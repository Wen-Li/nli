i entirely agree with this statement due to the following factor : first of all , i think that fuel will become more expensive and for many people it will be hard to afford going by car . another reason why i think that there will be fewer car in the future is because of the high pollution and the smog in the world , which is mostly produced by the car driver . nowadays there are also far too many car on the street . there is a lot of traffic ervey day and parking spot are quite limited in several area . sometimes it would be much faster to go by public transport than to go by car and try to find a parking spot . because of these mass of car on the street the pollution will just increase . all these factor mentioned above should encourage the people to stop driving and start going by public transport . but evidently they do n't ! fuel can get more expensive and more expensive , but the people are still driving more than ever . i still think that the number of car in use will be reduced . not by the people itself , but by restriction of the government . in my opinion it is the duty of the government to prevent the country from more pollution and smog . i am sure that in the next ten year there will be quite a few suggestion from the government trying to limit the number of car . it will not be a very easy task for them , because they will have to convince the people who are used to driving a car to go by public transport or maybe just to walk . i think for most of the people not being able to go by car anymore will be a loss of their freedom and flexibilty . it will be important to show them the alternative and also to build up a strong publich transport , where you are a flexible and free a in a car . i know that it wo n't be easy to reduce the number of car , but i think it is a task to be done in order to keep the world a clean place and i am sure that it will be done !
