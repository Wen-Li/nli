helping our communitis is very important . sometimes we can see some student giving time to helping their community , but it 's not very often . i agree with the idea that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their community . one reason that i think that young people do n't spend much time for their community is the school rul . in high school and college they have a kind of rul - like a homework - that a student have to help his or her community at list 10 hour per year . we could think that school ha this kind of rul to teach importance of helping community , but the truth is they have this rul because it 's hard to see young people giving time for their community . some people would say i saw many young people helping their community but they are doing it because they have to . second reason is commuties are in need of helper . they have a lot of thing to do so thay need many people . almost community do not have enough people to work so they hire some young people . as long a there is no young people who want to help the community , community leave work undond and this is happening a lot . why the young people do n't help their community ? it 's because young people think that spending time ofor theit community is such a wasting time . to change this mind of young people , we have to give them program or opportunity to make them realize the importance of helping community .
