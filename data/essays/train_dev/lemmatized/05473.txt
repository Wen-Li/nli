i agree with the statement most advertisement make product seem much better than they really are , in advertise ments they will show so much about the product , but when we buy them and use them they r not really a good a they showed in the advertisement , in my opinion they show like that to incrase the production and for the marketing purpose . i have come to that conclusion because i had three personal experienses , first i bought one dress from one shop by seeing an advertise ment , in wich they showby byed tat they are selling very good dress in term of quality a well a the prise and by seeing that advertise ment i went to that shop and bought one dress , after using it i have obseved the color of the dress is going , after washing i recognized i t and i could not return it . and the other time i bought shoe form one shop by seeing an advertise ment in the t.v they showed the shoe wearing one of my favotret star and i bought them , but the are very coastly comparing to the same shoe brought from the other shop in my third experience , one of the grocery shop ha advertised in such a way that every body should attract to their shop , but all the grocery are very coastly and some of them are expired , so they want to sell them a fastly a tey can . thease are the three personal experience i have come across and so i strongly beleave that the advertisement will show more about the product than they rally are . so i strongly belive the statement .
