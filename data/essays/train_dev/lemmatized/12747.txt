i agree with the idea that successful people try new thing and more likely to take risk rather than only doing what they already know how to do well . the attitude to try new thing and take risk can bring you broader range of possibility , lesson from failure , and strong drive toward success . when people do only what they already knew , their vision is restricted to very small area . they look at only on their experience and do not try to find if there is more effective way . trying to seek new thing can broaden your point of view and that might lead to a revolutional discovery or progress . of course there is always some risk when people try to do new thing . but people can not just stay there being afraid of taking risk if they really want a success . even though they fail , their experience is enriched by the failure if they learn a lesson from it . for people only do what they can do well , they might not fail but it is hard for them to improve . those people who rely only on their past experience can not enlarge their capacity . the successful people are tend to be driven by a strong motivation toward success . if people try to stick to what they already knew , it is impossible to get out of the range of their experience . when people look for new thing or try to get out of a plight that is caused by their own failure , their mind is always set to future . to be successful , you need to move ahead incessantly . thus i believe the attitude to try new thing and take risk is essential to be successful .
