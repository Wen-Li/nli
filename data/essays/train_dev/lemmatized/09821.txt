nowadays the speed of development is becoming faster and faster , so many think that no more car are used in the future that are substituted to other vehecles . i somewhat agree that the new device will be developed for transportation but doubt on fewer car in twenty year . first of all , 20 year is not so far from now . 20 year are not enough to invent a new vehecles and replace car . air plane that are already developed long time ago but can not replace car effectively . even thought they are faster that car , people do not own plane because they are expensive and huge to keep . in addition current suvery show that the number of manufacted car is increasing more than 15 percent each year due to developing country . it indicates that the number of car doe not seem to be decreased in the near future . on top of that , new way of car are researched and developed in order to overcome the drawback of car , in particular air pollution . various method of power are implemeted such a hydrogen , water , and electronic power that are not harm to environment . actually environment argue that use of car is restricted . therefore if non-polluted car is developed , people would not restrict the increase in car . therefore i disagrees that car are diminished in twenty year because the period is too short to change the role of car and replace to others . in addition the new method of preserventing air pollution will be developed so people do not need to worry about the use of car in the future .
