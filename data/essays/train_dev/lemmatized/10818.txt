i agree with this statement . in fact a lot of product are quite different from the example given in their own advertisement . i mean that people , who study the way to present an article or a product and finnally to prepare an advertisment , want to attract the attention of the costumer , instead of describes the quality of the product . using this kind of technique , the advertiser risk to have a product different in quality respect to the one , the customer have in mind . for example , i have buied a toothpasta that say to radically transorm my smile in a whiter smile , but after the four week that the advertisment suggest to use this product my smile wa not so different . in my opinion the advertiser want to demontsrate that his product is the best , or is better than others . in some case , to do this , he decide to say something not complitely true or not at all possible in order to attract the attention of the people . he lie a little , but he may pose his attention on the indefinite line , that divide people who believe in his advertisment and people who do n't . in particular people who believe in the advertisement do n't accept to discover that the product is very different from his idea . in conclusion in my opinion is not always a good idea to lie or to present product better then they are , because the custumer want what the advertisement say and do n't want a bad surprise .
