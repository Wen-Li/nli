it is likely that to specialize in one specific subject is beneficial for people who have decided to develop their carreers in a certain area , but i think that , in general , to have broad knowledge of many academic subject is more helpful in our life . first of all , to obtain a great number of academic encourages u to have many option or choice with regard to our intellectual activity a well a our career . if one ha knowledge of only one fierld , he or she can not revise the direction of life . for example , my old friend had a prominent knowledge about iron industry and he decided to get into a certain large iron company . fortunately he joined the largest company in japan , but the iron industry faced a serious recession later , which required him to take advantage of another skill or knowledge which he did not have . i think people ought to be a versitile a possible , and ramify their life according to condirions and phenominon . secondly , to develop a diverse sequence of knowledge help u find what we would have never found . when i worked for a life insurance conpany , i wa studying the neiboring industry such a the property / casuality insurance , mutual fund , and investment banking . then , the idea that it is possible to make a innovative product by mixing the feature of each industry had occured to me . and eventually , i became one of the member of our project in which we established a financial holding company under which there are now several financial institution . in addition , i am in charge of product development , especially high-brid product which consists of both life insurance and mutual fund . in conllusion , for the reason pointed out above , i definitely think that to have broad knowledge of many academic subject is better than to specialize in one specific subject .
