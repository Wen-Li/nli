nowdays we can see a great increasing in the use of car that are used in every action we do . the reason of this grouth in the use of the car is probabily the fact that a it is able to do human work in le time . as a consequence you can increase the productivity without spend nothing , the only investment is when you buy a machine . cars are so monopolised our life that is impossible thinking to live without them . for example we get on our car for going toa shop in a near place , for going to work , for taking our child to school . .. this example give me good reason for beliving that in twenty year we will not show few car around the world !!! this could be happened if we will start to see the damage that the uncleaver use of car have on the enviroment , on men 's health , and , generally , on the ecosystem . only in that time we will start to think that the comfort that the use of car give u is transuent if we compare it with the long term benefit that we could have living in a clean enviroment . according to me , this doe n't mean the abolition of car but it 's a hope that government , industry start to invest money for planing car that move themselves using alternative form of energy .
