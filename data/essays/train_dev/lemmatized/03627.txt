i strongly disagree with the statement that young people are not having time to help their community . we can see many concert coming up that are managed or coducted by young people for a great cause like below . they strive hard to help by rasing fund . for example , take our community we have all together three club for helping them ; home for the aged , home for the blind , and orphanage . these club are found by all young people with the help of local authority around our community . firstly , home for the aged wa found in may 21 , 2003 . in this we have 34 club member who not only help the activies of daily living for the aged , but also work partime to help them financially . they also help them by giving moral support which they are not getting for their child by listening to their agony . secondly , home for the blind wa found in december 1 , 2004 . this is a very talented club filled with teacher and musician . in this club , we have all together 25 member who help them in many way . they teach the blind how to read their note and help them in palying musical instrument . they not only help them educating but make them feel the nature by explaning through their eye . thirdly , home for orphan . this is also a very smart and talented club . it ha around 18 member . these people go on street and search for orphan who are child labor , sleep on pavement , railway , bus stand , etc . they help them to get admitted in some school by recommedations for the local authority . they not onlyh do this they educate by helping them in their homework . in our community , we are going to start a new foundation soon . they do not do this a a pas time or pleasure . they do with real concern . if they are not concerned about this , i do not think there is a need for them to do part time job , conducting concert , take help from the local leader to get charity , etc . this example show how young people are spending their time to help the society and spreading awarness to others .
