many people like to take the shortcut to complete their goal . it is true that it is easier to work on task with numerous strategy that are already discover . however , i strongly believe that the real successful people try new thing and take a much risk a they need . to begin with , although money is not always the best material to measure one 's success , most of the billionaire started something on their own for the first time . bill gates created microsoft program for people 's efficiency in using computer at affordable cost before anybody else thought of it . to pursue that business , he had to drop out of harvard university and concentrated only on his new business . it must have been a hard choice to do so , since harvard is an extremely competitive school to get into . now bill gates is one of the richest man in the world . my own father is another good example for the same situation . born to a poor family , he entered a hardest medical school in my hometown in south korea with his own effort . however , he changed his major to engineering , giving up his easy way to success by staying in the medical school . after studying in the engineering school , he pioneered biomedical engineering and became the first doctor of biomedical engineering in korea by founding the subject in his college . if he had not done this , he wa sure to be a medical person , but not the first biomedical engineer in nation . i myself already took one big risk in order to be successful - coming to america . i could continue my education in the insstitutions of high level in my native country , a a selected student in science in previous year . yet , i had a strong desire to try new thing with the cost of risking what might seem to be important in certain moment , and still do . of course there are many obstacle i need to overcome , but i believe it will be paid of if i try hard enough just like bill gates and my dad did in their youth .
