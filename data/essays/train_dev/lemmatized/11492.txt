in general , to be successful , many people take risk . but in my point of veiw , it is better to do what one really know to become successful for two main reason . low percentage of failing , and a better chance of developing the thing that one really know well about . first of all , if one take a risk on doing something , there is a high percentage of failing it . by contrast , if you know what you are doing and work on it by researching and getting new imformations about it , although you might fail , it is more likely to succeed than doing what you do n't know by taking risk . second , if you do something that you have no idea what it is about , there is a low chance of being successful . but a person who know the subject that he or she is dealing with could use the knowledge they have to develope the old one they already know about to a better one . for example , when i was11 , my science teacher at school told me to do an experiment about electricity . at that time , i had know idea what it wa about and had a lot of difficulty even choosing a topic for my experiment . i eventually did poorly on the experiment . but in the experiment i did next year wa successful because i knew about the subject that i had to do a project with . in conclusion , rather than taking risk , it is better to do thing that you know about to increase the percentage of being successful and have a better chance to develope a new thing and become successful in life .
