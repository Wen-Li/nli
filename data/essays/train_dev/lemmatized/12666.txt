without hardwork and risk , we cant succeed in our life . i totally agree with the statement . only by doing some new thing , we can invent something new in this world . . alonso wa f1 formula race winner last time . he tried new thing in the track , through that he won the tournament . he got lot of risk but finally he won the touranmentthat is important . every field need news thing to done . in the medicine field , every successful scientist need to do some new thing . only then they can invent some new drug . by doing already known thing that will help u to do the particular thing perfectly . but by trying new thing it give some suceess in our life . for example , once michael sczhumager wa succesful man in f1 formula race . but , last time he didnt performed well and he ha been replaced by alonso russian driver . main reason for his failure wa ferrari formula car , because he havent tried his drive with other engine like mclaren , tata etc . thats why he couldnt win last tournament . till there is no drug found to cure hiv virus . people who have completed their doctarate in this domain , they need to research on new thing regarding to this disease , only then it possible to find drug for this disease . only by trying new thing , victory , new invention can be made . thats why most of the successful person try with new thing rather than only doing what they already know .
