nowadays , life is much more fast-paced than in the past : with the long working hour and the many activity that one single person carry out , taking some time to help out in one 's community doe seem a rather difficult task . these factor , however , tend to be overlooked when analysing why people , in general , are much le devoted to their community : this debate usually single out young people a being the most selfish group . one that doe not get involved and where each individual fends for his own . in my opinion , this statement is too simplistic and i do not agree with it . first of all , although we can not deny that life is now much centered around individual goal than on community value , volunteering in third world country ha become a standard way for student to spend their gap year , helping out while at the same time gaining knowledge of another culture and possibly another language . in a natural catastrophe , such a an oil spill that ocurred a few year back , i wa a witness to how hundred of university student willingly took time to make the trip to the site and clean up for a few day , sleeping on the floor and with no retribution whatsoever . some of them even gave up their final exam just to be there . further on , in a world where consumistic value are the prime source of identity , many transnational social movement are making the difference , and these are mainly led by young adult who truly feel they should make a difference : we could argue that , therefore , the focus is not any more on the immediate community , the one we lived in , but a growing concern for the global community . if we are quick to judge the young 's apparent apathy , we can miss out on the many activity that are carried out all in the name of solidarity : we have to look closely and see that all the political , economic and social change have indeed affected the way people relate to their community , but not to it detriment , just to the adaptation of this realtionship in a more complex world .
