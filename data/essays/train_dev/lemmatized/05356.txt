nowadays , more and more student start to understand idea and concept rather than learn fact . actually it is a very good way for they to succeed in their studying field because of the following reason . first , idea and concept are the root of any study . if a student doe not understand the idea and concept , how can he/she find relation with the real life ? facts are revelant to the idea and concept , but after idea and concept are discovered , then we can apply the idea and concept to the fact . so idea and concept are more important than fact . in addition , idea and concept can apply to problem while studying . as mentioned , they are the origin of the study . therefore any problem related to the study should be based on the idea and concept or they can be expansion of the idea and concept . for instance , in geometry study , there are a lot of theory in a circle . the theory are the concept and idea . from these theory , teacher can develop more and more problem . if a student doe well in the circle test , he/she must have mastered the idea and concept of the circle very well . or he/she would not get good mark just by learning fact . futhermore , while doing a lecture about some course , the student are required to expand his/her topic from the idea and concept . they are not taught to give the lecture right from the fact . because starting from the fact will make the lecture hard to be accepted by others who are not familiar with the topic . the idea and concept are always the basis of any lecture . afterwards , the fact can be displayed fully to the listener . this is what a memorable lecture requires . in conclusion , idea and concept usually are the paramount factor of any study . therefore , it is more important for sutdents to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact . then they will be mastering knowledge better in the future .
