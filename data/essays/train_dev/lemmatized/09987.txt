of course , student have to learn fact from teacher and memolize them . however , it is only a first step to proceed their study . they should spend most of time to figure out idea and concept . by doing this , they can acquire appication skill . moreover , they can enjoy their study . to begin with , they can get highly developed appication skill if they try to understand matter . you will agree with this idea : person who know the nature of matter can perform well when he work on new problem , rather than person who only memolized surface of the matter . they can applicate their idea if they know the matter deeply . now , it is often said that japanese lack the appication skill . we are ranked in a lower position when the research is out . in contrast , country , like us , are ranked higly every time . we know the cause of this situation . the education of japan higly emphasizes memolizing . we must take hard entrance examination when we enroll in high school and university . so , although we often memolize the fact , we seldom have opportunity to think the matter deeply . so , student can raise their appication skill by understanding the concept itself . second , understanding the nature of problem is much more attractive for student . they can get pleasure when they find out the solution or they could understand the concept . therefore , they can continue studying with joyful . we want to do what we like rather than dislike . it also help raising their accademic skill . in contrast , in case of learing all thing , they will stop studying . for me personally , i did n't like studying at all until i entered university . i could not find joy in studying because i had to memolize many fact . however , almost all study in university assign u to think by ourselves . now , studying is not disconfort . because of the application skill and joyment , i believe student should concentrate on understanding . they can raise their ability and become interested in studying more .
