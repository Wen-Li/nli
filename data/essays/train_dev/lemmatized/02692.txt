i disagree with the statement that it is better to have broad knoledge of many acadamic subject than spesialized one . one of the most imoprtent thing is time factor , so spending much time on one subject we will me good and master at the subject . for example , in the higher level education university offering only in perticular subject rather than on prefer in more subject . broad knoledge will keep a person in the top in the position and every problem regading that will be solved by the person . speacialize acadamic subject will produce more bettre resulets , when the person is more intrest in that subject . for examle , in the school some people get good mark in the perticuler subject when compare to the other subject , at this time we will encourage him in his intresting subject rather than other . in later year he will be master at the subject and will take research in the field he will discover more intresting result in that area . let 's take an example from the hestory of math , great mathamatician pythagars , in his school day he always preffer to solve math problem to that of other subject like social , science . after few year he became a great mathametician , this is truly because of his broad knoledge in that perticuler subject . from , this examle we can say that the perticuler subject should his intresting subject . so , from the several reason and example we can conclude that it better to have broad knoledge in one subject .
