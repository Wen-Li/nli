knowladge is eveything i agree with this view . this view is it is better to have broad knowladge of many academic subject than to specialize in one specific subject . there are very unknow event in the world . it is believed that whatever scientist can find them . govermants are always support them . because if they find a solution for unknow event , human will be well day by day . for instance , one of the most unknow event is space . we still do n't know alien to be or not to be in our solar system . altough a lot of people such a scientist or resarchers try to find a solution for it , they can not a solution for it yet . also , the people who are scientist try to find a new energy source without petrol or electiric . they found h2 for car or bus . cars or bus work well without petrol owing to h2 . in my opinion , one of the most important invention is that . in this way , envoriment is protected by people because h2 is n't harmful for nature . all in all , thera are a lot of unknow event in the world . scientist have to find a solution for them . if scientist or resarchers find something like a treatment for cancer or fliying car , people will be more healthy and people live easily .
