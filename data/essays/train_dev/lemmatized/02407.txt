holleywood star tom cruz did n't stop with that he already know how to do well . currently , he is trying to do other thing . not only tom cruz is the one who success and also want to try new thing and take risk . a lot of famous people want take risk rather than only doing they already know they can do well . therefore , i agree with successful people try new thing and not do the thing that already know how to do well . for one thing , most of the famous people will be in news that he or she want to do some other thing and take risk rather than what they have talented in . for example , in japan they have a famous singer name hikaru utada . she ha very talented voice in singing and a lot of people like to hear when she is singing . one day she said she want to go university in new york . most of the news talked about that moment . she wa singing the song in united states and also she study hard in university of new york call columbia university . most of people know that hikaru utada is successful person in japan . for another thing , most of the successful people have a lot of interesting emotion . they think what if he or she do this or that . for example , one of the famous japanese comedian star name hamada try a lot of thing that he never try . he tried most of the sport such a sky diving , gold , tenis and every other sport that this world exist . most of the successful person doe everything that he or she is interest in . in conclution , successful people like to take risk and also they have amount of interesting emotion . i never saw the famous people who is doing only that he or she already know how to do well .
