in my point of view i agree with the following statement that , in twenty year ther will be a fewer car which will come in use than there are today . i agree with the statement that , in twenty year ther will be a fewer car which will come in use than there are today , because in this persent period there is a lot of computation between different company of car for example maruthi , tata , etc ; and there are many kind of car at persent like small car , medium car , and large car . these car are made of different metal , different engine , different mechanicsm , different horse power , etc ; a there are lot of compines comming from u.s.a , london , etc ; to india because they want to inprove their busniss . for example , before there wa only petrol engine car and then the technology a improved , and then the people found out about diseal , and then the diseal engine car were found . and finally there is a third stage which came into existance that is an electric car . by this rapid increase in the technology , we can see the increase in the model of the car with respect to technology . hence because of this reason , that is a rapid increase in the technology , and the rapid increase in different varity of car in this period , we can say that by twenty year ther will be a fewer car which will come in use than there are today . so looking at this point i would agree to the statement that , intwenty year ther will be a fewer car in use thatn there are today .
