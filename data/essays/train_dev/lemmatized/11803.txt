i agree with the topic beecause they dont care about it . they care about only themselves . it cause them not to help their community . i think they had better be interested in something around them . there are only one reason about this problem . this is that young people have to think about their future and they think they can do anything in their future but it 's impossible for them to do this . they can not do anything without their community but they ignore this fact no maybe they dont just wanna think about it . so i think they can not give them their community . if they can notice about it they will make our society increasing and improve their skilles . i hope so that . and many young people think their future are blighting and they have many wish but they can not succeed these .
