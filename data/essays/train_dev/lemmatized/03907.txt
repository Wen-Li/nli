presently , so many people hold opionion that successful people would do what they already know how to do well by their own experiense , life style and emotional evention . however some peole do n't . they hold opinopn that sucessful people would try news thing and take risk rather than only doing what they already know how to do well . and each opinion ha it advantage and disadvantage . from ma personal pespective , i would prefer the second opinion . first of all , doing what they already know how to do well is more safe do get suceed , however , it may also make you lose something that may even more important . since it is a world of changing , everything is changing in every minute , if you are only do what you already konw at your time , you may fall behind the time . so it disadvantage are even bigger than it advantage . the most vantial benefit of my opinion is that trying ne thing and taking risk may lead you get more experience in the changing worlding , you may never lose any information . and that is what the first opinion would never achive . what 's more the advanges of the my opinion is bigger than it diaadvantages . so many people would think there are too many risk during trying new thing and it may lead you lose more . however , the more risk you get , the bigger suseed you recieve and that is the different between successful people and nomal people . but sucessful people are not those taking risk blindly , they would think several time they should do it or not until it is possible for them to do it . after understanding , the reasoning above , it is quite safe now to say ,
