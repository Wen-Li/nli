i , being a science student completely disagree with the above statement . i have a couple of self experienced incident to say this . a person is generally inhibited with some level of knowledge which he can not cross over . thus taking one subject specialised would be more beneficiary to the candidate . i would like to quote a jug of water to support my theory . when a jug of water is placed upto it brim it will be useful for several others to quench thier thirst but when it is overflown then it get wasted and would be not useful for anyone . in the same way knowledge gaining would be useful for building up good career but it becomes unworthy when one is not mastered in any of the subject he planned . the proverb ` slow and steady wins the race ' can be reminded . therefore it is better to get specialize in one specific subject . let u consider the world 's greatest scientist sir isaac newton for this . if he too would have concentrated on many subject without making any thourough knowledge on anything then we would have lacked the world 's famous laws of gravitational forces . there may be exceptionalists who gain vast knowledge on various subject but the scientific reason behind this is they posse a greater amount of grey matter in brain and are considered a super human like einstein . here the fact is that one ha to recognise one 's own ability of study and interest and fully justify thier choice . this come only through wise thinking and seeking good advice from elder . i conclude the section that one has to be self worthy and choose less , gain more should be the motto . may be one 's study field is small but it must be unique and contrast . it 's not wise to say that only by getting specilized in many would make u creative but finally ` ur uniqueness ' would place one in a better status in the society . thank you !
