it 's very difficult to know how many car there will be in twenty year , because there are some reason that tell u that there will be more car , but also there are reason in the opposite way . i think it is more common and more easier to expect more car in the future , because if you look for the number of car twenty year ago you will be able to see that there were fewer car than today , if this tend continues , there will be a lot of car on our street . the problem is that tend can not continue forever because we have not resort enough to create and keep them alive . and also we have no space for that car . for example , i have a car but i 'm thinking of selling it because it 's impossible for me find a place where put it . another reason to expect an increase of the number of car in the next twenty year , is the decrease of the prize of a car . nowadays everybody or almost everybody is able to buy a car . but this is not completly truth because this part of the world is richer each day but the other part of the world is very poor and they do n't buy and produce any car . another reason is the tend of this world . i think that comunication is now the more important thing . you always have to travel because of your work or to visit people in other part of the world , and you need something to transport yourself . this fact multiplies car ' sail . but this reason also have the opposite effect , because now trip are so much longer than last year and you do n't do anything with a car , you need take airplane or train , but not car . in conclusion , on the one hand people need car and there will be a lot of car on the street , but on the other hand future will require other way of transport . future requires public transport , and we should promove it . so in my opinion , there will be fewer car in twenty year but there will be a lot of car yet .
