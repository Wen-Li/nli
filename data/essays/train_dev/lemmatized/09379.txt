since a long time at university and elsewhere a discussion is going on on how the education of people should be organized . there are basically two different way which have an important effect on the quality of people 's later way of working : you can build your education on a very wide basis and try to collect knowledge of a many academic subject a possible . or you can do it the other way round : you can specialize on one specific subject and try to get a good a possible in it . at first we 'll have a look at the method to try to gain a broad knowledge of a variety of academic subject . with this strategy you are able to see how thing are connected to each other , in which way they work together or influence each other . this later make it unlikely to you to produce product that work fine in one special way but do not fit the need of a large number of customer . when developing product you will have an eye on each group of customer , on the company aim , on the nature , and so on . however , a big problem of the previous mentioned strategy is the following : if you are good at practically everything you can not do very well at anything . so , in fact , you have to gain a specialized knowledge of the topic that is most interesting to you . in this way you should be able to achieve very good or even outstanding result . this can bring you , your company , or sometimes even humanity one step further . in my opinion the best solution lie in the middle of those extreme . specialization is good because you can not perform very well if you do not have in depth knowledge . on the other hand , if you just have knowlege on one specific topic , you can not see in what way your decision influence other area . so you should specialize on one subject and try to get basic knowledge on other topic , at least on topic related to your subject .
