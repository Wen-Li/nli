i agree with the statement that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their community . i belive that a lack of altruistic and selfless act are directly spurred from economic and social reason . in today 's world , many youth do not see a valid social reason to immerse themselves in community service . although the majority of the world 's population life in abject poverty , those who are capable of giving to their community are often segregated from those who are in need . hence , the lack of awareness prevents today 's youth from helping out . speaking from personal experience , i find that there is a gradual decline in my own community of youth that refuse to give or help out their community in any manner . as the president of key club , an international community service organization in my high school , i find it more and more difficult every year to recruit new member to replace the one that have departed . i remember when there were about 40 member in the group - now i find that it is even difficult to gather 20 member for the meeting . the only sense of giving that can be felt in my school 's atmosphere is purely caused from the need to `` look good '' on transcript for college . of course , i 'm sure not all of them feel this way , but i truly think it 's safe to say that the majority feel this way . every year , monetary donation rise in key club a the number of member decline . this is an economic reason why i belive that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their community . inevitably , most of u in the world have been brought up be capitalist - when we give , we expect something back in return . however , when youth help out with their community , they do not receive something tangible a reward . hence , today 's youth neglect to help their community . due to this fact , those who can help and give find it extremely annoying to invest their time in helping others . thus , their only token of help is through monetary mean , which they believe is compensation for not giving time to their community . nonetheless , society 's greed can even prevent the giving of money . it 's truly a shame to look around and see that today 's youth , or tomorrow 's leader , refuse to invest their time when they are perfectly capable of doing so . it is time that society creates more awareness in young people to be willing to invest their time for others . once youth overcome their laziness , fear of helping out , and learn that the greatest reward ( a cliched a it may sound ) is the fuzzy feeling they get from giving time and helping others , it will be the massive stepping stone in getting the world 's youth more involved .
