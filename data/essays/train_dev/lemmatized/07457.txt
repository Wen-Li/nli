i agree with this statement . some advertisement are thinking that to sell their product is the most important this is why they say any different thing about the product even on the t.v and newspaper . somethimes this thing make people angry so much . but this thing also couse bad for themselfs . last time my mom wa watching t.v. then , a advertisement were talking about some stuff for study . he said that if you use this stuff , you can be so smart and remember so many thing spanding just a week . he wa so serious on the t.v and these stuff looked like really good for u . then , my mom ordered the stuff for u . few day later , we got it and tried to use it but it wa not like on the t.v. actually it wa completely different . so my mom called the company . finally we could get buck money but we were looking forward to useing the stuff . they made u so mud . in the same case , some people may state this thing to court . if they so , the company is going to lose . i heard that the guy , he bought really expensive car on the t.v . because he did not have enough money to buy this car . on the t.v is usually selling more cheeper . but is wa fake . so he impeached to court and fought against the company . finally he won and got money from them . but even they know it , they continue to sell their product like that . most advertisement make product seem much better than they really are for selling their good . but it make consumer so mud and sometimes confused . they need to think more carefully about consumer a a some people . just selling good is so bud for people 's relationship . i think when people 's relationship is destroyed , the company is also destroyed by themselfs .
