have you noticed how crowded of young people shop are at anytime in the city ? young people nowadays loved to have more and more thing and spend much of their time on this without considering the need that our community have . in my opinion young people behavior seems to me selfish and not helpful with the community . first of all , capitalistic society we are living contribute young people to consume . for example , the ad on televison help to create expectative of having thing and consume more . furthermore , shop everywhere make citizien feel confortable because we know we can have what we need just going shoping . what i mean is that is not possible to think in enjoyable thing all the time , youth need to consider other aspect . regarding to this , we can be helpful at the same time we enjoy a we do shoping . we can reach this aim for example helping beggar recolecting money in group along the street . for instance we can have a chat with old people who are on their own sitting in a bench on the park , just to make them have a good time . in short , considering young people do n't help too much the community what i suggest is that we can help the community we are living and at the same time have a great time doing simple thing .
