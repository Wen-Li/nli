nowadays , the quantity of car is increasing very fast , but car need petroleum and this resource is decreasing fast too . for these reason , we should ask ourselves if it will be possible to continue using car in the future . in my opinion , in twenty year there will be more car than today , but the important difference will be that those car will be more ecologic or they will use another resource than petroleum . firstly , it is not sostinable to keep the actual consume of petroleum for many year , so there will be a moment when we will have to find another energy source for car . at the same time , new technology are improving theirselves everyday , so in few year it will be possible to find a good alternative for petroleum and to invent new machine much more ecologic . this mean that the fact that petroleum will finish doe not mean that car will finish . futhermore , everyday car are more necessary for people . that is because , in modern society , people need to move much more than before . for example , many time some family have their home far away from their job or the education center , so they need to drive a car to go to the workplace , to bring the kid to the school or to go shopping . finally , we have to know that many undeveloped country , where now there are not many car , are developing their economy and in the next year they will demand more car for their population . for these reason , i think that in future , the quantity of car will continue increasing , although , with the new technology , car will be ecologic .
