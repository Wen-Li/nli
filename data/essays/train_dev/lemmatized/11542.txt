when people think of making an advertisement for any kind of purpose , they always want to make consumer to get the right idea , or at least understand it . for this purpose to function , the advertisement ha to be perfect . so , it may be true that adevertisements make product look better than they really are , although that doe n't mean the product is bad . the purpose for advertisement is to sell , or to change way of thinking in people mind . an easy example , is fast food restaurant . they will never give a product a good a it appears in menu , but you will still buy it . this mean that since the moment you leave that restaurant , you will always now that the meal you had will not look like he one in the menu . still the restaurant will keep on adevertising their new meal or new promotion in the street or in their menu 's to create a confussion on the costumer mind , but make them think that the meal look exactly a it is in the adevertisement . if advertisement were not a perfect a they are today , they would not sell . the point is to make people decide for something that they may no be convinced for . so , if the advertisement show the perfect way for people to get convinced for something , why not make them better than they really are . this may create problem also , because you can loose client everytime you give them something that is not what they expected , but a i said at the beginning the advetisement can be better than the real product , but it doe n't mean that the prodcut is bad . maybe the client can no be a satisfied at the beginning but if the company try it best apart of the advertisement to make the costumer think the product is good , this one will forget how the advertisement looked like . in conlusion , the advertisement is a part of a strategy to sell product , but it is the first one to be seen by future custumers . this mean that it good to make them better than they really are , but there ha to be a good job to satisfy the client in the moment of purchase and the moment of atending the cliente so the product will never be a bad product , although it seems better in the advertisement .
