while life can be enjoyed by people in all phase of life , i personally believe that young people enjoy life more . main factor in favor of young people is their high energy level . young people are full of life and like to experiment different option . such experimentation build their life experience . exercising different option provides multiple opportunity to enjoy life . younger people have higher physical strength to endure outdoor activity . for example , while a senior citizen may require a detailed planning and preparation before they could take an adventure camping , young people could combine their youth with sense of adventure to take up such a trip with little or no planning . young people also have time on their side to take risk . unlike , older people who are risk averse , young people can take higher risk . young people realize that in case of any negative consequence , they will have time to repair the damage . this risk friendliness allows young people to stretch their limit and enjoy life to the fullest . while it is true that young people do not have enough time in their schedule a compared to older people . however to enjoy life , time is not the sole requirement . young people have multiple outlet to enjoy life - at work , home or socializing . hence a person need not wait till retirement to enjoy life . most of life 's enjoyment will require commitment of financial resource also . it is likely that smart older people would have achieved financial success to enjoy life , however it is more probable that young people will have more expendable income to enjoy life . in conclusion , while life can and should be enjoyed in every phase of life , young one should capitalize on this opportunity . young people have all supporting factor in their favor to enjoy life to the fullest .
