as the saying go `` every coin ha two side '' , some people think that we should broad our knowledge of a variety of academic subject , but other people believe that we should specialize just in one specific subject what we master in . in my opion , i agree with that we should master in few subject what we want to learn instead of study a lot of subject . there are several reason why i agree with the idea . first , althought some people talked about that we should study a lot of subject that could enhance our fundation knowledge , i think that if we do n't have any mastered subject , we ca n't distinct from others . and everyone should showes our difference from others . for example , if everyone just know a little in every subject what we study , we colud not ask others deeper question . in the long run , it could not advence in our society and our world . second , althought you do n't have a variety information of every subject , we can reach the top in the subject what we master in . and if we have deeper information , we could get better job what we need . for example , although i 'm not good in english , i master in math and it could be the best way for me to teach math . another example , my friend , john , althought he know everything a little in our life , actually , he still get no job now . to sum up , this is more important to master in a subject than know a little in every subject . there are a lot of adventage to master a subject what we want to choose . and this is why we have to select major subject in university .
