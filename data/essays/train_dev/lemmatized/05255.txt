due to better possibility of communicating and optimized wazs of transport , in the last century a process took place that incorporated the world : the globalization . one result of the globilazation is the increasing advertisement for product all over the world . on the one hand advertisement help u to inform about product . but on the other hand you have to ask yourself if this process of advertising is really neutral ? and in my opinion the answer is no . when you watch tv , you can see beautiful car driving through the landscape and beautiful woman sitting in it and enjoying it . but the question is if you also will enjoy to ride this car ? when you go to cinema you see several advertisement for film that are promised to be exciting . but again there | s the question : is it really that exciting when you see the whole film by yourself ? there are case that confirm that the promise become true . but in my opinion , in the most case you will be disappointed of the product you decided to pay for . the globalization certainly ha positive effect on the world if you just think of the possibility to convey product or information . but in my opinion it cause that quality isn | t anymore guaranteed in every case . let | s take the example of the advertisement for the car . in tv you saw the car with all the beautiful impression and it | s great equipment . but you | re not able to judge the quality of the car by only seeing it . so you may be dissappointed when you actually buy the car . this is a typical example of the thesis that advertisement make product seem much better than they are . in earlier time , you offered someone a service or a product and what you got back wa also a service or prducts . this wa the process of exchanging thing directly . and you there you were able to judge quality . but the globalization caused competetion . and competition cause lie , so that the product seem better than they actually are . because of the increasing competition between big company , the promise become better and better , the quality of product instead becomes worse because of mass production . so you can definitely say , that , not in all case , but most of the time advertisement make product seem much better than they really are . and in this case the question i asked at the beginning of this text is answered : globalization doe not have only positive effect .
