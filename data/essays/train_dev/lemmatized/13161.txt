some people may not agree with the statement that successful people try new thing and take risk rather than only doing what they already know how to do well . but , personally , i think it is really important to try new thing and take risk . therefore , i agree with the statement that successful people try new thing and take risk rather than only doing what they already know how to do well . of course , there are some advantage to doing only what people already know how to do well . for example , if all we have to do in the whole business life is just one thing , it is effective to focus on that one thing and to learn how to do well , without trying new thing and taking risk . however , in order to succeed , i find more advantage to try new thing and take risk rather than only doing what they already know how to do well . like what , i can expand my experience and diversify my skill . moreover , if i only do what i already know how to do well , my experties will be too focused and limited . first of all , i hope to expand my experience and diversify my skill through tring new thing and taking risk . i am a businessman working at an investment bank and am required various skill from my customer in the diffrent sector . thus , i need many kind of experience , skill a well a knowledge to meet the various requrements . i believe that i can enhance my value a an investment banker by obtaining the wide range of experience and skill . second of all , if i only do what i already know how to do well , my experties will be too focused and limited . the circumstance in the world change rapidly nowadays . if my skill , that is the only experty for me , become out of date , i will lose the competence in the society and will have a poor life . this situation doe not mean my success . in addition to that , i am a person who like change , therefore , doing only what i already do might be borering to me . the boring life is not a success for me . my primary consideration with regard to my life is to success by expanding my experience and diversifing my skill . thus , i agree with the statement that successful people try new thing and take risk rather than only doing what they already know how to do well .
