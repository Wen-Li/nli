this is true that most product look better in advertisement than they really are . in this age of agressive marketing and bullish economy , it take a monumental effort to successfully launch a product , and then capture a niche for the product in the face of competition from other similar product . the problem which most of the manufacturer of different product face is that the market for their product is overcrowded with similar product . so , in order to make a consumer base for their product , the manufacturing company try to make agressive advertising strategy to make their product look unique and different from other similar product . they try to rope in celebrity like film star or sport personality to work a brand ambassador and spend a huge amount on making advertisement film . also computer graphic , animation and stunt director are used to make advertisement film depending on the product and it target consumer clientele . few example which we can see are the cola giant , coke and pepsi . although the product is nearly the same , they spend a lot of money in making advertisement to look superior and different from each other . similarly we can observe advertisement of car which are literally flying in the air . all this is a part of a unique marketing strategy , to catch the consumer 's attention and creating a separate niche for the brand . we should also acknowledge the fact that if the company do not make the product look better in advertisement , nobody will buy the product . they will not be able to compete with other similar brand and the product will fizzle out or die . so this situation of aggressive marketing and making super ad is a much important a that of the making of the product itself . any good product can not survive without look extra - good advertisement .
