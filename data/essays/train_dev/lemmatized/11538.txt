so , how would you feel an elderly person watching a soccer match and shouting at peak of his voice . he ha his goggles on , a bear can in hand , and say , england flag painted on him . wo n't you feel a bit annoyed by the scene . yes , it true that every diffrernt age group ha a particular way of enjoying and even enjoying their joy . but , it 's quite a bit clear that young people enjoy thier lif to fullest than the aged . just looking at the energy of the youngster , the way they enjoy and with no pressure of being ashamed , if seen by any one . the main pointof diffrentiation in youngster and an eldrly person is the energy . with body getting older , it tend to loose it energy and even the muscle weakens . when young all the body cellls are young and can store and diliver the maximum energy requied . so with this we can go on traking , dance , jump , play , and many more thing . but due to lack of energy elderly people can not enjoy much , especially the thing requiring more energy . another good reason supporting my point is , number of option available . you just can not expect an old man to go for cycling round the beach for 10km daily . with sour joint , he ha to bring lot many limitation to the kind of work he can do . in contrast , young men and woman have many opitions open in the way they can enjoy . a person fond of biking can go on long ride every week end , or an athlete can have a mounatin traking program set . along with this physically exhaustive joy , a girl willing o dance can take dance lesson and perform whenever she feel down . last in the list , and one of important factor of social life is fear of being caught . with increasing involvement in social life , each ha o take care of his image in public . so the way to enjoy the life get limited down for a man ho ha lived much of his life than a yougster . if a company bos is seen freaking around on beach is definitely pointed ou , but , if it 's his son is surely admired . thus to conclude with , i can only say that though youngster have more way to enjoy life than elder people , one can surely define his enjoyment . defining it we can be happy with what we have , with no greed for what we do n't .
