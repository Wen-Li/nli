on my own opinion , i do agree that successful people try new thing and take risk rather than only doing what thay already know how to do well . first , i think they can success is because they have already take their risk , it is all risk out side the world , each thing ha a risk but seems to big or small . for example , if you walk on the street you have to take a risk that there will be a accident on you . taking risk is a must . the mean of success is they know how to do thing well , human being ha a think to learn more to find out new thing . of course , by the way people is learning they will have many problem to solve . successful people know that if they do n't find a new way or new thing to do , other people can catch up them . they want to lead , so they have to seek , to seek what that the world need so they can do it . although many people think successful people are selfish , just do thing they like or they want , wo n't share with others , but i think it is only other people do n't understand what they are thinking . they have a different thought than others so they success , they wo n't just stop where they success . they want more success , everyone want more success but not everyone can do it , so they know they can do it they wo n't care about the risk , even the risk is big but if they can pas it they success . they fail , they keep on going to find another thing . for conclusion , i agree that successful people tyr new thing and take risk rather than only doing what they already know how to do well .
