i agree , because people start to think car cost money and polute enviroment and their own health problem now . cause of bad enviroment , a lot of people have disease , like cancerand especially lung disease . it came from not enough exirsise and air polution . thesedays , more and more people take care about their health problem and they know that car make thier health worse . also people start to care protecting nature : ozon hall , air polution came from car emission . car cost too much money , people keep gasoline in car , and prise of gasoline getting higher . they have to renew car insurense every few year . they have to keep thire own parking . having a car mean costing money evry day . they want to save money , and it is easy to use train or bus or bycicle instead of car . using a another transportation is much easier than car . especially train is more quick and cheapest . about 30 year ago , it wa a statas having own car . however , now being natural is one of trend . i t si thougt cool ! also having a car that make people non-active person . ameria is the best example , most of american go to office or school by car . it make american pepole fatter and fatter . i know the best way to solve all of these problem . we have to walk our own leg . do not rely on car so much .
