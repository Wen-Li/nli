i do n't agree with the idea that there will be fewer car in twenty year . first reason is that car are currently most convenient transportation with high technology . it is convenient because we do not have to wait to drive a car without worrying about the weather and can easily get to the point where we would like to go unlike commercial train or bus . the technology is still developing which make car run more fast and safe , provides user the confortable room inside the car . once people gain the convenience , we will not be able to go back to inconvenient world . second reason is that there will be more car that are good for environment . many car company have been develoveped their technology and skill , and contributed to the environment . the price is yet high , but they were able to produce electonical car . therefore , the car will meet people 's desire that technology will eventually go with it .
