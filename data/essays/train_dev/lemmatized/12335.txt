i agree with the statement a fact do n't drive the concept or the idea . i feel that concept and idea have more importance than fact . without knowing how to implement a concept and how to try an idea knowing fact in not quite needed . a person with idea and concept can apply them when he ha a problem he cant do that by knowing the fact . the example are discussed in detail below . a student when given a problem in math can solve the problem only if he understand 's idea of how to start and the concept that he ha to use to solve the problem and get the required answer . just by knowing the fact on the problem he can not solve the problem with ease it take great difficulity to solve the problem without knowing the concept and having an idea of the problem , concept . for a student to understand a subject he need to have an idea about the subject and he need to understand the concept of the subject first , then he can easily understand the fact . so primary thing is to understand idea and concept rather than just fact . it is the same in case of science subject like physic and chemistry . for doing practical knowledge a student or the resercher should understand the idea of the experiment and the concept to deal with the experiment . understanding idea and concept have a very great importance in life . there is a need tro understand idea and concept particularly in the educuation life . the concept and idea are more important for student and reserchers to develop new thing and to excel in their feilds . so i feel that fact have very le importance even by knowing the fact about the subject it would be hard to analyze it just by fact . the above reason make me agree with the statement .
