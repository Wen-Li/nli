i agree with that successful people always try new thing to do and take risk rather than only doing what they already know to do well . as we can see them , most of the them are very advantureous people this fact make they are very special , and successful people . successful people like adventure . one of the famous inventor eddison like advernture . he always tried to get new thing that other people do n't know yet . before he invented the light ( electricity ) , he ha thousand time of lab for invent the light , evne his lab room wa burned down , he never forgive up and enjoy the advent they ha a unique think that is we ca n't even imagine that . eddison wa kind of unique child when he wa young . he thought the egg are hetching if he make them warm so he hugged the egg for a while . this story is very famous story about his childhood . a we can see , he wa not a normal child and doe n't have a normal thinking like other child . that kind of unique thinking make a person going to be different than others .
