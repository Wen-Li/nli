i strongly disagree with advertisement activity making product seems much better than they really do . this is a case of manepulating customer decision . some time this concept might go further to demonstrate a staus of cheating when mentioning false information about product or giving unreliable guarantee . companys and good seller should talk and descibe the actual advantage , feature and service they have . presenting these item to the customer in an attaractive way shall not be considered a a manner of cheating or telling lie . ways of presenting good and advertising to them in a proper and honest way is mentioning the component and item utelized to amnufacture these good . companys utelizing material with quality might point out the how good are the material used in manufacturing . another way of fair advertising actitvities , is highlighting the effort were required to get some good produced and pointing out the professional and continuous planning to tachieve this perfection . marketing trend in some culture by attracting consumer with utelizing cultural concept ( e.g. cultural and traditional saying a a logo ) . another example of fair advertising is studying the trend and behaviour of consumer ( e.g. packing childrens ' toy in a bright colored box ) , and we shall not consider this a manner of manepulation whereas no false information were mentioned about this product . by observing international market , manufatures and good seller all over the world are now trying to giving glorious and attractive name to their product which is n't a sort of decision maker manepulating . focusing also on the customer need and making pruchoures pointing out the positive side and promise of fulfilling their requirement can be considered a way fair promoting to some good . i do beleive that all advertising activeties should be carefully studied to give bright image about any product to the customer without mentoining false information or making them look much better than they really are .
