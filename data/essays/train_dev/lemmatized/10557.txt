in my opinion the assertion that young people should give more time to helping their community is right but i also want to point the reason out why there are fewer teenager or even young adult making le contribution to their community nowadays . the claim that young people should take care for their community is certainly right but there are so many reason these day that make it much more difficult . people have their own problem nowadays . especially young people always face the threatining of unemployment . the labour market today is very difficult so when student finish school they are frightened of getting unemployed what make it difficult for them to additionally care for the interest of other people . furthermore nowadays the connection to your community is not a big a it wa fifty year ago . my grandmother went to the chirch every sunday and she knew nearly everybody in her community . everything wa more personal . today many people do not even know their neighbour so there is a lack of interest in helping other people and many people just care about their own . some people may also think that charity doe not get appreciated in an appropriate way . i must totally agree with that opinion because i just helped in the church doing some work in the garden and there wa not even anybody who told me thank you for it . this are all reason to exemplify why i would disagree with a claim of more help from young people in their community . even though i think that especially elder people and the government should make an effort to help getting young people envolved in their community again . if child , teenager and young adult would identify with their community , get a feedback of their contribution and see that they can change thing and in this way can make a contribution to the community i think they would certainly think different about charity work or even just helping an older woman crossing the street or carrying her heavy bag .
