the issue at hand is that the young people do to not give much time to helping their community . yes i agree with this statement . this issue is very important a it show the unawareness of young people towards their community . i do n't know what 's wrong with today 's generation . now a day nobody is concerned about the welfare of their community . every individual is so busy in his/her own life that they are not even bothered about this . the first reason is that the youth today is so much interested in just filling their own coffer and for them wealth is everything that they do n't have a single second to waste on such a stupid issue a thought by them . the second reason is that they are forgetting the value of a community . today people have become so selfish and so inhumane that they show no responsibility towards their community . they are just flowing with the tide of 21st century and do n't want to realise their duty . furthermore , it the modern time which ha completely trapped the youth in it web and is not letting them to make a noble move towards this issue . well it hightime and the youth will have to come back from hibernation , otherwise their ignorance regarding this issue will simply destroy the value and ethic from the society . lastly , i feel that the elder should take part to help young people to be an active player in helping their community . the elder could be the right teacher under whose able guidance the life of youth can flourish .
