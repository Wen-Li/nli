i think young people have the right to do whatever they want a soon a they are not hurting anyone or causing any problem . but they have to give somithing to the community they are living in . nowadays there are so many thing keep young people busy such a game and computer . but that is not a good reason for them to avoid their assignment to their community . most of young people nowadays are careless . they dont want to work or help in order to improve their community . on the other hand there are some great example of young people who give help to their community . i think it is not fair to judje young because of few example . everyone ha to controll his want and try to help his community a much a he can .
