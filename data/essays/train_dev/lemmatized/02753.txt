the scince world ha no limit . every day we explore some new thing in this world . the human mind and the ability to imagin and to creat have no limit . so that i agree that it is more important for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact , because of several reason like , they may add some new idea to it , they may explore that the ftacts that we have are wrong , they can leran more about the subject if look by theirself . first , when the student understnad the idea he may add some new idea to it . adding new information can come only if the student start to think in the problem the without knowing that there were some people before him thought about it . if the student did not know about the fact , he maybe invent some new idea that can be write . second , the student can show that the fact that we have now are wrong . many time in the past some beginner people show that the fact that they had were wrong . the fact that we have now were made by a humanes and every humane can do some mistake . the people who made this fact were in some part of their life student like u now , so there is no differents betwen u and the people who made taht fact . third , if the student start to leran about the subject by his own , he will learn much better more than just leran the fact . ignoring the fact can be very helpful for the student because he will start to think using his mind not the fact . using the fact is killing the ability to creat a new fact , because the student is going to use the fact without think if they were right or not . finally , according to i wrote above , i belive that understanding the idea is more important for the student than it is for them fo learn fact . it is really helpful for the student because i tried it once and it really wroks .
