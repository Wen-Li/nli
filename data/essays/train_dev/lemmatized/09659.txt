i agree with the statement that it is more important for student to uderstand idea and concept than it is for them to lern fact . in this essay , i would like to explain why i have this idea , with using example of how i used to study in japan and how i am studying in the netherkands . in japan , i 've never had experiment in science class . what student do in the class is remembering the formula that are given by teacher and prepare for test . with this way of learning , student can remember a lot of formula in short time . however , once they finish the test , they will forget what they remembered also within a short time . it is because , they do n't need the formula any more . whereas in the netherlands , we have severaal time of experiment in a week . students learn the process how the formula work so that they can understand idea and concept of it . with this way of lerning , it take quite long time to remember the formula , because student need time to do the experient to reach the formula . but , student do n't forget the formula so easily . this is because , student can remomber the formula a an ` experience ' . i think i can remember formula that i lern in dutch school after forty year , because it is my experience in the school . also , it is so stressful to learn only by remembering formula , and taking test . students will get bored with listening to a teacher and solving question in a textbook . they ca n't concentrate during the class and the efficiency of stadying is low . on the other hand , it is fun to have experiment in the class . students can learn while they have fun . humans are tend to remember happy experience and forget unhappy experience . the efficiency of studying is hihg . to coclude , it is much more important to understand idea and concept than learning fact due to it efficiency . students , who understand idea and concept , will remember the studying forever .
