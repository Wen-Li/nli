in the last 20 year the number of car in use ha increased a lot , thanks mainly to economic development and technology improvement . the car industry ha , a consequence , improved a lot in term of security and modern car need le fuel than in the past . given the bigger uncertainty and instability that are today present in the world , both from the political side and the economic one , is not obvious what will be the future development . there are many reason to believe that the number of car will decrease , especially in western europe and usa . for example , i think that the traffic and the pollution level that have been reached in many modern city will not sustainable in the longer term since they effect negatively the overall quality of life in most richer country . in addition , the current trend of the cost of petrol make the use of private car everyday more expensive . in this context , a well organised public transportation service would solve these issue by reducing the usage of private car . on the other hand , it is likely that economy of country such a india , china and russia , will continue to grow at a sustained growth rate . this mean that , expecially in india and china , where the population grows impressively fast , the number of car will increase a well . the future of the car industry is another reason for which the number of car may not decrease in the next year . in fact , both in europe and in the usa the car indutry is a very big and important contributor to the country wealth , because it employ a large number of people . it is fair to believe that governement will help these industry to maintain their importance to avoid any social crisis . in conclusion , i think it is very difficult to predict what the future will be . too many uncertainty are present in our world today . i also think that a reduction of the number of car , even if unlikely to happen soon , will strongly improve our quality of life .
