'' we heard many time from our teacher . when we were a chidren . we could see many book . it is fact . we read the book . we can do everything in your think . we will become robot , door , hero , and so on in your thinking . then we have good dream . i heard like this sentence '' if you do n't have a deram , you 're very poor people . our life is different . if your parent are rich or not , your ife is change . if you leave more big country , you can experience various culture . however , we have different all thing the reaons are very various . our enviorments are different , but we reduce the gab . book is very important . we have to read the bookl . you can think many time toyue
