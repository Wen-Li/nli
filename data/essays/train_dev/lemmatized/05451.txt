what is really being young nowdays ? we often talk of the problem created by young people beaking the law and respecting nothing and no one in the suburb . but it is not the majority of young people . we talk le about quiet young people just trying to do their best in life and who do help their community . this lead to the last point , even for the one willing to help , it is not always easy to do so . they lack opportunity and time . when we heard about young people nowdays , what do we hear ? we hear about the law that were broken , the policeman that were attacked , the car that were burnt . of course it is a part of the problem but a it is often the case , the worse aspect is very well known and many people tend to forget that it concern only a minority . so we should focus on the majority of young people , the one we rarely hear of . in university or graduate school , there are club or group . these are about music , theater , art , sport , game but many concern the help that can be given by student . for example , in the school i went to , there wa at least a dozen of such club . some student gave lesson to child , some got toy for poor child , some spent time to give food to poor people and some even went to india to build a school . these club were among the most popular one a many student thought it wa normal to give an afternoon per week helping those who needed it . the last point i would like to develop is that , even it is always possible to say that the young one do not help their community enough , it is not always a question of lack of good will . when you are young , you are explained that you have many responsabilities , a huge number of thing to do in order to prepare your future life . all these problem , that might seem easy to solve afterwards , are difficult to face when you are young and without experience . they often leave little time available or no strengh to face something else . the conclusion could be that young people 's reputation suffers from what is being said about a minority of them and that the other most certainly do what they can , even if it might not always be enough .
