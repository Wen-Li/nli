i do disagree with the idea according to which young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their own community . i would rather think that nowadays young people do a lot of effort to try to help and solve social problem in order to improve and join their own community . though young people are usually considered a lazy and selfish and without any particular interest towards social or cultural problem , i do not think that they actually are . let is consider , for instance , the case of young volounteers . they are widespread a you can find them everywhere , in every country . it doe not matter which specific field they are interested in , it is just important that they are engaged in something they believe in . any little help given by young people help the society to improve itself . in addition , any single minute they spend for the community is meanfull . in my particular experience i wa used to be a social volounteers for nearly ten year , first in a community of down child , and then a a phone listener in an association called ( telefono amico ) : it is clearly a lot of time . thus , in my opinion and in my experience , i think that it is not that true that young people do not give enough time to helping their own community . they actually can do , and they do , that .
