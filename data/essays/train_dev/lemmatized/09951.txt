as far a iam living in this planet , i can realize that industry and science are growing rapidly in two way . one is for the benefit of the human being and one on the other hand is towards destroying him . well , talking about the one that is harming u . the increase in number of car nowadays is actually making our life more so complicated and difficult . for example , in dubai , it need a person to reach his office in the rush hour around two hour ! so the government thought seriously about that issue and now is constructing a sub way that can let you reach any place in the city within few minute ! at that time i think so many car will be sold because they are of no use . and i think one of the most crowded city in car is london . and by the 2020 's people might get rid of their car and go and buy bicycle . science after 20 year from now will be rapidly and increasingly progressed . and scientist might develope some kind of car that can fly with their own track that they can build over eachother so a to make use of space !! their might also be somekinds of motorcycle that are so sophisticated and secured that can alternate the use of car . well , by that time i hope that all country will have developed way so we can travel by the speed of light . so no gas , no pollution , more space and friendly planet .
