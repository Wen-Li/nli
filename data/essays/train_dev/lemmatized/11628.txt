for lot of people , traveling is one of the most enjoyable experience . throughout the world , million of tourist travel every year . some of those tourist travel independantly while others are led by tour guide . in my opinion , the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guid because by this way i will be sure that i will visit the most interisting place at the country to which i traveled . i remember , for instance , my first trip to egypt and how the tour guide insured me and the other group member seenig the most fascinating archaeological sight there . moreover , i believe that being led by a tour guid is more secure than exploring a foriegn country lonely . however , being led by a tour guide would not be a happy experience for a tourist who want to wonder around the real city and discover the the other lively side of a country . furthermore , there are other method that can provide the same capablity of a tourist guid . for example , the book that include useful information about the place that can be enjoyable for tourist to visit , map and illustrated book . another important raeson make me prefer traveling with a group that being with a group of someone 's country or cluture would make them feel more secure and safe rather than knowing no one . in conclusion , i would prefer to guided by a local person who know more than me about his/her country .
