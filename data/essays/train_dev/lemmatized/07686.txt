the given topic that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communites is a controversial one . on one hand young people help their community . on the other hand young people do not give enough time to help their community . however finally i would like to go with young people do not give enough time to helping their community . in the present era most of the young people have become self centered and they are not in a mood to know about the problem of the world . they are always seeking their own comfort . for example consider that if robber ha entered into the neighbour house of a man and he come to know that , first he is taking care of the valuable in his house rather than helping his neighbour . nowadays the young people are lacking in the moral and ethic value . they have become worse than the birds.i.e.if a crow is died or wounded then large number of crow gather at that place and shout , but when it come to people if a person met with an accident on a road most of them are passing a if they dont see that incident . they are not even calling the ambulance . instead of this they may comment that it is his recklessness . according to me this system ha to change , each human should help others . one person ha to help atleast three person in his life and instead of seeking thanks from them that person ha to ask those three individually to help three others . now nine people ha benifited and these nine ha to help to three others each individually . like this if the chain ha followed the the society will change and all the human being can live hapilly . the conclusion is that man is a social animal . he will depend on others some time . if he help others only the others will help hin in his necessity . so the young people ha to spend time to help others and his community because he is going to rule the world some day .
