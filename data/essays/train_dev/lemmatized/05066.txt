the claim of the question is that in twenty year there will be fewer car in use than there are today . i strongly agree with the claim since the following reason . to begin with , the government ha begun to develop some rule and law to encourage people to use mass transportation . the government ha some advertisement on tv to promote usage of mass transportation . through the activity , people would change their mind . besides , the government ha raised taxed for people who own car and increased the burden of these car owner . for example , in taiwan there ha some law to raise tax of car owner . second , it is harder to find parking space for car owner , especially when people live in a big city . besides , it is expensive to rent a parking space in a big city . let me take taipei a an example , the car owner should pay at least 6,000 ntd to rent a parking space a month . some people may argue that they can affort to pay the money . however , some people jsut can not find a good parking space even they want to pay the money . since the all parking space in taipei are not enough for all car . hence many car owner begin to consider the mass transportation , such a bus , taxi , and subway , third , people have concensus that too much car would pollute our environment . now some family may own more than one car , but actually they just need one car . under the strongly environmental pressure , people start to know the importance of environmental protection . too much car will pollute the earth and endanger the existence of human being . therefore , it can be predicted that more country would cooperate to decrease the pollution through some contract or rule that limit the car owned by each country . in summary , considering the aforementioned reason , i strongly agree with the claim that there will be fewer car in use than there are today , since the environmental issue and the effort from the government to limit the quantity of car .
