many people beleave that young people enjoy life more than older people do , a well a diferent culture can agree or desagree on this asumption by their contribution to their culture 's development . in some group , culture or family , young people are defined to be the motor of the group grouth , becouse they are suposed to studdy when they are young in orther to reach a high intelectual capability to create grouth and diminish poverty , in this particular group , young people have more free time to studdy , travel and play sport in order to experience and learn what they need to . so , for this group , young people certainly enjoy life more than older people do . on the other hand there are culture or group which beleave that young people have to work day and night because the older they get , the most knowledge they acumulate in order to become leader of the culture . because of this , older people are rewarded by being able to make desitions about the group 's future and enjoy life . from my perspective , today , we have the freedom to deside weather i enjoy more life when i 'm young or older , person do n't belong to a comunity that tels them what to do , they deside if they want to be part of the comunity who travel , party , play sport and doe n't do much during their first year of life , in order to work during their mid age until they are older . or to be part of a comunity who study very hard and focus on their profetional goal in order to have a retirement plan that will give them the oportunity , solvency and calm to enjoy life . in conclution i desagree with the statement that young people enjoy life more than older people do , every person should deside when to enjoy life , that shoud be every person 's goal in life , to have the posibility to chouse what fit their personal nesecities .
