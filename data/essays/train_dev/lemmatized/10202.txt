i agree that succesful people try new thing and take risk rather that only doing what they already know how to do well . when you try new thing your brain is working harder . if you take new chance that mean your are an enthusiastic an positive person . i 'm trying to study a master in law in a new york city university , so i 'm risking not only to deal with another language but also studying a new legal system . let 's assume i can work in another job that is not legal such a be a court interpreter and make good money . i can work a a legal interpreter but i 'm a lawyer in my country , so why not risk and become what i love the most which is to practice law . at the beginning i wa afraid because it is a new language for me , a new legal system really different from my country which is common law . but i 'm a capable person , enthusiatic and energetic . i 'm trying to learn new thing that i will . succes for me mean to try new thing doe n't matter how much they will take you to achieve . generally people just prefered to do what already know because is easier and sometimes put them is a better position not try harder . it 's difficult to try new thing but if you can accomplish your goal in your life generally you will be a succesful person . always make your best a a person that is learning every day .
