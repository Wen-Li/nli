young people nowadays are pointed for neglecting their community since the activity in which the younger generation are in demand much more of thier attention to thier own need thereby not giving the required amount of time their community . now in general broadly focusing on the issue of the younger generation the major outline we can draw is their survival in this world ha become the most difficult challenge for themselves like the pace of the life , to be infront on many ocassion whether it a professional or a personal , the competition which he is forced to be a part of it . when we say nowadays we mean , earlier people gave their time to help community because life at that stage wa not having that much pace . but the moral of those younger generation were far better when it come to help otherswith present generation , why not these generation people give their time because the today world is a world of technology . everything travel at a faster rate & in this speed the basic moral value are going away from the present generation since everybody is thinking of himself first then the rest . but the basic idea should be poured in the present generation that every young of their community is a pillar , if the pillar is not strong then the community wil not grow properly . for example yes , i do agree that nowadays young people are not giving enough time to their community . if these continues like this then which ever community it may be will have to pay for the lose they may face in comming year because of thier younger generation negligence .
