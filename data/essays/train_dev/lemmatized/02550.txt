do successful people try new thing and take risk rather than only doing what they already know how to do well ? i do n't agree with that . i think experience , time , and the higher possibility of success are the main point to support my opinion . firstly , experience help people to be successful in doing one job . if a person ha a lot of experience on doing one job , he can usually make the best decision when a problem come out . compare to a person who make a decision when he doe a new job , he is unexperienced and ha no idea which way ha more benefit for him . so he can easily make a wrong or worse decision . so successful people would do what they already know how to do well because they have experience . secondly , we need enough time to make our job successful . working a job to be successful is a long process . a person who doe a job which he already know how to do well , save a lot of time on understanding basic knowledge of the job . then he can spend more time to make the job perfect and and make himself to be successful . finally , a person doe a job which he already know how to to do well , he ha a higher possibility of success than those who try new thing and take risk . as we know , if we try a new job , we have no experience about that and have to spend plenty of time to understand the job . it is risky to do that because we might find out we are not able to make it successful after spending a long period time . on the contrary , if we already know a job well , of course we know what to do to make it successful directly efficiently . i disagree that successful people try new thing and take rick rather than only doing what they already know how to do well , because they do n't have experience , enough time and a higher possibility of success in doing the new job .
