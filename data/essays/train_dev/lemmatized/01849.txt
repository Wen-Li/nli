the following text deal with the question whether it is the best way to travel with a tour guide . traveling with a guide ha many advantage over traveling without guidance . a tour guide know the area well and therefore , will guide the tourist to the most remarkable and worthwhile spot of a city . commonly the guide is familar with the historical backgroud of the area , and will be able to explain the landmark and the development of a metropole . besides the well-known highlight , a guide will also be aware of secret spot and so , allow the tourist to be intoduced into the side of an area that is out of the spot light . that will not only show an often charming and different side of a city , but also completes the big picture . in addition to that , guided exploration are safer since the a person who is familiar with the area will also know the unsafe place where it is not recommended to go . on the other hand , traveling without a guide is more of an adventure . it is up to the traveling group to explore the city and to find both , the landmark and the secret spot . the traveller are more likely to get in touch with local since they are not a isolated from the `` normal crowd '' within a group of guided tourist . i also believe that traveller will experience a trip differently , if it is not organized perfectly by a guide . the travelling person can set their own pace and adjust the amout of daily exploration to their actual ability to concentrate which make a trip le exhausting and more pleasant . i summery , i believe that travelling without a guide is is the better way to explore a city .
