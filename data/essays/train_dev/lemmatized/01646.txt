i 'm agree and i hope that in twenty year there will be fewer car in use than there are today . today the use of car is more extended and ofthe it 's do n't have a real fundation . in fact , even is true that the lifestyle is more different by the lifestyle in the past century , even if people have more need and more activity to do , for exemple job , sport activity , social event ect .. , is also tru that more people would't have problem and private themselves of own confortability . for exemple analize a tipical family composed by five person , who are father , mather , first son of eighteen year an second soon of five year . in a family of five person , today is n't a surprise have four car ! why ? one car for the father , he use own car to going job , and when he have finished to work he going at the gym . another car is for the mammy , who use own car to going with the second son to the school and then she will go to work . another car is for the first son , who have own car for own personal need , like going to the school , to the cinema or going to the gym . all of over said is possible with one car ! maybe is necessary get up early in the morning and spend more time across the street , or in the traffic , but in this way you will have the opportunity to spend more time with own family , you can say a fact or an experience of day . morover you can resolve a big problem of modern society . the destruction of natural sistem . is more important to save the development and the grow of the word , save and protect the nature by the smog and more other complex problem , suc a serra effect , sea polluted , air unbreath , ect . reducing the number of car for each person , or using public trasportation , such a metro , bus or a lot of service wich you can use , you will reduce the traffic and so also the smog and you will have in the future more healthy for you and your family .
