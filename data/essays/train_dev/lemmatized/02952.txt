i agree with the statement `` most advertisement make product seem much better than they really are '' . if you pick advertising in health care product like over the counter medication doesnt work up to the extent they advertise or print on the item itself . for example there are certain medication used for hair growth like minoxidil which doesnt help in hair growth a they advertise . there is only one priscription medication for hair growth that is propecia even that will help only up seventy five percent . there are certain homeopathic medication like aerborn there is no exact theory how they work for all kind of symptom they list like cold , cough , and more . they always advertise for certain over the counter medication they are a good a priscription drug for example advil , it not exactly same strenth a priscrition it lesser strenth then how can be better than a priscription medication . in the advertisement they mention the advatages in big letter and disadvantage in very small letter , which are equally important and right to know for a consumer . by doing such kind of thing and increasing their sale company are making lot of profit . there is another disadvatage of advertising it also increase the manufacturing cost of the product , which eventually charged to the consumer . they advertising five us of the product out of which one or two is correct . in the past two decade advertising is playing a mazor role in selling new product . some advertisement are really good and the best way to know a consumer about the new product in the market and their us , provided they give u right information through advertising . my personal opinion on advertising is i could only realy upto certain extent and you have to be very careful
