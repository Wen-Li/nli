when wa signed the human right declaration ? who signed it ? where ? are you sure to remember all the anwers by heart ? if not , do not need to conclude that you are a bad person who doe not know anything . however , this conclusion can be easily reached if you do not know the objective of the declaration and it importance . maybe this example is not the best but it help me to explain that even if fact are important , understanding idea and concept is a priority . when student are going to school , they want to learn to better comprehend their environment . to reach these objective , they have to think , ask question and learn idea and concept . ideas have the advantage to be transversal and be re-use on different subject . indeed , the example of the human rights is not only an historical element but also a philosophical and anthropological question . by knowing the concept , student can make cross-over and see how some theme are connected . facts are still useful but they are mainly illustration , example . they give value added to student to apprehend their lesson to give a practical dimension to a theorical problem . they should be highly regarded and well-used , however , they should not be seen a the ultimate goal . knowing fact without being able to relate them to some idea is a waste of time . a person is not more intelligent by the amount of information he know but by the quality and his ability to use it . therefore , student should learn to think no only to repeat . finally , once student have idea and concept in their mind , learning fact is not the most difficult thing to accomplish . our world with the help of image , television , medium is full of fact . you open any newspaper you will find fact on a multitude of subject . the real difficulty is to analyze them . that is why i will definetely encourage student to take some distance from fact , think , and try to make some relationship with idea and concept . by that way , they will add value added to their work and remember easily the different historical date , name and fact !
