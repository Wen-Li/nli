i definitely hope that in 20 year there will be fewer car being used than today . eveyday more and more people take air pollution in to consideration . people started to use local tansportation vehicle more than before . as the fuel oil price increase the personal car use is declining . on the other hand local and or national transportation is getting more modern with the developing technology . access to many different region is easier than before . the starting point should be environmental pollution . if we want to leave a le polluted world to our child to live , may be we can start with our car . here is an idea ; when we are going to work why not driving one car . collegues living in the same region can get together and drive to work with one car instead of each of them driving his or her own car . this is a very common argument nowadays . hiring a minibus is an other alternative way to decrease the car amount on the road . in today 's world people are more aware and conscious about the nature .
