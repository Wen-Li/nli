advertisement , a a typical factor of this commercial society , can keep working because of it can make thing better than they really are , so people will decide to buy the product . in my opinion , changing cover , announcing a new verison , and using famous super star are three way for advertisement to make them look much better than they real are . the cover make them look unique , professional , and beautiful . but what will happen if people get used to it ? the fancy cover wo n't attract people anymore . so at this time , they will chance their cover . for an example , coca cola , a a very popular and traditonal soft drink of america , ha changed it cover for so many time , but it did n't really change the drink itself . the new cover will let people think , maybe it might taste better . the new cover bring people a new mood , which is invisible . a new version is another way of advertisement . when people get used to use something , they will lost their interest . so a new version of the product will coming out at this time . it doe n't mean the product is still the old thing , but no one know exactly how much the productor changed it . for example , there are so many kind of shampoo say they are the second verison , but only professional analytists would know how much they really changed , and how much different will be made . the third way for the productors to sell more their product is to use make the famous guy , such a singer , movie star , or even the president . the effect of the famous people are huge . first , if someone is a fan of a movie star . he or she might buy the product without any reason . second , most super star have good-looking face . even the product is not the reason that made them look good , cosumers might be affected . so they think at least they might become beautiful . so in conclusion . the most advertisement use verision , cover and super star to confuse people . so they can use these way to hide the real value of their product , and sell more of them .
