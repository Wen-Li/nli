i agree with the statement of the topic and put my view with regard to my opinion a follows . take for example the business sector , most of the successful people in are not merely to one sector alone , they have a group of company or if not they want to improvise their establishment by entering into different field . standing in the place alone can not make them further more successful , and here i remember the saying `` success is not a destination it is a journey '' there are many establishment of famous people which grow step by step trying new thing out for the newer generation need and the one who get to the need of the trnd is a successful person . so in the present day of improvised civilisation and technology new and new invention should be done to reach the people and this could only by taking risk , and i personally feel that without risk there are no invention and no progress . how would one be successful without a risk or trying out new thing . to state an example how would dhirubai ambani would be so succesful without his initial risk in investing for the business , with his risk today one of the largest group of reliance industry come into existence and still expanding day by day with new field . there a lot many example like this where success lie only after a risk . so tain any field of life success a mentioned is a journey and to pas through this journey several risk are to be taken and if not they will come to a stand still and this will not be called a success so i agree the statement that successful people try newthings rather than doing what they know .
