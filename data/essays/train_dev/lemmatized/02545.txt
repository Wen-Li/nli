nowadays the car is connected to our everyday life so much more than any other way of transporting is . we often use car to go to work or to go to school , we use car in order to be somewhere else in the le time it is possible ; we use car also , and maybe first of all , for going out in the evening , when bus and tube are maybe full of no raccomanded people and somethings like that . .. on one hand car is for sure our best way of transporting because it is easy to use and it need not to be in queue for the tikets for example , but i think that the real question is : is the car really the best solution , the best urban solution to reach a place , to go to somewhere ? or maybe would the car be one day a real problem in our everyday life , instead ? i think that the answer is that in a few year the car will be the worst way of transporting because of the increasing number of driver in the street , and most of all because of the incoming problem of the pollution ! according to me , in the end , in twenty year there will be fewer car in use than there are today a a natural consequence of the improving of our own life . i think also that my opinion is supported by all those experiment that scientist and ingenieers are doing in order to convert our way of moving in a city with alternative way of transportings and also with alternative carburants maybe le nocives . for example i think that in the future our city will support much more transporting by train than by car in order to move much more people at a time , eliminating problem connected with traffic and pollution .
