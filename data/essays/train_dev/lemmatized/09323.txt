it is often said that older people enjoy life more because they have more money and time to buy something or travel . however , i do not agree with that older people enjoy their life more than younger people . there are several reason and example that young people enjoy life more . to begin with , young people have much better physical condition . they can go wherever they want and do whatever they want . for example , my uncle , who wa over 60 , really wanted to try bunge-jump at least one time . but he wa too old to do that kind of risky outdoor sport . he regreted that he could enjoy his life more than now if he were young . secondly , young people have more desire about their life than older people . i believe that dream is a essential factor to feel happiness in their life . as people age , they tend to lose their dream because the possibility decrease to fulfill their dream or goal of life . it often lead to frustration and abandonce about their life . for instance , a lot of parent in korea sacrifice themselves much for their kid . they have little hope besides their kid . it is almost impossible for them to work more , make more money , or make new friend . in addition , young people can feel happy in thier life from even small satisfaction . there wa one tv program how each generation react to some given event . they were more likely to smile and laugh than older people . they felt happy very easily just because they were more happier people . very small comedy or even trivial action wa able to satisfy young people and make them laugh . it show that young poeple can enjoy almost everything in all situation , in contrast , older people are picky . in short , i agree that young people enjoy life more than older people do . young people have better reason and condition to enjoy life more . they have enough both physical and mental energy to try what they want to . and their desire will encourage them to explore and enjoy their life vigorously . also they have more tendency of satisfation .
