i completly agree with this statement because in all advertisement the product they show is the best of all , they show the product a if it is the 8 wonder of the world , but when you go to buy the product because you are completly facinated about it you notice that is n't even the half of what they said . this happens to all people in the world eventhouh all people know that what advertisement said are never correct they always want to go and buy the product and keep falling on buying the product they wanted . this statement should be place on every advertisement because sometimes that are really rare time the advertisement is correct and people think if they should buy it or just let it go because it may not be what they saw . this creat loses in some company because they now need to show the people that what they are selling it the real stuff . in some way what they are doing is cheating the costumer in every way because costumer go buy thing , thing that they think are correct but at the end they lose their money , the product and they ca n't do anything about it because they have already pay for it . the advertisement that really cheat costumer are the one given on the web , thing that you can buy on the web are most of the time not what the costumer wanted . but they are also thing that you can buy on the web like program because they will always be what they said the program ha . in conclusion i think that company that make this kind of advertisment are doin it just to get a profit of it but what they are really doing is makig their company fall because if they at the beginning starte to show advertisement that are n't real costumer wont buy any thing else from thta company even if after the company startes to amke good stuff . as my advice i think that company should show the product a it is or make the product look exactly a they show in the advertisement
