during their all long period of education and graduation , student are learning many thing on different topic and are developping many skill . that give them the opportunity to improve some of them . is that more important for a student to understand what he is learning , or just to keep thing in mind without any explanation or added value ? on the one hand , i think that it is essential for a student to understand what is teaching to him for the simple evidence that he will better keep it in mind . if we take the exemple of an economic classroom , it will be more efficient for the student to understand the concept of `` the liberalism '' for instance by understanding the way it work and it feature , than just knowing the fact that this is an economical way in opposition to others a `` sociaism '' . but on the other hand , it sometimes difficult for a student to understand every aspect of an idea or a concept . this made the fact that some student are tough in an area and weak in an other one . in this case it would be a better way for the student just to learn his class without any more understanding , just like a robot . my personal exemple can be releated through the phylosophy classroom i had im college . i wa defenetly weak on this area and the only profitable way for me to get a not too bad resul at the exam wa to learn fact and to prevent myself to write extra-explanations that i did not really understand . to sum up , i will say that it is of course essential to understand the idea and concept given through our schoolar education , but that we are not necessarly aware to all the field and some are so harder to learn depper in or improve . we can introduce here the concept of natural selection which drive people to some field of studying and some others to opposite area . ..
