there are many reason that make me think that the number of car would be reduce in twenty year , for example the improvement in the public transport , the increase of the comunications like telephone and internet that could reduce the utility of a car because we could work from home , the increase in the contamination and therefore the policy of the goverments , and also the increase of the price of petrol and gas . but i do not think that there will be fewer car than today . during the last fifteen year we have seen a big improvement in public transport but it ha not reduced the number of car , a everybody can see there is more traffic , more car per house , so the experience say that better public transport doe not mean le car , at least until now . obviously the price of the petrol and gas will be a problem , but since many year ago there ha been research for new kind of source . now we have not discovered any better source than petrol , but is more than possible that we can find solution in electricity and nuclear field than can satisfied our need , and with a good price . other reason that make me think that the number of car will not decrease but increase is our style of life . in a rich country like ireland we can see how is important the appearence , and in this country where the road are not good , you can see big and expensive car and people do not need them , why they have it ? only because when you have a big car , people respect you more because you look more important . another reason is the independence that i have with a car . i can go wherever i want for my own , and this point is very important for me and i think that for everybody , and is something that the public transport can not give u .
