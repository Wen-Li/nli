i agree with the statement . successful people take risk at every turn of their life . they tend to do the unthinkable because normal people are sometimes afraid , ashamed , shy or feel guilty doing thing that others have not done . in my opinion the one who dream and doe nothing to acheive that dream of his is not successful . successful people dream and try and try and try to reach their respective goal inspite of the difficulty facing them . i will give you certain example regarding that . a few day back i wa watching news about a handicapped woman who couldnot walk since she wa young . she attended college and by her sheer perseverance and hard work , she wa able to make it to the basketball team and is representing usa in world cup championship . when she wa interviewed a to how she could do it , she just replied hard work and risk . the other example that i can think of is the guy who created youtube . who would have thought that these guy ( 3 in all ) would make million and million with their new innovation . that is what i call risk . they risked their future by rejecting job offer from other company and starting a new innovation called youtube and the result are there for everyone to see . one more example that i would think of is india 's mittal company . indian steel company never ventured outside india . but mittal comapany made a bold move of purchasing britain 's premier oil company . everybody thought that this move wa a big blunder . but the company risk proved to be the best deal ( and big too ) and many indian company now are moving globally . so , with above example in mind i really think that successful people try new thing and take risk rather than doing what they already know .
