we can see many advertisement in our life . on tv , magazine , newspaer and even we can see on a street through the window . do these advertisement make people to buy the product ? absolutely yes , because most of them make product seem much better than they really are . i have three reason why and how advertisement make product seem better ; advertisement show only good thing , they use popular person a a model and they repeat same thing . first of all , advertisement show only good thing . they naver show negative thing . for example , there is a computer . this computer is very fency and look good however the function is very limited and it ha small memory . would the advertisement of this computer say that it ha limited function and small memory ? it would show only good thing and overstate about it however it would not mention about bad thing . people do n't know about negative thing and know only good thing so they may think product are very good . second , they use popular person a a model to attract people . many advertisement use popular star in spite of paying huge amout of money . people think they can be similar with the model a they use the product . for exmaple , model of clothes ' advertisement are all pretty and skinny , because people think if they wear the clothes they can be a pretty a them . last of all , they are repeated so people remind the product anytime . same advertisement are repeated . sometimes , i saw same advertisement for more than 10 time a day . although at first time i just passed the advertisement , however later i wa interest in the advertisement and the product . advetisement repeat same state and action so make people agree with them . for these reason , advertisement make product seem much better than they really are so make people buy product . in my opinion we should be careful with these advertisement to not buy that we are not neccessary . advertisement is just an advertisement . we can enjoy to see it , however we should not beileve all what they say .
