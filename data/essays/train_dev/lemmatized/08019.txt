being a successful person make yourself responsable on maintaining that success in many different aspect . i completely agree on the fact that successfull people should try new thing and take risk because it will give the person confidence , experience , knowlegde , independence among other characterics that a successful person should have and never forget . one point in favour is that successful people should try new thing to get experience even in thing that have anything to do with their area of success . in fact , a successful person ha usually studied before and ha a good level of education and experience on it field to achive her o his success correctly . for example , a successful colombian singer who go to music school in colombia and then go to a music academy in india will have not only the knowledge of indian music but the experience of being in another country surrounded with a different culture and people . furthermore , this will give the colombian singer a range of new idea that will probably be reflected in new style of music , lyric that he or she will manage to learn and use due to the experience of being in india . another point to support the importance of taking risk is the fact that you never know what is going to happen in the future . taking a risk being successful help already because of the prestige that your name already ha . for instance , my dad to the risk of quiting his last job because he wanted an independent company even thou he had a good salary . however , he manage to create his new coal company with old working partner that he met during a conference in last job where he wa very successful a the general administrator of a marine port . his success and popularity in his last job helped him after many year to gain the confidence and trust of new working partner . finally , to maintain success you have to take risk in life
