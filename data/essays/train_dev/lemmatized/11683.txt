i think that i will have to partially agree and partially disagree with the statement that young people tend to not give enough time helping their community . to answer the question accuratley though , and to fully explain my personal opinion on the topic , first of all we need to define the word ` community ' . a community is not only the place where you are living . it might just a well be a certain group of people you spend a lot of time with , like your sport team , your school , political party , your church or a local band . all these are community . sure there are young people who just like to hang out with their friend at home , watching television or playing videogames . but teenager are starting to wake up again , they have begun to be more active and participate in group activity , in community . there are festival and street market organized by teenager , they sing in their church or help raising fund for charity project . it is the young people - and not big company or mighty politician - who are struggling for a job and a future and therefore go through a lot of effort like organizing conference or meeting with those in charge to change something about the situation . clearly they can not do all this on their own and need help from adult like parent , teacher , mayor and company boss . but young people are up on their foot again , they are trying to make a change for the better . of course it is very easy to get the impression that in our society everyone only think of his - or herself anymore and is not willing to volunteer for a higher purpose , especially when you think of teenager . however , this impression can only be right if you look at individual . many young people are only concerned with their own future and their own well-being , excatly like many adult do . but there are just a many great teenager i know that spend a lot of time helping their community and the people surrounding them .
