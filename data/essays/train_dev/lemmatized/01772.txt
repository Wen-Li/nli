what is fun ? is it having no care in the world or is it having responsibility that you enjoy ? there are difference in opinion of what fun is for various people . usually , the age at which one is young , free and ready to face the world is considered exciting and more fun . the question is , are we ready to say that older people can not enjoy life ? i do n't think so . when we are younger , in most case , we have no responsibility and only ourselves to think about . this lead to concentrating on only our need and goal and hence attaining happiness out of it . but also , at this point in life , we need to think about the future and plan accordingly . this may lead to intense competition in academic life and a general stress . this is definitely not true always , but in most case it usually tends to have a balancing effect on the fun , challenging the notion that we have more fun when we are young . once we grow older , have a career and family , our responsibility are increased . this doe not mean we can not have fun . by weighing all factor and getting into a career we love , we can do something we enjoy . and having a family can only be a good thing because you will have people who love you and care about you . sometimes we wonder how it is possible for many people to be so active and remain happy inspite of busy schedule . it is mainly because they enjoy what they do and love facing challenge . even after retiring and getting old , we can do those thing in life that we always wanted to do , like reading our favorite book , going to our favorite place and experiencing life a never before . i think that the fun is in enjoying the little thing in life that bring happiness , and having a positive attitude . therefore , if we finally define fun a enjoying what one doe , i do n't think there is any difference whether we 're young or old a long a we experience life in the way we should .
