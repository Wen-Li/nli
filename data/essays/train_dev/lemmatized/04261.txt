i recently read an article about supporting group , which have to face the situation of very low activity participating rate among their member and lack of new application . since i also lead a supporting group for keeping clean our city park , i can confirme this tendence and i agree with the statement . i ca n't stop asking why young people do n't want to be involved in activity , which can improve the life quality in their community . lack of time is the first most popular answer . nowadays youngster are very busy : if the school doe n't give them enough homework , parent will find some extrascholastic activity . friends are also important , and something done with them seems to them to have more worth than something done for the community . helping the community brings not only benefit to the community itself , but also to who participates in the activity . staying together is essential for a social animal like the human being . in conclusion , more should be done to involve young people to help the community . school and parent should be the first to promote such activity , showing the benefit that can be achieved , and not holding people back !
