the world is having the thing that is more enjoyable . in my view there is no difference between the old age people and the young age people to enjoy there life . moreover i think young people are doing more enjoy than old people . i support my openion in the folowing way . young people are going to college in there regular life they had lot of friend . in the college they chat with the friend and eat a meal in the restaurent . they play game with the friend . for exampls some of the game like basket ball . which need a lot of strenth . i think young people having that strenth rather than the old people . always young people are having an habbit to drive a bike . it also need a lot of musscle strenth . always the young people are having that strenth so , they are enjoyed a lot . for example they go out side of the city along with their girl friend . this is also one type of enjoyment . moreover the main important difference among young people and the old people is experience . the young people are not experienced and the old people are experienced . there experience doe not allow them to spend a lot of money for enjoyment . the young people are not like that . they spend more money for enjoyment . in my view there is no enjoyment without money . on the other hand the old people also enjoy a lot . they are playing with there grand child . they are playing a soft game like in door game . in this way the grand parent are enjoying . by seeing all of the above expression . i conclude that young people are doing more enjoy than older people .
