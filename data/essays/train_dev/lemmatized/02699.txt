yes , i agree that young people enjoy more than older people . young age mean the teenage where most of the people spoil their life rather moulding it into a good future . they study till the secondary school but a soon a they enter into their college life they enjoy rather concentrate on their study . he is not aware of the future experience and problem he would face . young people enjoy in their teenage keeping study aside . most of the people in their young age are not aware of the future . they just waste time in enjoying and partying . so that they can not became a successful person in these society . he can not reach his goal . every person ha their on goal but we have to fulfill . by enjoying we waste half of our life and suffer half of the life . their is no use of recognition after the teenage is passed . they think that they have grown up and can handle their decision on their own . they think that they know what is right and what is wrong . they go on for party without the permission of parent and return late night . they smoke , they drink and commits lot of mistake . they break the parent reputation . but the same person when he come to old age he shall think of the past what he have done . he stop all the enjoyment and concentrate on the work and settlement . he think a a mature person . young people are not matured and can not take decision on their own . they live in a world of fantasy , passionate and fashionable . he wanders on the street and creates havoc to the public . most of the young people who think in a better way get settle in life but those are still on road . so everything is in our hand , we should have to change our life according to ur wish .
