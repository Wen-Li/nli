i definitely agree with this statement . i really believe understanding idea and concept for student be more important and valuable than just learning fact . there are diverse reason supporting this opinion . first , idea and concept are abstract and general , in fact they generalize fact . this mean that studying either a concept or an idea you learn the outstanding which all that kind of fact are based on . in other word you study a multiple set of fact . besides once you become familiar with the concept , you can apply it in several way and field of real life . on the other hand learning a fact you just learn that fact which is different to all the other fact . another important constatation regard how long a student can keep in mind a fact or a concept . once you 've understood a concept , it is difficult to totally forget it or delete it completely from your knowledge . differently a fact is absolute easy to lose even in the short term , because it is an unique , isolated situation . you can apply this statement especially to subject like mathematics or finace in which you have to learn how to derive formula or value rather than remember all the possible one . so even you do't remmber that formula you can derive it through passage that you understood
