in my essay i am going to explain why i agree with he statement that successful people try new thing and take risk rather than only doing what they already know how to do well . first i would like to say that success could also be connected with earning a lot of money . successful people are in the case to try new thing out because they are already rich . they also do not have to think about what will happen if the new thing , whatever it is , will not work or will not be so successful . they are able to lean back without caring that they probably had lost a lot of money . they also dare trying out new thing because they do not believe that they would lose something . to support my view i want to show it through an example . if a business man would open a restaurant , just to do something different , and the restaurant will not be visited from any person , he will not think about that he had invested his money wrong . probably he will believe that nevertheless it wa worth it to try it out . besides successful people are really getting tired of doing the same thing over year and year . they want to risk something and want to have more excitement in their life . only people who are successful woul dare it . the reason for my opinion is that if people had felt success once in their life , then they become greedy of having more and more success . they believe that no matter what they will build up , it will become successful . these aspect are leading to my point of view , why i believe that only successful people are taking risk and are trying out new thing and why success play an important role on that statement .
