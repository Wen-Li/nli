nowerdays every family seems to have at least one car . and we ca n't live in everywhere not to see car running on streetsm , whereas we can use some alternative transportation such a train , tube and motorbike . many people have started working to work aor school caring their hearlth . using car reguraly or using another way to transport , both of them have their advantage . it 's difficlut to guess in twenty year which will be more likely that there will be fewer car or not . but if i had to predict our life in twenty year , i would n't say ther would be fewer car than now . i disagree the idea the test had given me . there are some reason underneath . firstly , having car is one of the popular havits amoung men . after working hard to earn enough money to buy cool car , they show how cool car they have bought driving through city . it might be like thier dream to buy a good car . secondly , toyota , which is known for the leading company in japan have been making a big profit , and provide japan a lot of profit . now we can say it 's nessesary for our economy in japan . in short we can see the fact that there will still be lot of demand in twenty year . thirdly , for family i 'll recomend to go trip by car because it help them feel being clother more than staying at home . on holiday even if they get stuck in traffic jam they can have a good conversation . using car is a good enjoyment . in concludion , for those reason above , i disagree with the idea the question gave me . of corse on the othe rhand we have to think about our environment more cafefully .
