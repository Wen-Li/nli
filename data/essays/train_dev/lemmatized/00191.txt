nowadays many people look for way in order to decrease the number of car in use . although i would like to see that quantity of automobile on decrease , i do not believe that this is a possible trend for the near future . simply speaking , there are more incentive for people to buy and use car than there are reason to abandon them . i will try to make a short list of these incentive . first of all , the population on earth is growing continuously , which mean that there are many new people who want to have car . as a result of huge advertising campaign carried out by automobile firm which want to maximize their profit , a social image ha been created for car . people now think that a car improves their mobility and is an indicator of their socio-economic status . moreover , young people also want to have their own car , which make them `` cool '' . as a result , the demand for new car is very high in almost every country on teh world . another trend which would avoid a decrease in the number of car is the unpopularity of mass transit system . since the city are growing constantly and fund of government and local administration can not grow a rapidly a city , it becomes harder to travel within the city using the overcrowded mass transit system . therefore , many people prefer to have a car and use it especially in the busy hour of the day . due to the fascinating technological advancement , it becomes easier for people to buy a new car , because technological advancement enable a decrease in price . bank credit and other kind of financial assistance are offered to people who want to have car and most people use these opportunity to have a new car and keeping the older one for other member of the family . in the early 21st century , it is now widely accepted that a nuclear family ha more than one car , sometimes even all member have their own car : another inclination which hardens a worldwide decrease in the number of car . the continuous growth of population coupled with the strong social image of automobile , unpopularity of mass transit system and price decrease indicate that a decrease in the quantity of automobile is not possible for the near future . considering the environmental danger of having moer car , on the other hand , governmental and non-governmental organization should seek and promote option other than car .
