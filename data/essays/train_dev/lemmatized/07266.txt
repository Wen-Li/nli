i agree with the statement . we can forthseeing the future world . firstly , the energy crisis is coming . if we can not find other source of energy , there will have no energy source for the car . the energy price will grow up many many time from now . citizen may travel by public-transport instead owning a car . moreover , the government will control the number of privite car to control this problem . next , the mass-transit transport will carry most of the passenger . so the need of the car is decrease . secondly , all vehicle will produce pollution including electrical-vehicles . it is because when generating energy , the there are many exhauted gas came out . for example , co2 and so2 . according to the increase of voice in `` earth saving '' , people will most transported by public-vehicles . for example , they will transport by railway instead of dissel-cars . thirdly , for the development of the tele-communication , citizen may not need to go out for work . they may work at home . they may go shopping at home . the student may not goto school , their class may be held at home . do anything at home . so the need of the car will be decrease . on the other hand , the population of many country is decreasing . so that , after 20-years , the need of car may decrease . otherways , the working group of citizen also need to spend money for the eldery . next , the capacity of car are increasing day-to-day . they may carry more people and good . that will decrease the number of the car . for example , 60 year ago , there wa no double-desker-bus in the world . nowadays , the road is full of double-desker-bus . the development of the technology can decrease the demand of the car . according to the reason i mention above , i think that there will be fewer car in use . perhaps after 20 year , people will be travelling on foot for heathy life !
