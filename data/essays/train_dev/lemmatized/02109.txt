i agree with the statement and think that it is important to have a broad knowledge of many academic subject than specialize in one particular subject . firstly , a broad knowledge of subject help an individual learn a lot more in different field and open up his mind . this help him think in various perspective than a single one . for instance , if a doctor were asked if the height of a door in the house wa appropriate acccording to the height of the roof in the planning of a house , he would be perplexed and refer an architect . on the other hand , the same question would be answered by an individual who studied all subject moderately more clearly or atleast with a brief idea . secondly , the knowledge of a broad spectrum of subject reflects versatility of a person and help him get into various type of career opening up more avenue and increasing his flexibility in term of choosing a career rather than limiting himself to one particular field . for example , although an architect specializes in his field an architect with an additional mba degree would be preferred due to his broader domain of knowledge helping him perform better than the one with a single architect degree . thirdly , a variety of subject help an individual in increasing awareness and general knowledge which is very important in the competetive world of today . one who is ahead in this race ascends the step of success at a faster rate . if we compare an invidual who know the basic of all subject with one who know everything about one particular subject and nothing about anything else , it is but obvious that the former would get an upper hand in more number of field in life than the latter . finally , it is important to know the basic of all subject which can be built upon later depending on the career we choose to take up . this help u in increasing our chance of survival in this world of ever increasing competition .
