the beauty of flower is time . and so , if we a a community do not use our time appropriately , we will dramatically suffer , especially young people . the major problem arises today and it is that young people nowadays do not give sufficient time to help in contributing their community . unfortunately , they spend much of their time on futile and fruitless thing , such a watching television for hour , surfing on restricted site on the internet , and spending le time on reading beneficial and andvantageous stuff . unquestionably , most dwelling today contain at least one television set . the problem is that young people do not benefit from television nowadays , where instead of watching useful stuff , such a ` the discovery chanel ' or ` animal planet ' , they tend to watch thing that are noxious and ` brain washer ' . without a doubt televesions today are considered ` like a white elephant ' . young people nowadays need to contribute harder and use the internet more efficiently . i am sure that there are abundance amount of people in this world use internet unwisely by watching porn and bad thing on the internet . my point here is that the internet is a colossal source of information and many young people look at it on the decietful way , which is really depressing and exasperating . i strongly agree that much time should be spent on reading rather that watching television . and that is because reading make the person more productice by giving him crucial and pivotal information about many thing in life . moreover , reading is exceedingly useful for the brain , a it make it more active and vivacious . in the long run , i strongly agree that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their community . and neccessary action should be taken for the whole community to make an end to this unwanted crisis .
