personally , i agree with the statement that the number of car would probably decrease in the future , a the contemporary situation already provides hint that the trend is going towards this direction . first of all , the recent development of the gas price , show that driving a car becomes more and more expensive . even today more and more people try to avoid to use their if it is not necessary . moreover , already today there are people who ca n't afford having a car . i think that it is very likely that this trend will continue in the future . consequently it seems sensitive , a having a car becomes more and more expensive , that even the number of car might decrease . moreover , car cause pollution . people are already aware that it is detrimental to the environment and thus in consequence also to health if the traffic is not reduced . campaigns try to raise the awareness something ha to change . thus i can imagine that measure have to be taken to reduce the traffic . one of the simplest is to reduce the number of car . governments must and will have to take action , hence it appears reasonable that they will try anything to obtain a reduction of the number of car . one possibility to reduce the number of car might be to raise the tax which would in the end also make driving expensive , so that people might no use more public transport . however , i can also imagine that a there is a need to reduce the number of car in order to protect the environment , the cost for public transport might be lowered thereby encouraging more and more people to avoid buying a car . this trend can already be observed in the big city . car sharing and a stronger use of public transport such a subway and bus have become common hint that the number of car is decreasing . however , although i believe that the number of car will decrease in the future , it is also possible that this doe not happen . a new technology based on regenerable resource that make car le dangerous for the environment may keep the number of car stable . we will see
