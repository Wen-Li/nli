learning is based on too main tecniques , understanding the idea and concept and learning fact . understanding the idea and concept is a very important step in the learning process , it help student absorbe the essence of the topic . for example : jenny ha to study science , the first thing she should do is read all the information , digest it and make her oun conclusion based on her knowledge . tis step is more general , it includes more aspect than the next one . after getting the main point of a lesson , student learn the fact . this provides them with a solid base when the use of the previos knowledge is requied . in contrast with understandind the idea , learning fact is a specific activity , where you memorize selected aspect of your interest . in my opinion understanding the idea and concept is a important a learning the fact . i have been in contact with both of the way of studiyng and i have got better grade when i learn the fact than when i focuse on understanding the lesson . even though when i learn the fact i usually dont get the esence of the lesson , i get better grade . it is a little absurd but almost all of my classmate had the same problem . that is why i state in my personal opinion that the understanding is a important a memorizing . it is a way of itegrating two proceses that complete each other and forming a whole , joining both step . as a result the flaw of one would be covered by the good thing of the other and viceversa . for me , the perfect learning process would be the one which includes both of the step mentioned above , linking them by relating the overview of a lesson with the specific fact that support it .
