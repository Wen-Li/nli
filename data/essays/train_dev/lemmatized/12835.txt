i agree with the statement young people do not give enouh time to helping their community . actually young people do not have enough time to helping their community . the example and reason are a follows . firstly today young peolple are busy with their schedule . every young person running along with the clock to survive in this busy world . people are working hard to acheive their goal because of day by day population is increasind and also competition is increasing . young people are totally exhausting their energy for their carrier itself . there is no extra energy to help community . some of them are not having enough time to work for themselves . for instance , today many young people surviving by their own without creating problem to their parent . students are working while they are studying . some student hardly fine time to study because of their work . this is the main reason why young people are not having time to helping their community . in addition to that , now a day education is so much stressed that young people have no time to look upon community atleast those young people even dont know that community are search for help . today school are giving lot of home work to do that these young people are not in position to do other activity . like student employee also having same problem with their work . today many company not considering the time that the employee work . they want the amount of work . they are imposing the work on employee . i have an real example for this statement . my elder brother is working a a sofware engineer . in his companie 's policy they have holiday on saturday and sunday . but my brother used to go to the office even on sunday also because of the amount of he have to do . by considering all the above reason and example i conclude that young people do not give enough time to helping their community .
