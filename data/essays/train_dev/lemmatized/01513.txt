i disagree the statement that young people enjoy life more than older people do because of some reason . my some of the reason to disagree that idea are ; first of all enjoying life doe not connected to age completely , secondly when year are passed people get more experinced and finally older people understand life better than younger one which help them to enjoy more . to begin with , let try to define ` enjoying` . is enjoying related to your phsical situation ? what i think is that enjoying is having fun and being happy in a certain time period which is not dependent to your phsical situation but your mental property . you can be very healthy about your muscle , organ and all your body but it doesnt mean anything if your mental condition is alright . additionally , experience is very important in life to enjoy it . a famous singer say ` i know what it is to be young but you dont know what it is to be old ' when he reached the considerably old age . people who lived a lot of thing - which can be consired a ` taste ' in life - learn how to defend and stand for bad happening and it must help them to be happy even if they are in very bed situation . finally , life is not very easy to understand and identify . every second passed through our life help u to achive the understanding of the aim and that identification of life . this identification help people to enjoy since the unavoidable end of this life is to ` die ' . young people live a if they will never die whereas olders see that end easier than the youth that philosophical finish . hence , i dont believe the idea that older people enjoy life le than the younger people do because i think it doesnt completely dependent on age and the reason i mentioned above . i see a lot of young people never enjoy whereas a lot of very old people smiling and having fun with their friend .
