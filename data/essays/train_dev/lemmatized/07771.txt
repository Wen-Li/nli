it is important for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn the fact , i agree with this that student should understand the idea of the concept . knowledge of the student is behind the theory . he can do through theoritical . student should get idea on the both theoritical and the practical test . in the theory we will get the concept and in the practical we will get the knowledge in detail what is happening in that concept . a student can learn and understand and anything can be made through theoritical or practical . by getting the idea the student can improv his knowledge . in the theoritical he can get the idea but up to certain limit , where a in the practical test we will get the idea in the deapth . in the practical test we can learn the concept in detail , and with the idea we the do the experiment . with out the idea and the concept we can , t perform anything . first we have to get an idea and the description of concept going to be performed in that concept . student can improve the communication skill he can improve his idea . idea are the strength of the student , with out the idea student can not be performed . if any one of them ask for an idea we will be in a stage to give the idea . kowledge is the power of the student , and the concept without the concept we ca n't do nothing , for every small example there will be a concept , and without this concept we can not perform anything . what we are going to achieve , and student should understand the ides and the concept . this are the specific reason for the student to understand idea and concept . concept will give the ability what is going to be performed .
