in life there are many event that people do to enoy themselves . some people go to vacation while some without that much money could go to theme park and ride on roller coaster . to me , i think young people do actually enjoy life more than older people do because they have the energy that could be used to enjoy life better . young people would go to place like amusement park , watch a movie with friend , hang out with friend and much more while older people mostly stay home . young people tend to go out more to have a good time with their friend . when young people go to amusement park , they have a great time . many go on the roller coaster and have a nice time screaming their lung out or they go and ride on the regular ride like the carousel . but to older people , roller coaster are very scary and sometimes caused them to have nausea . older people would shy away from the amusement park at much a they could . at one time , my aunt came with me , her son and daughter to the amusement park . her son and i went to ride on the roller coaster while my aunt and her daughter just sat there and waited for u . she did not have much fun . we asked her to go on the slower ride like the carousel with u but she refused so , we just gave up on her and went on some more ride at the amusement park . at the end of the day , my aunt 's son and i enjoyed the amusement park more than my aunt and her daughter . to a young person , going to watch a movie with friend is a very enjoyable hobby . when watching with friend , they could laugh together about funny science in the movie and cry together when there wa a sad scene . but to an older person , they seldomly go to movie . like my parent , they do not go to movie . i remembered when my sister , me and my mother when to the movie , she got bored and fell asleep . she did not enjoy the movie and just slept through it . my and my sister wa kind of depressed because she slept through the movie . young people enjoy more in party than older people . young people in party could dance , eat , socialize , and have more fun than older people . older people could dance , eat , and socialize but they would not enjoy a much because they do not have a much energy . at a party at my friend 's house , we had lot of fun . we ate , watched television , sang karaoke , and danced . some of the people danced and sang very funny so , we laughed really hard and had a great time . we spent almost all of out energy and enjoyed every bit of it . in an adult party , the part that wa most fun wa eating food . there were not many entertainment and most of the adult just stood in their own corner and socialized . young people do have more fun and enjoy themselves than older people . most of the older people would get away from all the place the young people tend to like . the older people would want to mostly stay home and relax while the young people would go outside and have a great time with their friend . they do not have a much energy a the young people to enjoy life like u .
