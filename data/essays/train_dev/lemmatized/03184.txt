successful people try new thing and take risk rather than only doing what they already know how to do well . i agree with this statement because it is from the successful people that we get many thing needed in our day today life . for example , let u consider billgates who ha known very well for the invention of the software microsoft . he is a successful person in the software field but he may not stop doing the experiment in this field . one day he might be the leading personality in computer field . like this there will be many successful people who might take risk rather than doing only what they know . for example , consider scientist . scientist will be one the successful person in his field . he might take risk and invent more thing using the latest technology . right brother invented the aeroplane . they may be successful in their field but did n't stop taking risk to invent new thing . it is because of them airlines came into light . successful people might invent new idea using their own knowledge that is gained through reading book or by their own experience . if they were trying to discover one thing and if in case it might not come true because of some reason they will try it in other way by taking new risk . from the previous knowledge they think what are the cause and defect and they take measure to rectify the defect . in this way successful people always take risk to invent more and more new thing . failures may not dissapoint the successful people they take it a a challenge and will try more to recover the mistake and to bring out their product in to life . every successful man think that `` failures are the key stone for success '' . it is because of the failure one get strong desire to invent a new thing . only successful people can do this because they will not care for risk . they care only for their target .
