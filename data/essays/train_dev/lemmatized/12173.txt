well a a student i will say and understanding is basic not matter if is and idea concept or a fact , the point is all depens if is for a comon use or for a class , or living . what i try to say is all are important to undestand , what difers is who we use sometimes is better to have the idea of something becouse it let u our mine opend to descover more and undestand better becouse is how we undestand or persive the idea . when we have a concept is not much that we can change becouse is that way it is exemple a concept of a anatomy where blood are red cell , is not much that we can change we leran like that . now if we talk about fact is something proved by cientific law , gravity is a fact . as a student we need to accept some information a idea where can be personal or toughts form someone , concept where we need to learnd , and fact . i thing the diference in all is fact you can not change , concept you can learn in diferent way and finally understand , and idea is what you creeat , form something you see , you hear or feel , and can be change . facts , concept and idea are importan for a student , not matter what is study , for sure the person that study chimestry fact are every where , and it may be learn and no so well undestud , and other case a person that study politic science , what matter more are the idea how interpres tha concept , and maybe for someone that study biology concept are really important and must to be undestud . for more or le , ideas concept and fact are importan when we are learning , i thing how it work is we get the idea , then we analize then we undestand . wether is a idea , concept or a fact .
