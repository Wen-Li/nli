we are living in a society surrounded by various adivertisements which not only appear on tv show , newspaper and internet , but also on other occasion , such a subway , bus stop , or even on the bulloons flying in the sky . some people think all these ad make them easier to get access to the product they are not so familiar , while others consider it a obligatory input of business management . in my opinion , both of the comment are reasonable . as we all know , with the development of modern technology , our life style is more and more following a faster pace . so when we are considering purchase of our necessity , it is a little time-consuming to pick up the product from the others . ads help u to go through the choosing process . many ad maybe exaggerate their effect , for example , the advertising picture showed on the internet do have some difference from the original product , but since all of them are exaggerating in some level , considering that , they would be equal a well , which is understandable because every company ha to beautify their product to make profit . however , sometimes some ad boost their product so much that it would be actually undermine the effect , for they will be too good to believe . but this kind of ad should be prevented in case some people would be cheated on that . what is more , it is very discouraging and disappointing to discover that the product you have bought is not a good a the ad said . i can take our wireless internet access for example . we installed the high speed internet last year , and we are expecting to enjoy the high-speed online surfing service , but it turned out to much slower that what it said on the promotion handbook . so after that , i am becoming more and more convinced on the statememt in the topic . to sum up , according to my experience , many ad will certainly more or le exaggerate their property , i 'd better choose from them carefully .
