young people often resemble an attitude of interest to the most important issue , regardless of the amount of the time they give to actually help their community it is very difficult to meet someone that is completly not interested . i personnaly find very important that there is a social awareness of what si going on in any specific community and probably the young people involved play a leading role in in what their community will look like in the future . looking the community with a positive and understanding eye is not something that only adult should do . lots and lot of activity are done in community and the majority of them are well organized , young people in general attend to many of them and contribute significantly to the evolving proccess of community . of course there is a lot done by the local religious community in wich maybe there is sometimes a lack of young people . i personally live inside a community where the local church organizes place where all the young , age from seven to eighteen can play soccer and always attend mass a help for the priest . the high sense in these case of very strong religious factor can build up very strong community and avoid the spreading of violence and indifference . looking in a positive way to my communitiy made me appreciate all of these organization and participating to some activity and allowed me to instore some of the best friendship of my life . looking back at some of the best year of my childhood i see a lot my time in my community .
