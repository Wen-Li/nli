there are two way of travelling . one is travelling in a group led by a tour guide and the other is travelling by our own . there are advantage and disadvantage in each way and people have different view of choosing which one is superior than the other . my opinion is that travelling with a tour guide is not better than travelling myself . there are several reason of my opinion . firstly , many people choose to travel in a group in order to save money . it is certainly true . however sometimes a tour guide take traveller to shopping and make people to spend more money than they expected to . this issue ha been pointed out many time in the news . secondly , the time for a travel is limited when travelling in a group . usually , tour guide ha planned their schedule for each day . for example , when we are going to a museum , tour guide give certain time for staying in that museum because they have to move to another place . in this case traveller can not go through the place carefully because they have to hurry . thirdly , the reason i prefer travelling by myself is that i can visit anywhere i want to . i do not have to move within the group . for example , if i visit the foreign country , i always go to the market first . it is because market is the place that i can feel their culture and meet people originally living in that place . however , usually , tour guide do not take traveller to the local market . instead , they take people to department store where they can spend money . lastly , several disagreement can occur when travelling in a group . when i wa travelling china with some chinese , we have to argue for the food that we want to eat . therefore we had to travel rest of the day without talking to each other . people travelling in a group have to consider characteristic of people in the group . otherwise they have to travel in a uncomfortable condition . in colclusion , the reason i prefer travelling by my own is that travelling in a group can cost more money , the time and place for travel is limited and dispute can take place . i love travelling therefore i travel a lot , these point are based on my experience .
