today , the environment continues to play in increasingly important role in world politics . although , first step have been made to reduce globl warming , the issue is still not treated with the earnesty and conviction it deserves so far . sadly i need to stress the fact , that this may pose a greater threat to civilisation than terrorism . cars contribute to global warming by emmiting co2 . consequently , the question wether there will be fewer car in use in 20 year is of vital importance to u all . i would like to answer with a definite yes . however , i think otherwise . one of the main reason for this conviction is , that people have known about global warming for a long time , but that consequent action , such a driving le ha been taken only by a small minority . people love convenience , and car are very convenient . moreover car are very important symbol of status for many people . feelings have a greater influence on most people than rational thought , and this is why they will not give up their car if they don not have to . another reason why i think that the number of car will increase , is that large number of people in the so called third world , especially in china , who did not have car so far , are starting to buy them . ony a drastic increase in petrolem price could slow this developement . less pessimistic reason for my view , are that new car are beeing developed . these car use le fuel , cosequently , they will be affordable , even if fuel price should rise significantly . what is more , research ha been trying to invent car that do not use combustable fuel at all for quite a while . they will surely succeed in the near future . i do hope that if i am right , and we do have more car on earth in twenty year , than we do today , that they will not emmit co2 .
