the art of making advertisement is one of the most important thing to sell a product nowdays . people of this century is really involve in the advance of tecnology ; so , instead of reading a book , most of u are watching television or navegating by internet . this tecnologies , and also the street , is full of advertisement and we ca n't avoid seen or listenining them . as i said before , we are all the time in touch with advertisement and i think that this way of salling a product is the one that give more benefit to a company . thats why i agree that company do their best to announce their product in the andvertisements better than they are . for example , you can see and advertisement of a shampoo that sais that it would `` leave your hair very straight and soft '' a the model that they show . as a fact , you can be sure that the moldel did n't only use the shampoo to look beautiful , but the company need to reflect how people want to look like and they will use other product to get the best impression on the audience . we have to be very careful with advertisement because a i said , in most of the ca they are not showing the truth . most of the time are a strategy of marketing of the product and , if we are clear about it , we wo n't get dissapointed when the product do n't have the quality that the advertisement show .
