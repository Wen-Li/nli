i certainly agree with the following statement , `` successful people try new thing and take risk rather than only doing what they already know how to do well . '' how can a person be successful if he doe n't take risk and try finding out new thing in life . if a person doe n't experence it , how would they know if they are good at other thing and not just at one thing . if you experince different thing in life you also would experience at the same time different emotion . emotions are what a person express and feel . while expereincing you may find out what 's right and what 's wrong . a successful person , in my opinion , learns form their mistake , how would you learn from your mistake if you only repeat what your good at . successful people try new thing inorder for them to learn from their mistake . to live successful , you have to be successful . for exmaple my mother is a successful bussiness woman , she became successful after going through many different stiutations . some situation she faced were harsh and others were pleasing . you find out your successfulness after experincing different issue and going through different emotion . you never know when your successful until the end . taking risk , is all about being successful . risking your life and taking risk are one factor that help build up your personality . it make your personality stronger and tougher . personality is what make you unique and different from others . if your a successful person , your personality supposed to be great and optimistic , looking at thing in a postive side of view , even if you face a difficult siutation that you thought your not going to face . poeple build up thier personality by experincing different emotion .
