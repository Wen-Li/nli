the world ha witnessed a dramatic increase in population and also the amount of abuse that humanity ha done to environment . i feel that there would be a considerable amount of increase in the use of car in the future . the world undergoes a goelogical cycle inorder to maintain the balance of nature . man ha been very instumental in creating an imbalance in nature . in order to create a balance , the world ha witnessed unforseen natural calamity which have killed million of people . the movie , `` the day after tomorrow '' ha made real sense in showing what would be the state of the world in sometime from now . our natural reserve are being exploited to their limit . soon we would have none of our natural reserve left . but , technology ha made giant leap in exploring the unknown . we will have to depend on alternate method of energy to run our automobile and other equipment . solar power is the best possible example of an alrternate source of energy . battery powered car have been manufactured which are eco friendly . although fossil fuel consumption would become low , the number of car would see a dramatic increase . as more number of eco friendly car are produced , the more affordable would they become . population would a usual continue to rise unless a major catastrophe occurs . cities would grow bigger witnessing a major problem of faster transport due to conjusted road . industries would have to service more number of people . thereby to increase efficiency , they would have to have a better transport facility . this is to ensure faster delivery of good . residential colony would be located in satellite town far away from the city to ensure better facility . therefore , car would be of a major concern . for time to come , i feel that with the current demand of industry and population , car would be used more than they are being used currently .
