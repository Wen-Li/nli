i am in favour of the argument that over the next twenty year the amount of car in use will be decreasing . even though large part of the world 's population will increase their mobility through economic growth , the negative impact of car will outweigh this natural growth potential . for example if china 's and india 's economic growth allows people to buy more car , government in both country will need to react quickly to avoid the adverse effect of increased individual mobility . firstly , ecologically it will not be possible to continue using a many car a today in the future . our environment is already suffering strongly from pollution caused by car . for example breathing and skin problem occur more often on people living in city centre location than on the country side . furthermore our cultural heritage is endangered by car pollution a exhaust is attacking architectural work . secondly , economically it is not intelligent to count on individualised transport mean . increasing congestion lead to large loss for an economy . a lot of people stuck in their car are not working and loose time to contribute to growth of gdp . first step to integrate the cost of this time loss have been taken in london and singapure by introducing a congestion charge in city centre . therefore , in future it will be more expensive to use car than to use public transport . thirdly , most car require petrol or oil for their engine . considering that the exploitable world oil reserve are not increasing anymore , oil will become more and more expensive , making car driving a luxury . furthermore a large amount of oil reserve are located in the middle east or in politically unstable country such a venezuela it is becoming increasingly dangerous for society to rely on oil a the engine of their transport mean . this is possibly the strongest argument to move to other tranport mean than car a we know them . in conclusion , the trend laid out above are providing enough information to suggest that there will be le car in use twenty year from now .
