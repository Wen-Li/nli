i disagree this statement that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide . i like to travel and i have joined a tour group led by a tour guide many time . but i think i could n't enjoy my travel . now i would like to support my opinion using my experience . first of all , i would like to make a travel plan myself . if i hired a tour guide or joined a tour group i could n't go any plany wherever i want . a tour guide would make our day schedule and we would move and sightsee strictly . i want to take my time to see and know a coulture and enjoy the country or city where i went . secondly , i would like to research myself . if i hired a tour guide it is easy and convinient to know the coulture where i travel . but i like to research myself about the country or city 's history and coulture . actually , i do n't remember that a tour guide tought me something once i hired a guide . that i researched myself is more memorizeble for me . finally , i do n't want to pay my money for guide and tour company . now i 'm a student and i do n't have enough money . and tour travel and hiring a guide is usually expensive for me . so if i would pay my money for a tour guide i want to use my money for food or sourvenior . in concludion , i like to travel individually . a tour company and a tour guide make our travel plan and do n't give me enogh free time to sightsee . and i have to pay expensive money . i want to travel myself and meet many people who live in where i travel . i like to know about my coulture and travel freely because i could get good experience and good memory and i 'll think i want to travel somewhere again .
