i strongly agree that advertisement make product seem better . one should not be suprised by that because that is the goal of advertisement . in short , adverstisements want the consumer to buy the product whether or not he ha a health benefit . what always come to mind is the advertisement for cigarette . in much of these adverstisements , you see either a beautiful woman or hansome man and immediately you want identify with them . therefore you want to imitate their act , i.e. smoke . the other point about cigarette advertisement is the `` element of freedom '' . most adverstisements show vast piece of land or sea to suggest somekind of escape or adventure but it actually an illusion . the other type of advertisement that i would like to talk about is child snack . on television the snack look very delicious and appetizing but in fact they have no nutritious value . advertisers use bright color , with catchy rythms to entice child to buy their product . when you look at the nutritional value of the product , you realised that it 's full of saturated fat or even trans fat . kids love it because it taste good . some parent may like it because it 's convenient to prepare it . the last point that i would like to make is commercial for car . everyday that you turn the television on , there is a new advertisement about a new car or the new model of an old car . you are constanly reminded to change you car even if you do n't have too . what most people seems to ignore is that car run on gasoline and we all know that car are the biggest emitter of carbon dioxide ( co2 ) . most car company advertisement will not promote the use of public transportation to cut the emission of carbon dioxide in order to save mother nature .
