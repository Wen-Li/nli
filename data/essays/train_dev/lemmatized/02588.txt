considering the statement that `` in twenty year there will be fewer car in use than there are today '' you definitly have to consider the aspect of money . to own a car and to drive it frequently is already quite expensive and people are always complaining about high petrol price , in addition to that it seems that they continue to increasing constantly . therefore it could be possible that some people think about using different way of transport instead of driving a car . however , in my opinion there will not be fewer car in use in twenty year than there are today . most of the people that will be allowed to drive car in 20 year are already living nowadays and they grow up with the comfort of having a car in nearly every familiy . i think if you get once used to car and all the comfort they provide you will not like to miss them . there is , for example , the independency that a car provides . if you decide to go somewhere , you do not have to look up the schedule of a bus or a train , you do not have to wait untill the tain leaf or search for a possibility how to get to the trainstation . if you have got a car you can just go outdoors take your key and get away . moreover the car is very practical if you want to get to a place without wasting lot of time . by car you can go more directly , because there are more street and road available than way for a train , and therefore it is possible to save time . to save time is one aspect that seems to be quit important in modern time . you can easily observe this if you count how often people mention the sentence `` time is money '' . in conclusion i would say that people will not give up their car the only aspect when car will probably be used le than nowadys is for long journey . i think therefore people will use flight more frequently .
