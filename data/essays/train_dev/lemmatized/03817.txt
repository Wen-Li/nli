i agree to the following statement , that ` most advertisement make product seem much better than they really are ' . many company produce good and market them to the field by marketing them or advertising them through t.v show , advertisement etc . any product in this world must meet the iso ( international standard organisation ) standard in their value and quality . one can know about the product by watching the advertisement or the hoarding available . the marketing producer maintains the ad in such a way that , any people can easily get impressed to that product and buy that . they show high standard in marketing them rather than in maintaining the quality . for example take a simple product like a baby milk powder , the current and present ad will be in such a way that , it show a if a baby can become super man by drinking it . no body need his/her child to become a superman , they only want the minimum health need for their baby to grow . the ad will only impress the child to get attracted to it . another example for this type is the production of bathing soap , the marketing member will make the ad for the bathing soap so impressively by keeping celebrity for that ad . so that all the young and youth girl become desperete towards the soap thinking that they are the celebrity . every one know that by using that soap an ordinary girl can not become an celebrity , every one know it , even the production people knew it . yet they are making it . am not saying that the advertisement are wrong , it there wish to make or not , my opinion is to maintian the standard in there product , a many people trust them by going through the ad . as huge amount have being placing for a product on their advertisement , they have to keep an equal and energetic intrest on their quality too .
