some people think that it 's better to have a broad knowledge of many and different academic subject than to specialize in one specific subject . both the opinion present several strengthens and weakenesses but i 'd rather agree with the former position . first of all , i think that broad knowledge is really important in the modern world . in the business world for example , you have to be able to talk both about business and about product . to talk about the former you have to know something about economics ; but if you have to talk about the latter you should probably know something about sociology and customer satisfaction . that 's what i thought when i had to decide what to do after the high school . on that occasion i decided to study engineering and among the different major i chose civil engineering because it did n't provide me with too much specialization . second , i also think that it 's very difficult to decide which particular subject to focus on . in this sense , it 's much better to study and cover many academic subject in order to be flexible . in fact , flexibility make you able to focus on different issue and on different subject during your life . that 's what ha happened to me . i am an engineer but i actually work for a famous economic consulting firm . everyday life asks me to focus on different problem in different field and that 's why i say that flexibility is an important value . in that sense , having a broad knoledge of different subject can help you to keep your mind open . considering all the thing stated above , i think that specialization doe n't consider the social evolution of the modern era . in fact , in today 's world , people must cover different field in order to reach success .
