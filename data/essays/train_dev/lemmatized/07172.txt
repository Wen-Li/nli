the statement that 's exposed on the left is an important point of the own life of every person . i think the that statement rappresents the two large kind of person in the world : the successful people and the normal people . as like a the statement , successful people try new thing and take risk . instead normal people only doing what they already know how to do well . i agree with the sentence . in my opinion trying new thing it 's the best way to grow your personality . however a different point of view to the same thing can open your mind , and open to you different way to resolve any problem . in 1492 cristoforo colombo went to america and come back . he wa a successful person becouse take risk in his adventure . since 1492 , the conseguences of his choice during still today and past the age . today his name is in the most popular history book around the world . the different between colombo and a normal person it 's in his choice , it 's in his point of view . to be a successful person we have to fallow the colombo 's choice in our own life . if we are going to do only the thing that we know how to do well we probably remain normal person . in my personal experience i can see the meaning of the statemet that i exposed before . the person who free it mind going to be a successful person . at school , but not at all , this concept is more understandably . a large part of student study on book and do n't practice what they have learned . the proffessor give to student a basic formation , that they can enlarge only trying new thing and new experience out of the school building . a successful student , like a successful person , ha to try some different experience in his life to the complete formation of himself and to become a successfuf
