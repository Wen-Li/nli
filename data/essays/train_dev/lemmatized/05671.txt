there are many type of teaching style in school . some teacher emphasize to understand idea and concept , but others emphasize just fact and result . both of teaching style might have adventages . however , i think the statement that unerstanding idea and concept is more important than learning fact . before we know a result , we have to know procedure , and we have to understand idea and concept to know procedure . in korea , they emphassize fact and result . we just learn how to approch the fact and result . we do n't know why some fact do that . we just know the fact . we just memorize the fact . for example , when i learned about multipling , i just memorize the fact a 2 multiply by 2 is 4 , 2 multiply by 3 is 6 . it also happened in high school because student in korea have to take a korean s.a.t for going to university . korean s.a.t question want to just fact . in contrast , in the united state , they emphasize to understand idea and concept . students in the united states learn mathmatics le than korean student , but they learn why the fact happens . it 's different . students in korea learn `` how '' , but students in the united states learn `` why '' . a friend of mine , for example , came to the united state when he wa a high school student . at that time , he wa good and high grade about mathmatics in his school in the united states because he previously learned in korea . however , when he went to a university , and he also studied mathmatics , he could n't very well rather another american studens because he did n't understand the idea and concept , also he did n't know procedure . it is not only mathmatics . so , i think that understanding idea and concept is more important and a kind of best learning skill .
