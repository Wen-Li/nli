a well known proverb say : `` life is all about risk '' .many people adopt this concept and build up thier life around risk and exciting thing . other prefer to do only what they already know how to do well . i personally think that successful people try nwe thing and take risk rather than only doing what they already know how to do well . taking risk in life allows people to make discovery . this help them build up their knowledge on some area that they were not even familiar with or enhance what they know about a subjet already . also by taking risk , you learn on your own and you mature quicly because you can critically thinking and solve problem from your own understanding . you also gain experience . for example i recall having the task to take care of my two brother when i wa just fiftheen . my parent have to go overseas for my father to received better medical treatment following a terrible accident . i have to think on my own and provide good care to my brother while my parent were gone . sometimes i did n't know exactly what to do yet i took risk and i believe it paid off . i know better than if my mother wa to give me lesson the difficulty that parent encounter in raising up child and most importantly how they feel when child do n't listen to them . in addition , taking risk help me progress intellectually because you need to focus on the strategy to use and the outcome expected . however , we need to learn from the mistake of other so that we do n't find ourselves in the same situation . hence sometime it 's not wise to take risk if we know we will probably harm ourselves . also we need to keep in mind that we are different and wo n't always succeknow our limit and how far we can go in any situation so that we avoid deception
