i think that broad knowledge of academic subject is ever a good thing for a student . at first because in this way he can know different aeras of the human knowledge and he can also decide to insight one of that subject that is not extremely similar to his effective academic pathway or even radically change his pathway at all . at second because only earlier in his life , a person ha the skill and brain resource for achieve a lot of information of every kind of subject , that may have utility in his future or simply serve to increase his culture and his knowledge in humanistic subject . in my opinion is important , for example , for a student that choosed a scientific pathway or study a lot of scientific subject , to cultivate any interest in humanistic subject like literature , philosophy , art etc. because in this way he can achieve a different point of view of the thing that sourrounding him and even of this life . i think that have a broad knowledege is important for personal formation even spirit formation but , at the same time i think that if anyone decide to specialize in one specific subject he can really excel in that subject and become a true expert of his favourite subject , so specializing is important for professional formation .
