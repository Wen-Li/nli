i disagree `` the best way to travel is in a group led bay a tour guide '' , because : i agree group travel can be good , because group work is addition of all of group people 's idea or a person that tarvel a lot , and find the place that you very need to travel . so group travel can find place that much pretty than person travel 's place . this few reson is good for group travel , but i still believe group travel is not better than person tarvel . i think , person travel mean only you to travel a place , so place is you want to traveled , not like group travel only can travel a group want . this reson is very important , because if you want to travel one place , that must be you want to travel so it can be fun . a example : if you to travel beijing in china , you do n't want to travel the great wall because you think great wall is n't pretty but you want to travel a small park in beijing , is fine to travel that park . because you want to travel small park in beijing , you agree your thinking not like group trave push you to travel some place . difference between group travel and personal travel , personal travel it is more personal , travel you like ; travel you need . but group travel is not personal anoymore , you need to care about another people at you group not just care about your-self and must travel group like and travel group need . it make disaggree any personal thinking . you can not dong where never you want any more . but for travel , personal thinking is important . also i believe , travel must be fun . i am not saying group travel should be unhappy , but i am saying group travel can be unhappy , maybe will become unhappy : because if group tour guide facing a problem that you even do n't think he need to facing , it can often make unhappy between you and your group tour guide . but if you are not sure about a place that you travel , group travel by a tour guide will be better a example : if you do n't know there is the great wall in bejing and you only know there is only one small park in beijing so group travel by a tour guide is much better . thanks for reading . this is my reason that the best way to travel maybe is not in a group led by a tour guide .
