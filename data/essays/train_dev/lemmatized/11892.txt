i agree with the statement that most advertisement make product seem much better than they really are . why i agree with the statement is because , when i watch tv , i can see a lot of advertisement for good thing , and when i see thing from advertisement at store , it doe no look quiet same a that of advertisement . i like to watch tv , so i often watch a lot of advertisement on tv . i have some experience that i wanted to get thing from that of advertisement . when i wa elementary school student , i saw an advertisement for a electoric staffed animal which can walk . then i really liked that staffed animal at a grance . it looked so cute and can be walked very well . since i really wanted to get that staffed animal , i asked my mother to get it for me . when i used the stuffed animal it did not walk like that of advertisement . i wa so sad . i think wy most adversisements make product seem much better than they really are i because , they want to convince a lot of people to but their product . even though they can get more money thanks to thier advertisement , they are not saying true . so i think it is not a good idia . also because of the advertisement that make product seem much better than they really are , they can lose custommers ' trust . it 's very bad for them . in addition to losing costomers 's trust , now i think a lot of people realized that most advertisement make product seem much better than they really are . if so , these advertisenents can be lost thier purpose of their advertisement . i think it is very important for most advertisement who make product seem much better than they really are to realize costommers ' mind , and make advertisement that can be trusted by a lot of costommers .
