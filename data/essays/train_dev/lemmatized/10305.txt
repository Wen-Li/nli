products that a company make must look in front of the customer unique and useful through advetisements . therefore i must agree with this statement : most advertisments make product seem much better than they really are . let u take a simple example , chocoate bar . i am sure that u have seen an advertisment for one . dont you notice the expression on the face of an actor who eats that chocolate bar ? if i ate that bar i dont think the expression on the face of the actor will come to my face simply from the taste of it . this example is only to clarify the exaguration in advertisement . if i own a company i would rather make my product look the best and most useful for the customer therefore other owner will also do the same exact thing . i am not encouraging the company to exceed reality but to use imagination instead of exaguration . since in nowdays advertisments take more time than our daily watched progarms , so i think the best way to attract to consumer is by entertaining advertiesments rather than fake one . i think that it is the owner right to show his product in the way they want and also it is the right of the customer to buy the product that suit him . in the monopaly of a bussiness however , the company could be punished to not clearly showing the reality of the product and in that case , instead of the company gainning profit it could close down . at the end i want to state a plain idea that i mentioned before which is to use creative advertisement rather than false one . and that i am in total agreement with this statment mentioned above .
