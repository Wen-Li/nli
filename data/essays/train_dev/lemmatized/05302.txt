i agree with the idea there will be le car in twenty year than now for four reason : oil price increase , the devolepment of more thecnology , the more project of city ' street than now , and the unsafty of car . maybe it is true that the price of car begin to decline , but that can not stop skip that car will be fewer in the future . the increase of oil price ha maken people feel dread about buying car . because sometimes you have to pay more money in oil than the price of your car . for example , my friend ha pay one thousend dollar in his car and after three month he evaluated the oil he put in his car and it wa five thosund dollar . technology have make the usage of car unesecary . for example , the microbus is cheaper than car , more saftely , and more comfortable . you can buy for example a ticket for train for only one cent . in japan , technology appered to be benefical for people than car and that because in the train 's gate there is a map show you where are the location you want by pressing on it . in twenty year , the city will grow gradually to the point that car used only in musems . because there will be more shop near from your house so you do not need a car for going to the shop you want . cars acciedents is li
