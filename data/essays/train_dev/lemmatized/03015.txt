the statement content that in twenty year the number of car in use will decline . i do not agree with the claim . according to me , the number of car will continue to increase thouh there might be a change in the technology which they use . as the population continues to grow , so are the need . and , car is emerging a a basic need of the world today . technological advance have made the dream of a common man , to own a personal car , true . the rate of the car have never been so low , and this sharp decline of price will continue a the technology progress . this would further encourage their sale in the near future , a more and more people will be able to afford one . in earlier time , car were meant only for the main member of the family , the earning head . while today , even child and other family member use car for their personal need . moreover , nowadays , the two-seater sedan are in vogue . this mean that if a family of four member use a single car today , they may go on to use two 2-seaters in future . futhermore , the other mode of conveyance like the bus or the three wheeler generally cause more pollution than that generated by the car . nowadays , car have been manufactured which use electricity or solar energy to run . the availibility of such car at affordable price will help , to some extent , check the , so called , never-ending pollution problem , and hence will be supported by the government of any nation . however , the increase in the number of car will accelerate the problem of traffic . thus , i strongly feel that in future , the number of car being used will continue to rise and so will the problem of traffic , but with a decline in the pollution .
