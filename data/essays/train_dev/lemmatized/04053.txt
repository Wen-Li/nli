advertisements are everywhere . on tv , in shopping mall and in the newspaper . and every brand and product seems to be the best in it category . but do the advertisors tell the truth or do they lie or exaggerate about their `` perfect '' product ? this is exactly what the given statement is about . i agree with the statement , that most advertisement make product seem much better than they really are . for example : laundry detergent . every brand claim to be the best product , to make your clothes look like new , to remove every single stain . they compete in comparing their product to each other . and their product is always better than the one of the concurrents . but in my belief this is not true . some advertisement say , that they don `` t bleach your clothes , that they still look like new after 30 wash circle . but no detergent can hold this statement . another example is shampoo . if you would trust the advertisement , every shampoo can make your hair shiny , strong and even not greasy anymore . but this is so untrue . shampoos often don `` t hold the consumer '' s expectation . my last example are cigarette . in advertisement cigarette seem to make you feel free , that they make you happy when you are sad . they even make you feel like in another world . but is this really true ? doesn `` t it have any disadvantage or even danger ? of course it doe ! only a few year ago no cigarette advertisement said , that cigarette affect your health and that they can cause cancer that sometimes end in death . today they warn their customer in advertisement and even on cigarette box , but it is usually written in a very little size and so often ignored or not seen by consumer . some consumer take these warning ironically . in conclusion , you always have to be aware that advertisors try to sell their product to earn a lot of money . that `` s why they sometimes exaggerate or even lie what their product are able to do . the and if so , it make you should be careful and you should buy different product to compare them to each other and to think about how they can harm yourself or others . only then , you will find out which product are the best for you or which product you shouldn `` t even buy because of their harm .
