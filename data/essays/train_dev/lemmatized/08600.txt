although it is hard to admit , i agree with the statement that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their community . i support it because even though i have many friend , i know nobody who is or ha been involved in activity in their community . there are , in my opinion , two main reason for this . one of the reason is because young people , especially student , are busy with their school work or afterschool activity . when i wa in highschool , i got up at 7am , studied until 3pm , then practiced tennis ( because i wa in tennis team ) until 6pm and got home at 7pm . this i did for 6 day per week , and had only sunday to rest . all i wanted to do that day wa stay home and relax , not be involved in activity for the community . the same can also be said about university student , most of whom study , be involved in activity , and work at the same time . there is , i think , just not enough time for young people to cast their attention to their community . that is one of the reason for their not helping their community . the other reason is because young people are just not interested in their community . their interest is in their friend , game , party , hobby : in other word , themselves . they lack the voluntary spirit or the will to cooperate and help the region they live in . when i wa in university , i had a lot of friend . they had high goal for their future , and studied a lot ; being serious , they were interested in economics and politics , reading lot of book too . but even they were not involved in any activity for helping their community . young people , being much more energetic and active than elder , should be participating in helping their community . but for the reason stated above , they are not . therefore , i support the statement that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their community .
