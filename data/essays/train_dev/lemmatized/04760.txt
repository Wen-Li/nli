in my opinion the best option is to have knowledge of many academic subject . it mean to belong general culture that could be used in a day-life time . it mean you can speak and keep a conversation on differrent variety of topic with a lot of people , even if some of them are not belonging to your class or to your culture or religion . even to find a position on the job market is easier because you are not connected to specific competence area . in example i can mention the profession of the doctor and the dentist 's one . both have kind of preparation about medical notion and acknowledge of the human anatomy , but the doctor can choose his specialization after the study . before , he gathered many information about all the subject of linked to the human body and then he will focus his choice to work in surgery , radiology , gynecology or any other department . dentist know from the very beginning what will be work on and their study are focused on specific subject regarding the mouth . and they will work a dentist , no other choice . you are tied up to the formation you have received . on other hand , having a specialized knowledge of one subject allows them to be much more professional in shorter time . and probably to reach the goal before the others . but in a world where every company ha the need to get different his production , probably they will require a feature of suitability in the mind of their employee . passing through a department to another one with different task requires an elastic mind and could help you to better understand the interconnected problem between the production area . to conclude i would like to support my opinion with a strange personal example . i am a n average player of many sport : tennis , volleyball , football , swimming and many oter else . i am not a pro in anyone of them but i can continuously choose friend to play with . never saying , sorry : i ca n't join you because i am not able .
