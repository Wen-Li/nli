in every field , school , work , social etc. there are some people more successful than other . the following statement say that these people like to take risk rather than only doing what they know how to do well . i agree with this statement . the successful people are always looking for improvement , they are always trying to do better because they do not always realize how good they are , they want to get challenge and to overcome difficulty . in the scientific field there are a lot of example of that particularity these people have . i will take the example of the radioactivity , marie curie and pierre curie were always trying to improve their discovery and they died because of searching continiously improvement . their body were full of radioactive element and they died because of that . science is a great exemple of how successful people want to improve everyday their knowledge . scientifics are always looking for better invention because they like to compete . sometimes , these people , are marginalized , and they do not have a lot of family or friend , so they focus on their work , that is why they are looking for improvement everytime . it is their way to make their life interesting . in work , successful people have to always de better because they have to prove their value in order to be promoted or not to be replaced by somebody more competent . everything is moving in life , there are always change , the human beeing is never satisfied by himself , wether he is successful or not . we are always trying to do , to create or to give something new in order to keep u from beeing bored by life . that is just the way thing are . the most dangerous thing is to get obssessed by discovery like scientifics who died in the past to test their own invention .
