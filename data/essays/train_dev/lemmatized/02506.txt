as a matter of fact , it is impossible to know everything on every subject . everyone ha to make choice . we can choose to know a little about many subject , to have an overview of each academic subject . or we can decide to become an expert in one specific area . in my opinion , becoming a specialist in one subject is a better issue because we will really understand the purpose of the subject and we will not obtain only a superficial knowledge . it is trust to say that when somebody doe n't know everything on a subject , he can arrive to the bad conclusion concerning a probleme . then , his knowledge is useless . what is the aim of knowing a little a everything ? this is n't usefull . for example , if we study a part of the french law , we ca n't solve any situation because a lot of element will miss u . we must know all the article refering to the problem , all the previous situation which look like the one we are studying . otherwise we are certain to make an error . by knowing major issue of many purpose , we can seem very bright for a while . but it is a superficial knowledge . somebody like that seems very interesting but in fact he ca n't assure a real conversation on any of the subject he pretend to know . all his knowledge is a superficial one . deciding to specialize in one specific subject is the best way to be really usefull and to obtain an advantage from our knowledge . learning little part of everything is a waste of energy . being a specialist is being professional , efficient and usefull .
