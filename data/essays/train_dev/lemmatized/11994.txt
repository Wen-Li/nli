young people have mesmerizing dream . old people solely long for sleeping . .. endlessly . everybody know that when you are young you have energy , aspiration , an entire life yet to come . unless you are very unlucky and the car which is crossing the street make bingo , instead . everybody know that when you are old , your body is exhausted , you can barely feel pleasure , your freinds are most of the time longly gone . thus , there is no good reason to avoid the same car and let it strike it bingo . for istance , my grandmather is now really old . she is a widow , her child despise her because of silly argument . in a few word , she feel lonley and sick . so , in her case , her being deaf and hardly walking just spice the thing up . on the contrary my granfather ( the one who passed away ) never had to go through all this . i am sure that wherever he is at the moment , that is in the most reasonable of case in a coffin six foot under , he is suffering much lesser than my grandma is doing . i am young and being old doe not scare me at all since it is a condition i totally refuse . i think i will just wind it up when i will realize that taking off is the most decent choice . unless . .. unless that moment never really come . because the truth could be that oldening is a slow process which is structured on a daily basis . therefore , the time you may finally realize your youth and it manifestation are far enough , you are probably also too old to get up from the wheel chair and make a move . when all is added , heroism when you are crusty old can be interpreted a cowardy , fear , or a pathetic attempt to escape responsabilities . you can purport to be young inside after all . but my question is : when you are not able to stand up , will you be able to stand up for your right at least .
