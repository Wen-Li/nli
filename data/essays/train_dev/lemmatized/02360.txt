to have broad knowledge of many academic subject is to learn many thing in different field of study . to specialize in one specific subject is to look at one thing from one point of view . in my opinion , it is better to have both of them a a part of your academical development , and they are both equally important . what truly happens in every person 's academical development is that this person go through different equally important stage . in the first stage of a child life , this child learns how to speak , and then he or she learns how to write . this is general information that everyone should start with in the begining of their academic life . then come school , whatever , or wherever this person get their education is all called school ; although , there are some difference that occur on the level of that education . in school , people are taught all the essential of life , and a broad knowledge of many academic subject , including different science , mathematics , art , music , and language . these are the foundation each and every one of u need in our life . as the school education come to an end , different people start to specialize in different subject of their interest . later on in life , we are approached by university ; by we , i am reffering to the people who are looking at pursuing further education . university is where we are supposed to narrow our choice down , and choose specific field of study . that is when it is proper for a person to specialize in one specific subject ; in other word , major in something they are attracted to . in the end they are going to have to live with what they choose for the rest of their life , and that is why they have to choose something they truly love . in conclusion , to have a broad knowledge on an academic subject , or to specialize in another are all equally important . you have to get a broad education first , and then narrow it down to what comfort you most . it is like , watching the rain fall , and then waiting for the rainbow to appear . from the first word a child learns at home to the last book this person read , each and every stage in that person life is important .
