some very successful people are the commonly known risk taker . for example , somebody who open a new business and try to run it by himself with his own idea , is more likely to be successful than an employee of a company who ha the same job throughout his entire life . but also it is more likely to be unsuccessful for an owner of an unexperienced company than for the employee , because success can never be guaranteed . the one , who try new thing can gain very important experience for his future life . there are people who quit their job to go abroad , to study a new language or to make an internship in an other field . this can be very advantageous when returning into the area where they worked before . it could also be unfortunate for others , when they do n't find an adequate job when returning home . others might say , `` why return back home , i could life on a high standart in the other country '' . this aquires a lot of time to adjust to the different condition they encounter in the new country and is a challenge . on the other hand , there are successful people who have never taken any risk to accomplish their goal . sometimes people have extraordinary skill that can help them to make a good career , like athlete or teacher . but still i think , however , that most of the successful people , if it is in their job or in a social aspect , have to be born with a special talent . they should be risky but they should also see where they have to get back to a more solid ground where it is not too likely to fail . with the statement i do agree , because i think that you never lose anything when you take a risk , even if you fail . you gained experience and you will never forget what your strength are and where you can go back . a successful person is somebody who ha done something out of his life without having to say , `` i have n't done all the possible thing .
