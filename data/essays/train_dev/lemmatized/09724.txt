nowadays it 's very important to have a good academic formation to get an interesting job and realize yourself , but this should be reached in two way : a broad knowledge and a specific knowledge . i 'm italian , so i 'm influenced by the italian typical school system based on a big knowledge of many subject . in fact when i wa at school i studied a lot of subject , including latin and ancient greek , and when i wa at the university i took twentyfive exames on different aspect of economics . i think that it 's important to have a broad knowledge of many subject because today when you work you need to be more flessible than before ; a lot of thing are changed and it 's quite different from the beginning of the twentieth century when ford teorized the `` work specialization '' . but , probably in some case it should be different ; for example an ingeneer need to know a lot of thing in a specific subject and he must specialize in a specific construction sector , and , i think , it 's similar for medicians . on the other hand , my preparation is general because i would become a manager , and it 's konw that a manager must be resolve a lot of different problem in different way , you may use your ability to find new solution to the problem . for example , if you have a problem selling a product because the market doe n't like it , you have two choises : the first is to retire the product from the market and second one , which is more creative , is to find a good marketing solution to make the product `` pulled '' by the market . in conclusion , i think that you must choos your formation depending on your interest and your future job .
