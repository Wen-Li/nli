in the following text i discus the question if in twenty year are fewer car in use than today . first of all you have to take into consideration the country you are talking about , because i am sure it is too difficult to discus the development of car sale for all over the world . in my case , i am going to talk about the amount of car in germany . as far a i know , germany is already one of the country that ha a very high rate of car user . that is why it becomes harder to sell more and more car . moreover it is important to know that car are not cheap at all . thus , the wealth of a country influence the car sale a well . in germany there is one more factor . the green are an important power in the german government . that can be explained by the wish of minimizing the pollution . people do not want to see their child growing up in a world full of car which pollute the air . on the other hand scientist always try to improve the quality of car and it is possible , that they will invent a car which will not pollute our environment anymore . so i am sure , such a car would lead to more car in twenty year . one huge disadvantage of car is the trouble on the street . in my opinion it is horrible to cross a bigger city like berlin or london by car . it usuallz take several hour and even if you have been in a good mood , you will be in a very bad mood after the third traffic jam . compared to car it is so much more comfortable to take the underground in a big city . more and more young people want to live in the city and they grew up with idea of how to avoid pollution and that is why i think in twenty year will be fewer car in use than there are today .
