first of all allow me to say that i totally agree with the idea that it is much more important for student to understand idea than to learn fact . the importance of understanding underlying idea instead of only learning mere fact can be summarized by saying that a student that ha learnt by heart a lot of fact can be defined for sure a a student with a lot of notion but at the same extent can surely find him or herself in a lot of problem when trying to apply the fact they know in order to understand different situation . let ' think of history a an example . if it is true that on one side it is certain that a student must learn a series of fact that have determined the historical event of a certain age , on the otherone it is equally certain that a student that doe not understand all the driver and all the underlying cause that driven those fact will never be able to really understand what ha happened thus impeeding himself or herself to avoid same mistake made by former generation and to replicate the succesful idea applied to differnt context . obviously this is just an example but basically all subject can be used a example in order to sustain the importance of understanding more than learing by heart . take math a a last example . if a student learns by heart a math rule without understanding the general sense of it , he or her will only be able to apply the memorized rule if it present itself in the exact same form of the rule studied by heart . well this is simply impossible in math since a particular rule ha to be applied to a potentially infinite variety of possible occasion . as i wa saying , since learing by heart something infinite is impossible , understanding is the only possible solution for a student . these are only two example , but the same concept applies to basically all the subject that student approach during their accademic year , thus understanding is fundamental whilst learing fact is a waist of time .
