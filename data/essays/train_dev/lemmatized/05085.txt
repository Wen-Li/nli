on one hand , many people feel that the advertisement create an awareness about the product and product 's feature , while on the other hand many people feel that the advertisement make product seem much better than they really are . i also agree that the advertisement make product seem much better than they really are . due to increased competion in this world , all the producer of a particular product want to make a claim that their product is the best . for example , in the cola market , both pepsi and coke claim that their product is the best and contains all the feature to make a person happy . while advertising their own product they also go ahead to criticise the other product . but the choice of each person varies for a particular kind of product , so i feel that the claim that their product is the best , is over advertisement . another example i would like to mention here is about the soap product . many soap producer show in their advertisement that due to the usage of their product , a person is looking very young and it is very difficult to guess that person 's age etc . while making this claim they totally ignore other factor that contributes to this appearance . a person can not look young by just using a particular soap . to look young , the person ha to eat nutritious food , should exercise regularly and should not have much tension . it may depends on lot of other factor too . but these advertisement totally ignore all these factor . so i feel that the advertisement make product seem much better than they really are due to increased competiton and desire to succeed in the market . due to this competion , while advertising the advertiser ignores lot of other factor which contributes to the desired result in the audience .
