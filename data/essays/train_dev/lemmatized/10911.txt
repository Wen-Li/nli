i do n't completely agree with the statement for different reason . of course it is important for student to understand concept , and not only to understand them , but also to keep them clearly in mind and make them be a huge part of their knowledge . but on the other hand , i also think that learning fact ha it importance : in fact , most of the time a student is not even able to understand a concept throughfully if he doesn ' t know anything real related to that idea . i mean , it is important to have a knowledge of what had happened in history , it is part of one 's culture and will be useful in one 's private and working life , i think . knowing idea and concept in astract ha it relevance , of course , but is not enough : usually you ca n't understand the thinking of important people and philosopher of the past , if you do n't have any idea about the period they lived in or the fact that occurred in their life . i reckon that student have to learn fact , even if it is boring : most of the time teacher are aware that student are not really interested in them , and that they would rather being thaught something more exciting . nevertheless , student understand how important it is for them to learn fact when they grow up , because they will know what to say in every situation and to every kind of people they will speak to . with my statement , i 'm not trying to say that understand idea and concept is n't important : not at all ! i am only saying that both way should be used with student because they have quite the same importance , in different way . it also depends on the kind of student a teacher is teaching to : maybe someone prefers one way while another prefers the other one : they are both good way of learning , i guess , and should both be used to build one 's mind .
