i think that advertisement make product seem much better than they really are because that is the way that the buyer can show interest in the product and ask more about it . nevertheles , it is a dangerous form of publicity because some thing that are saying about the product are not true . i think that the advertisement that more use this kind of `` lie '' is the telemarketing when they show a lot of people saying that one product or another is the best that are in the market , and the problem with these product is that we ca n't see it or touch it before we buy it . so we take a risk buying a product that we really do n't know . althougt the advertisement for other product that we can see and touch are more realistic , some time show better thing that they really have . publicity is the best way for a company to show it product , but the buyer believe more in a company when they are telling always the truth and when the show a product with it real characteristic , and for a company the loyalty that show their client is the most important thing . some time , it is not that the advertisement seem much better than they really are but is the customer who think that the product is better that it really is .
