i agree to the statement that student must understand the idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact . the reason for this is an incident occured in my life , i prefer tell my experince about this statement . when i wa doing a project i used to sit wit my project team consisting about 10 member where each one give there own idea which come to their mind , when i wa in the team i should understand the idea given by the person so that i could implement the idea to get the good result . in the same way when a person is working in the group he should respect the idea of others by listening and understanding them . one of my friend work in the it company a a designer of the website . when he is doing that he get many doubt about that page which he is designing then he askes his partner to give him some suggesstion and to share some good consepts relating that design . when the partner give the concept it is the duety to understand by the one who is ready to implement . otherwise there is no use of taking concept or idea from other . .. in the same way when a perticular person get any idea in his mind the next job he doe his understands the later part of the idea . based on these example that i have given i could fairly agree that it is more important for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact . learning fact is obviously done by any one who experinces the incident that he could remember very fairly . according to me when ur around some people you should get to understand what they are talking about and understand their idea and view produced by them . finally i would say that i do agree about the statement reguarding the issue given .
