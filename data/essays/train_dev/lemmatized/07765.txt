there are good thing and a few not very good thing to travel in a group led by a tour guide . .. the good thing is that you will get to meet a lot of people and you can also have friend and family in the group will have a person who will be your guide during the tour and know perfectly the place that you are going to visit and will give you an explanation of every place you visit during the tour and this guide will also answer all detailed question of the place ; i assume that if this person is a turist guide he should have study very well about the place the we would visit . .. you will get to meet a lot of people in the group maybe become friend . . you could not get lost with i guide becouse of what i mentioned before he ha studied the place and know the place very well . . that is why he is a tour guide . he will give you advice in where you can shop , where not to go , wich place are better than others , very good restaurant , and maybe make a party for his group ! the not very good reason about traveling in a group and led by a tour guide is that you have to stick with the group and follow them to all the place and you can not wonder around to get to know the place you want to go and wake up late , have a very comfty vacation . . if you travel alone you can always get all the information you want and map about the place you want to visit . you can make your own tour and be your own guide . and you can always find the better place to be . . you can allways check feedback on hotel , restaurant , shop , car rental etc .
