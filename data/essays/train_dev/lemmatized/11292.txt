in this article i will discus the advantage and the drawback of having broad knowledge of many academic subject with respect to specializing in one specific subject . i think that both of them are required today for a successeful career . the rest of this work is organized a follows . firstly , i will analyse the main issue about studying many subject . then i will focus on the problem related to specialization . if you decide to study many subject , you will be prepared for a wide range of job . however there are also some drawback . first of all it is hard to follow too many academic course on completely different topic . moreover some job required an high level of specialization and in this case it is better to have little and good knowledge that many and poor skill . instead if you are specialized in one specific subject , you could find a well paid job because few people have a background focused on one particular field . on the other hand , if your highly specialized skill are not needed by the market , it will be very challenging to find a new job and you will have to start studying again . this time , however , you will probably choose something more general . this prospective could be awful if it happens when you are too old and have a family . in conclusion i think the best solution is something between the two choice . one should have broad knowledge of a general field but also should be specialized in a particular subject of this field .
