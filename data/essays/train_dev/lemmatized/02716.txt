young people are usually the subject of criticism . older generation tend to criticize the younger people mainly for the cultural difference created over the course of time . for instance , it is not difficult to hear complaint by older people that younger people these day are le polite and that young people are blamed for destroying the right usage of word and instead , creating slang . however , these are problem simply created from discrepencies between generation . the statement that young people nowadays do not give enough time to help their community also is one of these unjustified criticism or simple misunderstanding . for various reason , whether it is from warm-hearted sympathy or simply for college admission , young people nowadays actually spend more time in social service . they also tend to participate more a a community member due to increase opportunity for them . in the generation of grandmother or even father , there have not been such vigorous demand for good education . as the generation moved on the the information age , better education is highly preferred against primitive education . the general trend of the united states is moving toward marrying men with college degree ; a recent study showed that those without graduation certificate are having much more difficulty in marriage . due to this increasing demand of higher education , young people these day are preparing to receive better education in more famous college . the college insist that student should demonstrate not only academic ability but also their participation in community and social service . in fact , i have seen some student in my high school with more than 300 hour of community work . when i went to a camp , i met a girl who wa awarded for doing 1000 hour of community service . although there is another hidden purpose of getting advantage in admission to better college , a a whole , these young people are helping their community more . in addition , it is important that the definition of helping the community is not limited to mere social service . helping the community might mean serving a a part of a club , or even attending certain institution . compared to the past , there are many more opportunity for young people to be involved a a member of their community ; for instance , there is well-known club called interact club that help the society through activity like fund-raising or car wash . attending institution such a library or working a internship in local hospital , in the long run , produce much more educated and experienced people , which is beneficial and helpful to the community around them . it is true that there are several traditioned ruined due to the rapid rise of young generation ; yet , it is not right to criticize the young people blindedly . though it may not be from the warm-hearted sympathy , younger people tend to participate more in community service for the admission and are more of direct part of the society due to increased opportunity . with increased propaganda or campaign on television that people who are warm-hearted and know how to appreciate the community around them are more preferred over cold-hearted selfish people , there is no doubt that the number of people helping their community will increase even more in the future .
