the tecnology change and effect our life very quickly and very effectively . sometimes the change are so good and sometimes they are not . the tecnology invents lot of thing that we never imagine before we saw them . in twenty year , i think , many change will occur . maybe we are gonna travel by plane to everywhere or our car will be able to fly also ; who know ? .. i can not say this can not be happen but i do not think this will be happen . i do not agree with this statement . because most of the people prefer to use car than any other transport . cars are the most common transport , i think . because almost everyone ha an one , even , in a family every person ha theirs own car . i do not think lot of year later this common transport is not gonna using . and also there are plenty of car race . most of the people like this racing and they want to drive a car like them , too . for instance if you are driver in formula 1 or another organization like this you can not give up car because you are really addicted to car like a medical substance or medicine . the life is for you the car . moreover these vehicle are very usefull and economics than the others . for instance the plane ticket are very expensive so you can not travel by a plane if you can not afford this . and also if you want take your car with you can do this . but you can not take a yacth or something else like that . in conclusion , car are very usefull for our life and so economic to affords theirs ' need too .
