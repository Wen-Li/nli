in general i agree with this statement , although i think it doe n't make sense to suggest an exclusive choice . of course a student ha to do both , understand idea a well a learn fact . i think it ha got to do a lot with difference between culture . my education wa definitly focused on understanding concept . but i know for example from korea that student have to learn much more by heart . i will try to explane what i mean on an example from the field of music . in india it is common for tabla-players to learn many composition by heart . although there exists a system for musical notation it ha no relevance . everything is learned by heart from mere listenening . on the other hand you have the european tradition of staff notation and musical score . it is not necessary to learn everything by heart because it can be looked up at every time . this fact is connected with a different attitude towards tradition . while in india it is more common to emphasize the continuity of a certain school or family tradition ( called gharana ) in europe more attention is paied on what is new or what seems to be new . of course both musical tradition develop and change in the course of time , but their way to new way of expression is a different one . in india a tabla player ( who is a compser a well a a musician ) first learns many fact ( composition ) , and then , after a long time of practising and trying to adapt the tradition he might introduce new feature and invent his own composition . in europe many composer ( who are not necesserily performing musician ) started to compose at a very young age . before they had the chance to learn the history of music they already begin to understand some idea and concept and with the help of these develope composition a object . to summarize i would like to say that it depends on the cultural environment what importance ha to be given to the understanding of idea or to the learning of fact .
