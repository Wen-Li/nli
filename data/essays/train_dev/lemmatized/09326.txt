i agree with the statement that young people enjoy life more than the older people do . this is like this . lot of youngr people are very enthusiastic about their young life to explore the new thing so a to enjoy up to the maximum extent where a the older people who have experinced almost all the thing in their life tend to relax in their older age . now , young people who are new to the world with new intention like to spend their time in enjoying the life a much a possible like doing many thing , such a going to the theater to watch film and pub every weekend to have fun , can play a lot of game together and even participate in high level tournament , can have sex , can enjoy their university life a a student and many . many of these thing can also be enjoyed by the older people even but they are bored of doing them a they did a lot in their young life . playing sport must need a lot of strength and energy which older people lack . having a lot of party with friend in young life is the other important thing to be considered which the older people may find it difficult to do a often a young people do and they also think that thay are a waste of money . to some extent even older people who are still interested will enjoy attending the party and pub . one more important thing is the student life , which will not be repeated again . students enjoy a lot in the university in many aspect such a sport , research and even in some other co-curricular activity . older people can not definately do that again , but can enjoy a a professor which is quite different from the student life . students can experience the newer generatiions of life that ha been changing gradually and they increase their expectation that suit the newer generation . as the younger people having more expectation on life and more resource than the older people had , i can strongly conclude that young people will definately enjoy more than the older people do .
