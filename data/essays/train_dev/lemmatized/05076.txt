i do agree that advertisement make product seem much better than they really are and with good purpose . the main focus of advertisement is to make it seem that the product is the best thing in the world , that it is completely necessary and the most important of all , to sell the product to make profit which equal money . a good example of these reason are : diet pill campaings and ad on television . they make ordinarily difficult goal to obtain , obtainable making it seem easy , fast and without breaking a sweat . first of all , they target the one thing human are concerned about : their psychical beauty specifically lossing , gaining weight or being healthy . todays men and woman understand the importance of having a healthy body and being in shape for different reason these being : health related issue such a heart disease , diabetes , morbid obesity , etc . .. and other more psychical reason are : the stereotype of being pretty and skinny in a judgemental society that trives on superficial beauty . healthy body and weight loss come from : healthy eating habit , exercise and well organized planning . diet pill advertisement make it seem a if you could skip all of these step and still achieve your goal of a healthy shape and body , which in irony is not healthy or recommended by doctor because the risk are endless . still people buy these product because they want to be the lovely young lady with the tight body or men want to be that guy with the washboard ab to feel good psychically and mentally . to understand how this operates we must look for the obvious reason of why the product would seem much better . first of all , the image of expressing the easily unobtainable a obtainable is key in selling the product and therefore making more money and secondly when watching a television ad look for the little black paragraph in which the truth about the product is stated and they do n't want you to know quickly . this is n't a new practice every product will seem the best to make a profit out of it , but it is up to u to be educated and be informed about the product we hear or read about to make a wise decision when purchasing it .
