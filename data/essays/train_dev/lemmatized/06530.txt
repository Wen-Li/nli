i am agree the most advertisement make product seem much better than they really are . the people always make the product seem much better then they really are . first , they always use the entertainment to show to the constumas . they will use a lot of way to show to the people how good they are , and how usefull they are . secondly , when the people have make the product are not use the origanal of the item 's use way to do , they have think a lot of the now function to make the people have to buy that . for example for the eye content . the eye content maker are not make the eye content for the people what they really need the eye content . althought , they make the eye content have a lot of the color , and then given to the people want their eye change color and more petty . in my remenber , one day i had to go to buy the eye content . and then the saler had to ask me , `` are you looking for the eye content , we have some new arrivde . they have new function , they can make your eye change the color . '' and she had say a lot of that product how good they are . the saler a like the eye content wa she made . and i answer to her , `` oh really , i want to try that . '' so , i had to bougth that color eye content . and then , i had try that color eye content about two week . i feel my eye really pain , and my friend always my eye are vary red . so , i have went to check my eye . and the doctor say , '' you have abslutely stop to use the color eye content , if you continus to use that , it will make your eye bliend . that color eye content are not vary good for your eye . '' so , i have stop to use that eye content . in my expericent and opinin , i have really agree most advertisement make product seem much better than they really are . the saler ha say how good is the eye content , but te eye content are not really good a what wa the saler say . and the eye content are not really can change your eye color .
