i strongly aggree with the statement that yong people enjoy life more than older people do . i think yong people have le resposiblities than older people . older people have to earn money and take care of their family . for this reason , old people abandon their time and life for their family . otherwise , yong people doe not have such a responsibility . they spend most of time for their own life . in my case , i spend my time on playing game and sport , doing habbies or watching movie . however , my parent can not enjoy what they want to do . they work every day to support u . therefore , i think that enjoing life depend on the haviness of responsibility . for other reason , yong people are more energetic than old people . even if someone really enjoy playing harsh sport but is not energetic enough , he can not do those sport . in my experiment , even when my family go vacation to mountain , valley or beach , my parent can not play longer . they exhaust faster than i do . thus , i agree with that statment . furthermore , yong people are more opened at many entertainment system than old people . as time passing , many entertainment system that did not exist in past ha developed . so yong people have more chance and more choice to enjoy their life . in these reason , i gree with the statemnet that yong people enjoy life more than older people do .
