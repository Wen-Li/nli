the population of the world are growth day by day . according to this , the need of the people change . i think , there will be fewer car in use than there are today if people make the good decision in twenty year . in nowadays , the count of the car are increase and most of the people use their own car to go somewhere . by using their own car , they lose lot of time . except using their own car , i think they will try to find new way to reach somewhere quickly . for example , in a long vacation , people will start to use plane instead of car . because travelling by plane cause them to gain time . nowadays , in our country we can see the example of that . most of the people preferred to go vacation with their personal car . but when the plane company make the ticket cheaper and give the people opportunity to use plane , people begin to use plane instead of car . other reason why the car number will be fewer is the traffic . the traffic problem get bigger and bigger each day . this problem make people nervous and it take much more time to reach a place than it can take . they should try to find alternative way to go somewhere to reduce the traffic jam . the other important reason is reduction in amount of petrolium . we know that petrolium is very valuable and the amount of that decrease day by day . after a some time , petrolium will be find difficultly . in this time , people will use car which work with different product or they will try to use their car le . for people , using their own car much more comfortable . but condition make the car unneccessary . to gain time , to reduce traffic jam and to protect the recources people should find a new way to travel .
