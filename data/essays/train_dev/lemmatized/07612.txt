in my opinion it is better to have knowledge of one specific subject extensively , rather than having some knowledge in all the field . there are a few reason namely - accuracy , danger of half knowledge and specialization is only after some general knowledge - that i venture to opine in favour of specialization . firstly if a person is more widely knowledgable in the field of his own interest , he not only performs well but also is able to put in his own effort in the form of information to be used more accurately . for example a doctor , if he is specialized in heart and it related aspect he is capable of helping a patient more efficiently than a general physician would . secondly like i said danger of half knowledge are not unknown to u . if we have not mastered even one subject we can not put in any effort to get something out of our knowledge . we do not have a sense of direction in which to proceed also we have to stop in the middle of an invention or discovery because we do not know what lie ahead . this can also be decisive for the growth of a society on the whole . finally for any specialization to happen on any subject we start with a knowledge of various feilds related or unrelated which might help in the better understanding our field of interest so the knowledge of all academic subject is in a way the foundation stone of any specializaion and is therefore a part of the learning process . like i stated if it is a cardiologist in question then he would have some knowledge of the whole body functioning a that is evidently related . thus i can safely say that specialization not only help in developing our skill in our own field of interest , it also is the destination for some knowledge that we acquire in all the subject . eventually helping u to mature a an individual , a an adroit in our field and in the growth of society on the whole .
