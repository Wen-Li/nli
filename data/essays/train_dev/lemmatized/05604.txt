i would like to start by stating that i fully agree with the statement that `` most advertisement make product seem much better that they really are . '' i will present three argument that support my opinion . firstly i would like to explain that a good advertisement always ha the best picture taken of the item marketed . for example , when you go to the fast food restaurant you usally rely on picture to decide what you are going to eat . the nice picture tempt your appetite and make you salivate . but when you actully receive the end product , like a macdonald 's hamburger , it never look a nicely constructed a the picture showed it would be . a nice picture can speek a million word . my second argument is that most advertisement are performed by very good looking individual or endorsed by someone famous . to utilize such powerfull individual will influence what you think of the item advertized . for example , if jessica simpson say that the leading acnee medication is proactive and that she us it herself , then it must mean that it is an exeptional product because she is very rich and famous and can decide to use any product she want . we trust the people we look up to or wish we could be . my last argument is that a good advertisment and brilliant marketing will undoubtebly bias our own personal experience . who can actually tell which product is a brand name if it ha no label on it . if i were to blindfold you and have you taste 10 different macaroni and cheese could you pick out which one is the real kraft dinner ? an advertisement is very brilliantly constructed to attract consumer . i truly believe that we are all influenced , at some level , by cleaver advertisement and that we can all admit that we have been suckered into the latest gimmic at some point . we might not admit it to others though !
