will some time i do some time i dont . and it depends on where is the persones from . 1 : the young people : the young people can do alot of sport with out giting taird . they can do alot of thing drive car anything . will where iam from being young is more fun than being old . u can do what evre u want u go to the beach aftter go to partes drive cool car like bmw , lambergene , porch , corvat and more so here alot of the young people enjoy life more than the old people . 2 : the old people : will the old people like from age 40-50 have nice car like : bently , rr , maybach and more ... some of them do some sport go out have alot of money and thing but from age 60 and so on they just sit in the house watch tv or do something in the house if he want to go some where it will be to his frinds place or go to a restront or something so it boring . also where iam from the dad do evre thing to there son like let them get married buy them car evre thing and the son is like between 20-25 year old so he is so young and have so many good thing . the point iam trying to say is that the young people have much more fun than the older people where i come from . but let say another country for example ( london ) : there i see the old people have more fun than the young one not all but in genral u dont see a young one with a cool car like a bmw or so and u dont see a young one in a fanse restrant u only see old people going to fanse restrants , cool car , and thing so i say in a contry like that the old people have more fun than the young one .
