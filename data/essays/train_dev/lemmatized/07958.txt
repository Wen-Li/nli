nowadays while some people like to travel in a group led by a tour guide , others like to travel alone . both of them have their own advantage and disadvantage . in my experience , i agree with the idea that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tuor guide for several reason . first , traveling in a group led by a tour guide can help me manage my time efficiently . a guide may know well the famous site and place which visitor want to go and he can let me know about that within a short time . for example , when i traveled in florida a few year ago , at that time i did not know where to go and what to do . howeve , my aunt introduced her friend who had a guide job . she kindly offered me riding and comforable place to relax a well a let me know the most famous place such a disney world or sea world . thanks to her , i did save my time of sightseeing and spend my free time efficiently . second , traveling in a group led by a tour is more enjoyable than traveling alone for me . in a group , there are many people from different local or country . with these people , i can share a lot of valuable nformation and can listen to their unique experience . it is a kind of interesting experience for my life . when i wa a college student , i travel in canada . in a group , i made some friend there , and still we keep in contact through email . last , traveling in a group led by a tour guide can enable me to save money . he can tell me about information about the new country such a how to spend money properly . if i do not know the local living style , i might spend more money than i would expect . to conclude , traveling alone or traveling in a group led by a tour guide have both benifits and drawback . however , i agree that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide since it can help me make a plan more efficiently and save money and it is more exciting for me .
