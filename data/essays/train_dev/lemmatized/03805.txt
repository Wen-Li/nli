the question wheather it is generally really better to have a broad knowledge of many academic subject than to specialize in one specific subject is not easy to answer since it depends highly on the context . undergraduate study course should indeed offer the student a variety of subject so they gain a broad knowledge of different area . then , this knowledge can function a a basis to specialize in postgraduate study . i consider both the gain of broad knowledge a a first step and the specialization in one subject a a second step to be very important for the following reason : on the one hand , due to technical invention , among others the improved communication mean , contemporary knowledge is growing faster than ever before in the past . no human is able to learn everything that ha been discovered by scientist so far . in conclusion , the attempt to gain a deeper knowledge in each academic area must fail . one can only gain a deep knowledge in very limited subject . therefore , specialization is necessary since science need researcher who are expert in the area they are working . on the other hand , for the same reason that the world is much more connected than it used to be , there is also the need for every student to have a basic knowledge of other area than the one he is specializing in for different science are more connected and work together more often than in the past . in conclusion , basic broad knowledge is necessary a a basis to specialize in one certain area .
