peresonally , i disagree with the statement that young people engjoy life more than older people do . of course , it is not true to say that young people do not enjoy life . they engoy life . for instance , they play some sport or study various thing and so on . but , generally speaking , old people can do same thing , too . therefore we can not say that young people enjoy life more than older peple do . i think older pepole can enjoy life more . there are two reason . first of all , they do the thing that young people ara not able to do easily . for example , they can do luxuary thing such a clusing or traveling all over the world , because they are more rich than yonger people . second of all , they know the way to enjoy more than young peple . older people have much experiense than yonger people and they have more favorite thing . for example , my grandmother take part in various activity such a flower arrangement and playing tenis . that mean they can enjoy life in various way . in conclusion , i think older people enjoy life more than young people , because of their money and experiense .
