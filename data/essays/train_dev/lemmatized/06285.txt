i 'm agree with the following statement : most advertisement make product seem much better then they really are . we can separe two kind of advertisement : those direct to product , and those direct to person . there are many possibility to increase the apparence of anything or anyone . teelling about the advertisement that make product much better than they really are , we can give a lot of example : colorants in food , pesticide in vegetable or fruit , etc . many people think that a beautiful product is better than a unlikely product . it is n't true . in fact the produce use the advertisement for sell a product than can not be sell for it apparence ; but this not mean that the produtc is good . there is an other type of advertisement . nowadays , in fact , it is widesprerad the use of the chilurgie plastic for seem much beatiful or young whose the person really is . other way for seem better is the cosmetic . each way , however , change the really apperence of the people and bring other people than are le beautiful to feells bad .
