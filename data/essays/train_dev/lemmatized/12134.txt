i have a very close example in my family that it is important to try new thing and to take risk . in fact my father ha adopted this rule , and he is a succcessful man . but i think that you can try great challenge when you are able to manage all your skill , so to do well some thing is necessary to be successful but not enough . moreover i think that to do new thing in every situation in our life is an exciting way of life . in fact this approach allows to open the mind and to think with a wide vision . therefore travelling a lot , meeting new people and frequently changing the job is a way to improve ourseves . in fact it is possible to enhance our skill and to solve better every new problem . on the other hand taking risk is an art and a personal skill , but it is essential to become successful . in fact doing a challenging thing and being everey time under pressure probably can extract our best and compete with greater force . i thing that an intresting example of `` taking risk '' is napoleon , who wa the greater general of history . he wa able every time to choice the winning way , which wa a non conventional strategy , which presented many risk but also the possibility to gain a great success . he wa also able to communicate this approach to his army , so to transform the success of one man , to the success of an entire country . in conclusion i think that an aggressive and competitive approach is the best solution to try to reach success , even if it is also necessary to have some luck . for these reason , hoping to become a successful man , i 'll use this set of suggestion also on my normal life , both on work and during social realtionships . in fact i like competition and taking reasonable risk and i want to learn and do new thing every moment .
