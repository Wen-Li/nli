i do not agree with this statement because i think that it is more useful to know only a few subject deeply than many in a superficial way . i think that everyone , especially student who go to the university , should have a general cultural knowledge but this is something that go beyond the accademical role . in my opinion it doe not make any sense to attend a class about a course you are not interested in or that doe not have anything to do with what you really want to study for your future job . unfortunately , i personally experienced something similar during the past three year because when i started university i did not know what i wa going to study precisely and a i wanted to graduate in language and litterature i thought , a most of the other people in my class , that i wa not going to study anything else except from economics in which i wanted to specialise . could you immagine my delusion when i found out i had to study many useless subject ? why did i have to study thing like philosophy or history when i knew i wa not going to use it in my future ? in my opinion the decision of student to go to university is something very individual and it ha to be respected , from the governament a the educational institutions . i believe that it is up to the secondary school the responsability of teaching the general subject and when a student go to the university this must be taken for granted . finally if you really want to be strong in your future job and you really want to do it in the best way you can , you have to focus on it and learn a much a you can about the subject related to it . why should a future manager want to know something about
