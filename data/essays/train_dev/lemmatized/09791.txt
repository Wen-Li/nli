i disagree with this statement . i am only a high school student so i 'm not really sure about how elderly feel . but i 'll state three reason which i 'm sure about it . they are ; we are all same human being , generation really doe n't matter , all people feel joy at differnt time . first reason why i disagree is because , we are all same human being . it 's true that elderly a our grandparent had lived in a difficult time such a the world war . eventhough i believe that they also had an enjoyable young age . for me , everything wa fun when i wa a little girl . watching at a line of ant were even enjoyable . therefor i 'm not sure how our thought will change through when we get older but , i 'm still sure that we wo n't forget presious memory . second reason is because , looking at my grandmother make me feel the age doe n't matter to enjoy the event . she like to go watching movie with friend and after coming back she always talk to me how the movie were and what she did with her friend , with twinkling eye . from these experience i 'm sure that she is enjoying her life a an elderly . last reason is because , i think that all people ha different thought and feeling of the word enjoyment . i feel most of the thing which i felt happy enjoyable . even on the train watching other people sometimes mkes me enjoyable . talking with friend , family and eldarly who i just met in the street is also enjoyable time for me . as a result i think feeling their life enjoyable or not doe n't depend on the generation . it will be different by how people think the event on their usual life .
