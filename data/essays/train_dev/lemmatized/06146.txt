there are several good reason why i believe that is better for student to have a broad knowlegde of many academic subject than to specialize in one specific subject . first of all , i think that nowadays , work problem are very difficult to resolve and involve a lot of skill like computer knowledge or to know a different language . currently , company need people to overcome this sort of integrated problem , and the person ha to have a broad knowledge . secondly , if student have more skill or ability , they will have more likelihood to find a job . therefore , if they become borried in their work , they can apply to others job because people with a broader knowledge can do more thing than the others . although it is true that some people say that company pay more to people who know how to resolve a specific task , i think that is better for a person earn le money but with a lot of likelihood to get a job , than a person who can earn a lot of money , but working in a only one type of job . world market today are very difficult , people are hired currently and consecuently they have to look for a job more than ever , for this reason i believe that is better for a person to ha a broad knowledge . i can support my opinion with a personal experience that i lived five year ago . i wa working in cnn a a journalist , and suddenly i heard that the company board needed someone to work in trade area . after a brief hiring process , i got the position only because i had studied a finance course in university . in my opinion , i think that have a broad knowledge of many academic subject is better than specialize in one specific one , because a person have more posibilities to get a job , to resolve better the work problem and thirdly , because encourage his knoledge .
