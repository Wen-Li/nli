yes , i agree with the statement `` it more important to understand idea and concept than for them to learn fact . '' i feel it very important for u to understand an idea than simply knowing it . if you are good at understanding idea and concept then you can make yourself think of the fact pertained to it . an idea when brought into implementation , then it can be known about the good and bad associated with it , there bymaking u to think about the fact related to it . i feel the sequence related to this idea concept is , firstly generation of an idea is important and is folowed by it analysis , this is made in our brain thinking about it result . nextly , it implementation and there by deriving the fact out of it . so , the fact can be derived from the concept itself . in my opinion , simply learning fact without knowing any information regarding will be like `` eating food without knowing what it is ? '' the food that you are eating may be tasty and you are enjoying it but withou knowing what are you eating seems foolish . in this contemporary world understanding idea and concept is in existence . so , when the world is running if you still continue to be lethargic it not good on your part and you cant do justice to your profeesion . understanding an idea make a person think about it there by making him develop or innovate new idea regarding the topic . it enables man to be thought-provoking always . knowing the fact will be a part of the this process if a person adopts a habit of understanding the concept and there by filling the essence of the studying . thus , i feel it more important for a student to understand concept and work upon them mindful that he is also filled with the fact along with the idea .
