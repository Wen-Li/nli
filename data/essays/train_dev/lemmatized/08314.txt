i agree . in this rapidly changing world with higher degree of sophisticated benefit , comfort , luxury and entertainment , young people are not sufficiently motivated to lend a helping hand to the community in which they live in . the changing dynamic of world in term of pace , the benefit money can bring , young people are getting attracted to them and started pursuing money earning habit or past time activity from a younger age not witnessed earlier . right from schooling a ` comprasion attitude ' in term of quality or higher rank is commendable , yet it becomes deplorable when it is described or implanted in the younger mind a a trigger to money earning activity . such an impression in the early stage last long and effectively work in the mind of younger generation in pursuit of that goal . another stage that younger prople fall prey to this attitude is when they are deprived of certain minimum comfort their peer are enjoying . this may make them parasite and kill or supress their natural concern or feeling for others . the wide variety of entertainment available now a day keep away from helping the community , rather spend a per their wish to derive some pleasure . though nothing wrong in spending for one 's own entertainment or comfort or benefit or luxury , being a part of society contributing to the society is like paying back to the parent . the attitude of paying back and concern for others also give pleasure and creates a healthy atmosphere . this type of metamorphosis can be brought out by collective effort and higher degree of introspection . it becomes the bounden duty of the parent and teacher to explain the moral and social value of the system and ensure that such qulaities get inculcated gradually in younger generation . by explaining and making them understandable about the pleasure of sharing and helping the needy , younger generation can be made more responsible and acquire these divine quality .
