` the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide ' ... i would certainly agree with the statement . travelling is a lot of fun and also a good learning experience . if one want to enjoy a well a learn the abouth the history , culture and habitat of the place a tour guide would certainly be helpful . educating oneself about the place prior to visiting it by book and the internet is very helpful too but having a guide who is local and ha the knowledge is definately better . i feel that in a group with a guide one can have a planned itineary and can organize the trip in a better fashion . if i would be by myself i probably would get lazy most morning and waste time getting around . by being in a group i would probably use my time and money in a more efficient way . for me even while im travelling going by a schedule really help . being by oneself i feel one waste lot of time first collecting the information and then deciding where and when to go . with a tour guide one is in better hand to travel and sight see comparing to one own . by having a tour guide one can learn more . i feel that i remember more after seeing a thing / place and listening about it rather than just reading about it . a local guide might have some story to tell about the place which one may not find in any of the book . personally for me a group of people is more fun to go out with . i strongly agree with the statement - ` more the merrier ' . travelling , singing , dancing and eating out could be more fun for me with more people around rather than being by myself . going to a new place might be intimidating at first but being in a group would just make me feel at home all the time . i love making new friend and going out in a group also help cultivating new relationship and friend . hence i would strongly recommend anyone to travel in a group rather than being on one own .
