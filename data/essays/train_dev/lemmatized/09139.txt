yes , i agree that young people do not give enough time for healping community they remain envolved in other activity such a sport . child should take part in development of community a they are future of our country . if community would develop our country wiil also develop then only people could get some work and we would be able to compare our country with developed country . we should keep our sourrounding cleen in order to help our community . it is true saying by some one that '' child is a father of an old man '' if child would help communitis from now in future it would be beneficial for them only . if there socities are well mantained and free from all kind of pollution all humanbeings living around them will remain healthy . as all of u know that cleaniness is very important . cleaness safe time a well a money because if know one is in bad health no doctor or medical fee would be paid . so if achild remain fit he can engoy his life so it important for achild to help his or her community .
