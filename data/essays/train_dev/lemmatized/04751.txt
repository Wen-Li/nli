in twenty year from now the world is going to change drastically in many way and one of the way will be the mean of conveyance that one is using to commute . i agree with the fact that the personal mean of conveyance like the car will decrease in number . people will start preferring public transport mean like metro rail , train , etc . with the increasing traffic problem in country especially like india people have started preferring public traonsport like train to their personal car . in a recent survey conducted it wa shown that the number of people who prefer train to their car have increased by 9 % in the past three year . because of the commotion on the street because of the large number of vehicle if one ha to reach a place some 10km away he ha to leave an hour ago to reach the place on time while in train he can reach the place in 15mins . this save a lot of his time and he can be sure of reaching the place on time . secondly with the increasing awareness for pollution control , the car that are a major contribution to pollution should be checked . pollution control is very essential to control the temperature of the earth ( global warming ) . the temperature of earth is rapidly increasing which if continues to rise will melt the antarctica and then earth would become extinct . pollution is one of the major cause of this temperature increase . cars cause a lot of pollution and in order to check pollution the number of car in the coming year is bound to decrease . studies have showed that earth 's temperature ha shown a rapid rise in the past two-three year and it is mainly due to pollution . the car play a major role in polluting the air . so the number of car on the streeets will soon be controlled . with the decrease in the resource like petroleum and diesel which will become extinct in few year if not controlled effectively , it is expected that the number of car on the street will reduce giving way to public transport that us electricity . cars that run on diesel and diesel and petroleum will reduce in number to put these limited resource to better use . there are car that run on electricity but still for other reason like traffic commotion ; coming twenty year will record a fall in the number of car . time wait for nobody so public transport that save time will be more in vogue that the car in the recent year .
