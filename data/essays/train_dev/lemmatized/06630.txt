understanding is the most important way of learning i would say that understanding the idea and concept is more important for student than to learn fact . in math , understanding the idea and concept is the only way of passing a test successfully , because there are only a few fact that could be learned . you have to now how to add 2 to 2 in order to get the right solution . because only knowing the solution to be 4 doe not help you with adding 145 to 589 . another example is an interpretation of a text . the student ha to know how to do the task . he ha to analyse the text concerning rhetorical device and theory of communication in order to get a good mark . the knowledge of an metaphora in a special line doe not help him to compare it to the epoch or characteristic of the protagonist . in general , fact concern a special problem or situation , like in history . one example for a fact is the existing of a monarchy in germanz until the 20th century . but the concept of a former german monarchy is similar to a former french one . only when you know what idea and concept are about you are able to compare them to another similar situation or use them on another subject . and usually the knowledge of development and their reason are more important than the date alone . when scientist are searching for a problem , they compare the aspect they know to the fact they discover , but to understand how a process work , thez need idea and concept . despite the fact that student must learn concept and idea to succeed in test , they should not neglect fact , a well . every thesis need a backround of fact , which prove that the idea an concept are correct and useful . to summerize the idea i have to state that the understanding of the idea and fact is more important than the knowledge of fact . but any idea would exist without fact , so the second question in a test will be about specific example .
