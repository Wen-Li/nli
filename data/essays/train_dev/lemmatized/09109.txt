i would totally agree that most advertisement make item appear much attractive than they really are . the most impartant reason is that marketing make use of or subconcious feeling and desire . another reason is that product show just convenient aspect of a product rather than a natural mix of disadvatages and advandateges . first of all the success of a product is determined bz it advertisement . initially the product is just a product , an object which ha many similar competitor . but when the marketing section begin the product develops to a subject which incorporates a specific feeling or soul . let me explain this examplatorily . when for instance nike try to sell some new shoe thez are firstlz nothing than shoe . and what make them different from other shoe ? and how are people able to distinguish them from others ? the companz which advertises the product try to arouse a awareness of a specific group in society like e.g. young basketball player . the advertiser try to give their product a soul or feeling which automatically rise in a person who see this product in the medium . thus the adveertisers attemp to render their customer an opportunity for identification with theri product . in this case we can imagine a young boz sitting in front of his tv and watching this new ad and feeling the same a the people in the ad feel . so , it is possible that whenever he get this feeling he rememebers those nike shoe he saw last time on tv . based on this example i would saz that product seller make to a certain extant use of the feeling and thought of their customer . the customer watch these kind of ad and absorb the message behind it unconsciously , which can lead them to buy a product without knowing why . i think that this depicts that we are somehow controled by the ad and the medium . and this is really scaring me that i 'm unconciously doing thing i would n't do under normal circumstance . another example which show that ad make product seem better than they are , is the successful marketing of alcohol and cigarette . we all know that these product are heyardous to our health and can cause death but especially young people are capable of being seduced by these kind of ad . the do n't show the inconvenience of smoking like it smell or unsociability but more important is that thez do n't show the hayardous effect this item could ahve on our health . besides the inscription on the cigarette packet there is no information given about impact . in mz oppnion ad just trick customer to buz product which are worse than thez seem .
