i think advertisement give u a different image of a product . this is possible because advertisement always manage to affect our mind and our imagination through television and newspaper . they modify our perception of a product bulding an entire world around a simple object . when we watch an add on the tv , we never pay attention to what is advertised . we are caught by slogan and image . sometimes we do n't even see the product itself being showed . so , we just remeber the name of the firm and sometimes the catchy melody that accompanied the add . television usually advertises brand , not product . that 's way we may not get a proper idea of what we are going to buy . in newspaper product are often advertised by movie or sport star . in that case , we stare at the picture of the star and do n't notice the product . we associate that good to a character of the show business . in this way we do n't care of what we intend to buy , but whom we are going to look like after we bought it . we look at image , not good . both picture and tv commercial are now made by very famous artist . we are attracted to the advertisement for themselves . it seems to me that the more an advertisement is tempting and promising , the more talent is required to hide the real nature of the object . the beauty of an add obscures our idea of the product . advertisements are aimed to built a web around a product . a chain of association that must influence our behavior a consumer . to make u buy something that maybe we are not going to like and enjoy . television , internet and newspaper all offer a great and profitable way to accomplish this goal .
