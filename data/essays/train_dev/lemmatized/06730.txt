i think it depened . first im going to talk about the young people . some of the young people are enjoing there life in many different way and they do that by doing alot of thing for example they travilling every wear and by going with there friend to the mall and to the cinema and alot of different place . but some of thim they are not enjoying thier life because of some reason such a they dont have enough money to travell for example . or they work to support thier poor family . so that theirs young people that not enjoying thier life . and the sacend thing are the old people some of thiem are enjoing thier life in diffrerent way . i have one example about my friend 's father . he is old and every year he have to travell even if he dont have enough mony he travell for one week and then he retern back and all that just for entertenment . but his sun 4 year he didnt travell . so it 's depend on person 's setewation . because some of the old people they dont enjoy thier life because they are very old so they care about thim self more than thier enjoinment .
