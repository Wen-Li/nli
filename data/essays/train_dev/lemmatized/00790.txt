young or old .. it 's all about joy there are difference between the thinking of old and young people due to several reason , the most important of it is their life style and experience , and their method to enjoy themseves , a the definition of enjoying life and how to enjoy life can differ from young people to older people in a huge scale . a a young woman , i believe that youth enjoy life for the sake of enjoying it and not for the happiness that this joy can result . young people think that there are many year left in life and we should enjoy it a much a possible before they have serious responsibility such a career and family . unfortunatly , some time enjoying life for young people mean irresponsiblity and careless in life , this is not true for all young people , but many of them interprete it this way . according to what i mentioned before , i dont agree with the statment that say `` young people enjoy life more than older people '' , a i believe that older people do enjoy life , but in a different way than younger generation would understand , this is due in many reason like the lack of communication between older and younger generation , and their different difinitions of enjoying life . for example , i enjoy life by traveling around the world and by meeting new freiends and new contact , and i always request my mother to do so , but she a an older generation tell me that her biggest joy now is to raise her child well , and to watch them get successful and happy , while year ago she used to enjoy her self differently . therefore , i believe that older people enjoy life a much a younger people , and sometimes even more , but the difference is about the thinking of older people , and their experience after growing wise and mature , which are great thing that the younger generation can learn from , and therefore enjoy life more .
