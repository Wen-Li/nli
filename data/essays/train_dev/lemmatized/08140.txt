there are many different way of learning and every body ha got his way to learn and understand thing . do you agree with me in this ? is i more important for sudents to undersand idea and conceps than it is for them to learn facs . i think learning the fact is more important . first of all not all the student can understand idea and concept because they varing in thinking and cant all the time imagine whate the teatcher talking about for example i have a frined of mine and he is a teacher and he telling me abou this that most studente cant understand by explaining idea and concept . in the other hand he sudent can undersand fact easly for a big reasone because they can see theme and they can touch them by hand some time so they belive in them and the good example of this the same teacher who een teaching for more than twenty year prove to me that is right by kindly talking me to many of his clases and showed me and i belive in him ecause it wa a fact . i wish tha you agree
