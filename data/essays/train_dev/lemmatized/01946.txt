the issue of differnt kind of knozledge is difficult because it depent of each person . on the one hand people think that it is better to have a specialization because it per ; it to know fundamentaly one subject . but one the other and we see that other person belive that have a broad knowledge it is have the general culture . to my mind both point of view are interstong but the last is better . so i will weigh the pors and con for each argument . fisrt we can see that in the contry the last cycle that is say the graduate is a specialization in one discipline . this is the reason why we can imaginem this choice is the better . moreover it is really difficult to learn different discipline at the same time , it may not be interesting because you have not got a good knownoldge . futhermore this employer prefer the major , because they think that they are more competent than the person zho have no specialization . but i can not help thinking that it is more interesting to learn different thing because this is a way to opening your mind and have a global vision of the world . for instance if you read read history ; economy , sociology ect you will be more co ; petent because you zill be able to understand problem by diffrent aspect . then to my mind a lot of student prefer to have broad knowledge ; that is why in france the polical institute are very fa ; ous because they porocure a lage knozledge . it brook no agreement that this kind of study should be extending at all the college . in a nuthshell we can they that have broad knomledge of ; any academic per ; it to hqve q
