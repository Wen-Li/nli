when a young men grows helping other people , he will do the same thing during the adulthood . it is an important thing that consent to value how a person is good or bad . in modern society is truly difficult to find a young with a non-selfish attitude . but the problem doe not depends from the young , but depends by the way his parent have educaded him . this is a big problem that in the future will carry u in a much more egoistic society . if a father doe n't play often with his child , if he give only money to his boy , he doe n't teach anything to his boy , and the boy will grow up without a guide . the boy will grow only with the importance of material thing , not human value . instead if parent take care about her child 's education , and show him how to live with simple thing , with real human value , and showing how they help their community , probably the child will do the same thing in the future . so we have to give a better education to our child , with more simple and human value , not material . only proceding in this way we will have a better society .
