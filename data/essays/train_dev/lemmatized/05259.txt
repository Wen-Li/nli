there ha been many controversy going on regarding whether it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subject than to specialize in one specific subject . i strongly believe that a person should have broad knowledge of various academic subject rather than specialized knowledge . first of all , having broad knowledge allows an individual to become `` better '' than a person who specialized in one specific subject . what i mean by better is that the person will have more opportunity to get a good job and have a better life , because after all , what a company and the society look for in a person is how round an individual is . the broader a person 's knowledge is , the more an individual is considered rounded . for example , my father who is a ceo of his own company once said that a company look for a person who is rounded rather than a perosn who is good in one specific area . when he chooses new worker for his company , he always see if a person ha broad knowledge or not . his rationale behind this is that if a person is more rounded , then the individual will be able to work in many different area , which brings up the efficiency of the company a a whole . not only that , but a rounded person is usually more experienced with various thing . rounded person ha vast knowledge which reflects that the individual must have had experienced many aspect of life . however , if a person is specialized in one detailed subject , then it reflects that a person ha narrow mind and is le experienced than the rounded person is . for example , a friend of mine who ha broad knowledge is more familiar with all the different kind of event happening . however , another friend of mine who is specialized in one speicific subject is narrow minded and unfamiliar with subject that he did not specialize . thus , the extent of the knowledge portray 's a person 's experience in life . lastly , a person who ha broad knowledge is more opened minded than the specialized person is . a good example is my mother who ha endless knowledge about everything . everytime i talk to her , i realize that she is very liberal and is open minded . however , my father who specialized in chinese culture in university , ha a very conservative and closed mind about all the event because he simply doe not have broad experience . i personally think being opened and liberal is crucial in current society , because the new generation of people are generally welcoming change and are opened a well , and in these day it is important to fit in the society in order to survive . to summarize , i advocate the point that a person should have broad knowledge of many different academic subject . a korean proverb state `` digging one well is hard , but digging many different well with same depth a that of digging one well is harder , '' which mean , an individual should challenge oneself by digging various well , also meaning that a person should have broadd knowledge of many different subject .
