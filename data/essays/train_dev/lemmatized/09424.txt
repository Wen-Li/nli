i do n't agree with the following statement : `` successful people try new thing and take risk rather than only doing what they already know how to do well '' . i think that the correct statement will be the exact opposite . i 'm gonna defend my point of view first by prooving that to success people need to study , then the success need to been build step by step and finally the success is coming from others trust . fist of all , i personnaly think that to succeed , studying is needed . going to college is not a risk but the opposit , an insurrance in life . that an invest in life to a better future and and a secure one . of course going to college can be see a something new at the beginning , but it 's not exactelly like that . it 's more like a continuation of a reach to knowledge . by having a degree , people learn how to do something good . the second reason why i disagree with this statement is because i think that success is something which need to be built . it 's not coming easely and fast . that 's a long daily work and to increase chance to achieve it , stability is requiere . runing and rushing from one plan to an other one wo n't lead no where . finally , i think that to success in life trust from folk is a must have . without trust there is no possible real success . and taking risk is the worst way to reach that trust from people around . again , the trust is something to build day after day . and to get it a knowledge in the activity is also requiere , nobody is gonna trust somebody new in a realm who doe n't know what he is talking about . of course success can come to someone who is taking risk , but it 's like the lottery it is happening to one in a million . i think that knowledge , stability and trust are the key to success .
