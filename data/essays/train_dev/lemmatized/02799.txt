according to my point of view , it is more important for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact . because even they do n't know the concept clearly it is not possible to solve any problem regarding topic . suppose we have a problem to solve , then first we have to understand the problem clearly and we have to think about idea to solve the problem . then only we can solve the problem easily . even we know all fact about that problem , we ca n't do any thing . for example , if student ha given a puzzle to solve , then he know all the fact about solving puzzle . he know all the rule in solving puzzle , without implementing any idea he ca n't solve the problem . the main purpose of implementation of idea is to choose the shortest way and le time to solve that . here for the student not only to know the fact within the problem , he ha to know the whole concept around the problem then only he would get new idea which are to be implemented in solving the problem . after the learning of concept about the problem we have to understand the idea which have to be implemented insolving problem . not only to learn fact , definitely understanding and let them know the concept . the student who have learn fact , ca n't do anything without practical implementation . we have to improve them from the learning stage in practical method in every aspect . this practical method contains that understanding the concept clearly and thinking about the idea to solve any thing . its better to prepare them mentallyt that they are in practically . so a far a i concerncerned first thing for student is understanding the concept . at finally i conclude it is more important for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact .
