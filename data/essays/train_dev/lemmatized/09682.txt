it is difficult to agree or disagree with this statement . if people enjoy their life or not , depends most of the time on their character and their living circumstance . these circumstance can be bad for young pepole a well a for older people . but i rather think older people enjoy their life more than the other way round . most of the time young people do n't have a many responsibility a older people have . older people are limited by their job , their family and other task . on the other hand the job and the family can be very fullfilling for the older people and therefore make life more enjoyable . due to a lesser amount of responsibility younger people can do what they want and like . this greatly contributes to more joy in life . but there are example where this doe n't hold true . a relative of mine who is 58 year old quit his job with 50 and is now living a very fullfilling and enjoyable life with le responsibility than even the young people have . another thing which contributes to a more enjoyable life of older people is that they can value good time more than the younger because of their experience . most of the older people went through bad time in their life and so they can value smaller thing more than young people do . furthermore they know better what they like in life . young people often do n't know what the like . they are unstable in their emotion and tend to be depressed over small thing . on the other hand older people are often le open to try new thing . therefore they might miss activity or experience which they would enjoy very much . in summary it is difficult to say who is enjoying his life more , younger or older people . i think it depends very much on the character of the person itself . but when i had to decide between the two , i would choose the older people .
