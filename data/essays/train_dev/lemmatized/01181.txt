in my view , the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide . i do not prefer to travel alone a i believe that when you travel with friend then you can take atmost pleasure and information of the travel a there will be many question for the tour guide a there will be many brain , not one . i just want to emphasise this by using an example of my travel with my friend . i am a history student by profession . in the last year of my college i had a thesis to be submitted on a great monument , taj mahal . it wa a tour where a group of 4 ( including me ) have gone and the place wa to new delhi , in india where taj mahal is located . it is one of the ancient city in india with great history and also the capital of the country . there we hired a tour guide , who is believed be the best in the place . while looking at the monument and hearing to the information from the guide , we were astonished about the history , beauty and the effort required for it construction . there were lot of area in the monument whose named were not even heard by u before i.e. none of the book contained these detail , which are very important for our observation and thesis . there are lot of question that were asked by our group to the guide . i think my share of question would be only one tenth of the total . then , i realised the importance of traveling together . i felt that if i have come to the place alone then i would have learnt only one tenth of the information for the thesis which would have reduced my score . after coming back from new delhi to our place we have check our share of expenditure for the travel and it wa only 40 % when compared to expenditure if one one travel else . with the above mentioned example , i believe that travelling in group with a tour guide not only help in getting more information about the place you visit , but also help in reducing your expenditure for the travel . it reinforces your relation with your friend . you will remember and recollect your experience and incident in the travel through out you life .
