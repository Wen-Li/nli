i disagree about this question for the following two reason . first , comunicate with other people is basis for human being . nowadays , most young people have mobile phone and using it by not calling but mailing . in fact , mailing is useful and easy to send message . but i think mail is difficult to express their feeling . second , i think human being can not live alone . everyone want friend to speak of , and anyone love human being . a long time ago , there wa no mobile phone , tv , and television game . so young people played outside with many friend who live nearby them . it caused their community . but now , boy and girl play inside because of television game . it is bad for their health and heart . i hope young people play outside . because they are treasure for future .
