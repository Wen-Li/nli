personally , i think that it is very important for student learning idea and concept . some people think the opposite , they think that it is better and useful learning fact , they are against theory , but without theory , it is more difficult learning fact . learning some concept or idea it is necessary , it is the basis to achieve good result . for example at university : if student do n't study some essential concept of some subject , they do n't understand the gist of that subject and the study should become a los of time . books have this purpose : telling the most important information , idea about a specific argument . for example : student that want to become a doctor , before working have to learn some important concept , they must know the human body . in every field of study , law , engeneery , science it is necessary having an abstract knowledge of the subject . after having known all the useful concept and idea , you can learn fact thanks to the experience . certainly , learning the fact is important too , but after a comprehension of basic concept . another example : in science or biology , people it is important knowing and understanding some concept , such u dna and so on . csyudents when go to school should learn basic concept and idea . facts are useful too , in this way they can do a comparision in the reality . pobably , learning fact is le boring than learning some concept , that sometimes can seem not useful , but student without this knowledge would n't have a whole understanding of a subject .
