many expertise in the managment field have declared that the people we used to look up have that quality of trying new thigs and exprees opinion that could have other direction that most of the regular people would think . i agree with this statement because history ha showed u that the success , in any field of the human behavior , reach those who dare to go against `` regular costume '' . for example , everybody thougt that christopher columbus wa insane when he expressed his idea of an espherical planet . `` the earth is plane '' , this wa the general thougth and evrybody laughted at him when columbus decided to proved them wrong . we already know what happened after he got the support of queen of spain . probably , he died not knowing that his madnees wolud lead and prove a revolutionary theory about our planet . jesuschrist , the most amazin man ever lived , is the real proof that revolutionary thougts would lead the society to evaluate it behevior and change their costume . after 2.000 year , his learning ha effected every society in the world . albert einstein , known physician and called `` father of modern physic '' . with his relativity theory , einstein explained the behavior and the reason for every phenomenom that ocurrs in the nature , he took part in major research around the world , and his theory are subject of investigation now in these day . he wa a lonely man , and probably wa consider a `` abnormal to the society '' , but time ha proved u how his madnees change the world . taking a look at these three example we can see that person who dare to make and to express idea that lead to new thing change our manner , costume and even our way of thinking . many succeful people follow these lesson and teaching , and the consecuences are that their way of livining and idea take place in our mind and thougths and we hope that we can introduce them in our life
