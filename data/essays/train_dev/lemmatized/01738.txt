in the oversea traveling , people can take a choice of being guided by tour in a group or go sightseeing individually . in my opinion , i think that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide . there are more fun to travel in agroup , and tour guide guide the whole team in a suitable way by the experience leadership . first , tour guide have rich experience to plan the whole trip and guide the group in an apporiate way . some tour guide can custom the trip that is most suitable for all the menbers under lot of constrinst such a limited time and money . second , a group of people can always be a helper or supporter for an other . we can take care others and it is more secure for all the member when go outside our hometown . whether there is some accident in the travel , member can take care your belongs and help you to call your family if it is neccesary . thirdly , it is always true that member are more enjoyable when share and experience the same happiness in the travel . the whole environment is enhaced greatly . along the trip , member can review and show some their intestests and experience . from the sharing , i am sure you will understand others happiness from their talking . lastly , member understand others deeper through the making of consenus in the trip such a what kind of living place and what is target of the trip . learn how to respect others ' opinion and find a critical balance between member ' agreement . there maybe lot of disagreement here , sometime it is differicult make a balance or even conficts between the dicussions . however , i believe the situation can be improved by first understanding member ' interest before the discussion and respect others ' concert . in conclude , it is good to tarvel in a group with tour guide .
