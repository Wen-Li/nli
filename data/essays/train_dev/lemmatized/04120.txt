i do not agree with the fact that `` young people enjoy more life than older people do '' . first of all , a a young person myself , i can state that we experience a lot of stress during our teenages . we have to make all the choice on which will depend our future , therefore we do not have time to fool around and enjoy life . from the age of five until the age of twenty , approximatively a it depends on the country we study in , we spend our time learning , studying , thinking of our future and it doe not leave a lot of time to enjoy much of what life is . secondly , when we get older , we have seen and experienced so much , that when the time for retirement come , our head is full of idea of what we want to do or what we want to see . and the major fact is that old people have time to do what they want , moreover the life time have so much increased that nowadays when people retire , they have a full twenty year ahead of them in france . in other country , it might not be the same ; for example , in the united - state , executive retire after the age of sixty-five . so , old people have more time to enjoy life than young people do . moreover , it is a common knowledge that a we get old we tend to be a child again . so much old people discover themselves new passion a sight-seeing . for example , once i wa at the opera and the old woman sitting next to me told me that going at the opera or to the theater were her new passion since she wa retired . she also told me that before , it would have never occured her that she would become passionate by it . futhermore , how much old people do we see sight-seeing or in the museum comparatively to young people ? to conclude , old people enjoy more life than young people though the quotation `` carpe diem '' .
