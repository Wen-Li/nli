to try new thing and learn about new thing is always good thing and get advantage from trying . i agree with the idea of successful poeple try new thing and take risk even if they know how to do well . it will be always pul thing for them . and also trying new thing can improve themselve and might realize and find out thing that they did not know about . one of my best friend , she started belonging to basketball team . she wa really good at most of kind of sport so of course she wa the number one person of beginer . she started paly basketball for not serious reason like she just wanted to belong to someting to spend time of her asterschool for fun . after while , she started be absent for practice becouse she knew that she play the best in the team and she believe that she is always the best for sport . one day , there wa a game for tornament and coach wa going to call the name of player . but my friend wa not called . since she started skipping practice , other girl are getting better becouse they were trying and trying to get better . i thought she needed to try more hard even if she doe better than anyone . after that , she started to try and go to practice and the next game she wa called a a player and she play even better than before . in conclusion , i thgouht , to trying is always pul thing to do even for the successful people . and what i think of successful people is who try hard and always try new thing and take risk . even if they know thing already then they do not try , i think those people are not successful . so i agree with the state of succesful people try new thing and take risk rather than only doing what they already know how to do well .
