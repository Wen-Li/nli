although trying new thing , and doing what the man already know are uselful way in dealing with different situation in life . but trying new thing is a wiser choice i go with , because it open new window and give a new solution , trying new thing and taking the risk in some situation can also make a big difference in the decision taker 's life , furthermore , taking the risk and trying a new thing is important when the man stuck facing a new problem he never had been through before . opening a new window while trying to find a solution is such a relife from pain caused by prolonged thinking , because taking the pain away clear the mind . when someone stop at a point in his life that need a real brave decision he cant just look behind to search for an old situation or advice , it can make a difference . while people consider taking new decision a risk , i consider it a the opportunity that never came to anybody else and it is some time give more that the man expects . on the other hand , doing what the man used to do , or doing what the comunity like to do is to some extent safe , also it considered the area of experience , the thing that u know how to do well . if no one of u tried to take the risk once in his life there would be no step taken forward , everyone will remain in the same place after a year or ten year . therefore , i agree when they say that successful people try new thing and take risk rather than only doing what they already know how to do well , because taking risk open a new window , find a new solution , give a new experience , and change the man 's life .
