i disagree with the statement that in the next twenty year there would be fewer car in use than what they are today . the number of car that are running today on road are increasing every day . the reason which are contributing to this increase are the high rate of population growth which increase the demand for increased mode of comuting . and this population growth is steadyly increasing . also with the number of people having mean to buy the new vehicle are increasing with the per caput income increase . so people are more willing to spend their money on buying car which make commuting much more easier for them a well a their family . and this increasing trend in increased income is here to stay so would be the increased in the number of car that would be seen on the road . another important factor is the improving technology which introduces a new motor vehicle every month or thereof . and the rich and wealthy who have the money to splurge , in the drive to have the latest technology for their own use tend to buy these . the technology is still in development stage , so with further development and invention of new car this number would continuously rise sharply . i would like to substantiate my arguement with a few of my personal experience . i wa just off to us for my internship and i observed there that it only the major big city that have a well developed transportation system with frequent public transport system plying on the road or train running inboud and outbound of the city . but the situation in the suburb is dismal . the bus ran after an interval of about 45 minute to an hour , which waste the cruicial time of the commuter . so , most of the people prefer to have their own vehicle which make travelling under their accesiblity and control . also in india safety is a major concern while travelling by public transport . with the crime situation worsening every year in the public mode people would prefer to use their own vehicle a they have the affordibitly to do so and it would enhance their safety a well . so until the government take step to improve the public transportation even in small city and suburb the volume of vehicular traffc would only see an upward trend in the year to follow . also , unless the crime rate are reduced and people are made comfortable in travelling by public mode in the coming year the number of car running would only be seeing a rise in number . another important step to reduce the number of car plying on road is to keep a check on the population growth . untill the populaton keep to grow other factor accumulate with it henceforth increasing the vehicular volume over the next two decade .
