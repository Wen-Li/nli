i am now 23 year old and if you notice i am from an economy that ha held itself even after the national fabric threatens to break down every second day . something or the other just keep happening in this nation of million . what ha given birth to this never say die attitude ? the normal conclusion will be that it the new generation that hold in it hand the reign of a powerful and majectic nation . the pertinent answer to that will be yes the youngster are responsible for it community . i totally disagree to the statement ` that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their community ' . i am of the same genre that we talk about here . i would ask how have i not served my community ? i have taught in blind school that exists just beyond my college , who had forced me to do it ? , nobody . the reason why i did it is the fact that i think i am responsible to keep everybody priveledged or underpriveledged at the same level . infact i felt that this is the least i could do to help those who are le fortunate than me . as a rule i do n't believe in giving alms , i feel strongly against the notion that any able bodied person should beg and not work . that is what i do , i work , i contribute to the economy , i work , i pay my tax on time , i have the will to see that my ability are used to the fullest so that i grow , in turn my agency grows and that will in turn make my economy grow . if somebody feel that i stiil have not contributed enough to my community then i must add that my community hold adult and child . i love and respect both . not only do i spend time with them , i stimulate others to spend time with them too . as an onset i would finish with the statement that i do contribute to my community and i am still counted amongst ` young people ' . i will continue doing this because i do n't have a point to prove but the fact that my conscience asks this out me and this is the minimum i can do to make people who matter to me more special .
