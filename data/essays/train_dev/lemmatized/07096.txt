gone are the day when people used to say `` jack of all trade and master of none '' . today in this competitive era , the time ha come when we should rephrase this popular saying that `` jack of all trade becomes the master . '' i feel that a person having wider knowledge succeeds in life . although specialization is needed to excell in certain field but in the developing society where everyone is busy in the race of cat and dog , one ha to excell in every field . we can take the example of so many scientific experiment which ha led to a new discovery . even a simple biological experiment requires the effort of people from different field such a chemist and physicist . had there been no chemist to provide chemical and reagent for purifying dna and had there not been any physicist to develop machinery for u , we would not have sequenced the genetic material in u , and the use of these requires the knowledge of these area . the various exam such a the one i am giving also make u realise that it is better to have broader knowldge of many academic subject . also , i feel that having a broader knowledge increase the learning and application power . we can think bigger and put in our vast knowledge to do great innovation . we should have general study about the culture and history even if we study science . in various intervews and examination , the questionairre are not from what we have learned specifically but about our knowledge and i feel it good too because this can only tell how we know about thing happening around u . broader knowledge not only help u lead a successful life but also make u an improved human being . it help u in better understanding and thus leading a better life .
