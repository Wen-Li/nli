there are a lot of way to travel and a lot of place to visit , with the development of the transportation mean , distance have been reduced considerably , and it is much easier to travel all around the world in an easier , cheaper and faster way . maybe when traveling to another place you could wonder what is best to travel in a group lead by a tour guide or to travel by your self ? i think in order to answer this question you have to take into consideration several factor a where you want to go and how much you are willing to spend , among other thing . i think it is really important to choose a destination because there are some place where a guide would be necessary , a a colonial city or a city filled whith history and monument to visit , but if you are going to a beach or a place just to relax , you may not need a guide to show you the city . the amount of money you are willing to spend on your jounrey can also determine whether you hire a guide or not , if you are traveling on an austere way , it would be better if you did not hire a guide , but if you had a lot of money to spend and you want to visit every inch of the city it would be a great idea to travel in a group led by a tour guide . for what is written above it can be seen thet , there are some thing that have to be considered when deciding if traveling on a group with a guide or traveling by yourself , but there are also some other factor , a the saftey of the place you are visiting , a well a the knowledge of the language and the culture you are going to visit that can make you decide what is better to travel by yourself or to travel a a group on a guided visit .
