this statement point at a very common and recently develloped way of thinking . nowadays , people tend to believe that all-included trip led by tour guide are the most inexpensive and pleasant way to travel . according to my traveling experience a an '' aventurous '' backpacker , i will try to demonstrate in which extense , this unfortunatly too common way of thinking is very far from reality . first of all , it is common sense that the le intermediate you pas by , the cheaper your trip is going to be . consequently , the number 1 rule for a cheap trip is to avoid travel agency , especially on internet , which practice abusive fee . dealing directly with airline company and hotel or hostel will always make your trip cheaper since , this way you 're not going to have to pay any commision to anyone . regarding accomodation , you can reduce your budget to a very low price if you feel like staying in a hostel . contrary to what might be thought , many of them are very clean and really cheap . it also ha to be seen a an opportunity to meet , share and talk to foreign traveler from all over the world . this is , in my opinion , way more enriching than staying with people with whom you share the same culture in regular three star hotel , since you unescapably have way le to share . still in my opinion , the tour schedrule , and the unescapable uninteresting random touristic visit are the main reason why i 'm totaly against all included trip . if you find yourself in a situation , or a place you do n't like , you 're obliged to handle it , and suffer in silence , waiting for your group to go back to the hotel . as for the guide , he ' s totally optional since lonely planet exists .
