i disgree with the given statement because i think it depends on individual and not on the time available . a person who really want to help his community can surely take out time for the same whereas a person who is not that interested will use his time for other purpose rather than serving his community . no doubt that in the present generation the competition ha increased and inorder to lead a resonablly good life people we really need to work hard . so in running after making penny people are overlooking the need for sparing time for working for the community . but still it not true that people dont give enough timefor community . for example , recently mumbai encountered a bomblast where thousand of people were injured . then immediately people reacted and started helping the government in moving the injured people to the hospital and geting their treatment done . a group of student took shift for whole night and served the injured with bread and tea . i think this showsw the concern left in people . donating money for development of poor people is also one way of serving the comunity . because of the vast destruction of psunami many people were left with starving stomach . in many college people collected money food , clothes and gave it to the government for sending them to the required place . serving community not only mean that you have to take fixed amount of time separately for it . i think helping the people where ever you find them is also serving . for exapmle , when we are on the way to office and come across a blind person struggling to cross the road helping him will also serve the purpose . in short for serving community we need not be the active participant . seeing the people reaction in such case like psunami and the bomb blast i think young spirit are still burning .
