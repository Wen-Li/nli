i agree that the young people nowadays do not give enough time to help their community . it is because that the technology now is much better than before , the young people now are too happy , and the effect of the medium . the technology today we have is way better than 10 or 15 year ago and young people have more entertainment in their life . the bad thing is that most of the young people spend most of their time to go along with these entertainment such a tv , vadio game , mp3 , and computer . compare to the older day , people would be more helpful in their community since they did not have much entertainment . they would spend a whole afternoon in a community centre to help and learn . young people would spend most of their time in front of a computer or a tv instead of helping their community is because there are too many better thing waiting for them . moreover , not caring other people is the point of view that the young people mostly having now . it is because they have not been in a hard time in their life since birth . they are too happy , and so they do not have an idea of helping others . the older people would spend time to help others because they know that even a little help would be a gift for some people . so , the young people would not spend a lot of time to help thier community because they do not know that their help would be a great reward for some people . finally , the attudite of the young people is a problem a well . if the medium encourage them , there would be a lot of helper in the world . media is the passway that the young people related the most , so if the medium encourage the young people to spead time to help their community and tell them that a lot of people would need help , they would spend more time to help . therefore , the improvment of technology , the way and attudite that the society is having now and the effect of the medium are the most important thing that make young people do not give enough time to help their community .
