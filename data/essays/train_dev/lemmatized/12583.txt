i agree that most of the time advertisement make product seem better than they are and i guess there are several reason for this . one of the main reason is that in most case , there are a number of similar product manifactured by different company that are in competition for being bought by costumer . usually costumer will want to choose the best product among the several similar one , that is why each brand will try to convince potential buyer that his product is better than the others . for example , soap and detergent to use in a washing machine . every advertisement will show extremely dirty clothes become spotless and the more incredible the result is , the better the product is supposed to be . the point here is `` incredible '' : no product can actually do what is showed , but if company a did a sincere advertisement , nobody would buy a 's product because `` it doe not clean clothes a good a the others do '' . that all come down to a sort of `` prisoner 's dilemma '' from game theory . it is a bit like doping in some sport : if nobody used it , there would be a fair competition , but a single person who chooses not to use it put itself at a great disadvantage towards the others . one other big reason for making product seem better than they are , is the need to create a desire in the potential costumer . the advertisement 's goal is to make people feel that a certain item is so good and useful that it is not possible to live without it . so , even if at first people would think of that object a unnecessary , after some time they will feel the need to buy it . an example might be cell phone : until ten or fifteen year ago very few people had a cell phone and the one who did not , did not even think about buying one because it would have been useless . now almost everybody ha a cell phone , or even more than one , and they wonder how they did manage to live their life without it .
