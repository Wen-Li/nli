if growing older involves the aging of the mind along with the body , in that case , i would agree to the statement that ` young people enjopy life more than older people do . ' whether you enjoy life more at 60 than at 16 depends mostly on your state of mind . but yes , i would agree that with age on your side you have the certain advantage to live a more fun life than you probably would ever do , a you grow older . as we age and our responsibilties in life start to increase under the ever growing pressure of work and family life , we tend to forget to stop by to enjoy and appreciate the little but invalauble moment of pleasure in life that are not easy to come by . as child with just school test and peer pressure are our greatest worry , our naturally preserved innocence allows u to have more fun out of littler moment . a new pup in the house seemed like the most fun thing to have ever happened to u while we were not that grown up . with the brain not sucked dry by the pressure of meeting deadline at work , the child have the enthusiam , energy and zeal to live every moment a their last one , living every moment of life to the fullest . also , the younger generation ha always had advantage over the older one , in term of the number of option to choose from specially , when it come to choosing from different way to have fun . i can often hear my father recounting story of his growing up day , when there were not many to have fun , it had to be the book or the playground unlike our generation that could n't decide between the hundred of videogames available to choose from and along with the option to read or be out in the playground . with every generation the list of option to choose from keep growing making the present the best time to be young at . but , like they say - aging is all in the mind , you could be 40 living the life of a 14-year-old and having the best time of your life , just because you choose to !
