i completely agree with the statement telling u about how young people today do not give enough time to aid their community . i am going to use various example to justify my opinion on this statement . in olden time , people in some way or the other had to help their community in some way or the other a there wa no other occupation other than agricultural occupation but a time have progresed , both chronologically and technologically , young people do not find it important to aid their community . people today have to be compelled to do something that will help their community , for example , school today have community service a an essential part of their curriculum which is good a they are trying to instill value in their student but the question posed is whether the school are successful in doing so or are student just doing it a a compulsion . people today feel that helping their community is a waste of time and money in some case but it is important for them to put themselves in the position and see the various kind of suffering people are going through . for example , the youth of today ha enough time to fit in time for computer game and movie in their schedule but they do not have the time and chivalry to go and help the lesser privilleged people in their community . some young people , who feel it is their duty to help their community , fear aiding their community a they think they might be considered a social outcast and people might make fun or make a mockery of them because they are doing something ` uncool ' . through proper time management and a change in their outlook , the youth can make time in their schedule to help their community and be of some positive use to society today .
