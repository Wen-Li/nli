i strongly agree with the statement `` it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subject than to specialize in one specific subject '' . a broader knowledge of academic subject will lead to a better understanding of topic and problem that exist or may exist in society . by possesing an interdisciplinary knowledge of subject , an individual will be in a better position to understand the complexity of issue which are not static and may involve many discipline . for example , a podiatrist who specializes only in his subject will be highly succesful in working with many foot condition . but when faced with a specific problem , say an allergic reaction on the foot , he may not be able to find the answer in his specialized area . that particular allergic reaction may be a secondary effect of a larger health issue , such a a disease that ha caused the patient 's immune system to be compromised , or something a simple a a neurological reaction to an unusual amount of stress that the patient is experiencing . a broader range of knowledge in medicine will most surely aid in the podiatrist 's understanding of the allergic reaction and in finding a solution to the patient 's affliction . not only is this the case for medicine or science , but in any aspect of a professional 's career it is important to have a wide knowledge of issue related to his or her career . a civil engineer is more likely to build a safe and useful dam if he is knowledgeable in the need of the people , the weather condition under which the dam will be susceptible and the geographical component of the land . many time disaster , such a the flooding of new orleans , occurs because of this lack of knowledge on the part of developer and other professional .
