nowadays we live in a very comppetitive world . we are being overun by advertisement everyday . we see them on tv , radio and they are even taking over the street . but how much of those product being advertised actually work ? . what 's more , are they really a good a they seem to be in the advertise ? . sometimes you are watching tv and you see something that seems to do wonder in the kitchen , wonder on cleaning , a product that doe the laundry , clean the dog and also wash the car . you just have to buy it . but sometimes when you do and you try it for a few time you keep thinking : `` but this did n't happen on tv '' . thats because on tv they only show u what we want to see . they dont put on air if it hard to use , or dangerous for the kid . they put that on the box , in tiny black letter . and it did happened to me when i bought a `` all-in wonder '' blender . in the world of advertisement it 's all about appereances . most people is being suggested by those advertisement to buy the product because the people that sell it only show the good side of it . also to sell it they have to make it look spectacular on the eye , because nobody buy an ugly box . all the effort is focused on making it look attractive , not where it should be : quality . companies are more interested in making more money by making the product more attractive to the eye , than making the product efficient , safe , and good . its the constant battle betweent quality v cost , and unfortunately , these day that battle is won by cost , because it give more money to the company that make the product . in conclusion , our globalized world is more interested in making a product more profitable than reliable . we live in a `` use it and loose it '' world . an based on personal experience , when i hear the statement `` most advertisement make product seem much better than they really are '' i say to myself : sad , but true .
