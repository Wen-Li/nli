i agree with the statement and there are many example to support this idea . nowadays young people do not help their community at all and inside the change of society and culture can be found the answer of this behavior . in my personal opinion , i think that the reason for which young people do not help their community are three . first of all , it ha become very common to live in city which are not very small in size . living in a big city mean that a young boy or girl do not have the usual place that there were in the past . during the last decade , the church , for example , wa the typical place where young people could help the others , for instance , they helped old people or the little community near the church . secondly , in the past it wa usual to live in little house and your neighbor became your friend and all this friendship formed a community in which everyone gave their help for the others , everyone did something to the overall benefit . this wa a great advantage because young people , living in this particular atmosphere , could see their work appreciated in the community which transformed itself in a big family . today this kind of situation is not possible because people usually live in a block of flat and everyone think only about his | her own bussiness , nobody think how can be important to have the possibility to have the help of the community . thirdly , today society and culture ha changed very much and , of course , young people are changed too . every young boy or girl live in a world without the others , it menas that young people prefer to stay alone . nowadays young people think only about themselves , for example , about not intelligent thing such a their game , their shoe or bag . they are only concerned on them and not on other people and in particular on community . in conclusion , all these three reason can not explain this phenomenon in all it feature , but can make easier to understand why young people are so far with their heart from one of the most important thing inside the society : the community .
