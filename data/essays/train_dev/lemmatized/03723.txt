it is commonly assumed that most advertisement make product seem much better than they really are . althought it might not be exact for every advertisement , this gap between reality and representation is experienced on a daily basis . first , we have to keep in mind the primary goal of an advertisement , which is to attract customer to a specific product . hence , advertisement maker have to rely on commercial technics that give the impression that their product is not only good , but that it is better than other product of the same category . it is precisely in this process that a gap may occure between what the product really is , and how it is presented to the customer . even if we assume that the advertisement maker are aware of the basic quality of a product , what is to be understood is that their goal is to make you think that you need this particular product , hence emphasizing it 's quality and of course passing under silence it 's negative aspect . this unbalanced and biased view on the product inherent value will surely produce a distorted perception of it 's real desirability , making it seem much better than it really is . the car industry provides numerous example of this phenomenon . this very competitive market force advertisement maker to present every car a they are perfectly fitted for you , which is not always the case . for example , american car maker have the tendency to promote their vehicule by stating their durability and their power . but they naturally never mention the fact that these vehicules are much more energy-consuming than non-american car . hence , if one relies only on the advertisement , he will be conviced that this particular american automobile is a really good product . but , if he buy it , he will soon realize that his vehicule ha a high gas consumption rate . he then might have the feeling that he made the wrong choice , that the vehicule wa not a good for him a the advertisement pretented . this illustration show clearly that advertisement are by definition enhancing the apparent value of a product in order to sell it .
