i agree with this statement . twenty year ago , when my father wa young his family had only a small income so he startet working in the age of 14 . so he had no time to help the communitiy . today , life is much easier for child and young adult . i am the best example - i am 22 year old and i only work in the summer break . i am studying to get a better job and to earn more money than my father earned when he wa young . an other reason why i waste a lot of time at university is because i want to get a job that is not bad for my wealthy . that mean i have more time and i am not a tired a for example my father wa when he came home . but on the other hand today young people have a lot of hobby . they like to go swimming in the summer and they are happy if they can play in snow in winter . they can enjoy to be child . later they spend a lot of time in pub with theire friend . they have also to go to school or university and to learn for test . if i ask myself why i do not give time to help my community , i do not get a real reason . i think our generation is a bit selfish - everyone only care about his own problem and need . to increase this situation it could be effective to talk about in school . teachers could find out the reason and they could try to change it together . i hope my childrens will give enough time to helping their community , because it is really necessary for the community .
