i strongly agree with this statement because when i look up to a successful person a an example i find someone that try something new , develop new ability that maybe he or she did not know they have and a a consecuence make them move forward . i know a carpenter that wa making 7 dollar per hour , but today is a millionar , why ? somebody gave him an opportunity to work in a big project ' they offerered to him to built the roof of a series of building , even though he never did that kind of job , he did not reject it . he got trained in that area of construction and the people were so happy when the work wa finished that gave him more work . in a couple of year he became no an empleoyee but the owner of his own constrution company .
