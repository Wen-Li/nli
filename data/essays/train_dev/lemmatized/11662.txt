i agree with this statement . i think this phenomenon is much more frequent in advertisement of food , but it is also widespread for other product . we have a lot of example in the allday life : when we go to a supermarket we see lot of product that seems very prelibate , quite appetible , that really seems to be perfect . in my personal experience , i often know that when i 'll be back home and i will be able to see how really the product is , my delusion will be clear . but this not avoid me buying that product , and obeying to the law of consume : consumer must be stimulated to buy a product , in every possible way . so the message of some advertisement for example emphasizes some quality of the product that are not so important , or that the product doe n't have ! this is a tipical aspect of the modern society , which is totally focused on the appearance and very often seems to forget that sometimes it is more important the substance than the form . but i think also that this trend in modern consumistic society is due to an intrinsec characteristic of the product in commerce . we can see that the product in a certain field are quit similar : for exampe every car well doe it function , to carry a people from one place to another . there are very few difference between one car and another one : one car may be le expensive , the other may have le consume , another one may be more fascinating , but really all car are very efficient if we think that they only have to permit u covering big distance in short period of time . sometimes one company is able to project a car which is a bit different from the others , for example because it ha a new technological device , but this improvement is not so determinant , and other car doe not become obsolete in an istant of time . so why a consumer should choose a product instead of another ? at this time is very important the aspect of this product , and it becomes so important that in some case it brings to a systematic lay , by making product much better than they are .
