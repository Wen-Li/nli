i disagree with this opinion which say that most advertisments make product seem much better than they really are because , in my opinion , it depends on people how to be impressed by advetisments , and general company do n't do such a thing unless it 's a fraud . we should n't say that most advertisments telling a lie . first , how the advertisments influence you would change depending on what situation you are . for , instance , if you see the advertisment of the restaurant when you are hungly , it would more affect you ; however , if you are not , it doe n't impress you much . therefore , advirtisments ' effectiveness is changing always . second , now it 's guaranteeed to send the product back to the company after you bought them . usually , the company take care of the cost of returning . if the company tell a lie at the advertisment , it just hart themselves . therefore , the company would n't tell a lie at the advertisments because they know telling a lie at the advertisment doe n't benefit the company at all . finally , now in this global society , some low prohibits to advertise the product not a they really are . after the internet wa created , we have been getting some chance to buy some on the internet . if we go to the store and see what the one really is , we wo n't take any mistake . however , if we buy them from the internet without seeing the real product , we only can see and imagine the advertisment and the picture of it . new therefore , in order to prevent costomer doing this the new low are being created in many country . it is clear that advertisments do n't , make a product look better . advertisments ca n't have it definition because it 's a just image of the product which can be changed by each costomers . from these reason , i strongly disagree the opinion which most advertisments make product seem much better than they really are .
