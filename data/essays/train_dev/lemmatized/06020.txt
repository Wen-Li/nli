there are some people who voice serious doubt about having broad knowledge of many academic subject and who are prepared to argue with having broad knowledge of many academic subject , but i would have to say that if i faced with the decision , my choice will be for having broad knowledge of many academic subject . first reason why i support having broad knowledge of many academic subject is knowing many thing with this way . if we know somethings about many academic subject , we can effect people while we are searching job . for instance , there is a man who graduated from university and who is searching job for the money but he only specialize in one specific subject before the his business life . i think he can not be sucessful in his career because of this . on the other hand , there is a man who know something about many subject . this man easily can effect the people who are manage the company so he can easily find the job for working and he can earn good money in his business life . another reason why i support having broad knowledge of many academic subject is that i think the knowing many thing is symbol of the evolotion . if the country have people who know something about many subject , this country can easily develop in all way so knowing many thing is also useful for our country . one the other hand , counry which have people who specialize in one one subject can not develop easily . all in all from what ha been mentioned above , we can safely draw the conclusion that having broad knowledge of many academic subject is better than specialize in one specific subject .
