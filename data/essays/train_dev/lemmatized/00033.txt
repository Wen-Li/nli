i disagree with that understanding idea and concept is more important than understanding fact . i think lerning fact is better than understanding idea and concept . first , understanding idea and concept might be difficult for some student . however , they would be able to guess what idea and concept are by lerning fact . only being lerned by someone doe not make thier thought develop . thinking by themselves is best thing to halp their thought . second , even thogh understanding idea and concept is important , thing do not always happen by follownig idea and concept . sometimes other result that student can not expect from the idea and concept which they understand may happen . yet understanding fact tell student that whan kind of result would happen , and this make them easier to understand thing . third , some student might misunderstand these idea and concept , and they would make mistake , but student who understand fact at first can get along thing , because they already know what kind of thing they have to be done . for these reason i disagree this statement .
