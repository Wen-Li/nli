with the above made statement , i fully agree for the following reason : the best example would probably be the tobaco advertisement shown on tv , the cinema or a large poster at bus station . nobody could say that smoking is healthy or make you feel free , but a certain brand tryes to provoke this picture by showing landscape , cowboy and horse . another example is the food industry - what they say to be healthy often turnes out to be tho opposite , if you only have a close look at the ingredient list printed on the back . but often people do n't even realize what they are consuming after having taken a close look at it because they do n't have the knowledge interpretate the meaning of what they read . of course - not everybody is a doctor or pharmacist and is aware of the danger that certain thing might become to our health . and that is one of the point i really think to be unfair from the froducting firm . to sell bigger quantity of their product , they willingly make believe people wrong thing . especially for child those advertisement might be dangerous a they even know le about what healthy and unhealthy substance can do to your body . they just want to do , have , eat or drink everything they are told is good , brandnew , cool . and so do their friend . concluding my essay i would like to outline that of course this is not the case for every product or even ` most ' a is written in the statement . it would be unfair to declare advertisement to be generally false , dishonest or dangerous . there definetly are advertisement which state the truth about their product ! many adversitements even show a houmorous content and can be really amusing . - for these reason we can see show at tv containing the ` funniest tv spot of the world ' - what an enrichement to our tv program !
