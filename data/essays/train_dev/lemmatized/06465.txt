i agree with the given statement that modern adverstisements do not reflect the real quality of a product . since advertising is known it had the purpose to get the comsumers attention for a product , then cause interest for it which should end up in demand for the product and finally in the action of the buying process . so it is no wonder , that a company offering a product want it to be presented in the most favourable way to raise the amount of people buying it . in only a very few case the company and it advertising company care about the product shown a it is . from an economical point of view this behaviour seems apparently right , but from a moral point of view it is very debatable . a supporting role play the development in the field of digitalization and technical progress . with contemporary technique it is possible to refine picture or movie clip by digital mean . so in an advertisement for a lotion which proclaims clearer face skin , the picture of the campaign protagonist 's face might have been enhanced digitally . so it seems , that the lotion is effective because he or she ha very clean skin in his facial area . that the picture doe not reflect the true situation the consumer will get to know after he ha bought the product , when the adverstiser ha reached his goal - a sale . in my opinioen this emphazises the nowadays problem that the population - the consumer - are not critical enough towards information they receive via television or medium in general . they believe in what they see without a critical attitude to it . as a conclusion i want to say that from my point of view , it true that advertisement often make product seem better than they are , but thats okay because the advertiser act in economical purpose .
