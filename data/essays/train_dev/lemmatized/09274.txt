i do not agree that young people enjoy life more than older people do . there are some reason that might suggest this a for example that younger people are normally more healthy then older people . of course if an old person ha to use a wheelchair he is going to enjoy his life le than a younger one without wheelchair . also younger people might have le obligation and responibilities than older people . studying is assumed to be mainly fun . but this seems to be a popular illusion . today , through the advance of medicine , older people are healthier than ever before . also , today student are aware of the fact that their future depends on their success in study . this mean that they have a lot of obligation and responsibility too . and old people can also choose a life with only minor obligation and responsibility . actually they can live like young people . older people have made their experience . according to their experience they have chosen how to live . they have all opportunity like young people plus experience . young people have to spend their time to their education . they ca n't build a family for example . for most people having a family is still the most satisfying experience . also they depend during their study on the money of their parent . older people however earn their own money . they have more money to spend and they can decide what to do with their money . another point is that enjoyment of life doe not depend on age . the difference mentioned above are mainly dependant on the person . you can enjoy yeour life when you are young and you can enjoy zour life when you are old . most thing you can do in both stage , like meeting friend , visiting concert and so on . the important thing is how you take life . you are always going to face problem whether you are young or old . the decisive thing is how you cope with the problem .
