from my point of view having broad knowledge of many academic subject might sound to many people boring and at some point useless . why would someone study more when you can just specialize in one specific subject and be ready for the world in a shorter period of time ? i kind of disagree with the statement presented . i believe that the more you know , the more you are prepared for life . having broad knowledge of many academic subject might help you to develop yourself more a a person and a a profesional . when you specialize in one specific subject , you might be missing the chance of learning more and being more complete . you limit yourself to not to go forward , not to learn more about thing that might interest you and to not be even more prepared at a profesional scale . i do not mean that specializing in one specific subject is the biggest mistake you could possibly ever make in your life , but i do think that we have a lot to learn and that we never stop learning . knowing more doe not harm anyone and may bring you piece of mind . it feel great when you realize how much you know about some subject which at some point you found useless to know about before , but when the time come you realize how wrong you would have been if you would not have made the decision of amplify your horizon and learning a much a you can learn . for example , learning another language is a really good thing to do . you never really know when could you actually be needing that second language until you find yourself in the need of it . many company want that their employee could talk at least one or two more language than the one which is their mother language , but unfortunately not everybody is prepared . being prepared is about having the enough knowledge that could guide you through life .
