i agree to the statement that it is more important for student to understand idea and concept than from fact . the meaning of understanding the idea is thinking about the concept . the three quwestions will arise while thinking that is while understanding idea and conceptsthey are why , what , how . what the concept is how the concept arosed and what is the main theme of the concept same a that in the case of idea too here the main aspect in understanding is moving into the deeper meaning of the idea or concept and understanding about the concept it will make the thing easier when studied by understanding idea and concept it will remain in brain for a long time than it is studied according to the study it ha been concluded that most of the student who understand the concept can remember for a long time than we study the fact by understanding the cocnept we can get knowledge about the topic in two way one is the positive result and the other the negative result from the concept . after analysing the concept we too can chosse the bet way if it is applicable in the real time apects too . the mean of understanding the idea and concept is to make the studentsto get good knowledge on the concept there are many aspect in supporting the issue that understanding idea and concept is good for student . firstly the student can get the whole idea nof the concept they can get full knowledge of the concept . secondly they can get the reason in supporting or opposing the concept . finally they can use it in the case of the realistic application if it is applicable . the fact also make the student to learn more about the topic but when compared by understanding idea and concept knowledge isgained greatly than studying the fact a it is . the meance of understanding the concept may lead to think about new idea too which can improve the past there is a possibillty which can destroy the past idea too . so finally it ha been concluded that understanding the concept and idea will show more effective than learning the fact .
