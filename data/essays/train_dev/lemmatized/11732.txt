i agree whit the statement below . the reason of my affermation is that a person may not , in the actual society , know only a specific subject , because our job employment may change in the future . infact our society is more flexible than in past , and then we must to be prepared for all this chenged . in other , i think that is interesting have a general culture . for example we should know sometimes about history or science , about math or philosophy . of course we can not know all in absolute . it is impossible ! a general knowleadge may be theach in some kind of school , or by studing at home for ourselves . in other , i think that we can learn more of general subject by talking whit other person who are more informed about a specific subject . however , is not wrong to be specialize on a subject . infact many job have need a specific knowleadge , a the professor or the engigneer . to project a machin do n't need to know latin ! this is my case because i study electronic engignering and my future employ will be about the only project , who do n't require other knowleadge . in other , personally i think that is very interesting know all the paticoular of somethink . without this way to think , in the past it wa posible invent very complicated and sofisticated machine . finally , my general idea about the statement is that we should learn ( at school , at home , with friend ) the more possible about all subject , but is important , in many case , have a specific knowleadge only about one .
