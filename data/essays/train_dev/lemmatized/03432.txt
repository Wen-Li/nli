i certainly hope this statment would be true , a i wish to agree with it . but unfortuantly , i do n't agree , a reality implies opposite fact . as i grew up , i have been noticing people changing their car every now and then , i usually did n't care , but when it wa time for me to get a car , i felt how important it is to ride a car that comfort me and get me to any where i wish to go . and i realized why people were so interested to changtheir car . it 's either they did n't like their car model anymore , or maybe they just want to get the latest car . however , being this tramendous change in car manufactering world wide affect all people , in term of age or gender . now not only men interested in car , but also woman . even though most of the well famous car manufactering coorporations are trying to suit what is the best comfart car for a woman , in term of color , mirror on both the front sits , where the driver located . also , certain type of car were introduced for a small or a big family . nonetheless , the type of car introduced , there are so many and uncountable . alot of different car industry are growing so fast due to the competition between them to produce most high technical and comfortable car with le maintanence , with ofcourse , the shape it ha of modern look and color . many people are very impressed with the very high technology applied in car nowadays , from the car 's shape till the car 's performence . and let never forget that car now serf u in many of way . any family ca n't live without a car , and thats a reality everyone should admit , a in case if you do n't have a car instead you can take another tarnsporting mean . which at the end is a car , going anywhere , to your work place or for visting someone or even travelling near or far still requires a car . car 's serf u in many way , that make me doubt that in twenty year will be fewer , even if telecommuting took place instead of going to yout place , and replacing car with any other mean of transportation like for example airoplanes , it will be so diffecult to adopt to such a diffecult mean . cars just make life easier in term of tarnsporting . finally let just thank those industry who are trying to manufacter car moving with electricty rather than petrolum that affect the enviroment negatively , and wish to demostrate instead of what we are using now .
