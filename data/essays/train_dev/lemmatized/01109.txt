regarding to the statement that young people enjoy life more than the older one , i hold the view this is true . regarding to my opinion young people today have a lot more possibility to create their life . first they have the opportunity to go long to school and afterwards studying whatever they want to . older people never had this great opportunity , nor the money for such a comfortable life . second is the creation of the wide range of spare time activity . there are so many new possibility what one can do in leisure time , which have not existed in the time when the older people were young , and what they now can not do any longer because of health problem . the variety go from sport , culture , travelling to visiting friend in a foreign country . from this i want to move to the next point : foreign study . younger people do n't even have the great oppotunity to study , but also the chance to do this in a foreign country of their choice . this is an important extraordinary experience , which ha a great impact on the later life . living in a country for a period of time is something else than beeing on vacation . the young have the opportunity to learn really from other culture an so probably develop a different view about many thing in early year of their life . older one can do this after year of work and ca n't take the chance in that way . but one ha also take into account the carreer chance offered to the young people . with the money from the parent it is possible to live in a big city whre many great company are . so they have a greater chance to move from home to another city and live independent . to conclude , one can say there are various thing what make the life for young people easier and more comfortable than in the past and even in the future for the older people of our society .
