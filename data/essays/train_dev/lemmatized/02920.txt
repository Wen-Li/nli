i do not agree with the statement that young people enjoy life more than older people do for various reason . first of all , many young people today are under so much pressure , that they often do not find time to just `` enjoy life '' but have to study or work hard to compete with many others their age to get a satisfactory job or a place at a good university which they want to attend . elderly people , on the contrary , especially if they are already retired , are much more free to enjoy their time . as a psychological research ha shown , people experience a shift in value during their lifetime . while younger people are still very much keen on achieving material richness and tend to compare themselves much more with others , older people seem to put more emphasis on emotionally closely-knitt relationship and value material good le than young person do . hence , one could assume that elderly people do n't experience a much social pressure from society than youngster . the high rate of suicide among young people would also speak against the assumption , that young people in general enjoy life more than older people do . however , i also do not believe that older people generally have a more joyous life than the younger generation . they face different challenge : while young people might experience greater mental stress , older people most probably have to conquer more physical stress , often in the form of serious disease . as an open question in the end i would like to ask whether it is at all possible to determine the level of a person 's enjoyment from an outside perspective ! ?
