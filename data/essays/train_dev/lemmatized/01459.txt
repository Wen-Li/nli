someone say it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic sudjects than to specialize in one specific suject . i ca n't agree on this statement . because obtaining specialize knowledge is more inportant than obtaining broad knowledge of variuos subject . my statement mainly based on the following reason : first , with the bloom of the information development , it is mostly impossible the obtain all the knowledge of one specific subject , not to metion obtaining all the knowledge of a broad range of subject . what wa the use of a person who spend all his life in learning all the knowledge in the world , but doing nothing to used what he learn to contributed to the society ? second , to obtain that many knowlegde is a very time consuming process . sometime it could be a waste of time . and to choose a wide range of subject mean to secrify the depth of the thing you learn . this may lead to a person difficult to live in a world that most , if not all , of the work are specificly cassify . and the most important reason is that , what a person will focus in his or her life , is usually one or tow field , it is really not nessesary to studied too many subject , learning too much may not do any good to our future . why do n't we use the time we spend on the knowledge that may never be used in our life to something more related to ourself ? who will need to know how to cure aids when your job is the programming software to a supermaket ? in sum , i think that knowlegde are important to all of u , and it is a good thing to know more of the . but the more important thing is how to use our limited time to learn the specific knowledge that will more likely be used in our life , but not wasting our life of what may come useless to u .
