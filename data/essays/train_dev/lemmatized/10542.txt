i agree . most of the student are always trying to learn about thing that they even understand about , they just are repeating thing with out a little notice about the topic because some thimes the only matter it 's to obtain a good grade , i understand that when you are trying to repeat and studing hard something just for accomplish a good grade it it more dificult to remembered in the furure , and it 's more dificult to practice it in a live time a an experience wath you had study just for a fact . if we are talking about student i think that the main focus should be not how hard they study because in that case this student will be measured by his memory skill and what for a student should be graded is by his aprendice experience that 's what make poeople competitive see how hard they learn by understanding , and the only way to get student into the leraning experience is by first teaching them to understand , so let give them the importance in how to learn by a clear slide about the idea of comprence . in other way to suport my thouth it by the importance of emphaty in all relation and this is the meaning of understanding the other part , so this understanding prose it ha positive impact in all professional , academic , business and personal issue having a clear image of an effective understanding prose and i think that in the order that you understand something in that order you 'll be succesful and in most of the time succses is the meaning of happines , so let 's promote the understanding between our student , let 's try to make them happy so they can give u back a good and ethical work that our society it demanding this is just my personal point of view
