in general i agree with the statement . i only agree in general because i think one ha to take lot of thing into consideration . it is is true that especially nowadays young people do not help community a lot . '' helping the community '' is a very broad term , when i read this i understand contributing or becoming actively involved in a community . especially in these day it seems to me that people in general , young people included , expect more from a society and community than what they are willing to give . there are certainly various project and possibility to become involved . however , especially in the last year the development of medium , video game and good of consumption in general desensitized a lot of people , especially the young generation . this lead to unawarenes of problem that might exist , or even when recognized to an unwillingnes to act . also i think one ha to consider the social background and sorroundings of young people . if a young person grows up in a society where nobody care about contributing to society and their community , how is he or she supposed to learn that it is necessary to be involved in the community ? on the other hand , it is common sense to become active . it is a taking and giving , if the giving aspect doe not work properly , the community will not be able to uphold the service it offer . especially young people are not aware of this process . therefore , i do agree with the statement . however , instead of blaming the young generation , something ha to be done so that young people get encouraged to be a part of a community and get active .
