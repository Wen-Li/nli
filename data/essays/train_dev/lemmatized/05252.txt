i agree to the statement . in my opinion there is famous saying that `` to get success you have to take risk '' , i agree to this statement because i feel that success dosent come without taking risk in life . today is the world of competetion and to compete in this world you have to try new thing to get success . in order to get success , sometimes you try to find out new way . by going on those way you think you can achieve success and you often take risk in your life . i feel if people only do those thing which they think know how to do well they can get success upto a certain level but can not reach height of success . in my opinion every one ha it own defination of success and it depends on the person to person till what extent they can take risk in their own life , for some people success mean peace of mind or a happy life . but for some success mean reaching the height of the world , to conquer the world so that person tends to take more risk comparision to that that person who is happy in his own world , or to that person ha different meaning for success . for example , if you take the example of cricket if a batsman want to score quick run he hast to play slodgy shot in order to take quick run so he ha to take risk . sometimes he get success or sometimes he fails . so it just depend on the person is he ready to take the risk in term of getting success ? but i dont think you can buy success without taking risk . sometimes i feel is `` success has its negative side '' . this question always bother me a lot . is success dosent come without taking risk ? till now i am not able to find out the answer till date , may be i have not achieved success yet but the day when i will achieve succes i will come to know
