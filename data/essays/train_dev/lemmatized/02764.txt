i agree that young peoples enjoy life more than older people do . my first point which is most important is that , they are young . since they are young they have lot of energy to enjoy by the way they want . for example , if someone think he enjoy his life by playing some outdoor game , when he ha a plenty of time . now , if thinker is young person he can just grabb his stuff to play & go on . but suppose this come in a mind of an old person thats not possible easilly because he ha to remind quick what kind of restriction his doctor make on him . also other point is lack of energy . he may not be able to perform that task even if he will enjoy in out door game . he ha to compromise with thing like just watching t.v or having family dinner party , an easy way of enjoyment all older people prefer . also second thing which support my agreement is , travelling or trip which lot of people like & good way of enjoyment . when all the friend come together & make a plan for a long trip , is easy for youngster because they are able to face all the kind of problem starting from weather change to walking a mile away by foot when there car is out of fuel . but in case of older people they need support in such kind of situation . they can not face a youngster can . they need there medicine ready while weather change happens & even though they are preprepaired , they are not sure that there body can respond well . so , basically young people can enjoy there life more than older people a they have enough enery to enjoy by the way they want . but older people also have so many way to enjoy there rest of life . as , at one time when they were young they also had fun .
