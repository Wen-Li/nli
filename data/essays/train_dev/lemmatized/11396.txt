in my opinion this question need to be dealt with in a differentiated way , there are pro and con . a significant argument in favor of the statement is that certain developpments which currently take place , lead to a higher degree of egoism among the people . we live in a world , which globalizes more and more , there is more competition and everything becomes increasingly busy and difficult . one ha to face unemployment or lower wage unless you are better than others , one ha to dominate others in a certain way . i think this quite general phenomenon gradually lead to a change in social behaviour , which express itself for example in a lack of young people , willing to help their community . furthermore young peoble are in many case not willing to help in their community for the simple reason that other thing are more entertaining . why should they help older people or do some cleaning job when they could alternatively spend their time playing computer game , watching a series in television or hanging out with friend . young people are n't sufficiently taught that it can be far more interesting to help others and to improve the community experience . on the other side there are also some argument against this statement . the existence of a considerable number of organization in ther welfare-sector and the fact that young people are integrated in these organization serf a a proof against the statement that young people do not give enough time to helping their community . there are religious organization , sport club and political party which dedicated themselves to the duty of helping in their community and the y have many young member . apart from that the civil service is the germnan alternative to the militarz service . for the period of one year young people can help in there community .
