inventing the wheel again the method for being sucessful in life is not written on an ancient egyptian scroll . in today 's world no one can really determine what will be a hit or not . inventing a new thing is sure necessity to be sucessful , but one should not blindly take risk in the sake of it . one 's experience is his best treasure and his best guide for reaching sucess . successful people improve on what they already do well . imagine someone who want to be a good swimmer . he first learns freestyle and a soon a he learns it enough to look good , he start learning butterfly , backstroke , breastroke and so on . while a competitor chooses his best stroke to be freestyle and put just the same energy and time to freestyle only . the first swimmer can race and be good in all style but when he race freestyle , the second swimmer will win . success in sport is similar to success in life for many thing . if one doe n't focus on one thing and learn it quite well he wo n't improve on it . successful people plant their strategy well and work on the thing they already know to improve themselves . in order to be sucessful in a subject one should bring something new into that subject . in order to bring in something new to the table , one should first know what 's been put on the table . successful people who ha experience on their subject already know not only what ha been done upto that point , but also they understand what is needed next . someone looking at a picture from outside can not see the next step , can not see what that businness field is lacking and what would be a big gap filing invention . taking a risk on new thing without and experience on it is like driving in dark with no headlight . being successful doe not mean doing only what ha been done up to that point without chaning it . successful people always re-invent and improve thing in their field . the first rule of being successful is not stopping and always improving on what one have . success story are based on doing dramatic thing . however it is only a fair luck to be successful in a field by just taking risk and trying new thing . new thing are necessary for improvement and success . but for new thing , experience is a must . successful people are the one that try new thing in the light of their experience .
