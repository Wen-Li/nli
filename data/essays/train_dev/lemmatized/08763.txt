it wa five o'clock and i wa sleeping on my confortable bed in my home . suddenly , i woke up cry and screaming . i could n't believe it , i had had a bad dream . before , i realized that dream had a profound effect on my feeling . the dream wa about a trip where i got lost and there wa nobody next to me . i wa afraid !! . i agree with the statement that say that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide . the reason why i agree with that are my personal experience of traveling alone and the cost first , one of the reason to travel with a group is my personal experience . i went to brazil alone and i did n't enjoy it so much . i realized that i do n't like traveling with no people . all the trip should be done with people who you care alot . moreover , i would like to visit others place like bolivia and chile , both country from south america . but , i 'd go with my close friend . one who spends with their relative or lover have fun more than one who spends time alone in a foreign country . futhermore , the cost is another reason why i think that taking a guide for your group trip is a good idea . visitors spend more money going by themselves to an unknown place . if you have a guide , he or she is going to tell you where you should go to eat delicious native meal . also , he or she can tell you the cheaper restaurant in the city or town . in adittion , everytime you travel with a group , the disco and tavern are the favorite place to have fun . there , you can dance and drink all you want with le money . in conclusion , the best way to travel is with a tour guide . he or she can show you where to go , where to eat and where to have fun without paying big amount of money . other way to travel is doing it with a group . to be in a foreign country alone is not agood idea because something could happen to you . moreover , being with your bestfriends or maybe with your family make the trip more exciting and unforgetable .
