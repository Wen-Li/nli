i disagree with the above statement for , simply put , it mean `` jack of all trade and master of none '' . i certainly have no idea who came up with this particular phrase but i do percieve it to be very true and apt . a `` broad knowledge '' to my understanding may be defined a enough fact to project a scholarly image in refined society . in other word , claiming to have a read a book by reading it ' back cover . limited knowledge of multiple topic is of no real use unless a person 's vocation requires him to posse such knowledge . specialization on the other hand is what lead to pure genius . certainly some men are born a true genius . but others can get there through hard and consistent work in their particular field meaning specialization . to support my idea i put forward four exemplaries , indian nuclear scientist - dr. homi bhaba , vikram sarabhai , raja ramanna , dr. abdul kalam . these men shaped indian nuclear history . they absorbed nuclear science into their very blood and brought about a revolution in the nuclear field . india owes it present day nuclear status to these men who laid the foundation stone for the edifice of indian nucleardom . what would be our status today if these men settled for a broad outlook on general knowledge ? but this is not to indicate that specialization make every person reach the height that these four have achieved . but certainly an in-depth knowledge of any subject leaf the individual with a personal sense of satisfaction for actually having achieved a milestone and also brings him a respectful position in society where his achievement is appreciated by both his friend and others . if we , for example take a heart specialist or a engineer constructing house , they can not hope to execute their respective task without specialization in their field . they touch the live of all the people they serve and in addition to their remuneration , they also earn the lasting gratitude of the people for a service well-rendered .
