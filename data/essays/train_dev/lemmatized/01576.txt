i agree . we continually see advertisement , the possibility are too much for having the possibility to exercitate a real control . there are many kind of message in every advertisement and when that is unconscious , we often do n't recognize it but we keep it in some way in our mind . when we watch tv , when we read a newspaper or every kind of magazine , when we wait for a train in a station too , we see advertisement continually . all the city have a lot of public site where we can see advertisement . that is the cause of the our society is defined cosumistic and at the same time the advertisement and the advertisement product are accepted a a specific part of cutlure too . i mean , nowadays , the famous andy warhol campbell tomato soup ' is a symbolic artistic example and above all , it is an aestetich kind of meaning vision . we live in a context in which advertisement is a foundamental part of life and for many reason we feed this economic process . that-s the way it 's easy to thimk we need some product , we idealize the effect that product could have in our everyday life and we think we must have it . the most product we use are not useful . sometimes we need some product to appear , to like to the people , other time we really need them but it happens very often , the product are very different from what we immagined in the advertisement and the effectes we hope the can make , do not appear in the reality .
