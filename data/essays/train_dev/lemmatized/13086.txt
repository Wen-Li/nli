i agree that young people enjoy life more than older people do . there are three reason why i think so . at first , i think success of life need enjoy . most of the successed people are studying or working with fun and passion , not only with pain . fun and passion come from likng something . liking to through being good at something . espeacially when young people have an interested in something , they can concentrated and try to practice or study . that is a short cut to success . at second , because enjoying life is comfortable for the body . recently all aged people are stressful . the number of suicide is increasing . people do not live in order to be sick , and health is most important thing in life all over the world . finally , nowaday the diversity is a common sence . in order to find their future life story , young people should try to many kind of fun and work with enjoy . therefore i think that young people should enjoy life more and more !
