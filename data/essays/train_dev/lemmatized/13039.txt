in general , the question whether young people enjoy life more than older people do , is difficult , if not impossible , to give a clear answer to . in our family , there are both example of young a well a older people like my grandmother , who enjoy their life in a similar way . of course , older people do not have a many possibility a provided to younger people . nowadays , young people can use internet to read newspaper , check e-mail or watch movie online . or younger people can go abroad on an exchange semester , like i have done . all thing , which older people have grown up with or experienced before and therefore , are not familiar with . however , it depends more on the personal attitude towards life than on your age if you enjoy life or not . my grandmother is a good example for that . she is the most amazing woman i have ever met in my life . even when she ha to go to the hospital because of her illness , all doctor , nurse and patient admire her because of ther constant optimism . in her opinion , it is of utmost importance to be active and to be kept informed by reading newspaper , book , and watching television . it drive her spirit to learn new thing she ha never heard of before , even though she is already 80 year old . it is a whole different story , if old people start being confused or do not remember thing and thus need to be taken care of . for example , my friend 's grandfather wa once brought home by the police because he could not find the way back to his home anymore . this is the time when being older start becoming a burden for relative . in conclusion , it can be said that it totally depends on your own attitude and not on your age , whether or not you will enjoy your life however , it should also be taken into consideration that at some point of our life we might want to enjoy life the same a younger people do , but are not capable of doing so anymore .
