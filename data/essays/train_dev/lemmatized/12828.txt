i am agree with the statement that say that succeccful people try new thing and take risk rather than only doing what they already know how to do well . in my personal oppinion , i think that taking risk and trying new thing we can have more exit in our life . if we do not know how to do something , we have to take the risk to learn to do that thing taht we do not know . maybe it will not be easy but it cold help u to grew up a a person and can help u to have exit . people who do not want to have exit in their life always do the same thing all their life . that wold be really boring and sad . as human being we have to have something to encourage u to be a better person . that something could be to try new thing . doing new thing we can open the door to reach the exit in our life wich thet is what everybody want ; also can endevelope the different skill that we have and we could realize our value a human being . to have exit in our life can help u to find the happines that we have been looked for all our entired life and can help u to share that happines with the person that we love , and also can encourage to others to follow and reach their dream and to be successful people . the commun idea that we have a human being of a succeccful person may be not the correct , most of people think that a person who ha exit in his or her life ha to be bad or corrupt but , no , everbody in this life can have exit if we want , the only thing that we have to do is take risk and try new thing in our life and of cours we have to have the desire to do it .
