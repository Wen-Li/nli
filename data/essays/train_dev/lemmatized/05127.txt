it is important to know a lot about economics and social science to predict in an appropriate way if the amount of used car will decrease in the next twenty year . is there any lack or shortage of car in our society ? it seems that every family and also every lonely living person ha at least one car . additional car are not required for the private use . because the population in my native country ( germany ) is not growing any more , it is likely to agree to the statement so far that the number of used car will probably not increase . it could stay constant . other question concern the alternative of driving a car . travelling by train is still very expensive in germany - the high prize for petrol are not worse . our train system still ha to solve many problem ( too many train are critically late , sometimes they are overboarded ) so that the possibility to use a train instead of a car ist not very attractive to many person . one completely different aspect is the availability of petrol in the future and how fast an adequate substitute can be found and introduced . maybe in twenty year , it could be the privelege of a few very rich people to drive a car , because the little accessible rest of petrol will have . how much car are needed for the industry ? and what is the tendancy how the indostrial need for car will develope during the next twenty year ? here i have to display my lack of knowledge . many article , chemical component and other thing have to be transported from one place to the other . the disire that the economy of a nation should grow for it 's own ` heath ' doe n't suggest that car could be le needed for oconomic purpose in twenty year . as a summary , it is visible that there are many different tendancys and development which make it almost impossible to predict the amount of used car in the year 2026 .
