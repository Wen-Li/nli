in my point of view , i would prefer to have broad knowledge of many academic subject than to be specialized in one specific subject . this essay will discus in the first part about the advantage for having broad knowleges of many academic subject and in the secound part about the drawback for being specialized in only one specific subject . to begin with , to have broad knowledge of many academic subject is very helpfull in the today 's world . to learn about many academic subjetcs give you the oportunity to have a lot of skill in several subject . in other word , it will give you the ability to take part in several conversation whatever the topic . furthermore , if you know something which doe not belong to your work sector , it will be seen a a real benefit . for example , if you work in a compmy and if you are the only one who know how to speak russian , your bos will appreciate even if your level of knowledge is low . and you will be seen a different from your co-worker . however , to be specialized in only one specific subject can be very frustrated . for instance , during a diner with some friend working in a very different activity sector from you , you will not have the level of skill to speak with them or to take part in the conversation . moreover , in a company , the bos like the fact that employee have several competence which are not necessary linked with the job and if you do not have these skill you will not be attracting for the company . to sum up , to have broad knowledge of many academic subject is for me very important . all the skill that you can have are always very helpfull whatever the level .
