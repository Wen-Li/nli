i disagree with the statement that young people enjoy life more than the older people do . from the simple obversation , young people have more activites in their everyday life than the older people . they go out for travel , go sporting , or dancing , and so on . they seem enjoy life more than the older people . but it is superficial . we ca n't get the conclustion just from the more activites they take . whether it is enjoying life or not depends on the quality , motivation , emotion of entertaiments and other deep factor . the motivation and quality of activity differ between the young people and the older people . this lead to the fact that the older people more enjoy life than the young people when doing entertainment . the older people usually have more spare time than young people . therefore , when they do their actitives , they really enjoy their time . but for young people , a lot of pressure always make their activites rush or pushy . most of time , the activity of young people just help them release and relax a little bit , because they will put themselves into tougher situation later or they just are exausted from a very tough time . the deeper factor affecting the conclusion come from social and psycholigical side . the society usually give more expectation to young people . on the other hand , the young people are still in the developing period . thus , there are many uncertainty enfronted by the young people . they need to develop themselves , recognize the society , and adjust themselves into the world . therefore , for the young people , chanllenges and unstability are good for them but they really bring many difficulities or obstacle for them , including physically and mentally . it is really hard to say thta they enjoy their life while facing so many problem . but for the older people , they have already experience most of their life . they are more calm , and stable . so , they are more enjoying their current time . in sum , young people do n't enjoy life more than older people do .
