some people prefer to to have alot of knowlege and they do n't like to focus on one subject but others like to focus on one subject and try to know every thing in that subject by specializing in it . i think it 's better to specialize in one specific subject rather that having knowledge of many subject because it 's better for the society , it make you more focused , and make you more successful . first of all , specializing in one subject is better for the society because you will be professional in the feild you work in and therfore you will carry your role in the community in the best way possible . also , people will depend on you in everything that is releated to the subject you are specialized in . for example , if you are a doctor that is specialized in heart disease every one will depend on you to help them with their heart problem and you will be helpful to your community . second of all , if you are specialized in one subject you will have all the time to focus on that subject and it will be easier to concentrate . having only one subject you will have the time to know more about that subject and learn extra information which will be useful to your subject . also , when you are studying you wo n't be frusturated and lost between many subject because you will have to focus on that subject . finally , it 's obvious that if you concentrate more on the same subject you will be more successful in your study which will lead to a successful career . knowing more about your subject by specializing in it will make you a professional worker and therfore more successful . in conculsion , specializing in one subject is far more better that having general knowledge in many subject because of the reason i explained above and many more reason . having general knowledge is not a useful a specializing in a certian subject especially if the subject you specialize in is an important subject .
