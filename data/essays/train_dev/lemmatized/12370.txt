i think it depends on people but i disagree that understanding idea and concept more importand for student than learing fact . i belived that there are some important point why to learn fact . people encourage to learn fact because of interested in really and to learn easily factinal information . for instance i would like to learn which tempertures doe water boil or how electrity come our home and how dishwasher doe work ? moreover , i would like to learn basic math to help my daily work . nowadays , young jenerations are very knowledge for evrything even child . they watch tv , read newspaper and resarch what happening in the world in spite of idea or cancepts . in sort of information is teached people different way . some student maybe can learn easly idaes and concept rather than learning fact . in my opinion which kind of necessary information we need , we can learn guickly . so learning fact are important for me and i prefer to learn it .
