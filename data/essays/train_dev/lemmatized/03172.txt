i definitly agree with the statement of `` successful people try new thing and take risk rather than only doing what the already know how to do . '' in this essay , i am going to state my view h in my opion , a successful people are willing to try new thing and take risk . first , they will not afraid of failure because trying new thing can help them to learn more and braoden their horizon . for example , a successful person , edison , who invented the light bulb wa used to be a normal boy whois good at study . but how come he can be a successful person ? it is because he wa willing to try new thing - to be an inventor . he took a lot of risk on doing the experiment , but he did not give up , ended up , became a successful people . despite there maybe a risk , they will still keep on trying new thing and take these risk to become a more successful person in the future . second , if a successful people only focus on doing what they already know how to do well , they are not that successful . they maybe successful in this short period only , a there are many other people try new thing and to be a more successful people . the successful period of that person is limited by himself , sooner or later , others learn his skill and he will no longer be a successful one . to conclude , i think that successful people should keep on trying new thing . they should not just keep on doing what they already how to do well , otherwise , people will not claim you a a successful person , they will tease on you because you think yourself is a successful people and
