some people believe that young people can enjoy life more than older poeple do . but from my point of view , the opposite is the truth . i think it is hardly for a young man to enjoy his life better than an older man . first of all , nowadays few young people are aware the purpose of their life . it is hard to say that a person could be happy without knowing the purpose of his life . instead , many of them idle their precious time . they do not know what they should care most in their life . older people , on the contrary , know exactly what their purpose are . so they do not care much over other trifle a young people do . they know how to set up a goal and keep chasing it . this is what i envy older people most . one of my cousin spent two year in a colleage and try to find her favorite major . but even now she can not make up her mind because she change her interest so frequently . furthermore , young people are not mature enough to control themselves . so they make more mistake . many young people do thing just out of an impluse , . sometimes it can be dangerous to do thing this way . as for older people , most of them know clearly what is right and what is wrong . they have their own judgement and they can often do thing according to their life experience . no wonder our young people always need an adult to teach u right from wrong . finally , young people are much easier to give in to temptation , especially in today 's society . they are not steady enough to avoid the bad effect of many negative thing in our society . but a for older people , they have seen much more than u , so they know when and how to say no to temptation . so , i think it is easier for an older person to enjoy his life than a young person . but i also believe we young people need guide and we learn how to live and enjoy our life through mistake and experience . as we grow older , we will enjoy our life better .
