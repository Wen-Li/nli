i partially disagree with the statement that is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subject than to specialize in one specific subject because i think that both the idea expressed in the statement are important and that one idea doe n't exclude the other one . in fact my opinion is that is very important to have an idea and a minimum knowledge about many academic subject . that 's an important thing because everyone should know almost the basis of general culture . i think that is n't a good thing when someone do n't know anything about one or several aspect of culture , for example about history , geography or science , also if the same person know very well one aspect in which he is really interested . it 's normal to focus our attention , energy and maybe also all of our life about the thing that we really consider important , but at the same time we should mind that these thing are fundamental only for u . for this reason it 's important to be informed , at least a little , about all the aspect of human worldwide society . but at the same time it 's impossible for someone to have a very deep knowledge about all the subject that could be studied . for this reason it 's also important the existence of people who are specialized in only one subject . for example i think that people who study something like science could n't make new theory if they should study with the same attention they use for science all the other subject ( like history , language and philosophy for example ) . i think that unfortunately it 's impossible to know everything . for this reason we should focus our attenction about what is really important for u but at the same time be interested to all the other thing that appear everyday in the world .
