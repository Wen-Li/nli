i think , it is absolutely necessary to understand the whole idea and the whole concept of a topic . on my opinion , only then it is possible the get the core and the intention of a topic . if student would only learn single fact , they would never receive a complete picture of a subject . they permanently would have single piece of information but never a whole picture , they would absolutely lack an overview of everything - like in a puzzle where some piece are missing . furthermore , all idea or concept themselves contain fact which are embedded into them , so it is not even possible to lern about an idea without learning - at least a few - fact . my experience ha shown that i have le problem to learn and to remember both , the whole idea a well a important fact and detail , when i have understood the whole topic . i have tried to learn only single fact a few time , for example at math , a subject i am not very good at . i only learnt single formula but had no idea about how all these formula worked together in any relationship . in those case i never got access to the deeper sense of the materia . another example i have already experienced , wa when i had to learn a lot for the university . especially in one management course there wa so much content during the whole semester , i really wa afraid i could not cope with . but at the end of the semester , when i had understood all idea of the content , all information matched and fitted together nearly alone . i really wa < in the topic > . so finally i could use all information i had to learn , because i knew what they were all about , i could categorize them and use them in the right way . i am sure , this would not have been possible , if i only had learnt the fact . summarizing , i think student get not only a better , but also a wider knowledge by understanding idea rather than single fact .
