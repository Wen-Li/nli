every thing in life have changed and this the fact that we can not diny and than we will give the exaccuse to the youg that they are not doing like the parent used to do to their community and i agree that they do not . first the sociaty ha chaged a their is no plenty of time a the old ginaration had for example the trafic and the communication now aday have more time and efford to go from place to place more than the time in the paset with the parent so the youg man doe not have the time to finsh his won need and doe not have the time to care with others , and also if we are taking in the same point of the communicatin it became more expansive to go from a place to another and the youg doe not have this enough money to go to help in other place . second the youg people have alot kind of intertenment in the life more than the last generation ha for example the youg people have a lot of movie they can go to wath and there is alot of place he can go with he friend so in his fre time he will prefer to go for dinner or movie insted of going to help the community in th cummun field like the parets did . third i thik that the sestem of the aducation is also responsible of this case a they did not teach the youth in the school the meanining and loving to help others in the community and how to be mumeber so when they grow and graduid they do not try to help a they did not learn how to do and to sum up and with all the sttment suggested above i think that we are all responseble of this case of the youth the parent in the house did not teacth them how to love their community aaaand how to help it and also the school the medium we are all responsible and if did not care for this problim we will not gain in the future the good result we all aim from those young people .
