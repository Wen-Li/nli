often happen that we can hear elderly complain about their condition , such a '' ohh my god , i am too much old , i don `` t do anything , i am tired . .. '' . instead usually youg people enjoy to be on youthhood , to be active , to go around . i think this fact is displayed in any family that ha got a grandmother or an elderly in general and some child . if is true that maybe we are get used to hear this king of thing i think that the real situation is different . first i think that when old people talk about their healt condition is only another way to tell `` hello i am here '' . after probably they certain don `` t fell so bad to involve that they fell sick . when you are old maybe can happen to be alone for long time , have got too much time to think . as a result you start to consider too much your feeling . image if you start to think that your foot hurt you , probably after one day you will be really hurted from that . why ? and if is only because the power of our mind sometime overcome our own sight . i don-t know if is true but often i thought to be sick and at the end it wasn-t anything . so can be . second what can you talk to someone that come to meet you if you during the day wa setting spending your time lookink the street , nothing i think . but now talk about the young . in my opinion is really bad listen some young guy that complains about his or hers age , probably he do be really sick , in his or hers mind . it is rare but sometime happen to listen these gender of people that spend their time continuosly claiming to be sick . you are not ! you have got the common problem that a guy can meet during his or hers age of growth . you are raising . by the end i think that every age ha got a good reasos to be live . when you are old because you childhood , when you are young because you are full of energy , the world seems under your foot , that wait only you . so probably the best thing that we can do is think by ourself , our result and what will happen tomorrow . the life is so a guess that we mustn-t be bored because sometime this don-t go where we want . life is life and age a well .
