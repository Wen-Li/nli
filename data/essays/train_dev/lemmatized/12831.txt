i agree with the statement that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide . i think the trip will be well-planned , enjoyable , and economical in this way . a tour guide usually know the resort well . therefore , he or she most likely ha a good plan of where to visit , where to eat , where to take picture , and where to stay for the night . i went to the niagara falls in a group led by a tour guide . the guide talked about the history and formation of the falls on the bus . we stopped at a small and good restaurant for lunch . in the afternoon , he took u directly to the best spot of view . i did not spent any time looking up a map and figuring out where to go . it is enjoyable to travel with a group led by a tour guide . we can talk on the way . we can also make friend with each other . we can help each other when needed . when i went to the smoky mountain last summer , we were talking and singing on the bus . it wa one of the best memory of my vacation . it is also economical to travel with a group led by a tour guide . people can share the expense of renting a bus or a car . they can share the expense on gas and toll a well . sometimes it is cheaper to buy bulk ticket than to buy each ticket individually . for example , if a ticket cost twenty dollar for one , it might only cost fifteen dollar each if you buy ten of them at the same time . these are the reason why i think it is a good idea to travel in a group led by a tour guide .
