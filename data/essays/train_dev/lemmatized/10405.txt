i definitely think that is very good and essential for an individual to have a broad knowledge of many academic subject . by knowing about many subject one is more comfartable in interacting with all kind of people because it will not be difficult to have a healthy conversation a we will not be totally unaware of what the other person is talking to u about . another important reason why we should have knowledge about different subject is that we never know what bad phase in life we might go through . to be able to stay put in all situation and to be able to work our way through all difficult time we should have at least the bare minimal knowledge required in every field . this broadens our horizon to work and not be stranded in various situation in life . if we have only specific knowledge about one field it is not always necessary that we may have enough luck in our fate to make it big in that field . to keep that door of opportunity open for u at all time we should have knowledge about a variety of thing in life . lets take the example of a simple clerk who ha been used to entering data into a register manually all his life . with the development of science and technology there will come a time in his professional life where his company might install computer to manage the data . the clerk would now be required to work on this new marvelous invention . if the clerk had always been satisfied throughout his life with his manual labour and would not have updated himself in this new technology he would have been blank a the the knowledge of computer and this would in turn lead to him losing his job where someone who is computer savvy might get the job ; but having been update with happening in different field the clerk would find it simple to navigate throught the system in turn making his work easier for himself . this wa a very small but ver effective example a to why we should be in touch with thing that are goin on around u . as they say ` little knowledge maybe dangerous ' . keeping this in mind i firmly believe and state that it would be in our best interest if we knew more thing about other field a well rather than just knowning everything about one .
