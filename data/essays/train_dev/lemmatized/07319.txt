some people may think that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide . however i disagree the statement for two reason . first , individual traveling is more interesting . scond , the tour guide is not always lead some good place . let me explane in detail . to begin with , backpacking is more interesting in travel . it is obvious that group tour is convenient , but i ca n't do myself in that case . and i ca n't improve a sense of independance . let 's take my experience for an example . when i wa sophmore , i had planed to travel to easten-asia . that is the first trip to out of korea , thus i wa too confused everything such a making passport , reserving ticket and scheduling my trip to think the method using the traveling company . however i decided to do own my on . finally i traveled to thailand and gained valuable exprience . after that i can do it everything myself and improve a sense of self-help . in this sense a group tour is not the best wat to travel . next , some bad tour guide lead commercial place to make money rather than good place . in the past , people doe n't go travel to other contry through the travel company . now , many peolple use tour-agency . thus there are so many side-effects . let 's take my friend experience for an example . he traveled to baly with his wife for marrige tour . likwwise other people , he used a tour guide in travel . first day , the guide lead beautiful place in baly and give interesting mention he prepard . however the second day , the guide lead the coupple to a treasure shop and silver shop and explansed that these good are most popular in this country and persuading him to buy the good . so he disappointed greatly . this show that the guide is always good . in conclusion , a tour guide is not the best way to travel for the reason that
