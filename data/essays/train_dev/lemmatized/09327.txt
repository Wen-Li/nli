indeed , many succeful people in the history were willing try new thing and take risk , but do all the succeful people try new thing and take risk ? i do n't think so . i think successful people are the one who are topest in thier field . if he or she can do one thing best , he or she will be a succeeful person . for this point of view , successful people do not always have to try new thing and take risk . we see some one who do somethings new and succeeds , so that we say succed people `` always '' try new thing and take risk . i think it 's too abrupt . we will say that , because we only see the succeful one . we have little chance to the failed one . trying new thing and taking risk also mean high prossibilty of failure . therefore , many people prefer to spend their time on what is already known . and they work hard so that they can outbeat their rival . also , only the `` try '' is not enough . we have to spend more time and energy to improve the invitation . and the improvement part are more annoying and complicate . if he or she are one who are only willing to spend their time to find or invite somethhimg new , but too lazy to improve it , he or she will not succeed . on the other hand , if there is a one who are willing to work hard to find the imporving way , one is more likely to succed that the original invitor or finder . take janpan for example . theamerican invite car , but they do n't spemd time to improve car . and janpanese spend a lot of time and money to improve car . now , janpan becomes the biggest contry producing car . therefore , i think the keypoint of success is not trying new thing , but willing to work hard or not .
