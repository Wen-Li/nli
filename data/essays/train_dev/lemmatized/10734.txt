this is a really common theme for these period . young people most of the time are not interested to help and to develop the community in which they live . just a small part of them is really interested at the topic . often this new generation is selfish and it is worried to satisfy their need instead to open their mind to the community . i can say that many thing are changed during these year , in the past the people s commitment wa much more developed and felled compared to these day . my parent , my grandparent really believed in the possibility to create a better place to live , moreover they tried with a lot of effort to improve activity that could let the community be a better place . there were the trust that something could change if you are really interested in what is around you . nowadays i think that the reponsability to take care of the community is disappeared at all - young people think that is not their problem being worried about the community enhacement , thus the common believe is that just the governament ha to promote and support it . furthermore the young people are not interested in this aim because there is not for them a clear return in term of money or materialistic benefit . this generation ha lost the beuty in believing on the power of the idea . they do not fight anymore for an idea but just for themselves . an example of the difference between the past and the current day could be provided by a short story told me by my granfather in the 1940 my grandfather wa very interested to the problem of our town . he wa a person that ha tried to improve the economical condition of our city and to develop the spirit for the community . in that period in my small city thre were not a cinema . the citizen of that time complained most of the time for this kind of lack , even because in that period the cinema wa something new and it appealed most of the people . my grandfather wa the one who invested money and finally bought the first cinema odf my town . everbody can remember him firstly a a good person a then a someone who did at least some effort to take care of the community .
