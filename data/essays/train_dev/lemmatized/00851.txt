party going , loud , naughty , nasty fast driver , rule breaker . .. these are some quality that people accross nation , countires and community associate youngster with . they always think that it is them , who are the black sheep . they never look at the other side , this energetic group ha to offer . agreed that they take a lot of thing lightly , but when it come to extending a helping hand towards community work , i strongly feel that they are the first one to pitch in . there are many example where young people have worked together in harmony to achieve result that were surprising . craig keilburger , matt johnson are two vivid and huge example . `` kids can help the child '' , thats what craig keilburger thought . he started campaigning in the united states at an early age of 15 . he wanted young people to come together , to share idea and resource to reach one goal , that they all shared - ` make the child strong , for tomorrow they make the world strong ' . his work started from his neighborhood in a small town in new york . he and his friend started by collecting old clothes , toy , book and even saved a part of their pocket money . once the collection wa sufficient they would go out and distribute it among the needy and the desperate . he gained recognition and fund started to pour in , helping him expand his work from his neighborhood to the nation and finally to the entire globe . his foundation now consists of thousand of `` young '' member who constantly work together . thanks to them , thousand of child accross the globe now have food to eat and school to attend . craig is an example to big to believe ? wait until you hear about matt johnson . the johnsons lived in a slum in a chicago suburb that wa famous for it notorious crack dealing . the policeman , the fire department , and even the medical emergency staff kept away from it . it all started when daphne , matt 's friend got hit by a baseball during play . the ball hit her eye and wa bleeding badly . they called 911 , but no help arrived and eventually she lost her eye . this angered matt to the limit . the next day onwards he started from the basic thing like cleaning up his neghborhood , his friend joined him and they worked until they cleared all the bad notion that people had about their community . to sum it up , i think it would be very unfair on anyone 's part to say that youngster do not help in community work . i think that people must recognize their effort and appreciate it .
