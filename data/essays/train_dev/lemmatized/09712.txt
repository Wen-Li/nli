the question mention two type of knowledge . having broad knowlegde of many subject and specializing in one subject . having a broad knowlegde mean a lot of subject but le information . specializing in one subject mean le subject but tonne more information . they both have advantegs and disadvantage . having a broad knowledge of many subject mean that you have le infromation about many subject . having knowlegde on a wide range of subject is a good thing becuase it mean that you understand a lot about many thing . however a it will be only broad mean that you will only get the basic infromation you need , therefore this wont be enough to answer or fulfil certain thing . i think you should only have a broad knowledge of thing when you want to be general in thing you should do . example a general doctor should have a broad knowledge of what different disease are and their symptom . specializing in one subject mean you only do one subject but you concentrate on it and you will get more information about the subject you are doing . by specializing in one subject it menas that you will have more time to concentrate on the subject you are doing which will make you a a person an expert in that subject . in some profession you will need to specialize in one subject , such a being a professer in a college or university . example and geology lecturer should specialise in geology , this will make him have more infromation about geology a he will have more time to concentrate on what he is doing and learning . this will result in a more effiecient professor ! from my point of you i see that they both are good and beneficial depending on what you are going to do i the future and what you think is good for you . if you want to know that basic of many subject and have be a bank of basic infromation that go for a broad knowledge of many academis subject . on the other hand if you want ot be an expert in what you aare doing then specialise in the subject that you want to be an expert in a you will have a much greater knowledge about your subject , this is laso becuase you will have more time to concentrate on your subject .
