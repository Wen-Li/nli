nowadays , young people have very busy life and it can be thought that they do not spend enough time helping their community . in fact i disagree with that point of view and i think young people do a lot for humanity in the daylife of their community . first of all , young people are very implicated in education of younger . i have a lot of friend who give mathematic support lesson to child after class or who help younger student to prepare for their exam . in my view , helping in education is very important and this kind of help is very valuable for the society . secondly i have noticed on several occasion that young people are very helpfull to elderly people . some student help elderly to do shopping ; others go for a walk with disabled people . these example show that young people are very implicated and feel concerned about the elderly in their community . finally younger citizen are usually the most implicated in humanitary project in their city . many organisation helping disabled people like patient who suffer from toxicomania or unemployed people were raised by young leader who were very involved in finding funding to realize their project . moreover when there is a natural disaster in a town , we usually see that the younger are the first on the field . in conclusion , i trully think that young people are very concerned by the condition of living in their community . despite their lack of time and money , they are really motivated to help people in need and are often more implicated in helping their community than the elderly . their differents action are very encouraging for the future of our community .
