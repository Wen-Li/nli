according to this statment , i think that student should learn the fact more than just understand the idea and concept because if they just understand the idea and the concept , they are n't really understand what they have learn . and , if they just understand the idea and the concept , they ca n't use what they have learn in the future . if student just understand the idea and the concept , they do n't know what they have already learn . for example , a student want to learn how to swim , he know the idea and the concept , but he doe n't try it before . he thnks that he know how to swim ; however , he doe n't . or if a student is learning how to play piano , he listens to the teacher teach him how to play the piano , he know many thing about how to play a piano , but he doe n't play the piano before . doe he know how to play a piano ? the answer is not , he doe n't know how to play it . because he is just a paper soldier , he just know how to talk , but not to play . nevertheless , if student learn the fact , they can use it in the future . student study many thing at school , but there are only a little knowlegal they can use in the the future . for example , if the studens study business at school , after they finish the school . they can be the businessman . if some people study nursing at school , they can be a nurse in the future . however , if those people just understand the idea and the conceptsat school , they will mkae some trouble in the future . there are many thing happen suddenly , if they do n't now the fact , they ca n't slove the problem if they should face the problem at that time . however , if they have learn the fact , it is easier to slove a problem than they just understand the idea and the concept on everythings . therefore , student must learn the fact of everything when they are at school because it will affect their future if they just understand the idea and the concept about everythings
