it is said that the understanding idea and concept is more important than learning the fact . there are many student who only try to check the fact because they are used to the test asking the choice of solution . however i think learning without understanding idea and concept is not effective and meaningless . to begin with , many student who do n't understand the profound idea and concept of the fact will not be able to solve the problem successfuly when they face the a little bit different problem . even though the problem request student to find the other aspect of the general fact , student always apply the same fact to solve problem , moreover , they can not realize what the mistake of their solution is . my brother graduated from a famous high school in korea with a good grade . however , when he studied in the university , he suffered from the lack of the understanding an important idea and concept of the fact . because the university education needed him to think over the problem considering the concept and idea . he finally gave up getting a degree in the university . at second , when student focus on the fact , they can not develope the skill that is necessary in the real life . we have to do many activity such a finding a problem and suggesting the sitable solution in the company . at that time , we sometimes need to get the different point of general view for the more innovative solution . however , the student having no understanding of basic concept and idea could get the unique point of view . in conclusion , i can not agree the learning the only fact is enough to overcome and solve the every situation . without understanding idea and concept , there is no way to find the real method to solve the complex situation . so we need to motivate the student get the understanding of the profound concetps and idea of the fact .
