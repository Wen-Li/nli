if i had to refer only to my personal experience i would have to completely agree with the statement . fortunately not every youngster is like me . i must confess that i have never taken part to community service , which in my home country , italy , young men could choose a an alternative to military service . a bill ha been passed that free my generation from military service and thus also from `` compulsory '' community service . i might have justfied my behavior by saying that nowadays the sense of community that used to animate the life of suburbia and countryside village ha been lost ; that work condition and habit have changed and all in all people are le and le tied to their own community . they think and act global . but the fact that i am selfish doe not imply that so are my fellow citizen of the same age . i have many friend devoted to at least one community service activity . my best female friend ha been active in the emergency transport service , that brings patient to emergency room and hospital for the past five year and she is still on duty once a week every thursday night . it is worth to mention that in italy this service is run on a voluntary basis . finally one can extend what i have mentioned about the fading of local community and claim that the young should take care of the global communtiy and especially it poorest member . more and more young woman and men are now spending their holiday in non governmental organization active in the poorest part of the world . as far a i am concerned i have never joined these program , but my sister and some frinds of mine did last year . they were helping in a small hospital in satellite town of kolkata , india . so , hopefully , the picture is not so bleak , at least a long a my friend persist in their altruism .
