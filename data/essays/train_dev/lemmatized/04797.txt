the statement that the young people do not give much time for helping their community is a genaralised statement which ha to be debated upon . i feel that the young person 's tendency to help mainly depends on the kind of atmosphere he dwells in and the basic nurture that ha been provided to him in his younger year . a person who ha seen the difficulty of life in his young age is prone to actually understand the situation of the helpless . that empathy is the driving force for the youth to help people . we have seen many personality all over the globe . some of them being mother theresa , hellen keller and mahathma gandhi . if we look deeply , it wa their young day that facilated and ignited their mind to sacrifice their life for their community . this point rightly speaks for the youth . we saw a lot of protest and active participation from the youth right from the twin tower tragedy to the katrina . young people hae always been there for their community in the point of distress . the other side of today 's youth picture student roaming around with gun and the rapid addictionof today 's youth to drug and other habit . empathy can surely not be expected from these youth . where there is no empathy there is no place for service . the young people today can not be catogarised on a general scale in this aspect . there are a lot of young people who take up their life 's aim a service at the same time there are a lot of them who act in the opposite direction . furthur more , the increased terrorist attack and the increasing hostility of the surroundinds serve a a catalyst to the youth of today to stand up for their community . so i think that a sensible part of the youth is rightly giving it part for the community
