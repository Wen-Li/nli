i always think to myself , what will my grand parent do when i am having fun or boredom in school . everytime i go pas by old people , they sit on a bench holding the leesh of their dog and watch people walk pas by . but their truth of enjoyment wa something else , something more impressive and tearful . therefore , i believe that they may not be enjoying their life in my sight , but they are certainly enjoying more than u , younger kid . when i wa at my grand parent ' place , i wa investigating what they would do for the 24 hour . their bed time wa worth half of my bed time and their tv time wa worth not even the half of my tv time . and even , when i wa trying to entertain them by teaching them how to use the computer , they sleighed the mouse on to the computer screen which made me give up on them . then , i realized that their enjoyment wa something else , which young people can not possibily feel . when it wa my bed time , my grand mother wa staying up watching a series of drama . i interrupted her asking what is her entertainment in life and she answered me that her enjoyment of life is all about watching me and my mother 's day go past by safely and our fulfiment of laughter is instantly her pleasant laughter . and the next thing she said to me is that she is enjoying so much of her life that she would not regret for living , even if she dy the next day . in conclusion , i do not know how their own enjoyment of life work , but all the tearful saying that my grand mother had made for me touched my heart and therefore , i believe that older people enjoy their life more than u , younger kid who only know how to play computer game .
