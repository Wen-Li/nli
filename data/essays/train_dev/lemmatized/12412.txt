i think it is much better to speiclalize in a certain subject . for the following reason . first , in modern soceity , a the science have depeloped countless subject like clozing technique have been created . in addition , the subject can be classified to many branch that contains a lot of infomatrion . so if you try to have broad knowlege of many academic subject , you will end up skimming only the surface of them and you will not practically know the subject . on the other hand , by choosing one or two speicif subject learner can focus on them . if you specialize the subject . you might improve and develop the subject that wll provide a great benefit to the society . second , if everyone want and try to have broad knowlege and avoid specializing a subject . there will be no future in each subject . they will lose the heir of reseach and not only be developed but also begin to regress . as the result , the society will no more expect to gain benefit form academic subject and reseach . third , if each person specialize one thing , he might interact with others who have other specifict information . tthere are many case that a ceatain subfect will require some information on other sujects . for example , take a look at an erectric dictionary . you can benefit from it very much . but what if there is no specific technique to desigh and produce an erictric badged could only good translator and interpreter make en erectric dictionary ? it will need both the tranlators and erectric engineer and even more expert on different subects . i definitely suggest that people should specialize one and help others in case
