today , many older people tend to travel all around the world , live in abroad , enjoy their hobby , going to older people 's school for talking and playing with same age people after retiring their job . thus , i disagree with this statement `` youn people enjoy life more than older people do . '' many travel company tend to make travel plan and long-stay in abroad plan for only older people these day . for example , my parent are thinking of traveling all around the world and living in abroad to relax and enjoy their rest of life after retiring their job . my university teacher ha been talking same kind of thing . in addition , i know some older people who live in abroad . i agree with their thinking because they have worked very hard and have not seen the whole world . older people can have a lot of free time to enjoy their hobby . they do not need to care about time . thinking about young people , they also have free time when they are student . during going to school , they can travel , study about their interest , stick to their hobby . however , after graduating school , they need to work and they have much le free time . thus , i think older people enjoy life same a young people do . or might enjoy more than young people becuase they do not need to anything . in my opinion , i would like to enjoy retired life , but i would like to enjoy more when i am young . this is because to get a job which i want to do , and to get a happy life , i need to see the world by own my eye . traveling around the world is very fun to me , and this would also benefit my future . by the way , i really hope that my parent would have very enjoyable life after retire .
