although i can understand why some peolpe have the impression that young people today are not engaging themselves enough to helping their community , i disagree with this statement . i have three reason for my opinion . first , in my view , young people have to dedicate most of their time to their education and career . as the unemployment rate in most country increase year after year this is the only way for young people to asure themselves a job in the future . for example , young people have to attend college or university , they have class during the day and usually homework to do in the evening . some student also have to work part-time to be able to afford the university fee . second , a lot of young people are planing their own family when they are still young . when you have child on your own you need time to raise them . children need a lot of attention a they always have so many question about the world and a lot of reasearch paper state that the intellectual capability of child are influenced most at a very young age . so parent should take all the time they need to raise their child and explain everything to them . finally , i am convinced that even though young people do not have a lot of free time , still many of them do engage themselves to helping their community . i would like to give two example of the community i live in . in our community especially young people are part of the first aid team of the local red cross . they spend their time doing different volunteer service , like medical help or entertainement for older people . furthermore , the fire department of our town ha a special youth organization for people aged below 17 year . for the last five year the volunteer member of this youth organization have increased steadily . concluding , i think that young people today have a lot of important activity and obligation like their own education or the founding of their own family which prevent them from giving more time to helping their community . but i also have the impression that young people still engage in their free time a much a they can to improve their community ' condition .
