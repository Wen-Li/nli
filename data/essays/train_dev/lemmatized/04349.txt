people should take risk and try new thing , to be successful . life doe not give u a list full of opportunity . we must create our own chance . as we look through history , we can understand that every succesful person did something new . scientists who discovers incredible thing or artist who think more creative are called `` successful '' in our time . the thing which make kandinsky or picasso is that , these people tried new thing . they were not afraid to create `` cubism '' or the other art technics . the leader such a martin luther king or ataturk , battled even if it seems impossible . victory can not be won without taking risk . there are so many example to give , our own life are also example . for example , at school i asked a question about a murder which had happened in my country . it wa such a question that should not be asked but everybody know about . it wa a new thing , to ask about politics and talk about them in class . that question created me a new job opportunity , when a modern professeur heard about it . i learned that , we should not be afraid to ask , to search and to judge because it is the only way to win . in every novel or in every movie , there is a hero who make everything better for himself or others by taking risk . last night i watched a movie called `` pursuit of happiness '' which depends on a real story . in the movie there wa a man who ha no money and a 5 year old kid . he turned from an unknown person to a world wide hero . after all , i can say that , people should try new thing and take risk . it is the only way to be successful . otherwise , they may not have the life that they want to live .
