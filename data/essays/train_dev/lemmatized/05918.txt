as a country progress , enhances it economic power , it also lead to an increase in the purchasing power of the people in the country . in twenty year time , people are expected to have higher income and purchasing power than at present . having a house and a car are basic necessity and it doe seem indispensable to most of u . i totally disagree with the statement that in twenty year there will be fewer car in use than they are at present . i will support my opinion in the following paragraph . the first reasoning that i would like to put forward is that a a country is moving from an under-developed to being a developing country or a developing country to a developed country , over time it will lead to increase in employment level , which will subsequently lead to a rise in the income level and purchasing power of the people . for instance , in my own country , india , there are a lot of individual and family who own car today than the last twenty year . the traffic for car in city like delhi and bombay , where the income level are rising rapidly , there is also evidence of more number of car in such place . the statistic show the number of person owning car have only been increasing over the year . the second reason that i would advance for my argument is , that car is a very convenient mode of transportation . personally , i feel , it is more convenient for most of u than air plane , bike , bus and other mode of transportation . it offer a kind of flexibility which is incomparable . its very practical for everyday use . the third reasoning would be it ha a lot of utility for people with family , which all of u do ! a situation where most people are owning their own air plane or bus is not quite palatable to me . cars have also become very sophisticated and user-friendly these day . there are a whole whole of model and price to choose from . to conclude , car , in my opinion , fall under the category of a ` need ' and not a ` luxury ' . what could possible happen twenty year down , is that the car could get even more sophisticated . there could be even more model for car , much more than what is present today .
