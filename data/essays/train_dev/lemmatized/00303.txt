in my opinion , i do not agree the statement , for i believe there are three major point that can help to increase the number of car : new resource , growing population , and new technolgies . these element will continue to push up demamds for car . first , we are now developong new energy resource substitute fossil fuel ; for example , solar energy and hydrogen energy . these energy have two fascinating point ; they are safe to environment without producing any chemical substance causing pollution problem . and , they are obtaind almost infinitely . by refining these new technoligies can be applied in twenty year and we can use car without harming our planet . that can be a strong element for the favor of car . second , the convenient system in car are enhancing it ability . for example , today we can reach destination without losing our way thanks to the navigation system supported by satelite communication . moreover , the safety of the car is improving ; the physical strength of the car body is becoming incredibly strong these day saving many driver life . these new supporting system or technology provide more confort to the car user , which mean the consumption for the car will keep strong in future . third , the rapid growth of population in the world is going on for at least twenty year . this mean there will be growing demand for the car continously . although we are also tryng to create new type of train such a renior motored car that is moved by magnetic power , i think people tend to buy car that can provide safe energy and fabulous convenience . actually , i experienced the subway newly constructed wa not so used by citizen in new delhi , india . as stated above , there are three aspect supporting the stromg demand for car : the development and application of new resource , new technology and system give drive more relaxing atmosphere , and the exposion of number of people who need car in the world . in twenty year , it is quite sure .
