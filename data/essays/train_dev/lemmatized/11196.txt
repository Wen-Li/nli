to predict the future ha always been a difficult task or at least a task that requires either a great deal of imagination or a deep knowledge of science and of it actual development . therefore what i can do now is a simple hypothesis based on my personal experience and on what i read on the newspaper . basically i think that the statement is correct and that it is very likely that in the future man will use le car then nowadays . this is for several reason . first , a the problem of air pollution will increase , new technology will be discovered in order to make the problem le urgent and hopefully to solve it . i would therefore imagine that instead of car others mean of transportation could be used . for instance , small airplane fueled by hydrogen . second , the actual trend go in the direction of reducing the time in doing thing in general and in moving from a place to an other in particular . it is a common experience in the life of each of u the morning traffic jam in which we get stuck . third , probably in the long run it will decrease the need to phisically moving in order to fullfill ceirtain task . the movement will be in the ` virtual world ' instead that in the real one . in other word , internet , connecting people who live in different part of a country , will dramatically decrease the need of transportation . in fact , it is something that it is already happening . summarizing what i am trying to express , there are both reason of health and pratical necessity that will lead to a situation of le car and this will be made possible and affordable throught technology .
