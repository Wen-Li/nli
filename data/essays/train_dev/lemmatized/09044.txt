in mordern society , student always face the dillemma that which one is more important between understanding idea and learning fact . this problem is the much debated one in that it affect everyone in their daily life . some people prefer the first one to another and others have on opinion about it . before rending my opinion , i think it is necessary to take a galance of the argurments from both the side . it si quite easy for average people to choose learning fact because the several obvious reason that learning fact is more interesting , is easier and so on . although learning fact ha some advantage , it also ha many drawback such a you don not understand it deeply . therefore we have no complete evidence to suggest that learning fact is always better than unerstanding idea . what is more , the innate quality of understanding idea , unfortunally , is ofter \ n underestimated ; in other word , if you notice the invisable benefit of understanding idea , you can understand it more deeply . here i want to explain a few of the most important reason . it is the ability to think that is the first aspect of understanding idea that people view profoundly . to illustate this , there is an appropriate example that is very persuasive . my parent are professor , so they usually teach me systematically to understand idea and put this on the prist place since i wa a kid . as the time going on , i gradually become a person with ability to think . and this is very useful to me because this ability make me more creative . besides , the further reason why i advocate this is because that it is widely acknowledged that interesting is an indispensable part to the student ' studing and this issue is becoming a certain concern to many expert . to me , i think understanding idea is more interesting than learning fact . they are more attractive and fascinating finally , i think understanding idea is easier for student to understand . because fact could be differently in many condition and they might influenced or change due to other factor . in contrast , understaning idea is more straight , is better for the student who don not have good intellecgence to learn . taking into all these factor in to account , we may safely arrive at the conclusion that understanding idea is more important for student and it is more desire u to endeavor and we also could desire a special fulfillment and pleasure
