i agree with the statment `` the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide '' because i think travling with a group will cost le money and give more fun , also the tour guide show u more place to have fun with and help u to orgnaizen the trip . first of all , travling with group help u economically by make u share housing , and travling cost . for example , if you decided to travel by car alone you will have to pay the gas by yourself . but if you travel with group by car at lest three people will go with you at the same car and that will divid the amount of money payed for gas by four which mean you will pay only one-fourth of the gas money . also if you travel with friend , you will share the room with somebody and that mean you will pay half the price of the room . so it save money . second , you will have more fun . imagen that you will travel by yourdelf , play with yourself , and get picture of yourself by yourself ! would not that will be boring . but imagen if everyone play with you , hang out with you , and take picture of you and the other : would not that considerd more fun . however , sometime even if you are travling with group you might not have fun because you do not where to go , or where is the importnat place that you need to visit and to prevent that from happening you must have a tour guide . the tour guide is important because he/she will orgnaize the trip by makimg scaduale for the touresm place and attraction , help u find the perfect place to live in and the perfect way to get there , and be responsible for the direction we need on the trip . finally , i think travling with group or friend and escorting by a tour guide is the best way in travling . becuase it make the trip more enjoyable , cheaper , and much organize .
