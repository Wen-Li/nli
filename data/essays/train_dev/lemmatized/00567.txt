in my opinion , older people enjoy life more than young people do , although both of them have their own unique way of enjoyment . young people mostly spend their time away from home enjoying outside , whereas older people enjoy most of their time spendind at home itself . one reason may be that they are not strong enough to move around at that age or may be they have enough spent their time outside during their young age . younger generation are involved with studying and career development , where most of their teenage is run off . in contrast , older people must have either retired by then and so they can enjoy without any thinking for the future . moreover , responsibility arrest the younger generation from enjoying their own life . this doe not happen with older people a all their responsibility might have been finished by then . for example , a younger person working ha support his family finacially and should be responsible towards everyone in the family . so , most of his time ha been spent in accomplishing his goal and supporting the family . older people enjoy more because of lack of obligation at their age . although , younger people pas their time with friend , they do only occasionally . first few year of teenage is spent in studying , after graduating jod search start . later , work tension builts up stressing in all aspect . so , there is hardly anytime left over for joy in life . in contrast , a the older people have already passed through these stage of life , they are absolutely free of such work pressure and hence enjoy their life to the maximum extent . another factor is money . older people are financially more strong than young people and so spend a much a they can because , they dont need to give explanation for the money they spent a do the young people . to conclude , older people enjoy more than the young people .
