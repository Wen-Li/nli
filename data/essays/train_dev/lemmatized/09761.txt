today , in the bachelor degree of the university , many people take the double major and try to pursue the various aspect of academic subject . although i graduated from only one major of bachelor degree , i believe that it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subject than to specialize in one specific subject . first , by having many academic subject , one can acquire not only broad knowledge but also the wider scope of opinion and way of thinking from many subject . to sepcialize in one subject may lead he or she have the narrow minded or way of thinking and may have difficulty to accept different opinion since he or she concentrate into one subject . second , by having many subject , one may not get bored with the subject he or she take during the university . when one go to school , school life is a big part of everyday life . on one hand , if he or she concentrate into one subject , it can be bored after year . on the other hand , if he or she have variety of subject in school , topic of study change and it may be more interesting to study . third , if one ha taken many academic subject or double ( or more ) major , it must be easier to get a job after the graduation . one ha more academic experience to write about in resume and he or she can apply to more variety of job . however , to specialize in one specific subject is more suitable for people who want to be specialist in the business . in conculsion , the variety of knowledge result in people to have wider understanding and way of thinking by the background of many academic subject people study in school .
