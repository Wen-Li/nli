there are many way or system for education . some system prefer to educate a teaching idea and concept , and some system are teaching the fact . i strongly agree and support the idea that learning fact is always the most important thing in an education . lecturer and teacher mu encourage their student to face the fact instead of living in a dream world . in our day there are many research about physicoligacal condition of young people . big percentage of the young people involved in these research are unhappy and complaining for their life . the reason for this is , they are not at the position they demanded to be . because they were living in a dream world when they were teenager . nobody told them the true and the fact of the life . on the other hand if you tell a student always about any ancient greek hero or scholar lived in a historical time and always support the idea that the hero stated , the student will begin to thing with the character you presented . but the student can not seperate and understand the conflict between the idea of this character and the fact of our decade , due to his \ her young age . the other problem is our life is different than before . when you make a mistake , the result ha worse impact than before . that result may lead a terrible effect to the student future life . the best idea to avoid these bad result , teacher must perform the meeting of the student with the fact a soon a they can . the worst thing is any bad experience that is impossiple to correct .
