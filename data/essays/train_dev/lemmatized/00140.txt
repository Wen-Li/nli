although most advertisement company state insistantly that they are deeply considering the ethical issue in advertisement , i think most of the advertisement produced by these company are exaggrated . firstly , these company are taking high amount of money from customer and a a result they want to appreciate these customer . rather than using creativity in preparation process , they just exaggrate the property of the product . after all these deception , the product can be perceived much more valuable by the public . in order to avoid these type of misleading advertisement , there should be an effective control mechanism like a properly working group which investigates the advertisement before they are published . a second solution might be strict regulation like fining the misleading company etc . secondly , these advertisement only emphasizes the positive attribute of the product but give no information about it drawback . in this way , people who buy the product , do not the weak point of the product . for instance , a product which can clean only smooth surface might be used by the owner on rough surface which will probably cause deformation to the product . here , it can be stated that this problem is caused by the advertisement which did not include the constraint of the product . finally , there is a great competition between the product of different company which cause the omittion of some ethical value . rather than stating the drawback , praising is a common style in the advertisement . to conclude , the advertisement are misleading in most way and these fault must be corrected by mean of proper control mechanism . furthermore we should know that frankness is the most important virtue on the earth .
