definetly i agree with the idea that young people enjoy more life that older one mainly because we get knowledge in an eassier way , we emphasize on the importance of the cooperation skill and in general because we have a better sense of humor . firstly , young people assimilate the existing and new information efficiently . we are like an empty box to which we add new idea and conception . for instance , we addecuate perfectly to the information age by the use of internet , i/pod or new device . moreover we learn without much difficulty foreign language like english , chinese or french . consequently , we enjoy the new benefit of this age . secondly , young people like working on group which is essential for developing the cooperation skill and fit better on this age . nowadays everybody is inter conected and the enviroment is more complex than before by the existence of more competidors therefore a team work is vital if we want to survive , moreover young are the one who practice it perfectly because we do not find any difference among people or we do not have erronous conception from the past . this skill let u make a lot of friend and enjoy much better our job and study hour . therefore we enjoy more our life . thirdly , young people have a better sense of humor . this skill let u find the possitive side of the thing . for instance i do not get too much depressed when thing do not go well but my parent do , getting depressed many time . to sum up , a far a i am concerned young people beacuse of their atitud to life like assimilating new idea without any problem , having innate the cooperation skill or having a good sense of humor enjoy more life than older people .
