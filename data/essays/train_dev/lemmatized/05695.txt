i strongly agree with the given statement . from my point of view understanding idea and concept should be the top priority for student than learning fact . there are many strong reason that have influenced me in accepting this statement . these reason are presented in the subsequent paragraph . firstly , it my firm belief that student should have a solid understanding of concept and idea . this would build them up in such a way that they would be in a position to further research these idea and present their point of view . research ha also shown that student understand better when they have a firm grip over the fundamental . secondly , understanding idea and concept would develop and hone their analytical ability . the analytical ability is now a crucial factor in judging the intellect of an individual . thirdly , mere learning of fact with out understanding the concept would encourage rote memorization . this would hinder the development process of a child . this would make him a mere data storage device . fourthly , when we learn from fact especially historical fact much depends on the authenticity of the information that ha been provided . it is quite possible that the information provided by archaelogists or historian might have been altered by the then existed government . governments might alter the information provided by them , when they think that it would hurt the sentiment of people or cause a conflict among different socio-cultural group . fifthly , i feel that in this age of technology mere learing of fact would not suffice . the technological innovation demand an individual to have critical thinking ability , strong analytical skill and a firm grip over the basic of the subject . only when the basic are strong can a student understand the innovation and further research the idea . i strongly feel that `` only when the root are strong can a tree stand tall and firm . '' these are the compelling reason that have influenced me in stating that understanding idea and concept is far better than learning fact .
