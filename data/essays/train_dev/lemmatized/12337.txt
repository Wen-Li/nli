the program of study course require a thorough preparation and in order to make the best choice in this preparation you should keep in accountvarious factor , for instance what is most important for a student to learn and here come our question : is it more important for a student to understand idea and concept or to learn fact ? i do n't completely agree with the statement that understanding idea and concept is more important than learning fact because i think that both thing are important : understandig idea and concept is necessary because theory is the basis of any subject and you must know it , on the other hand , if you only know theoretical idea and concept you wo n't be in touch with the reality and , a a consequence , you probably wo n't be able to use your theoretical knowledge in practice . furthermore you should n't forget that theory come from experince and the object of experience are fact so , in order to have a complete view of thing , a student should both understand concept and idea and learn about fact . concepts do n't come out of nowhere , for instance , a lot of scientific discovery aroused from noticing some unusual fact that were analysed and led to some theory that were demonstrated . therefore , if we only understand and memorise concept and idea we miss a lot of element that help u to understand thing more in depth . a good example of how learning fact is a important a understanding concept and idea can be given by the study of history : if we study a political theory , we understand it in depth but we do n't have any idea of how it wa actually implemented we will have just a partial view of this idea , based only on theoretical element and we wo n't be able to figure out wether it is good or not wether it is realistic or not wether the man who elaborated wa right or not in his view . in conclusion a must say that , in my opinion student should both understand concept and idea and learn fact .
