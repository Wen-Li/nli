i disagree with this statement a we can see the incerease in traffic day to day . if we see the graph drawn between number of vechiles on the road year wise , we can see the increase rapidly . this show how the people are using the vechiles . nowadays we can see every family owns a car and it ha become a must-have thing . most of the people use their car to go to the office or work place , and you can use your own car to travel to different place instead of hiring a cab . the cost of car have come down in recent year making it easy for common people to buy them and most bank and financial institute provide different scheme to purchase a car . through these scheme most of the middle class family buy a car for their personal use . if you own a car , you need not worry in a emergency situation like calling the ambulance for sudden health problem of family member . the other reason is if a family is planing to go on a vacation to a different state , they can use their own vechile instead of hiring a cab . they can move around the city and go to any place they wish to . if they have their own vechile they wo n't be any problem for a late night party . they wo n't have any problem look for a cab in the late night to get back home . and a resale market have come up , people sell their old car for a new one . i strongly belive that in the next 20 year , there would be double the amount of car you find right now on the road . every common person use the car for all his activites like goign to the park in the morning , goign to his office or work place , and goign to a late night party , and going out for shopping of household thing etc . so i disagree with the statemen that they would be fewer car in the next twenty year .
