having a broad knowledge of many academic subject seems more interesting than specializing in only one subject , however , we ought to determine all the advantage and inconvenients to make our mind , i am convinced about the great importance of mastering at least several subject in order to increase our general knowledge , it seems nowadays indispensable to be aware of a lot of subject that belong to varied for example , we are to be able to talk about politics , ecology , communication and business , and this would not be possible if we did not get broad knowledge in history , biology or mathematics , if not , we will not feel concerned about very important subject that are part of our life , that the reason why we need to accumulate a lot of knowledge while we are still in college , after being part of this learning process , and only after that , you will be able to choose one specific subject that corresponds truly to your personality , your skill and your motivation . then , you might be further in the subject you have chosen to express yourself in the best way , whether if you were previously not interested in other general subject , i am afraid that it would be difficult to envision thing in a very mature and complete way , to conclude , you should have a look around you to be open6minded whatever your speciality may be in order to be able to use a wide range of skill ,
