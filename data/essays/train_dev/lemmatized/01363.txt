i agree with that it is more inportant for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact . here are three reason to support my agreement . the first reason is that the idea is the most important one of everythings . only you know the main idea about it , you can think about more detail and ask more question . furthermore , the concept are the main body of the lesson or something like that . you should understand the concept and after that you can learn other information . for example , if a student ca n't understand the idea and concept of the chapter at accouting class , he doe n't know what this chapter talking about . then , he gain nothing on accouting class . the worst thing is that he will fail the class . the second reason is that understanding is more basic than learning . you can learn something after your understanding . for instance , in order to learn how to read , you should to understand what doe reading mean . it mean you should see the word in the paper and say them . therefore , you must gain the idea and concept of reading . after understanding those , you can learn other thing such a different kind of reading method and how to read . moreover , when people are talking about reading , the first appear in your brain is the meaning of reading . it is the basic one . the third reason is that idea and concept are always put in the front of the book such a outline . you can know what is the author mainly mention about in the book becuase of the idea and concept . then , you can read the book from first page to the end and learn the detail and fact . generally speaking , it is normal when you read book and learn them . on the whole , you ca n't learn the detail and fact without having known about the idea and concept . it is more important for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact . sometimes , it is enough for them to know idea and concept . there is no need to learn fact .
