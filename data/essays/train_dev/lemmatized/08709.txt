personally , i agree with the statement that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their community . it is for the following reason . first , young people have to learn more skill to compete with other people for survive . second , young people are more selfcentered than they used to be . in addition , young people do n't be educated to care about their community . first , young people have to learn more skill to compete with other people for survive . today , with the economy growing , people have to earn more money to meet their material desire . in order to make a good living , they spend lot of time to learn skill . on the contrast , during the past , young people made a easy life , they would have more time to care about other people . second , young people are more selfcentered than they used to be . today , young people are spoiled . their parent always provide them a good life . they can easily get anything they want , so they do n't appreciate the people who take care of them . therefore , they are getting more selfish . for example , one of my friend wa born and grew up in a weathy family . he always think `` money is the world '' . all he care about is how much money he ha . he totally ignore his family , friend and community . in addition , young people do n't be educated to care about their community . parents do n't set a good example for their child to take care or help their community . young people need to learn how to be concerned about their community . in brief , if young people nowadays put more attention on their community , the whole society will be different . it will become warm and peaceful .
