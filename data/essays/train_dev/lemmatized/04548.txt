i do n't agree that young people enjoy life more than older people do because of the following reason . this statement depends on what you think is young and old . first , all people have different point of a view . usually , young people are focused on activity , and they think that 's important for them . by the way , most older people like to be calm all the time , and they enjoy their time with their family or their life partner . second , older people have more money than young people . many older people worked hard to make money , and after they retired , what they can do is spending money for themselves . frankly , money doe an important role in people 's life . however , young people got to work hard to make money , and even if they have the money , they have no time to spend the money . third , older people do n't have worry about their family too much . most older people live without their child . they only need to care about their husband or wife . but , young people need to take care of their child a lot if they have . they easily can get stressed out from raising child . fourth , older people think about everything calmly . they have lived longer than young people , so they can understand thing easily . they do n't act too fast or too aggressive . their life have not many thing to change . by the way , many young people are busy , that make them to think aggressively and furiously . they do n't think about their behaviour . if someone doe bad thing to them , they would get angry and they do n't think about what made other person to do bad thing to them . i strongly think that older people enjoy life more than young people do .
