i agree with the given topic . i think that it better to have broad knowledge of many acadamic subject . i am an engineering student i feel pretty good my subject when i am talking with another engineer . where a it is very difficult to me , to talk about any other subject with other person . recently i went my home town and met my friend . they are all art student . at that time i had to talk about history of world richest culture . they talking well but i could not even talk a single word . at that moment i feel very bad and thought that if u have knowlege about some other topic i definitely able say something . we are living in interdependent society that mean we have to help others and take help from others , we must know about our duty and responsebilities and some famous person . it requires to know about some subject those are knowlege about history and geography and political science and knowledge about some biology . last year summer college a big accedent occur . at that time i and my frined were near by . we do n't immediately what to do , what i mean is to make a phone call to police station . at that time we did n't make . actually it is a our mistake , this is because of lack outer knowledge . in conclusion , every student having broad knowledge of many subject is better . then only we can easily manage society and study .
