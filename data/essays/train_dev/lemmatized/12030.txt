i agree the statement that successful people try new thing and take risk . those who were did something well tend to challenge for new thing because they think that they will be good in other thing . the risk is not important thing a they succeed . that 's why many successful people do new thing even if they take risk . when i went to japanese middle school in japan , i had joined gymnastics club . i like gymnastics because i liked gradual step to get new skill , and i can have successful feeling after i practiced the skill many time and did it . if i suceed in one skill , i could practice more difficult skill which may take risk , such a injure . i always tried to challenge new skill because i want to get the skill and show my friend how i am great . i did not care about the risk because i thought if i think about the risk , i can not do anything . the novel , great business , by kyoko mori show how the certain businessman succeed and become bos of his company , although he wa bottom of status at first . tsukasa worked very hard for his family . as he worked many hour without any absents and his grade wa the highest among the collagues . one day , he wa suggested by his previous bos that he should be the bos of his company . although he wa uneasy since he need more responsibility to be the bos . however , finally , he decided to be the bos . he did n't mind the risk and become more successful person . success often lead to another step that people have never did . that 's important thing for people 's live . people can not afraid of taking risk . they always have to challenge to do anything .
