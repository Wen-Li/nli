historically the growth on the number of car ha been keept increasing constantly since the third decade of the previous century . there are no sign of any reversal on this patern , and moreover recent research show that the situation could be worst on the next year . first , a the world develops , more family are able to get a car , nowdays the car are not only for rich and welth people , reduction on the final cost , for average car ( luxury car are keep apart of this analysis ) , and the improvement on the world average salary , probably help to narrow the original economical divide . countries under develpment , are a huge potential market for new car , a the economy of this contries get develop , the life quality of the population grows , also their expectation and their posibilities to get new car . other people migth say , that fuel cost , pollution regulation , and the limited parking space on big city could stop the sale , and begin with a reduction on the total number of available car . against this people i could only ilustrate that the cost on fuel are comparatively lower today if we compare the fuel with many other product . the regulation to decrease pollution are adopted by each individual country , and also the new car are complaint about most of this regulation . the other aspect about parking space , could be mitigated with the reduction of car size or the develop of new parking technology . personally , i do belive that in twenty year this number of used car will be much more that there are today , maybe is not the best for u , maybe it is . however based the actual rate of growth of the number of car , and the amazing development of the world , especialy on the underdevelop country , it is easy to predict a grow .
