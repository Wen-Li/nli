as the touring company is more popular resently , the student in the school , some community and some group of family go on trip with a tour guide . i agree with the passage , `` the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide '' i will give following two reason why trip with the tour guide is best way . in the first , tourist can deepen the knowledge of the place where they trip by the tour guide . most tourist is not fammilier with the place ; they do n't know about the language people speaks and history , what manner and behaivor people respect and so on . therefore , tourist is necessary to inform tourist what intresting there are ; a a result , they have fun in the place . next , tourist need the tour guide who lead there . they may lose their way , and be in troble with the paticular language and culture . for example , american childreen who go to singapore recieved a heavy panishment in order to not follow the rule there : they throw their gum in the public place . if a tourist wa along with them and teach singapore 's rule to them , they would n't be in the troble there . therefore , the best way to travel is group led by tour guide in which tourist should have fun the travel in a patucular place . they can learn about the place more and do n't in trouble term of the tour guide .
