i do agree with the statement of successful people ha to try new thing and take new risk . since the beggining of human life , the human had always to explore new thing in order to survive to addapt the different change and the different enviroments that surround u , the world and everything around u is in constant change . think how it will be the world today if we continue to be only doing what we already know how to do well , we will probably be pre-historic , if no writting , no paper , no wheel , no medicine ha ever existed , we will probably be extinguish by now . the pre-historic man did n't talk or have clothes but in order to live he started wearing the fur of the animal he haunted , the human now can survive the cold . all that we are and have today is possible because of the foundation that we had before , if we have n't take the risk that our ancestor took every day we would't be here . and the world it 's going to keep changing and we need to keep changing too , trying new thing , taking risk . it 's your option to change or not but if you decided not too take a risk or not to try a new thing ; my friend you will be left behind and with time cease . in the time we live now adays everybody ha to try new thing and new risk , learn new thing , it is really easy to become obsolete in this world . even choosing your carrer , let 's say doctor in surgery . you just finished the university and after a couple of year they discovered a new anesthesia that it 's better for the human body , but you do n't know how to use it and you do n't want to take tha chance of knowing something new , an improvement to your carrer , with time this anesthesia is the only anesthesia available . in what have you become ? ; you have become obsolete because you refused the change . now it 's not a change anymore is what people are doing and they already know how to do it well , but not you . change and taking new risk it 's inherit in our nature , the human will always try new thing and find new risk that 's our nature and that 's why we are on top of the food chain .
