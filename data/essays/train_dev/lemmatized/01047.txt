there are many product that seem to be too good to be true and i believe the influence of advertisement to create this image doe not use the right or ethic procedure to achieve this goal . for this reason i agree with the statement presented in this question . as a tourism manager i know perfectly this situation by studing the case of touristic destinations ' plan of marketing . in one hand , they usually offer an exotic and pristine place that invite you to go there and make use of this facility : well-equipped resort , horseback riding for lonely beach and hiking in magical mountain , on the other hand , these plan omits crowdy beach during high season , hotel room that do not have ocean view and so on . we could mention thousand of example of this situation . for me this should be ruled more rigidly and lead to protect in a better way to consumer who are cheated for this advertiser . in this virtual world where information go faster and faster by internet , the idea of advertising is becoming sample , cheap and le ruled . it is easy to see web site showing marvelous hotel and resort picture and with just one click make a reservation that cost hundred of dollar . when we get there the reality is so far away we realize that the hotel is not in the location shown or at least doe not have the feature presented , we understand the picture did not show how many ad and signal everywhere it wa possible to see , making our enjoyable destination a polluted a a capital city and making our frustation the most unforgettable of our vacation . this is a typical case of making product seem much better than they really are . as an example let 's take ocean city maryland in the united states , whoever going to the different website offering this touristic destination can see the atlantic ocean a the perfect background for a nice trip , we make a reservation and finally get there , nobody told u about the vehicular congestion , visual pollution and the noise made for teenager running their car overspeed . but that is , and there we are being part of a fraud a many other product that seem to be much better than they really are .
