the big industry are famous , because generally their product are better than other product of small industry . i think that , the trayectory and the knowledge of the company permit to identify if any product is better than other . for example , i went to supermarket and i buy a unknow oil , because this wa more cheap and i did not show big difference between my normal oil and this , but when i used this product i show that i loose my money , becuse this product had a le quality of my habitual oil . therefore , i think to that there are famous company , but this is not a garanteer for a good product . for example , currently a famous company of toy had problem with it toy , because the toy have a dangerous chemical ; this toy industry is famous around in the world , but this is not complete garanteer for tha quality of the product . i agree with this idea : `` most advertisement me \ ake product seem much better than really are '' because the market is a war for the consummers . so , the quality of the product is determines for the people , i think that , the especialization in the production of the product help to people know that product is better that other , because if the company only make a special product , the product will be more technique and with le price than before . there are product better than others jus in appareance , but people should say which product is better when they obtain it , because it is better for their option in the market and in the habitual consummer , they have a social function too .
