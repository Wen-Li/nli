as far a i consider , in now a day young people have no enough time to help others or to their community . how ever there is no time to eat food also . in that condition how they help others . in the developing country like india young people have so many responsibility . so they are bussy with their responsibility . avery person ha his self duty . for instance , a college student are bussy with there daily appointment , that mean daily work with their book . in adittion to that a b.e student ha no time to take his tiffen also . he is bussy with his collage work , he is having alot of work i.e.lab work , record work like that so many affair are there to him . and next coming to the point of young people , those are going to their duty , having full of work tension in there officies , so they can not also help others .a very person in this world is full of work . in order that bussy they have no time to help their community . some people have intension to help others , those are called samaja seva , with this they can help others , but they are affraid of others . others mean they are roudies . the people who wanted to help others ha to face some problem . that why young people can not show attention to help others . more over , helping others is a good habit . if we `` helping one person that lead to help other two person '' .this wa said by south indin mega star in his film . that film story is full of same concept . i think at this movement south indian people are started to do helping others . in the world like india , people are sentimental . they can help u to each other . but they are fully engaged with their work and responsibility that 's why the young people is not showing interest on helping others . finally i conclude that , in present day young people really have no enough time to helping community .
