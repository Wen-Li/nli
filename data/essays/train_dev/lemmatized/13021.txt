my opinion about the having broad knowledge of many academic subject is better tahn the speciallizing i one specific subject is that broad knowledge is much better for our study than the one specific subject , which reason include that broad knowledge could open our horizen about the whole study and we could have wider rangesfor u to choose our major through studying broad knowledge . in morden time , many job need various knowlege because the matter require complete ability and broad knowledge which content many academic sujects , such a math , physic and chemsitry could provide a broader knowledge for u which one specific subject could not . for example , if we are a lawyer , we not only use the knowledge about the law , we still need the knowledge about the ecnormy and humannity . we would benifity from broader knowlwdge in our work . it provides u more information when we should solve a problem . furthermore , we would choose our major from what we learned in the school and studying broad subject widern the range for u to choose . what i meet now is that which major i should choose . though i have already studied some subject , i still do not figure out which major suit me best . this is an important aspect because i should use the knowlege about my major after graduation and i would earn money by working this field . if i choose the wrong major because of lacking interest and unabble to study , i could not rasies myself in the future . broad knowledge make me confortable to chosse the one i like best and study my major well . to sum up , though one specific subject is a skill for cerntain people to use like painte , i still draw the conclution that broad knowledge is better than one specific subject . time to sleep , bye .
