i agree with the statement because of several reason . it is very casaul and normal to not help their community in this society . as our society is getting more comlex and busy , we can not care evry sigle thing . it is very true that people do not give a enough tension to the communitis , but i do not think it is bad at all . the following statement mention that young people specially , why is that ? do you think old people give more time to helping community ? i do not think so . as i said before , this is dog-eat-dog society . even child have no much time to play , they are very busy to learn everything they can . sometimes , each family member do not know about what their family do . also , from the statement , it say ' do not give enough time ' . i am sure they are so many good people in this world and try to help the commuity out . i know some people who really do that . they do help them out because of not they have le busy time . as we know , a lot of people help thier community . they have to satisfiy with that . me a a represant from all young people in the world . we have so much big dream and big list of what we want to do . our brain move to think even we are in bed . but the problem is the world is not give u enough time to do all . so we have to select a one thing to do . what i say is we are still trying to find that last selction . to get enough attension from people , especially young people is too much . it is not beacuse we do not want to help them , it is only beacuse we are deadly busy to do other thing .
