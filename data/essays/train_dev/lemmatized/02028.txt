this assey is going to accomplish and reply to the question . do i agree or disagree to the statement , the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guid . from my point of view i disagree . i am supporting to travel in a small group , alone or just accompany by my girlfriend . their are several reason to confirm my opinion . at first your are not depending on a timetable the guide offered . i 'd like to plan my traveling on my own . if you stay at a beautiful place , you can keep staying and not to move forward with the group . within a group there are alway different point of view , some would move faster and some like to stay . you are not flexible . further a guided tour is always more expensive then a own organized tour . and anyway , with the new internet time and the research possibility , you can find all relevant information in the internet or guid book like lonely planet give also all necessary information about sight , city and historical backround . as per own experience you meet a lot of different people from all over the world during the journey . this experience is sometimes more important than the sight itself . you can also get lot of information from other traveler . guides are usually visit most famous place and this place are most likely very crowded . in a nut shell , i 'd like to be more flexible and save money . you never know wheter you like a particular place or not and to spend money to stay at a place i do n't like to only because of a group decission , this sound not realy like holiday . to plan the journey is also a very beautiful experience i
