i disagree with this statement because i do n't think that the broad knowledge of many academic subject is more important than to specialize in one specific subject . in many kind of career , there are many career which need the specialized skill in the process . there are several reason . first , in executing the work , if we have more specialized knowledge in the working process we can do the work more exactly and fastly than the people who ha not specialized knowledge . for example , a friend of mine ha specialized knowledge in business marketing field more than others so now he ha a splendid job in a famous big company and he is executing the work excellently and many co-worker are respecting him and his working skill . second , in some case , the people who ha not specialized knowledge may not execute the work at all . for example , my major is architecture , exactly interior design . in architecture field , if the planner or designer ha not special skill or knowledge about structure and resist for many thing ( water , wind , heat ) , he can not design the tall building , airport , school even if small house . for above statement , in this world , there are many kind of work which need the specialized skill not only architecture field . so we have to learn about many knowledge in the specific subject to work for the specific field . finally , having broad knowledge of many academic subject is just only memorising the britaniker dictionary . with these many knowledge we can only use the knowledge at small and paltry question and we can not use the knowledge at specialized work field . if we want to have a good job for me making much money and feeling happy with our job , we have to have the specialized knowledge in our specific subject or field .
