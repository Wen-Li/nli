sometimes , what people believe to be a fact turn out to be wrong , and many people are astonished by it ; however , their notion toward the fact are le likely to be changed . it is because their mind are already hardened to accept the new information . therefore , what people must learn is the concept and idea of the fact , not just the fact itself ; since it offer them more flexible mind , the ability to accept the foreign idea to them , and a broad perspective . history itself asserts the power of the idea and concept . for example , the fact that the sea water doe not freeze is proved wrong by napoleon . in most case , it doe not freeze , yet there wa a historical event that showed the exact opposite . napoleon wa the figure who knew the power of idea and concept : he broke the dam to invade netherland ; the breakage of the dam created a very sound lake made by the sea water ; and when the winter came , the lake froze . the army of napoleon could invade netherland easily . therefore , it is more important to know the concept and idea to apply in real world than to know a single fact . also , the student are likely to have more flexibility when they understand the idea and concept , since they can apply their knowledge to a variouds range of study . for example , a person know about the way earth move during the earthquake , then he can adapt that knowledge to construction in order to build a earthquake-resistence building . it is important to point out that it is not his ability to know a many information a possible ( knowing fact ) but it is his knowledge and understanding of a certain matter , in other word , understanding idea and concept . in conclusion , it is much more beneficial to understand
