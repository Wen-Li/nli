i strongly believe that successful people try new thing rather than staying on what they usually do . they explore new chance that open them even more chance . they stray from the known path to find out if there are better path or not . and they reach success because they have experimented more . they explore new chance and find out even more chance . this happens because they are willing to find out more . instead of being satisfied with what they already know , they go to the unknown to see what they can learn . and this risk of going into the unknow open them new choice and let them expand in their enterprise . they stray from the known path to find out if there are better path or not . they wonder always why are they doing the thing the way they do them , and if this way can be improved . with this , they risk losing valuable resource , such a time and effort , but the gain is even higher in their soul : it is the gain of knowledge through experience . they run risk at this experience , and if they lost , they at least did not lose the lesson . it is precisely this gain of experience that make them successful . thanks to this experience , they have a better range of perspective on everything . this allows them to be better at finding solution to their problem and to be better prepared for problem they have already faced while they were gaining this experience . successful people run risk for a reason : to gather experience and knowledge to better their life . the more risk they run , the more experience they will have and the richer their perspective will get on about everything they do . after all , to be successful you will have to run the risk of not getting to it on time
