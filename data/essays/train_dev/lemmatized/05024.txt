for me , it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subject than to specialize in only one subject . because the more knowledge we gain the more opputunitues for having job we would have . having broad knowledge is the key element which we can gain job . for example , i want to study accounting at university , and later i will have got the cpa . however , i will choose to study how to direct film a my subsidiary major because if one day i am tired with my carreer a an accountant , i can stil choose another job a a director . secondly . i think when we gain more knowledge we can learn a lot of beneficial thing of those knoledge . for instance , when we learn about the history , we can learn about the major fact or issue that happened in the past , we can try to circumvent those malicious fact such a the ww2 and other disaster , and we can make some improvments from those historiucal fact . thirdly , learning more thing can give u another aspect of viewing the world . from learning we can not only gain the knowledge from the academic subject but also expand our mind . for example , when i wa a child i viewed everything in the world with a narrow mind , but since i went to the high school i lea in conclusion , i agree on that we should better to have broad knowledge of many academic sujects because it can give u more advantage than it give u drawback .
