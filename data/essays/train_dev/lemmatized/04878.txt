when the education 's reform hit the headline of the newspaper it is a strenous effort to know if it is more important for the young student to learn fact or understand idea and concept . with the benefit of insight , i suppose both have advantage and you can not separate one from the other . on the one hand , the schoolchildreen have to learn fact in oder to make their meaning to understand complex situation a the die and the birth . you could not have the possibility to write or to tell something without vocabulary or idea wich you learn in your youth . there are four step in the developement of the childreen , and you do not become an adult if you do not learn specific fact in this step . on the other hand , you do not spend all the time of your life in learnning fact . in previous year after your schoolyears you will not learn some fact but only understand idea and concept in order to analyse them , and discover a solution . for example a searcher in an institute of medecine , had spent time in book to learn fact a a student . but , when he take time on fundamental experience like research on a.i.d's virus he spend more time to understand it complex structure than learn about the fact he exist . to put in a nutshell , the student and te adult when they are not student spend time in undestand idea and concept and learn fact . on the whole , i am firmly convinced that all the time in your life you learn and trie to understand concept or information . owing to world change evryday at evrytime . you have to focus on all information if you want to do not be drop out the society .
