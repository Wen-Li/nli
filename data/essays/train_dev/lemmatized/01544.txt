having a broad knowledge of many academic subjects , or specializing in one specific subject ? having broad knowledge of many academic subject can make the student know a little of every subject but it wo n't get focused on a specific subject . specializing in one specific subject can make the student know everything in one subject but wo n't make them know almost anything about other subject . people choose job and they only have to know all the information about that specific subject that they work on . they are n't responsible to know information about any other subject . these way the distrubition of job are formed . although this way job distrubitions are formed , knowing everything about one subject can make people boring . knowing a little about every subject make people open minded and more interesting . they can look at the world at different angle and since human are social living , a little color into everyone 's life is needed . if people only knew about one topic and had no idea about any other topic , everybody would be boring . people would only make friend with people of the same job type because they would have no common subject with people of other job type . if the people knew a little of everything and did not focus on one topic , then everybody would have to do all of it work itself and no job distribution would be made . also subject like science , history , geography , surgery , etc . . would not go alot of distance because nobody would be working on mainly one topic . this way new invention and explorements would not be made . in the conclusion , i think only focusing on one subject and not knowing anything about other topic , also knowing a little of every topic and not focusing on one are both bad but if i had to choose one , i would say that specializing in one specific subject is better than having a broad knowledge of many academic subject because this way the standard of life do not decrease , only people get more boring and have friend only of their own area of knowledge , but by having a broad knowledge of many academic subject make the life standard decrease .
