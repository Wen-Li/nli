when i wa a litle boy , i always thought about `` why doe uncle can look sad ? '' . it wa the time that i tried to create new thought in my mind and tried to find why we happened to be alive . uncle can always looked sad and he always said he said something to deal with in his mind . i tried to find and solve what he had in mind with my insufficient logic - like i said , i wa a little boy then - , which i solved lot of time . however it did not matter how many time that i have solved his problem . it just made him to create more . then i understood that it is not just the `` thing in his mind '' , but there is something more which is socially structed by human being and our culture . as time go by , we grew up and a time go by we have more and more responsibility which are given to u by our society , which is the fact that make older people more stressed than younger people . when we are talking about society , we have to stop and focus on the culture of society and socially structed situtations . in this example that i will give , one may see thing more clearly . when i wa at elemantary school , i just had to pas my course , then i attended to the highschool , now i had to pas my course and be accepted to a well-known university . now i am studying at bogazici university which is really famous in turkey . however my mission continues to increase and advance while i am succeding and going on . this may seem a story of one . however that is not the truth . the truth is a a human being grew up , he/she will have more responsibility which make u more stressed than yesterday . why do you think old people love to look at old picture ? it is obvious that he/she want to be like in the old day , the old day that he/she had not any responsibility . it may be seemed like only constructed society is to be blamed . however that constructor is u . human being create society and society creates human being . we can not really seperate them . human being are well known a progresive and ambitious and that is why we are always trying to better and more powerful , that make u stressed and unable to enjoy life day and day . to sum up , a time pass we will become sad and old . because that is what we created by wanting more and more . in this post-modern world , we are stucked in our created destiny , which is a we get older we will enjoy life le than younger people .
