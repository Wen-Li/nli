today , most advertisement make product seem much better than they really are . the fact that there is almost not restriction about some advertisement let big company a lot of false and even impossible argument to sell their product . also , they know how to touch people 's thought with their different analyst . the most dramatic of all is the use of people symbol which misleads people ' statement . the restriction on television commercial are very small or do n't even exist . a company owner ha simply to give the the money for the advertisement of the company . this advertisement will be accepted without any restriction because the only restriction that we have is the nudity scene , but we don ` t have to prove that what we said is true . we can take an advertisement which is about get slim . in this advertosement , you will see people saying that they have lost weight in 4 week . a man who will herd those talking will be attracted to the product , but the people 's talking on the advertisement are false . the other probable element wil be the use of analyst . those analyst are very smart because they know what people want to hear . so , with only one speech written by them , they can make a product seem a fantastic when this product is not . as example , we take a man who want a car . now , this man watch an advertisement on which they say that the car make girl crazy , and even show you a woman who is persecuting a man because of the car . the man will like to have this car in the minute following these advertisement . however , is that statemement in the advertisement true ? these statement is not . so , a lot of people will be fooled . the most dramatic thing about advertisement is the use of people 's symbol or fan to sell product . some study have shown that child under a certain age are more to do what their star think is right . in this way , we can imagine a basketball player who is saying that a certain product is good . all the child who like this player will buy the product when they shall have an opportunity without any hesitation . unfortunately , the product is not so so good a it is supposed to be to finish , i would say that i agree with the fact that advertisement make product seem better than they really are .
