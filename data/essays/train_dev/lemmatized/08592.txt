in today 's life advertisement are everywhere , they are part of everyone 's life . everytime we go to a mall , we recognize some of product we see because we have already seen them on a commercial . advertisements play a fundamental role in marketing : they tell people what is worth buying and what not . most of the time the wonderful shiny product we can appreciate on a commercial is not what we expected it to be once we buy it . that 's the power of advertising , and that 's why industry would pay several million dollar , for instance , to get a 10 second advertisement space during the american football superbowl . why would someone pay so much for ten second ? it 's quite easy to understand . .. i do agree with the fact that most advertisement make product seem much better than they really are , and i think this is quite understandable . people would never buy a product which can be classified a `` normal '' . people need to improve their life by owning something better every day . i believe this is a psychological strategy , and industry do exploit it to make their income grow a much a possible . sometimes i think that those who create commercial do n't believe their own word , or maybe do . maybe an advertisement is good when it own creator can tell what 's real from what 's a lie . in my opinion , advertisement , particularly those based on lie , must not be trusted at all , even though it is also true that the customer really ca n't avoid beeing the victim of this strategy . the customer ha the right and the need to tell the good product from the bad one , in order to save money and buy what is best for him , not for those who sell these product .
