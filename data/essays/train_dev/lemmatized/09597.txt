i believe that it is more important to understand idea and concept rather than learning fact . understanding idea and concept can lead to interesting debate , it can be used in our everyday life and it can also help u understanding different fact from the past . facts are only date and name in book or newspaper , while concept and idea let u imagine different possibility through different aspect of life . first of all , understanding idea and concept can lead a classroom or a group of friend into an interesting debate . by exchanging opinion about a particular concept , for example , communism , we can learn new thing and support our opinion by giving argument . understanding the idea of our mate is also important . it give u a chance to be in the other person 's position . it help u to have a wider frame of mind . secondly , being educated about many concept and idea can help u in our everyday life by helping u taking an important decision . for example , if you have to vote at a provincial election , you need to understand what thesis each candidate support . you need to be aware of the consequence that each political party can bring to the population . you can develop your own opinion based on idea and concept , and then make a choice about the party that will get your vote . lastly , the capability to understand concept can help you understand different fact that happened in the past . for example , if you understand the concept of socialism in the u.s.s.r. , you will be able to understand the actual fact about russia , such a economical difficulty , health problem and the gap between rich and poor people . in conclusion , i think that understanding idea and concept make a student much richer than by simply learning fact . facts can always be learned in book , while concept and idea can mostly be learned through experience !
