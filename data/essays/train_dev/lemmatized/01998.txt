agree the traveling with a group is good tour guide because whenever you go some where with the group so this is a good chance to know much more about the new place and this could be better amusement for you . this is also the fact that you do n't need to travel in a group because somewhere you feel like to go alone and most of the people do n't want the company of others this is why this thought can not be applyed to every one . most of the people really want a company of some people because they do n't want to travel in group . according to the tour guide it may be the best way because in your group most of the people know and they can give you the better idea that where you have to go and wher you can get a lot of fun and they can tell you where you are going wrong . as a matter of fact it might be a good tour gide . traveling is very importen to the people to know about world and in group ti could be might a well .
