the issue of is it more important for student to understand idea and concept than is it for them to learn fact is difficult to deal with because you can not understand abstract concept without fact but on the other hand you can not understand fact without explaination . it remains that i think this is more importante to understand idea and concept than to learn fact without understandness . to illustrate my point of view i am going to give three argument with exemples . firtly , by understanding idea and concept you keep a criticise view on the world . we know that to the govern the france we need a president . this is a concept . after we can think about who could be the good one among peaple who would like to become president . secondly , this is evident that to understand how our world work , we need to learn general concept and idea . and after that we can do our own life in starting from this base . for exemple if you want to learn thing at school , before you have to learn how to behave in a school and which are the rule of the school . finally , understand idea and concept suppose that you use your brain , you have think about these concept and idea . it choose that you are clever if you try to understand concept before learning example because this is the logical way of doing . at the opposite , there are people who learn supidly fact and example without understand anything . this kind of people are good at tv game but that all . they have not a critisize point of view on the world . we could even say that thesis person are dangerous for the society a they can a extremist feeling . to conclude , i would say that a i am a scientific this is logical for me to learn concept . many people say that this is too abstract but i think this is the good way to understand the world : first concept and them fact which support the concept .
