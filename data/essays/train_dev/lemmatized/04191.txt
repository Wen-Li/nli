i agree with the statement that say `` in twenty year there will be fewer car in use than there are today '' i think that the statemnt is right because of many reason , one of this reason is the technology in our life this day , if we talk about the present time we will see that the car are essenial in our life , before a very long time , car wa not necessary for transportation they can use train or bicycle and mostly they used to walk , and in near past , everyone used to have one car , a whole family consist of large number of brother and sister , son and daugther used to have just one car , but in these day every person could have two or more car , in this we see how technology became a part of our live . in future i think there wont be car at all or at least not in this huge amount that we have it in this day , i think that the scentists will discover other way for transportation , they would change the car using petroul by other with different shape using light or using other thing , or even future people could have a bag in their back , and whenever they want to go to some where they just press a little button and they fly or even wearing a shoe which make you to jump a large distance or thousand of idea that will make u not using the car and the train , which make our atmosphere clearer and better way to live . alhough i think that this step will happen in future , but i dont think it will happen in near future , because this kind of step need a plan with the risk that could be taken in such case , with opprotunity for everyone to have this venture ,
