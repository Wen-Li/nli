well , i disagree with the statement that say `` it is more important for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact '' . the reason for that , is i think fact are the basic of idea . so , how can an idae or a concept come before the fact . consquantally , the we leran the basic which is the fact , then we propose an idea . so , if a student recivied an idea or a concept without having the solid basic , he wil not be able to make his decision about it . therefor , he will not have the apportinuty to discouss the concept . clearly , the logical way to learn is fact then concept . so , we teach student the basic and the fact , and gradually try to involve some idea and concept into their material . in this way , they will learn how accepet all the opinion and then make their own decision . also , they will try to interfere from the fact then try to propose their explaination and support it with evidence . an example for my choise if geology calss . if we taught a student that cave are formed in a certain way , he will memorize it without conventition . in other hand if we taught him about cave from different area . they are an extent area but if he got some information about kind of cave and how it formed , he will be convinted about what he learns .
