it 's easier to learn fact than understand the idea and concept which generate them . while some student may think it 's more important to understand idea ; others prefer focusing only on fact . in my opinion , it 's worth it to try to deal with idea and concept . ideas and concept allow u to understand the reason of what happen in our world . facts are only a result of something and never provide enough information . when a student focus on idea and concept , he will understand much easier new event . in my opinion , focusing on fact is too restrictive and doe n't provide any new ability . when i wa litlle , my physic teacher wa always explaining u the reason why something happen . it wa hard in the beginning but i developed the will to work in a research department . the last but not least , it 's just more interesting to understand idea and concept than to learn fact . when we learn fact we probably do n't understand the meaning of the event . students who are lazy will choose to learn fact without understanding the concept around . i have always thought it is pretty borring to try to remember by heart something because i just do n't understand . i did it when i wa in history class . i tried to remember everything and just gave it to my teacher during the exam . when i begin to understand idea and concept behind those fact , i wa able to learn more information . in conclusion , it seems obvious that it 's more worth it for student to deal with idea and concept than it 's for them to learn fact . the opportunity to provide more ability in understanding others subject and the interest to be able to learn more are two main reason .
