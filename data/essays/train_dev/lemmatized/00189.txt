travelling is one of the most popular pastime for most people . when you dicide to have a travel , should you join in a group led by a tour guide or travelling alone ? in my opinion , both of them have merit . travelling with a group led by a tour guide may be easier and more comfortable than travelling by yourself . the guide will arrange everything for you , all you should do is just to follow his/her guide . in addition , the member in the group will help each other and share their feeling about the scenery with others , which will make the tour more interesting and funny . furthermore , travelling with a group can save you some money . for example , you can share a hotel with the your groupmember . however , in other circumstance , travelling alone may be more suitable for you . firstly , travelling alone can give you more flexibility . you do not have to follow the strick schedule made by the tour guide . secondly , if you do not want to be interupted by others , travelling alone may be better choice . in addition , if you tend to go a place , where is not attractive to others , travelling alone may be the only choice for you . also , you can have more privacy by travelling alone . as to me , my preference depends on where i intend to visit and how much money i plan to spend on it . suppose , i plan to visit a histirical place , which is relevent to my subject , and even most of people do not know it , i may have to go there alone . on the contrary , if my destination is yellow stone park , i would like to join in a group , so i can communicate with other member . in addition , the money is another factor , which can affect my decision . on one hand , if you have enough money , i prefer to go there alone because i have more flexiblility . on the other hand , if the buget is limited , i would like to share some cost with others , then i will choose a group to join .
