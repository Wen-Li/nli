the student must understand the idea and concept . students are the future of the world , they are the one who will change the world . they must take thing seriously and must intent to do that . understanding the idea and concept behind , doe matter alot and make difference too . the concept and idea which is understood by any student will make him or her take decision on that topic more efficiently . example , a student understood the concept and idea clearly and become a succesful doctor . when he or she operate any human being , the patient , his life at risk the decision and the solution which come out of the concept and idea understood by the doctor during his or her class . any failure would lead the patient their life at risk or may be to death a well . a man put his life in doctor hand with trust and hope . the student must do justice to it . while the critic say , learning the fact are also important by the student . example , imagine a doctor ha learned the fact and doe not have the idea and concept in his mind . he or she would put some person 's life at risk . if the person died he would be responsible for the death . the patient could survive and could recover but due to lack of knowledge the patient ha to suffer . which i would say is not fair at all . furthermore , the student with the good concept and knowledge about the idea would be more effective and appropriate than compare to the student with learning fact . sometimes learning fact are necessary but mostly the concept and the proper knowledge is taken into account . in the end , the knowledge of the subject should be by understanding the concept and idea . the better knowledge the better effect could be seen . the understanding of the concept and idea are always work and give good output .
