will there be fewer car in use than there are today in twenty year time ? to answer to this question and determine whether i agree or disagree with the statement in question , first we must consider how several aspect of the world in which we live are going to develop in the future . factors such a the world fertility rate , oil price , development of poor nation , technological improvement and damage to the earth , have to be taken into account . we must consider how these various element will change and interact over twenty year , affecting the number of car in use . it ha been proved that world fertility rate are rising , specially in non developed country . this mean that the world population will grow during the next twenty year . thus , probably , there will be a greater number of potential car buyer . however , if large number of the world population remain poor , they will not have access to car . the development of poor nation could raise the standard of living of people which are now poor and can not afford to buy a car . this mean that in the future , large segment of the population of country such a india or china could be using car . however , this process is uncertain . on the other hand , factor such a oil price increase or damage to the earth may the cause the human being to focus on other possible way of locomotion more cheap and enviromentally friendly . perhaps , in twenty year time car will not exist any longer and we will be using other machine thanks to new technological advancement . in my opinion , there is a great possibility that emerging nation such a china and india will one day increase their number of car owner . the development of their economy is raising very rapidly the standard of living of their population . in addition , their fertility rate are high . all this combine to make it very possible that they will have large number of car user in twenty year time . i also believe that human being will still rely on car to travel in the long term ; despite the improvement in technology . so , to conclude , i do not agree with the statement proposed .
