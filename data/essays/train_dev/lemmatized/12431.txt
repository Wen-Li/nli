i am disagree with the statement . i think that it is more important to learn that we all can prove a fact . first , not every thing we understant a concept or idea is a fact . for instance , when we learn an specific topic in economics we spect that it will work every time . but that it is not true , a well known case is the way that one must take a desicion in a game , remember john nash equilibrium . sencond , it is more easy to memorize a fact that a concept . we all know that two plus two is four . on the other hand , try to understand how physic explain the earth 's movement . finally , there are alot of research in each area that when we understand a concept imediatly arise a new theory explaining the same concept . for example , pluto is not a planet when i wa a child everybody known that pluto wa the converse . for all i wrote above i can sincerely say that to learn fact is more important for student .
