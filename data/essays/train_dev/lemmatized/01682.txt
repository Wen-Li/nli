there are many opinion occuring about whether young people or old people enjoy life more . i actually do not agree with the statement `` young people enjoy life more than older people do '' at all . i do n't think that old people have more fun in life than their younger companion either . but i am not saying that not anyone on earth enjoys his or her life . i am just trying to say that it depends on the person himself regardless of his age . a man , 80 year of age could be the richest man on earth but may still not be satisfied with his life because he want to be young again . therefore he doe not enjoy life . and on the other side a teenager is unhappy about his life because he doe n't have the money and right to do whatever he wish to do because he still life in his parent house . all the teenager want is to get older , so that he can do all the thing that he always wanted to do ( and of course the money to do it ) . and the funny thing is that both illustration could be the exact same person , only in different life stage . but it can be different , too . as a young person you can enjoy life by going to school , meeting friend , doing sport , etc . and just because of the fact that you are old doe not mean that you can not have the same fulfillment in life a a younger people do . you only do different thing which you could have never thought of when you were younger . so what doe that mean ? you could have all the thing you 've always wanted and still be unhappy . it doe n't matter if someone is young or someone is old . if that particular person doe not have the right attitude to make the most out of the situation he will never be happy and finally enjoy life . a young person can enjoy life a well a an old person doe . it is only important how he think of himself . i believe it is your attitude that determines what kind of a life you can have . you can enjoy life or make it a terrifying time while being on this earth . nobody can make you feel happy , but you .
