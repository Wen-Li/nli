i agree with the statement that most advertisement make product seem much better than they really are . to my mind , the main reason for this is that today in the age of mass production there exists a graet variety of product that all want to be sold . selling a product make it important to draw the attention of people to it . this aim is normally achieved by using exaggeration in the advertisments of product . for example , advertisement often state that a certain lotion make look one 's skin ten year younger by taking away all wrinkels . i actually do not believe that this can be achieved just by the use of a certain lotion . a lotion might help to moisturize your skin and by this make it more soft , but i do not believe that it is able to make you look ten year younger . this is a typical exaggeration often used in an advertisement that make the product seem to be much better than is in reality . furthermore , people 's attention in our hectic world is usually drawn to so many thing at the same time that an advertisement that just give u clear information on a product will not help the product to be sold successfully . most of the product advertised in tv . the cost of this type of advertisement depend on how long the product is shown . thus time often will be rare und used in a way that draw the attention of the audience very quickly . the easiest way to do this , is to make people believe that the product is much better than all the other product that it could be compared to it . this goal is normally achieved by telling people something about the producht that make it seem better than it is in reality . at least , all the mean of our modern medium society make product often seem better than they are in reality by proposing them in a certain light or colour . this is why i want to state that in conclusion that one should not believe everything presented in advertisement .
