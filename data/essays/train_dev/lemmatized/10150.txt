as people know more and more in their lifetime , they suppose it is the most important to try thing new , in order to bring them to a higher level that can make them a successful person . however , this could hardly be true since success not only cost new idea , but also hard working and patience of woking on thing they have already known . first of all , it is said that practice make perfect . without repeating over and over again , doing the same thing , people can not finish a task greatly . for instance , the famous chines athlete , liu xiang , a one of the best runner in the world nowadays , he is successful . yet he is trained to do the most simple and basic thing everyday to win the golden metal . he is requested to go slowly running and log distance running , and jump back and forward in the field . these thing are certainly the thing he knew how to do when wa five year old . although knowing how to do them , he keep on practising everyday , and the repeating , however , take him to the first place in the race and achieve his success by this kind of training . so , doing what a person ha already known and do it better and better , even the best , can enventually make a person successful . in addition , poeple keep doing the thing they already know is much more important than merely trying new thing . this is just like a basic attitude towards life , which show that a person can not do thing he know well , can barely do thing he doe not even know . for example , if a person doe not read very well , that mean he/she can not read fast and accurate , he/she will not achieve a nice score in university that requires a high level of reading skill . in this case , the reading ability is the person ha already known and , further , may ha the approach of how to read well , but the poor reading ability affacts him/her in the field of further education , and the real situation is , before he/she tell other people how to read , or try the new way of reading , he/she ha already failed the university . finally , a person concertrated on trying new thing will overlook the purpose and importance of doing thing in this new and risky way . noting knowing how to ride a bicycle , is the question remains untill a person fell down from the racing bicycle or a motorbike . the thing people have already know may seem boring , but the day people understand it really well , they can see through their aim of trying new thing and will be mote possibly , successfull . hence , it is the most significant for a person to become successful to do thing they have already known and do it a great a possible .
