i strongly believe that most advertisement make product seem much better than they really are for several reason . first of all , the marketing ha been always worked behind the objective of : `` sell . .. a much a you can the product '' , ... and how do they know how to sell u something ? how do they know how to make u buy what they want u to buy ? well , first of all , they study the consumer . in my opinion , it 's more than obvious that everybody want the best price based on quality everytime they are going to buy a product . this is not something easy , because if a business create something with high quality and sell that product cheap , they would never get a good profit of it . so , is you create a product , at a price , and you want to sell a much a possible , how are you going to do it ? well , there is where the marketing , and therefore , the advertisement , enter in our discussion . it 's seems something easy , but it 's not . the first thing they have to do is study the consumer , what they need , at what price , when and how much . if the product that they are trying to sell , ha everything the consumer want , perfect , they did it ! but that is very very difficult , because no all the consumer are the same , it affect the age , the sex , where are they from , what they like . .. so , the solution is make the product and make it look like the consumer want it to be . it can sound strange , but i think that the objective of the advertisement is try to sell you something they want you to buy , sometimes a product that you really need for your life , but sometimes they create you wehat i called , artificial need . lets just try to think about u , i 'm sure there ha been at least one time in the life of everybody that had bought something that it seemed great on television and then it is n't a good a we thought . my experience wa buying a car , it looked amazing on television and it ha a great price too , but something cheaps cost you expensive . .. everybody wa buying this car , so i decided to buy it and , at least , it wa n't a amazing a i thought at first . in conclusion , i strongly agree with the statement that most advertisement make product seem much better than they really are , because the objective of the advertisement is to sell you something and make you buy it , even if it a good a it seems , or not .
