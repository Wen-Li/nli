now-a-days the life for everyone ha become hectic , let it be a boy going to the college or middle aged man who ha family responsibilites . especially for young people who have their entire life in front of them & it time now for them to decide in what direction they will steer their attention to get to the destination which will take life to the aim that they have to achieve . for a start they have to attend college . some time have to pay for it themselves . so for that work part-time . but now-a-days i can see student dont mind working for their own education . they have become more active in the society . they have started realising the important of human value like honesty , humanity & trust . hence , i disagree with statement that is made here that young people donnot give enough time or help their community . i can give you an example which i experienced myself . few month back , in my city there wa an excessive rainfall in a season when it wa completely unexpected . hence , the government resource were not available on time . at that time , people staying near the place , where lot of water wa creating a blockage of traffic , came onto the street to help the people for crossing the road which were under water . i even heard news that these people provided shelter & food to those who couldnt get to their home due to lack of trasport . all these people helping out others were young . it wa quite evident because old one couldnt help doing so many thing by walking in rain . there might be some youngster who are involved in drug activity or crime or some even `` doing nothing sitting at home '' type . but you can not judge the entire young generation only by looking at them . i think that today 's young generation is very much awake about it responsibility & are doing their duty well , without fail . giving them opportunity to do it is now the responsibility of our community .
