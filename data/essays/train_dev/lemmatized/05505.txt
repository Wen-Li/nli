the issue is a controvertial one . on one hand the issue state that there are young people who contributes to their community . on the other hand , the issue claim that young people are not helping their community at all . however in my final analysis , i would support that young people are giving enough time to help their community . the first instance in support of my view are the non-residential indians . they are young people who work outside india . inspite of there busy schedule , they come back to the home country and conduct lot of session . they also help financial institution in india by providing them financial aid . they actively participate in the event and promotion done by the government of india . my second example are the young politians those are coming up in various country . people like tony blair of united kingdon is a fascinating example of a young person helping his community and country . politics ha now become one of the mean by which young people are contributing . another example would be people like michael johnson from basketball and mark waugh from cricket . these sport person have taken time out for child welfare . they have also setup various sport academy , to help nourish young talent in their respective field . these people always make it a point to visit their respective academy . finally , the musician like yanni have conducted charitable show . many other young musician also conduct charitable show to generate reveneues . singers like michael jakson is known for conducting such charitable show . this money is used for the development for their community . in conclusion , i feel that young people of this era are actively participating for the cause to help their community grow . the above example are just a few to quote .
