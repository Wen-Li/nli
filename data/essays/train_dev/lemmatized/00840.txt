having broad knowledge is always better than having specialization in one specific subject . but , this doesnot apply to every student . we can classify this for student based on their level of education in two category . one is a undergraduate level student and the other is a graduate level student . for an undergraduate student , it is recommened to have broad knowledge of many academic subject . having so help him to know what fileld he is his intrested in . he can choose the area of subject , in which he want to specialize in graduation . moreover , any person should have minimun knowledge on different fileds . like if we take an engineer , if he doe n't have minimun knowledge about human body , then he may face problem in his life . like he can not explain well enough to doctor like an illeterate , if there is any problem with his health . also important is some political and general information for student who come from enginnering , medical or any other filed . any citizen of a county need to know atleast some history about his country . he may be a big doctor , but if he doenot know how his country got indepence or who are the great leader or atleast the geographical structure of his countrty . there is no point saying that , i am a medical student and i do n't require any history knowledge . he should have atleast some basic knowledge related to any field . where a in the case of a graduate student , it is better if he specializes in one subject . he need to concentrate on one subject and specialize in it . most probaly , a graduate student , like one after completing his master will go for a job . so , he need to specialize in one specific subject , where he is dreaming to work . a doctor need to specialize in one particular field , like an eye specialist or become a cardioligist by specializing in heart related problem . in short , we can say that a undergraduate level student need to have broad knowledge of many subject and a graduate level student can specialize in one specific subject .
