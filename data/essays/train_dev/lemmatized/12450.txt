i disagree with the statement that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their community . with time the awareness of benefit that come out of helping community are found rooted in the society . forming community and giving few productive hour of schedule ha become routine in most of the young people a they realise the fact that working for the community would develop the society which constitutes them too . there are lot of community formed based on different aspect like - from the profession one is into , the locality one life , the age group , the university one is into , to the food one is inclined to . the community formed based on the professional similarity would help them discus what skill must to developed to have a better value in the market . so all the young people would definately be penchant to join the community . similarlly , the people of a locality forming a group would help them to have their home a better place to live in by taking up program like clean and green which indirectly help the enviroment to get out of deforestration and in this process of keeping the locality clean the sewage system will also be improved . so it the entire public thats enjoying the fruit of forming a community . thus i think that all young people will definately be enthusiastic to be a part of all community which lead to their welfare inturn . for example , when i wa doing my first year of graduation there were many article about not using plastic in any form a it lead to cancer . but there were very few who bothered to pay attention . and all our classmate took an initiative formed a community which wa againt using plastic . we organised road show , disussed the disadvantage of it with the enviromental care board member and took their help a put an appeal to the governament bang the product . doing so , we successed to an extent in giving plastic a stop . so i feel that it mostly the young people who are aware of the current day circumstance and form community to find the solution to make the society a better place to live in .
