advertising campaings , to my opinion , are most of the time filled with unreal information about the product they are trying to sale . for example , i always see on tv advertising about loosing weight that they try to sale a type of medice or lotion that make you loose weight , and then they first show a woman so fat , and on the other side of the screen you will see such a beautiful and skinny lady , that anybody , or , at least , an intelligent person can realize that such a change is not possible that easy . i believe that those advertisement always say what people want to hear , but they do not usually say the truth , but the only purpose of this is to sale the product to be able to make money , despite of what the consecuenses are . that is why advertiser make this product or item seem way better than they really are . i can also mention some others example , such a food , clothes , medicine , even cologne and perfume , that can change your live for ever , and make you the perfect person of this world , but unfortunaly , i do not have enough time to talk about all of them , but what i can say is that , at the end , these campaings have the same meaning , and result . there is no doubt that advertisement , and i strongly agree with that statement , are a good invention for those who want to make money out of people ignorance , and common sence ; and advertiser also know that , in some occasion , people like to spend money even thought they are aware of those product are not really good , and that they hide something behind the image the advertiser creates . all in all , my advice , do not buy everything you see on tv , magazine or other place , because they do not usually say the truth .
