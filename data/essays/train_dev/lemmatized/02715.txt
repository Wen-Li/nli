in my opinion , i agree this statement . i think that number of car will dicrease at least around in next decade . there are a few reason for it . first , recently concern for environmental pollution is getting higher . of couse , it doe not cause of only car , but the great number of car apparently affect to air and water and so on . moreover , in our daily life car is very notivable ellement to environment . second , from aforesaid first reason , the number of prietors is not increasing like before . for example , my parent thought it a a dream to buy car when they are young . now , i am almost same age to them at that time , but i do not need any car . i do not feel necessary to it . the meaning having car is changinng more than before . third , many vehicle have developed very well , so we can go anywhere by using them , such a train or airplane or ship . moreover , although there is not only one company but also a lot of company offer their vehicle with competing , we can use them cheaper than before . some people may disagree with my this opinion . the market of motor car is still now storong , therefore it never decrease theis number . of couse , in japan also , the market is still now vegorous . if i watched tv program , i can see a lot of commercial through the time . even now a lot of people may be purchasing their new car . but i think that recent main stream ha changed ovbiously , that is to say , recently the most moticable stream is new type of car that never excharge any pollutant . in addition , eco-car is famous and popular , which use not nonrenewable resouces , petrileum , but electricity . i think that this show our view had changed from before . therefore , i agree this statement that recently fewer car are in use . the number of car will change into fewer .
