success sleeps in reality people who are in the search of new thing and like to take risk rather than doing in well-known form may be considered successful when it is heard . however , i totally disagree with this idea of desire towards new thing and risk for several reason . the first reason that support my idea is that time is the most valuable concept in human life , and it should n't be wasted . it mean that someone should run after empty dream or the idea that increase the slope of life , for human life is short . for example , when the history is examined , one can easly see that there were lot of mad scientist who dreamed lot of mad thing including `` navigation in time '' , but if one look at the result , there is nothing to applaude . descartes , mathemetician and philosopher , can be considered a nice example for life , for the he wa so successful although he did n't dream or take risk . the second reason , that one should n't try new thing and take risk , is the comprehension of the primitive knowledge ; that is to say , people may try to learn the theory or method that have been already accepted by the authority . before creating or commenting , the knowledge should be enlarged a much a possible . by the way , instead of trying new thing or taking risk , one can profit from it own knowledge or try to be satisfied in his border . for example , if an engineer learns the current progression in his major and improves himself , he doe n't need to try new thing or take risk to be succesful , because he is aldready succesful . all in all , a the reason are shown , i think that the idea of resting in peace of it border , and following my life a it flow is better idea
