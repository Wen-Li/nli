i aree only partially with the statement that successful people try new thing and take risk rather than only doing what they do well . although , trying newer thing keep up the growth graph and help a person to rise above the rest but equally true is the fact that one can be equally successful in some thing in which he or she ha both , experience and expertise . to excel in any field , it extemely crucial to know one job correctly and efficiently . this excellence can be achieved by hard work and spending more time on the job at hand . in other word , experience and diligence is the key to success . for this reason , i belive that those people who do the same thing over a long period of time or do it well , do become successful . for example , a mechanic specializing in repairing electronic gadget can achieve enough success even if he stick to that very job forever . people shall always trust him more than the neophyte in the profession . however , if he change his job or try to multitask in more number of job , he might end up spoiling his established work and not even getting the customer 's support in the new area in which he will now become a beginner . however , trying out different thing in life can not be seen with any contempt . it is always said that if you stop growing , you would soon start declining . staying in just one thing and doing nothing else can easily stagnate a person and stagnant water is worth nothing more than a breeding place for mosquito and deadly disease . therefore , it is a proper to keep experimenting in life . one should always learn newer and better stuff and become adroit in them . at the same time , one must never forget to keep in touch with the original talent and maintain it . conclusively , whether you decide to stay in your discipline , or diversify , success can be all yours , provided , you do it with sincerity and hardwork .
