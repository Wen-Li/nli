the teacher teach u alof of different thing . they always teach u that to understanding the idea and the concept of each article is more important than to learn the fact . even thought we are the student or the teacher . first , understanding to idea and the concept is to make sure that you know everything of this story or article . if you do not understand what it talk about , you would never get the the fact of it . my english teacher always say that way to me . if we want to learn the good english , we should read it more than one time to understand the idea . it like the chacater , setting , plot , and the background . when we can get all of the above , we would understand the idea and the concept . trying to read it more than one time , it would more easy to get what it say in the reading . i always do that way , because i want to get higher mark of every test or quiz . when we do that , we will learn more when we read . leaning the fact is not really a bad thing to lean . it depends on different people to learn . everyone also ha it 's own way to learn . we wo n't learn or follow the others step . everyone is different . no one is the same . learning the fact is another way for learning . actually , learning the fact is almost at the end of the learning step . if we spread it out , we would know that the first step of reading is to understand the idea , and then it should be to learn the concept . after this two step , it 's to learn the fact . although there ha a lot of different way to learn , i still would think the most important for the student to understand idea and the concept . that 's because that 's the only way that my teacher teach me since i have been studying .
