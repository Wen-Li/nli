the statement of how successful are the people that try new thing and take risk rather than only doing what they already know how to do well is an interesting one and many time is also a controversial one . on one hand there are those that try new thing and take risk . for example , there are those that are willing to put all their life saving into a new business . others that , after 20 year decide to start a new career or even go back to school . nobody know what the future hold . it is uncertain . some people are broke one day and rich the next . a new tv show called deal or no deal is a great example of how within second your decision might change your life for the good or for the bad . the show invite contestant to win up to a million dollar , and by within 10 to 15 they need to say if they want to accept the deal that the show offer or continue opening briefcase until they find their million . the key is that your briefcase might have 1 million a well a it could only have 1 penny . you decide how much you want to risk . donald trump is another example . it is publicly known that he lost a lot of his fortune year ago . to get to where he is now , he certainly took risk that paid off . other people , like the ceo of starbucks saw an opportunity to try something new and presently , his company is the #1 coffee company in the world . there are many factor to be taken into consideration when taking risk , because the size of the risk may vary depending on the decisons made through considering those factor . do i want to risk my 2 year saving for a trip to spain or do i want to use my kid college fund to start up my business ? one the other hand there are those that only do what they already know how to do well . we all know people like that or we might even be like that . it is a preference , a choice and many time a personality trait . people that are content with the fact that they wo n't go through that moment , day , hour or minute in life when they will hold their breath to wait to have gotten what they were looking for when we risked something , because most time , if not all , thing that we risk are of value for u and many time , to those around u . in conclusion , i believe balance and most importantly passion are key for success . i have personaly taken risk in my live , and believe that without having taken them i would n't have achieved personal and mostly professional goal that i always wanted to achieve . in term of balancing , how about taking the risk of opening a business of something i know how to do well or at least feel passion about ?
