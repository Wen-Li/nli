i disagree with the statement . i think that it is more important for student to learn fact than to understand idea and concept . i will aprove my support by educational system and my experience . we could not know real historical matter in school . our textbook wa controled by goverment and people who live a high cast . so , we can just learn what they want student to know for our country , it is not real . then we feel that we alredy know the idea and concept . even it is not good for our contry , we have to learn the fact for our future . if we go to other country , sometime we might have to feel apporogizing . therefore we have to learn fact rather than just understanding idea and concept of our country . secondly , although it is important to study at school and home by textbook or drill , it is better to go outside and get new idea a a school trip or just traveling . when we grow up we are taught academic course , like english , math and history from our teacher or parent . and we are said that we have to study a lot because of our carrier . however . it is good way for our life to go outside or other country and get new idea and point of view . in my school , we have a one week course that we can experience new thing at other country or city . on the week , we do not have any assesment and homework . but we can get new thing and also reflesh our mind . and also we can spread our knowlege because of the trip . according to my trip , i could know that although just understanding idea and concept is important for u , however learning fact is more important for our life and mind . thus i beleve that it is more important for student to learn fact than to understand idea and concept according to the educational system and my school trip .
