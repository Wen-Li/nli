now-day the market is becoming more and more competitive compared to the past year . this change of situation is due to a more sophisticated technology and a better awerness of the product . from my opinion this contest lead to a point in which the company , in order to sell more product , produce advertisement that make product seem much better than they really are . i believe that this technic is becoming a strategy used by the company to attract the consumer 's attention . in fact , once the consumer find out that the product is not a it wa pictured in the advertisement , if he ha come a long way to buy the product , he will most likely purchaise it . however , it may even happen that he is so disappointed that he will not buy at all and at the same time he will make a bad advertisement both on the item and on the company . i have experienced this situation a well , in deed , on a magazine i found an advetisement of a new brand that wa promoting a shirt , but when i went to the shop to buy it i found out that it did not corrispond to the picture of the magazine . in fact , it looked much better on the advertisement and the material wa really bad . at this point i decided that it would have been a wast of money buying it and i left the shop . moreover , this situation is occuring too frequently and it will influence the consumer in a negative way when buying product advertised . in addition this type of promotion make break the trusty relationship established between customer and company . in conclusion i can say that i tottaly agree with the statement , most advertisement make product seem much better than they really are , and i feel that this new approch adopted by company will have a negative impact on the market and may damage the relationship between producer and customer .
