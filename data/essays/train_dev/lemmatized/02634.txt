in earlier time school and schooling itself had an excessively straight forward concept , to dump information in form of fact onto the student without considering them a individual . however this concept is outdated and thankfully most necessary adjustment to a modern way of learning have been made . of course it is much more efficient to understand idea and concept to eventually be able to put them to use in reality than to just learn fact by heart without understanding them . having several generation in my own family i can experience the infulence of an older , le modern education . in those time the motto often wa `` just accept it '' . very often unmotivated teacher still use this concept with their student today , they just are n't interested in their education . compared to that a passionate , motivated teacher will always take the time to explain the fact he just put in the student ' head and turn them into comprehensable concept . the best example would be a complicted looking mathematical formula with three variable . if a teacher just throw that formula on a student 's desk while telling him to adapt it to the number 2 , 5 and 9 the student will most likely respond with a blank stare . however if the teacher approach his student with the given formula and sits down with him and explains why this and that is in it , the student will probably be able to use it soon . or if one learns a certain book by heart , will he understand it ? no , in that case it would not even be a given that the particular person will know any of the content , he will simply be able to repeat the word , like a roboter . however if this person conciously read that book and overthinks the various concept , he will learn from it . it is logical that the understanding of a given idea or concept is more productive and thus more important than to just learn the dry fact . facts do not have to equal knowledge , and only knowledge will get you somewhere .
