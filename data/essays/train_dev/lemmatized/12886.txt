i gree that it is more important for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact . i agree with that for many resons . such a , they will find many good ides , and a lot of diffrenet concept . what every body know that people learn fact by them self , so it 's le important to understand . what i think is more fun is that student really need to realize other people idea and concept . students will share idea and concept . furthermore , they will be involved . the most important thing that student will come up with many good idea and concept . therefore , it is more important for student to understand , realize , and consider idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact . as what said before , that people can learn fact in their own life . what i need to mention is that fatcs are basic thing . you ca n't change the fact or do anything with it . on the other hand , you can improve you idea and come up with a better one . that 's i am agree with that student need to realize idea and concept . before i came to america , i did n't like it , but my cousin advised me to come . it wa my cousin idea . every body ha many idea and concept . one example is self help concept . that concept make people are independt , so they can do their own business . i wa n't a self help concept before i came to america . now , i am a self help consept . i learned that in america because people in america are diffrent than people in my country , people here make their own business by them self , but people in my country get help when they need . the fact that i am agree with statement is that people are able to imprve idea and concept but not fatcs .
