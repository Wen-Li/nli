it is often said that most advertisement make product seem much better than they really are . is it really so or ha this statement no sense at all ? whenever an advertisement is conceived , an important issue , a part from the commercial target being aimed at , is the impact given or the message to be transmitted . this naturally derives in a series of technique adopted to produce the propaganda . many of these technique might seem to make product look better than they actually are and therefore spark outrage . other do not instead , no doubt about that . so the question is , are most advertisement like that ? the answer relies on two issue . one regard logical interpretation of the statement , the other , simple observation of propaganda itself . as a matter of fact , the meaning of the word ` most ' should be specified beforehand . but let u not pay attention to this cynical point . as for observation , it is obvious that the type of product being advertised ha an enourmous specific weight in the discussion . for instance , certain product such a medicine can not be made to look like better than what they actually are , whereas magical fat-loss meal tend to be over-advertised and are likely not to work . of course , generally , advertisement tend to outline the positive aspect of a product . but this is justified by the nature itself of pubblicity . so , in a way , the phrase could be always considered a correct . on the other hand , a what is being put into discussion is not the nature of advertisement itslef , it would be fair enough to acknowledge the way propaganda is meant to be and proceed to reason not on the essence , but on the form of the problem . in conclusion , the statment might be accurate or le accurate depending on the type of product considered , let still the nature of propaganda .
