although both young and older people can live fascinated life , i think that young people enjoy life more than older people . this may be because young people have wonderful dream about life , they are healthier , and finaly , they have le responsibility . having a dream and aim is one of the most thing that make young people more enjoyable of the life . young have many goal that they want to achieve , for example they want to achieve good education , high position . also , they dream with a wonderful wife/husband and happy life , and they exert their best effort to achieve these dream . expecting and anticipation of better future is a main source of happiness . some , may aruge that older people also have dream and goal , but , in my opinion , they faced and experienced the real life which may be hard and disappointing . another factor is , health is very important to enjoy life . when you are in agood health , you can do any thing . you can do any effort you want , any kind of sport , any activity . illness can cause the person to be disappointed and unhappy . when you are ill , you should take care of your health ; do should not do any hard activity , any excessive effors , and can do only some kind of sport . you have to take care of time of different medicament , and see the doctor regularly , and so on . moreover , le responsabilities help young to enjoy more their life . they always feel with secure and safe a they live their family . also , they know if they have problem , they can find person to depend on , and to give them advice . they do not have to care about money , paying bill or preparing food . all they have to do is focusing on doing well on their education . to sum up , young enjoy life more than older people a they are more hopeful in a good life , healthier , and have le duty to do .
