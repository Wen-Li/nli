in a world developing faster than many people are capable of , it becomes more and more important to be well prepared a soon a possible and to be ready when it 's up to one 's ability to react on the world 's need and demand waiting . therefore i understand , why it is recommended to gain a much knowledge a possible in all different kind of field , if you want to prevent yourself being limited to only one academic subject . life might demand a lot more . on the one hand , i have to admit , this might be very true . especially when you are attending college or university to become educated for any kind of job , it might be the right thing to gain a much knowledge and ability a possible . employers will prefer applicant who are flexible and able to manage all different kind of task they may be assigned to . also , a broader range of ability will of course allow to apply for a broader range of job and will increase possibility of being employed . on the other hand certain field of study and research would and probably will very soon seriously lack of intensity and depth . especially philosophical and philological subject which do n't necessarily prepare the one or any certain job benefit from their student ' and scholar ' commitment and focus . intellectual development and insight of these subject , which , no matter what demand the job market will have within the next year , never stopped being important , would very soon come to an end in case of mere superficial and commercial interest left to this subject . secondly , the student 's personal preferations would have to be given up chosing a broad , nothing but job related field of interest . she or he would not be allowed and able to concentrate on a field of study they personally and idealistically are interested in . idetification with a nothing but useful education and possible job afterwards wo n't help them in this case to enjoy the greater part of their everyday life , which will be workday . for these reason i recommend to listen to one 's own preferation and to follow only what seems to be important to oneself .
