many people can not decide whether having broad knowledge about academic subject or specializing in one specific subject is more beneficial for individual 's career . in my opinion , people should focused on one topic and specialized in it . by having deep information and significant experience on an issue , people will gain some important advantage such a finding a good job , salary opportunity and becoming an expert in an area . first advantage of specializing in a topic is that people can find a job more easily compare to other people . because , company today generally look for people in a specific topic . the reason for this is that today 's company are working on a detailed subject . it is clearly seen that there are not so much company that work on differents area . therefore , this situation pushed the company to find people that have important experience and knowledge about their job . secondly , in today 's world , if a person is an expert in an issue , then this person take high salary compare to other employee . because it is hard to find an expert for company for a job position . therefore , big company can give high salary to these people . finally , technology force people to become an expert . the main reason for this case is that technology is developing day by day and it is not possible to have `` enough '' information about a topic . i stated that because if you want to produce something or create a product , you should have detailed information about it . by only this way , people can be creative and valuable in their company . to sum up , having detailed knowledge about a topic will become people more lucky than other people . they can get high salary and they can be `` wanted '' people among company . if people chooses the second choice , than they may not be special in the market .
