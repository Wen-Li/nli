agree or disagree ? ! when i first read this statement i thought it 's hard for me to choose if i agree or disagree with the following statement . after thinking for few minute , i now know an answer ! i agree and disagree at the same time ! i think it good to have broad knowledge of many academic subject and at the same time , i think that specializing in a a certain subject is perfect too ! both condition have advantage . one of the advantage of having broad knowledge in more than one subject is that this knowledge can help you alot in understanding what people say . for example , if you are a person who ha a broad knowledge in various academic subject , you will somehow understand a program that talk about politics ! but if you were a person that specialized in one specific subject and that subject , for example wa astronomy , it 'll be hard for you to understand a political program ! an advantage for a person that ha knowledge in only a specific subject is that this person will have deep information in the subject that they studied . for example , a person who specialized in business will have good information and detailed information in this subject . in contrast , a person that is not specialized in a specific subject will not know detailed information in a subject like business for example . there are more advantage and disadvantage for both condition but i just wanted to state these that i actually can think of for now . i think that it would be perfect if a person ha broad knowledge of various academic subject a a well a specializing in a certain subject too , but who will actually do that ? ! as for me , i really want to but it 's hard !!
