i believe that most advertisement make product seem much better than they really are . there are two reason a follow . first of all , most people would agree that the product in the advertisement are presented under the best circumstance since the purpose of advertisement is to sell the product . for example , clothing manufacturer and designer put their clothes on good looking model which make clothes more attractive . another example can be food advertisement . food is presented in the best dish with picture perfect lightening and everything . i remember that i had to return some of the product i bought because they were different from what i had seen on the ads . secondly , advertisement is one of the most powerful way for producer to communnicate and convince people that their product are benefitial to cutomers , therefore , people tend to emphasize the strength of the product rather than showing their shortcoming unless they are legally asked to do . for example , when we listen to tv or radio commercial such a cosmetic item , we feel like that item can be solution to all of our skin problem . the ad doe not say how time or money consuming the product can be . that is , i think , one of the reason that certain product such a cigarette or sleeping pill are required to state the possible side effect . unless the law requires , company would not want to show their shortcoming . as i stated above , advertisement are used to promote the slaes and communicate with cumstomers and viewer in favor of the product . consequently , i am truly convinced that product are better projected in advertisement than they are in reality in most case .
