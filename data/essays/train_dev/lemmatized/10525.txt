i totally agree with the opinion that most advertisement make product seem much better than how they actually are . there are mainly three reason why i support this idea . first of all , i want to underline what i call `` the value of experience '' . i think everybody ha a bad memory of a product he/she bought . moreover , i think everybody could tell a story about how his/her expectation were not met by the purchase of good and service advertised in the medium world . i think personal experience can say a lot about how tricky advertisement can be . as an example , i remember the first time i bought a new type of frozen pizza that wa adveritized for a while all around italy . the image seen on tv showed a fine and elaborate pizza served with some fresh napolitan ingredient . in reality , the pizza turned out to be a poor imitation of the original one that i wa shown in the advertisement . second , i think that the type of advertisement on tv , newspaper and even on the web can never be completely reliable . what i mean is that a product or service can not be perfectly reproduced on paper or through a photo . this second point is pretty technical , but i believe it is important . finally , it appears clear to me that advertizing technique are well known and designed for being tricky . even in a well-functioning market economy , you can not impose rule that prevent company from describing or presenting a product in a way that increase it value . obviously , there are some limit that company and advertising agency must follow to be in line with the regulation and law enforcement , but in general i think there is enough room to induce a consumer to buy good which are not how they are in reality . in conclusion , i think it is inevitable to come across product , buy them and then regret to have done so because the product were not exactly what we thought .
