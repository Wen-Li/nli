i agree with the following statement . successful people try new thing and take risk rather than only doing what they already know how to do well . i have three reason that i want to support my point of view . first of all , i think that if a person is always feel passion on meet new people , learn new thing , try new stuff , that mean they are not afraid they did wrong thing at least they tried . it not a big deal for them because they have a stronger attem than other people . in addtion , learn more thing that you do n't now is good to you . for examle , i am learing a new method for solving math equation , and by doing this , i 'll understand more solution that other people do n't know . so , i am being a better student that the other person . secondly , i find out that to do such new thing is a littel bit hard for most of the people becasue they are not good at . however , if they break that mind which seems nervus and afraid , they 'll go trough it and will get a lot of fun by knowing fresh thing . further more , changing your mind and learn will make you enjoy the thing what you do , i think this is also a big idea that those successful people have . thirdly , i believe that most of the successful people have attempt for their goal , they us certain way , very active and powerful way a the process they 'll do . for example , once when i wa haveing a dinner with my parent , they 've give me some good idea and i never forget about them . the idea are if you never try , you never win . and the other one is if you learn more than other people , you 'll get more chance than other people . those are the word i always remember and i realized the life from real , thing just like those word . lastly , to conclude based on the reason that i gave above , i agree with the following statement . successful peple try new thing and take risk rather than only doing what they already know how to do well .
