every young man is supposed to do that kind because , i disagree this satement beause of many reason , but at the sametime . i agree the statement . reasons for the disagreement are 1 ) as am a young boy , i myself formed a group in my street , and we held election , i wa selected a the head of the youth.my duty is to look about the welfare of the society , so what i did is , i started collected money every week from the individual , and i started helping the community , 2 ) we should agree te statement that youth are participating in the community development , because a we have many player who represent their own country , say for example great crickter master blastyer sachin tendulkar he ha satarted a community in india , from which he can help nearly 10 thousand people to survive their life , 3 ) maria sharapoa , andrew raddick , sanis mirza who are the famous tennis player the hepl the community by giving up their renumarations which they receive from the different corporate company . 4 ) every country ha got their own respect to their cedit , development in the community depends on the developmnt of the country , so individual government ha taking it own individual rule regulation . 5 ) youth ha always get associated with the community we have different kind of community , say islam community , christian comunity , inindia we have hindu commmunity , so every religion must look upon their own community development system / . 6 ) even in christianity we d have many kind of community . they say catholic , protestents , and they have different kind thing they have . if youth donot find time in helping community then how these many community are there , every community ha it own passion , they have different culture , they have many aim to their credit people often participatein community meeting .
