i agree with the statement that most advertisement make product seem much better than they really are . if the advertisement fail to show the product ' virtue , why are the manufacturer advertising their product every day ? it is the basic function of the advertisement . comercials are trying to exaggerate the virtue of product in two way . first , using the characteristic of medium . television , newspaper , and megazine are adapting every possible visual effect on their advertisement in order to show the product brighter than they are . they using lighting and computer based image reprocessing technoligies . there are lot of new thechnoligy used in the advertisement that make it possible product can be seen a totally different style and shape . hence , customer usually disappointed with the real shape and color of the product , especially for economic product with ceap material . second , showing just good part of the product . even though the advertisement do not lie to customer , exposing only the good part of product mean hiding the worse part of the product . hence , if the public see the advertisement , they may think the product are amazing one without any problem . it is the reason why some sophisticate customer try to find rate of other customer for the product they plan to buy . the customer who already used the product can give more accurate information , both pro and con . it mean customer hardly find bad aspect of the product on their comercials . in conclusion , i strongly agree with the idea that advertisemens make product seem much better than they really are . although advertisement of product can provide people with information that may helpful to decide to buy them , they are often to lure customer with wrong image .
