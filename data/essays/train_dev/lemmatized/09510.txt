it is a big topic to discus that let student to understand idea and concept are more important or to learn the fact are more important . i think it is more important for student that to understand idea and concept than for them to learn fact . we are not machine . student should know what happened , and why it happened . for student to learn something , it is not only tell them the fact . the main point is telling them why . as we know , student have their imagination , they can imagine a lot of stuff . they have the ability to understand and figure out what will happe next . to tell them the idea can make them keep going , not stop there . for teaching a student , it is important that give them a way to go and to explore , not only give them answer . there is an example . it is said there wa a mom , she ha two child , she love them . she gave her first child a lot wood fair to live in the winter , at the same time , she gave her second child a axe to make wood by himself . the first winter past quickly . both of them still alive . the first child did n't do a lot of work but he had a good winter , the second one did a lot work and he had a good winter too . one year past quickly , the winter came again . the first child did n't have enough wood , he used almost of his wood up during the last winter . he died in a cold night . with out fair . the second child used his axe to make wood , he past the winter at last . this story tell u something about to understand idea is more important than to learn the fact . i think it is more important that to understand idea than it is for them to learn fact .
