today , education is a very important factor for the personal development and a a concequence , many people have a wide knowledge in different subject . for my person , i agree and also disagree with the statement due to the following reason . one one side , a student should concentrate himself on one specific topic . today , there is so much to learn about on subject , you do not have the time to study an other subject . imagine the subject biology . there are so many invention in the technology for biology and this invention result in new discovery in the subject . as a concequence , student and also graduate person always have to update their knowledge and that would not provide the time which is needed to study a different subject . therefore , a specialisation absolutly necessary to be good at his subject . but in my opinion , there exists also a differt view . influences like globalisation and environmental pollution have changed the world . everthing is connected together . further , society deeply depends one nature . and in this framework , it is really important the we know how the world is connected . a broad knowledge of many academic subject can provide this knowledge . for example , a chemist in a big chemistry company can only do his job well , when he also know what consequence can occur in the environment and even in the society . in conclusion , in my opinion there are some reason why i should support the statement of specialisation and also some reason why i shoud support the broad knowledge of academic subject .
