i disagree this statement . because the student in broad knowledge will not help a lot in futher study . if person take a specialization in particular subject will help him a lot , and he becomes expert in his own subject . board knowledge is mainly useful for school education only . when he compelting school education his should have hsi own idea in specialization course , i think specialization is mainly for graduate student . every preson ha is own specialization in study from certain age . specialization of particular course will help the student a lot specialization in course help the student to become master in his desired field . student specialization in particular coursr depends mainly on his attitude . the student should be given a chance to take his specialization course which will mainly heilp in his study . one the student had taken his desired field it will help the society a lot . if student taken his desired field a new invention can be made . invetion and discovery are made by great people in their desired field . so my opinion is taking specialization in desired field help the student and his country .
