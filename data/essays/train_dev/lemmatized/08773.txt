advertisements sometimes are just an information that not show the true , it is just a way to show and offer the product . all the product have to have an advertisement , but sometimes this kind of ad only show the common rule that all the product must have . in my opinion advertisments must show the true composition of the product , no matter if it significate a major cost for the company who produce this kind of product . advertisments are very important because they show u if that product is correct or no for our consume . i agree with most advertisments make product seem much better than they really are , some products show quality that are n't true when you consume it , the only thing that they concern it sell their product no matter if it is so good or no . they try to hide some detail , and that detail can be harmful for some people . a lot of peolple ca n't consume some ingredient , for example a diabetic person should n't taste sugar , but if an advertisment do n't show the quantity of sugar that the product have , this product is harmful for that person , even can cause an intoxication . i think we must create a rule for advertisments , all of the product should have a complety list of ingredient and the quantity and quality of these , the product must be clasificated . to conclude i can say that advertisment sometimes can be entertaiment but sometimes can be cheerfully , all we have to do is look and try to find the real purpose of the product .
