the problem of knowing if being a risk taker or limiting yourself to do what you 're good at to be successful is complex and controversial . while some people might argue that risk are likely to lead to failure , i would say that major success have often been the result of creative and risky initiative . i believe that innovative thinking a well a risk taking person are more likely to obtain huge success . if you do only what you 're good at , you generally do n't create new idea nor product but you just execute something that ha been already done . being efficient may make you the best in your field and procure you some relative success . in my opinion , having a comfortable living situation doe not necessarly mean success . in fact , success would be illustrated by more outstanding success story , like the one which came from a completly new concept . this point can be illustrated by the example of the company google . to start a new company is a challenge itself that can lead to failure . in the google 's case , building a very efficient search engine and believing that it can be profitable through advertising wa a completly new and innovative concept . financial risk related to the investment were important . investors had to be willing to take risk in a situation where we had no history nor statistic to anticipate success . however , google managed to be successful to the point where every employee gained a lot of money thanks to the enterprise success . even the cafeteria chef 's stock option were multiplied by more than one hundred between the time he joined google and now ! i do n't believe we have seen such a growth in other new company for the last year . today , we can definitely measure that the risk wa really important a we know that a lot of company that emerged from the internet bubble went bankrupt . also , we can realize that google 's innovative thinking a well a their will to take risk enabled his creator to have the success they have today .
