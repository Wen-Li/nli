in recent year , the education system are diffrent . some people perfer the student should have broad knowledge of many academic subject , however other perfer to have specialize in one specific subject . for me , i would agree with first oppinion . the reason are a follows . first and formost reason is that in this sociaty we need compehensive person . nowadays , the competition is very drastic , every body ha ambition to be the first , if i just have specialize in one specific subject , i could not allow to have various job oppotunities , and also i will lose some good chance . for example , if i specialize in history , i just can find some job rely on history , but there are not have many job in history , but if i study borad subject i can afford many diffrent job , even it not intrested , but i can get job and money . i can servive . second factor is that it can improve my organizetion skill . for example , if i stduy broad knowledge of many academic sujects i will organize the time , and my work ethic . also it enlarge my view , also in diffrent calsses , i will meet diffrent people , it also can improve my communication skill and interpersonal skill . thid lie in fact is that it pave my way for furture . if i have abroad knowledge of many academic subject , i can have good job oppotunity and also if i meet diffrent people , i can easy to talk with them and easy to find intrest object to talk , because i have large knowledge . also it improve my socal communication . in brief , even specialize in one specific subject , you might save time and save money , but you will loss more . according to what i have disscuss about , if you want to give them good impression and if you want to survive in this sociaty , you should have broad knowledge if many academic subject than specialize in one specific subject . weighing the pro and con of these argumentation , i agree that it is better to habe broad knowledge of many academic subject .
