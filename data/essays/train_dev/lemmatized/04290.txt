i disagree with the following statement . because from now so many people buy the car , and also so many people use a lot of car . so even in twenty year there will be not fewer car in use than there are today . also another reason of this statement is now so many car come out after a mouth of year or after 1 year . and some people buy one car , after that they buy new car . because the new car is good design and good looking . so many in twenty year there will be so many car in more use than there are today , and also there will be a lot of new car are coming out .
