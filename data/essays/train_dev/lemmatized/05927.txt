though some people might think travelling in a group arranged by the travel agent is the most suitable way of travelling , i strongly disagree with it and i consider the best way to travel is by individual . in my first place , the cost of travelling by individual is significantly lower than by a group . you need to pay more service charge to the tour guide , to the hotel , or any additional charge when travelling in a group , you may have a question in mind , `` what is the cost difference between them ? '' from my experience to boston in united states , travelling in a group would cost about hk $ 10,000 , while travelling by individual would cost about $ hk 6,000 . it is only two-third of the cost by travelling in a group . my second reason is that travel in a group is not flexible for the schedule of your trip . you need to follow a standard schedule to eat , to play or to wake up at specific time while it just like working . the main purpose of have a trip is to relax while the tight schedule would not make this original goal effective . for instance , if i want to stay a place for a longer time and enjoy more there , it is up to my decision by travelling alone . i can manage my time in my own interest instead of following a standard time schedule . finally , i consider that travelling alone would explore more than you expected . you can decide to go to any place to learn the different custom where it would really broaden your horizon and make you become independent . you can obtain any kind of information by finding them out yourself and get a deeper insight on them . for example , you can live in a host family for a couple of day to experience their culture . this would be really beneficial to you . to conclude , i love the experience that only travelling alone would give me .
