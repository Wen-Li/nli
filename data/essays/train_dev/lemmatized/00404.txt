of course i completly agree with that statement . i think that in life everyone must have high ambition , but the realization of personal scope and ambition dipends in a large part on the ability of everyone to take risk and try new thing . if a parson who want to have success in life only doe what he/she already know maybe he never became real leader in his own business . that 's because everyone ha to wrong for deeply learn . of course if there are no risk there are no mistake and if there are n't any mistake nobody can obtain a real knowledge . the real knoledge is based on two fondamental point : personal cultur , academic and theoric knoledge and pratical experience . they are both fondamental : the only theoric knoledge or the only pratical experience are not enough . for example i 'm a good student , i have good mark and a good theoric knolendge , but if i want to have success in the future this is n't enough . in fact in ten year i see myself graduate but also working in the field i 'm studying for . i see myself at the head of my own business , i do n't care if small or big , i just hope it could be active in organization of cultural event . i said that becaouse even if i will be graduate with excellent mark it will be very important for my person and my careear to do experiece in the `` concrete world '' . in fact i imagine my self travelling around the world , surching for new experience , and new source to organise very original a particular event here in italy . this is very important do give relevance to the year that i spent at school at first and and at universty after . this is tha only way to have success in life .
