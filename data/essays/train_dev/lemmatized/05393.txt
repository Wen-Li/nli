is it more important for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact ? i think not . first , because fact are thing that can really be change . facts are the way they are and there is nothing we can do about then to change then or to modify the thing they try to let u know . in the other hand , idea , a the name give u a clue , are the thing we think or believe about something . as an example , we all know that we need air to live . if there were no air , we all would die . but instead of only teaching this we get the ideas of why air is necessary . we breath it , it go to our lung then the oxigen is transported to the whole body traveling by the blood . we can get to know that it is important . following the same example , we can find the concept of `` breathing '' then we get all the idea we mentioned above . with that information we can reach a fact : air is needed to live . another reason why idea and concept are better than only fact . with the first i mentioned we can find out more information than with fact . thanks to the concept , we can understand the way thing are , the way why the sky is blue , why our blood is red , how is it that the light is reflected , etc . . facts let u know thing someone else , thanks to investigation , concept and idea discovered . someone may say `` what 's so wrong about it ? '' if we are not motivated to investigate , to satisfy our necessity of knowing , we will only take the `` free sample '' we recieve from fact . besides , if we cook our idea , and bake our spicy concept then we can find a complete menu of knowlage . free to whoever who want to try it . and once you try it , you are going to look for it . it is better to cook thant just to but a pack of cooky . to make my point clear , with fact we do n't reall y get to investigate or to make a research about thing . but with idea and concept we can create our fact , thanks to the information we looked for . and that is why i disagree with the statement on the first line .
