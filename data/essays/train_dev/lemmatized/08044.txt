i completely agree with this statement . the main reason for advertisment is to sell their product on the market . they want to get the attention of the viewer or the reader for their product . advertisment should not only emphasizes the goodness of their product , furthermore it stress a character given by the advertisment . for example , when there is a company advertising for entertaining thing like a funny tv show they also have an even more funny and entertaining advertisment during the commercial break . it is not important for the company if the message which is given by the advertisment is correct or not , the only important thing is that they get the people 's attention and may achieve interest to watch their show . the only thing advertisment doe so is because of money . money rule the world . and so the company is not afraid to illusion people . next to the obvious reason that the company want people to buy their product first of all , is that mayby their product is not so good that people would buy it . in turn , they have to improve the image or quality of their product . this make a product seem better although it might be worse . on the other hand lot of people have already made a lot of experience with some advertisment and their promise year ago . moreover , they got to know that most of all the advertisment is much better than the product in reality . this experience made people more sceptical . but how should people know if the advertised product is for real worse than the advertisment promised or if it is maybe exactly like that or even better ? they have to test it . and therefore they spend some money . maybe they test it just one time , but they do it and that 's exactly what 's the purpose for an advertisment .
