every teacher ha his/her way to teach sudents and each tacher ha his / her technieqs in teaching . one may let student to understand idea , and one may let them to learn fact . however , teaching student to understand idea and concept deliver the information more easily to student rather than learning and memorising fact . understanding idea and concept is make the information or the detail more clear to student . first , when a student is facing a new idea and information , he/she may have no idea about the new topic . and starting by learning the fact and memorising them will be hard on them and may lead to miss understanding for the topic . whereas , when the teacher try to explain how the concept and the idea where direvered from will make it easier for the student to learn . for example , if the teacher give student scientific work sheet and tell student that they have a test in the next day on the difinitions , student will try to memorise the term without understanding for the root or the detail of the fact that are in the sheet . however , they will be confused about how the fact and the detail are linked . and in that case the teacher should have have talk about the fact and teach the student how these fact work , because that might help in memorising the fact for a longer time period . second , if the student learnt for example , how the machiene work , he will be more knowledgable about method used to invint it . moreover , when the teacher us technieqs that alows the student to think and how to understand the idea this piece of information will last in his/her head for along time and he/she can develope that new idea a year after a year . using this methode will produce alotof inventores and scientests . to conclude , some student have the appility to understand more than memorising and the opposite is also true . however , these two type of learning , depend on understanding idea and concept . and it make it easier for student to learn .
