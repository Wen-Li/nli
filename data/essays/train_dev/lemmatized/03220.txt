young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their community . is this statement right or not ? i think it is quite difficult to answer this question . if i think of my grandmother , wa she really more involved in their community ? it is possible that at the time , when my grandmother wa young , kid and teenager may have done more for their community . for example people in these day organised event for the whole community , they were together in a social community and helped each other , wherever they could . but this statement can be made for all people of my grandmother village , not only for young people . on the other side my grandmother and also the other child in her age had to work a lot at home and on the field . so they did not have a lot time to spend together or to do thing for their community . furthermore i think nowadays young people are also social active . it depends more , where they are living . in rural society , in a small village for example , the connection between the inhabitant is much closer , than in urban area . in a big city , in zurich for example , people do not spend a lot of time in helping others . as bigger a city is the more individual and isolated people are . thy do not have enough time and also not enough connection with others . and the consequence of this individualism and this isolation is that people , expecially young people , are not integrated in the whole society , they have only their peer , but they are not much connected with , or related to people form different age or different social and educal background . this people do not even think about helping their community . but that is not their problem , that is the problem of the whole society and the difference between urban and rural life .
