when economy grows in a country , more people are able to purchase their own private car . in this regard , more people may have car in twenty year in thailand . as far a bangkok is concerned , however , i disagree that there will be fewer car in use than there are today . currently , too many car are on road with le proper regulation and these car have caused environmental and health problem . since these problem are geting more serious , the civil society , which may grow more in forthcoming decade in thailand , urge the thai government to restrict the number of car in bangkok and the government ha started to take action a follows . first , the thai government ha been aware of necessity of more public transportation due to the current trafic situation in bangkok . in the morning and evening , people commuting by car including their privaite vehicle and bus have to spend a lot of time ; this is really wast of time for individual and the country 's development . if people can use more variety of train with an affordable price and convenient manner , they will of course prefer using them . in this sence , it is important for the government to continue to develop the underground train and sky-train system not only in bangkok but also it suverbs . according to the plan of the bangkok metropolitan authority , i am sure that a lot more line of these train will be constructed in twenty year . second , alike singapre and other country , the government will enforce a proactive regulation for reducing the number of private car in bangkok . for example , specific rush hour in morning and evening , a car should have 4 passenger including a driver . besides , when bangkok ha become more developed , the price of it real estate will increase . due to it , the parking lot will have to charge much more than now . this ha been seen already in a big city like tokyo , where people avoid using their car for shopping since the parking fee is sometimes more expensive than their purchase at the shopping center .
