the lifestyle and activity of the young and old people are always compared . while the young people think that the way of life old people lead is slow and boring , old people complain about the speed of the young people 's life . people , young or old , have a limited time to live . . in addition to this people should live their life full of enjoy and with activity . wecan clearly observe that there are more activity for the young people around . it can be seemed a a discrimination but it must be accepted that in today 's world young people spend ore time at outside and also spend more money . in this situation it can be concluded that young people have more chance to enjoy life . on the other hand , what about the people whose age is old but young himself ? i mean that sometimes age doe not the meaning of everything . person who ha had a enjoyful life can continue his life in same way . in addition to this , the concept ` experience ' is very important . when the people are young they do not have the chance of aware of what is true and wrong . therefore it is possible to make mistake and destroy his life . ofcourse it is not something certain but even it is just a possibility it is a situation that must be thought on . on the other hand old people who had several mistake before gain experience and make le mistake . and in my opinion it is a good way of enjoying the life . another important thing is that enjoying life is also up to the preference and idea of the people . there can be young people who enjoy doing thing that associated with the old people . for instance , a young person may not like the night life . instead of this he may prefer to dtay at home nd chat with family at night . another example is fishing with a boat . most of the young people think that it is boring but it can be also a source of enjoy for a young person . in conclusion , it is important to belive in life and it beauty . if a person know how to enjoy life it is not importanr if he is old or young .
