i think that new thing in life can be discovered only if there is a perfect observation . if it wo n't be there then it 's not possible to discover new thing . some belive that taking risk in life you may go ahead but others think that it 's better to do what we know . but i think that successful people try new thing and take risk . i have several reason for holding my opinion . if a person is working in a factory and his bos ha alloted a particular work and he is confused then it will be difficult for him to do that work . but if he take risk and try to solve that problem then it would be very easy to help his bos . even , scientist are inventing more thing by taking risk . for an example , while inventing a computer it wa difficult for them to select what wa necessary for inventing it . but , at that time if they would not have taking risk then it would be difficult for them to invent a computer . i would like to give an example of an everyday 's life . some people spend there money in buying lottery ticket by taking risk . but if they will get double money then it would be useful for them . and a such they will be beniffited by taking risk . if a person is shy or is not ready to take risk then he might miss an opportunity in getting scholarship . if he think taht his score is very low then he is unable to apply his result in different university . and probaly he will have to waste his future . as a result of risk our country is progressing economically . if we would n't have taken risk then we would be still standing at that same placewere our ancesstors were . so , i think that taking risk in life successful people try new thing .
