`` successful people try new thing and take risk rather than only doing what they already know how to do well . '' i agree with the above statement that successful people should try and take risk rather than only doing what they already know how to do well . a person must first secure his position both financially and mentally by doing what he is skilled in . then there is no point in doing the same thing again and again and produce the same result . for a person to grow in life , he must try innovative mean to do the same work or try new thing and take risk . as we know , doing the same work repeatedly will add nothing but boredom to one 's life . to add spice to life , one must try something new . but this should be done carefully and responsibly so that it doe not affect one 's existing reputation and profession . let u consider one of the giant in global economy , mr.dhirubhai ambani who wa the founder and director of reliance industrial group in india . he initially entered the market in the final quarter of the 20th century by starting a textile firm which he struggled very hard to develop into a very big company . he wa very successful and wa financially very secure at that time . yet , he wa a true entrepreneur and tried out innovative thing and took many risk by entering petroleum industry . now reliance petroleum is a very big name in indian economy . in addition to the above mentioned industry , he also started reliance telecommunication which is the first cdma mobile service in india . he reaped huge profit through this . infact , reliance group ha entered energy and retail sector also . today , reliance group stand among the top 50 company globally . all this would not have been possible if he had not taken the risk and entered into these business instead of holding on to the textile business . so i think it is always better to secure your position first both financially and mentally and then try out innovative thing and take risk to develop your business . a successful man doe n't rest at any point of time but strives hard to be more successful . successful people try new thing and take risk rather than doing what they already know how to do well .
