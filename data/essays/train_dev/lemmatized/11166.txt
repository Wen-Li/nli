i agree with the statement that it is more important for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact . there are several reason to prove this opinion . first , students understand and learn easily about the subject if they know what idea and concept are . for example , in math class , they are learning about the multiplication formula . at the basic level , they only memorize the formula . four time four equal to sixteen . this is not difficult , but in problem solving quetions , they need to think about the quetion what formula they are going to use . at this point , they need the skill derived from the main concept and idea about the multiplying system . second , if they just learn the fact , they only need to memorize the fact that happened in a specific time range . they can not apply the fact into real life . in real life , people confront many unexpected moment . they should be wise to solve problem when they are in difficult situation . however , if people only learn the fact , how can they solve other problem that they have never experienced ? therefore , people need to apply idea and concept that they have learned to the problem in real life . third , every subject is interacting each other . for example , math and science are related subject and social and history are related subject . people would not know how they are related and study well both subject if they do n't know the concept and idea of each subject . everything that surround people in their life are related and interacting each other . people study subject that are related our surroundings . if they only know the fact , they can not be improved and go ahead because they have only limited knowledge and skill . to think broad and fix the problem , people have to know the real idea they have to achieve and the main concept of the subject .
