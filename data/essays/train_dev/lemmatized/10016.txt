it is common that many people begin to gain knowledge in a variety of way . at the same time the question that if it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subject than to specialize in one specific subject will be brought about . what do you think of the issue ? as far a i am concerned , i will agree with the idea that it is better to specialize in one specific subject than to have broad knowledge of many academic subject . in the following paragraph , i will add some example and detail to support my point of view . in the first place , specializing in one specific subject ha advantage in various way , of which , the most significant is that it will save our time and energy . we have to the point out the essencial fact that we do not have enough time to finish every work well , which mean that we can not do good in many academic subject . if we focus on one subject , we are able to spend enough time on that subject . therefore , we will have more chance to be successful in the subject we concentrate on . for instance , if a student whose major is computer science study art to broaden his eyesight , he will not have much time study his major , which will influence his grade and credit . as a result , there will be bad effect on his study . in consequence , we will make good use of our limited time to study , if we concentrate on one subject . in the second place , what is also worth noticing is that it will bring benefit to our future job , if we specialize on one specific subject . as we all know , in the future we will find a job which we are interested in . in that case , we should focus on one subject which attracts u a lot . then we will find a good job after graduation because of our professional knowledge . for instance , if we study biology , we are able to learn more in the subject , which mean that we can gain the knowledge related to biology . therefore , when we have the interview , we will have a lot of academic knowledge to be discussed which will leave a good impression to the manager . we will get the job we want easily . admittedly , if we have broad knowledge of many academic subject , we will become knowledgeable . however , if we have knowledge in a variety of aspect and we do not know much about each subject , it will cause bad influence on our future life , which is not good . therefore i tend to hold the opinion that it is better to specialize on one subject which we have lot of interest and we will get benefit from it . to sum up , taking into account of what ha been discussed above , i can draw the conclusion that specializing in one specific subject is better than having broad knowledge of many academic subject . i wish that there will be an increasing number of people who can get benefit from the one subject they specialize in .
