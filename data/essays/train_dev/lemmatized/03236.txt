i agree with the statement that today 's young people do not participate to help their community , because they do n't have enough time to spend on such an activity . someone may argue that , through the long history of the mankind , young people in each era should be very busy with their own task . however , even though they were a busy a our time ' young people , nowadays are more competitable that any other period in human history . in korea , a lot of student in secondary education are suffuring from afterschool class in private institution . they depends on private institution from when they were elementary school . the have learned playing the piano , playing the football , even friendship through the private institution . all of these are competitive . their parent are very afraid of their childrens ' being a loser . as a result , young people do not have enough time to do other activity , and they only concentrate on the subject that will be helpful in their entrance in a good high school , a good university and finally getting a good job . though young people nowadays have a mind to help and participate in their community , it is almost impossible for them practically . another reason that young people nowadays do not have enough time to help their community is for the technology advance . as information technology are growing faster , human can save much time on the simple traditional task , such like calculating , or searching for information . however , human need more time to study new technology and be able to use newly developed computer program . especially , the recent survey result that younger people spends much more time on internet and almost of them are early adaptor to newly developed facility . they spend a lot of time doing someting with their computer . so they hardly can think of helping other people , or their community . in sum , high comptitive surrounding that is confronted with younger people nowadays , advance in information and commucation technology and computer technology prevent young people to give enough time to helping their society .
