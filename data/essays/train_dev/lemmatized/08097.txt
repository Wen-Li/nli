oh no . i do n't have any date on the buisness car but i dont belive it , but i hope it . probably after tokio the world and the daily beahevior people must change . the car make so much pollution that the world is n't able to resist in this way . also the city ca n't resisiste to all of this . in some city , for example , is made a law to do n't go by car in several day and to improve the pubblic service such a metro or bus . i thik that in italy the continuo oil 's increase cost is do to we do n't take the car every day . it ' s all rigth for me because in some way we do n't take every moment the car . althaugt the car company make more and more new and amazing car . they are always more power and that they fire more than oldest . i am ill when i see that every person ha a personal car ( in italy ) , and i try fight this going by bike and also i promove the bike .
