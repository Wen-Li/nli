it would be universally acknowledged that young people enjoy life more than older people do . according to me , this statement can not be entirely true . let u consider my personal view and the comparison between a young people life and an older person life . for the great majority of people , youngness brings all that a person want : health , beauty , love and so on . and it is wright . but something everybody ignores , is the notion of time . in our society who ha time to do what they want ? currently , young people are the most of the time student . they have a lot of work to pas their exam and have their dilpoma . by this way , they study a lot and spend their time working at home or on campus . added to this question of time , a student ha no money . studies are very expensives , above all in the united-states . a master could cost 20 000 euro for a year . it would be difficult to have extraordinary week-ends or travel to a foreign country or to do a very expensive sport . all these thing bring u to consider diferently a young people life . with no time and no money , how could a student really enjoy is life ? on the other hand , older people do not have all the daily life problem ' . of course , they have some healthy problem but they have time because they are retired . they worked all their life , they accumulated money . they can travel all over the world and make their dream possible . they do n't have child at home , they do n't have a lot of preocupation . they can live their life a they want , see their friend when they want . according to me , older people could enjoy life a lot . this brief presentation can lead u to reconsiderate the statement . young people are to busy to lead their life a they want . old people have this opportunity . it is important to realize this . it is my personal opinion .
