historically , to have a broad knowledge of subject wa perceived a part of a culturally enriched society . if we take a peek at the ancient greek we see that all their main philosopher ( platon , aristoteles or socrates ) were considered to be expert in many field . but time ha changed and nowadays specialization ha become more and more important . having said this , i ca n't totally disagree with this tendency . i believe that in our modern society , if you want to stand out from the rest you need to specialize and become an expert on your area or field . a good example of this is what the labour market is currently demanding . if you do n't have a job because you are not specialized or expert enough , how can you wish to have a broader knowledge ? different is if , in your spare time , you devote it to persue other academic knowledge , that 's fine . but i believe that the real reason why many people choose to a very specific academic knowledge and a certain career path is because this will assure them the suficient ` know how ' they will need in th future tu secure a job position . educational authority and responsibles should have a say in all this . from my perspective the educational law should provide the opportunity to the student to choose a wider spectrum of subject a longer a possible . to be honest , this will not be possible always , there will a time that the student will have to focus in which path he or she will like to continue in . but the later we prolongue this decision , the better . to summarize , if we lived in an ideal world we could all know about a lot of subject but this is n't like this . the reality is avery different one and we have to apply to it . the society want ` expert ' and we know it , so we play by the book .
