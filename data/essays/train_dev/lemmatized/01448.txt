most advertisement make product seem better than they really are . this reminds me of an incident which occurred only a few day ago . i wa out shopping with my friend and i wa on the look out for a new mobile phone which i had fallen in love with a soon a i saw it on my television screen one fine morning . i had vowed to buy that mobile phone whatever be the consequence . this action can be appraised by the fact that the phone looked really cute in the advertisement and it boasted of many feature a well . this phone wa the ultimate gadget for any teenager . but i had the ultimate shock when i saw the same mobile phone in the mall . it did not look a cute a it did in the ad , for one thing , and it did not seem to have a many feature a it did in the ad . the ad wa an illustration of what is defined a cheap publicity . the phone had been wrongly displayed and if it were not for my trust-worthy friend , i would have bought it with all the love i previously had for it and then would have ended up a the loser , disappointed a well . most advertisement seem to display product in such a way that the consumer would fall in love with the product just by viewing the advertisement . this can result in serious damage of the customer ' trust in advertisement a well a in the manufacturer of that particular product . the consumer will be heart-broken when they come home and realise that the product , with which they were previously so in love , ha really let them down , quality-wise . the advertiser or the manufacturer are hood-winking the consumer into buying their product at high price , ensuring profit for themselves , but breaking the trust of the consumer nonetheless . the advertisement should be more realistic and they should not display something which the consumer may not find in the product later . the advertiser should only advertise those charactertistics of the product which actually exist and serve a purpose . not the characteristic that ought to be in a product . if the advertiser are so keen on advertising such characteristic they should suggest to the manufacturer to actually integrate these characteristic into the product and then advertise them so they would not be cheating the customer but actually showing a true , realistic picture .
