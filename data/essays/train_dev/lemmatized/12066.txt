in my point of view understanding idea and concept is very important . the subject like a java , we can know the knowledge of java by understanding the idea and concept . concept is more important than fact . by studying the fact like sun microsystems invented the java , we ca n't understand the feature of the java . we can also learn by something hearing and studying the fact . fact can also improve the knowledge . by studying the fact like independense we should know about the great leader of our country , and we should know about the how they will work hard for the independense . history will tell about this . so learning the fact were important . by studing the fact the child can learn about the honesty , relibility , and history of the country . everyone must should know about the history of the country . by learning the fact we can prevent the war like second world war and the first world war . by learning the fact we can know about our previous culture and method , it wa very intrresting . last week some of the person found the dwaraka under the sea , so by hearing this fact we can conclude that there were dwaraka in the past . by understanding the concept and idea we can improve the knowledge of the subject and we can improve our performance and profound knowledge in the subject . we ca n't understand the concept like polymorphism and abstracton while learning about the fact . all the student can understand by understanding the concept and idea of the subject . conceots were very important and ideas were also important . for understanding subject the student could know about the idea and concept . there would be necerrely fact for the student because for know about the past . in this day , understanding the concept is very importants for future importance .
