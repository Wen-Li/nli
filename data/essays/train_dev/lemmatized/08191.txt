i agree with this is the best way to travel is in group led by a tour guide . if u will go to the visit the one country without guide . if you know little bit about the visit place you can manage what ever you know about the country . you want visit more place in that country u dont know about the visit place then you need guide . there is no guide along with you whatever u know you can visit the place . if there are more visiting place are there you can not visit that place . at the same time you can face languge problem . if you visit the place simply by saw the place it is waste if the guide is along with you he can explains if there is a histerical place are present . if you know about visiting place completely u dont need a guide . in some case if you want to visit the new place uyou want know the language of that visiting place . at the some time food at thevisiting place is not good . if you take the guide along with he is familier with that place this can be helpful to u . guide known the languge so that there is no communication problem . next some visit place food is not good . so guide know the where the food available fresh food . another one is he is familiar with whatever the visiting place are there in the visiting place . another one is he well known about the which hotel is good and which hotel is available at our allowabel financial . it wiil beeter to go with guide whenever you t
