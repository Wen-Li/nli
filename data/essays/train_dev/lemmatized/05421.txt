yes , i defenetly agree with that statement . i 'm finishing my study for mediadesign in berlin and during them i got some information from different advertising agency . if we take a model for example , which will be on the next `` vogue '' cover ( a fashionmagazin ) , so she or he , the model will be the product for this magazin-cover at this time . this magazin want to sell any kind of image , so the model ha to look pretty , modern or somehow , so the people who work in these advertisment agency are going throught a picture which any photographer have shoten and they are working over it , sometimes even day , so if the model on the picture ha for example a spot in the face , it will be removed in the computer , by programms like photoshop , which make it possible . even me , a student who often design brochure and invitation have to make some picture looking better than they really are , like the light , the color , contrast etc . so i can unerstand why these advertisments are doing that . pictures or objects in general will be caught by our eye first , so if there is a banana on a poster in a busstation for example , we ca n't really smell it , but we can see it and if there is a banana which is looking green , a they often do at the beginning , we will maybe not buy this brand , but if you imagine a banana on the picture that ha a beautifull strong yellow color , we a human being would think in our mind `` this banana , that is from jamaica , semms to be tastefull , i guess banana from this brand are qualitativ , healthy and good '' . this is how we normally think , but of course there can be a lot of disappointment of it , after bying these advertised product .
