successful people want to try new thing and take risk , instead of doing what they already know to do well , and this for these two main reason . the first reason is that it is one of the mankind caracteristics . since the homo erectus , human being try new thing and take risk to develop themselves . for example , at the beginning the first pre-human lived in tree because it wa a safe place . and since they had jumped off their tree , they had discover many useful thing and had known an great evolution . they had taken risk , instead of staying on their tree like monkey , which allowed them to made great discovery . if the human being is at this level , it is because some of them tried new thing and made some breaktroughs . for example galille , took a lot of risk when he propose his therory of a round earth turning around the sun . and he could have trust the old therory which were saying that the earth wa like a plate , but he did it to improve the scientifical knowledge . the second reason , is that successful people are getting bored when they always do the same thing , because they seem too easy . so , to have a challenge they try new thing to discover new difficulty or feeling which can lead to the progress of the person or of the community . for example , ellen mc arthur know how to sail on a river or on a lake , but for her there is no challenge doing it . she prefers doing thing the had never done before , like doing the round of the earth . this is true for sport in general . its is the motivation of every athlete to go every time further , to push it own limit . as a conclusion we could say that it is thanks to these successful people if human being ha reached this point of evolution . and it is not finished yet .
