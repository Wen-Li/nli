the author suggests the young people enjoy life more than older poeple . i neither agree nor disagree with the statement . i believe it purely depends on the mind-set and the personality of the individual himself than it doe on his age when it come to enjoying life . a pessimist in his prime would surely not enjoy life a much a an optimist who is in his old age . generally considering , a young person is not burdened with responsibility and thus ha a carefree life compared to the one led by older one . thus , he would enjoy his life more than doe a older one . also , enjoyment is an abstract word . one may find enjoyment in partying , hanging out with friend doing all sort of carefree stuff while others may find enjoyment in their work . thus , it is hard to say a person is fully happy when he is in a community gathering enjoying himself . also . it would be incorrect to say that a person is not enjoying when he is seriously involved in work . it just depends on what one think is enjoyment . as it is , young age is the most enjoyable part of one 's life a a man is healthy without any ailment or disease . thus , even in medical term , he is well equipped in young age and thus , can enjoy life more . when one grows older , one may find fulfiling his responsibility to be a happiness . thus , he will be happy and may be more happy than a young person a he ha no more responsibility to fulfil . some people enjoy challenge . thus , when such a person encounter challenge and find all possible way to win the situation and start applying these to his problem , he may find his life more joyful and more enjoyable . i will conclude this essay by reiterating my stand that , enjoyment of life depends on the perspective of the individual than it doe on his age .
