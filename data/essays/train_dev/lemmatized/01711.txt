nowadays many advertisement make product seem much better than they really are . i agree with this statement for many reason . i could say that in the world of business the most important characteristic is the honesty , so if a company make an advertisement that make a product seem much better than they really is this company will probably loose a lot of customer . i think that this consequence that i 've explained is a risck for every company . after stating that loosing a lot of client are a risck for a company , in other word i can say that if this company doe n't change the advertisement it will surely loose all tha customer and failed in the end . i think that nowadays a company must make large effort to survive and the most important effort is to improve the honesty of the advertisement to make the product seem like they really are . for example , i recently take a new car that seems a wonderful car in the advertisement . initially this car doe n't make noise and doe n't make problem to me but after a mounth it begin to stop more often and it begin to have a lot of problem . furthermore i have to spend more money to adjust this car than the money that i spend to buy it . the company that give me the car ha lose a customer and also customer 's friend . in any experience of mine i would wish that first of all the company or the person are honest . concluding among all the possible fact the most important aspect in every business is the honesty . as a matter of fact all the company shold make an effort to improve the advertisement of their product .
