in my opininon , the statement doe n't represent the reality in a completely way . i am agree about the fact that the number of car is increased today , but i disagree when it is said that car were fewer twenty year ago . during the eighty there were many car , a lot of traffic and the hustle and the dustle like in our nowadays city . therefore there wa pollution in the air and also an acoustic one . obviously pollution increased during the year and today it ha reached an alarm level , especially in big city like milan or rome . i know this fact because i live in milan where the air is really heavy and street are full of noise and waste . thus i go to the countrysyde , when i have the possibility , in order to live some day in a natural atmosphere . i think that our enviromental condition is terrible . one reason for the increase of pollution depends on the fact that today a family us often two or more car , because maybe is necessary for working or for reaching other place . although i think that every person could contribute to improve the situation by using the underground or other public transport . the only positive aspect of today 's situation is the help offered by technology which ha modified specific part of new car and the engine in order to control the emission of toxic gas and to decrease pollution . twenty year ago these solution did n't exist and car emitted all toxic and dangerous gas and other substance .
