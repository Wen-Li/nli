there are always two aspect for learning-one is to understand idea and concept and another is learn fact . both of these have their own importance . some time it is important to learn idea and concept than to learn concept . in another condition learning fact have dominance over the understanding of idea and concept . both vary according to the situation . for a student studying the mathematics it will helpful for him to understand the concept and idea . learning basic concept will help him a lot . he can utilize these fact in solving many of his problem . another example for importance of learning the fact is here . a student can utilize a fact a a previous experience in solving a problem . suppose he is in a problem of choosing a product from same price . then he will utilize the fact of his previous life . for example one of his friend ha puchased the same product one month before . while the use of this product his friend ha problem . in this condition man will not buy this product a a fact that this product had harmful effect on his friend . some time it becomes important for student to pay more attention to idea and concept . if a student ha no experience about decision which he is going to take then it will beneficial for him to use his idea and concept . in some subject untill a student will not understand the idea and concept he will not reach to a conclusion . for example in a music class , if a student use his idea and concept he will be able to understand the quality of music in deep . he will perform better than the previous one . if he us different concept than it will help him a lot . so understanding idea and concept and learning fact ha their own importance . they can also be used simultaneouly . in some condition idea and concept are superior and in another condition they may have affect minor . so all depends on situation and the way in which a student use it .
