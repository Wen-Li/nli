in a way , i disagree with the statement that young people nowadays do not devote enough time in helping their community . i beleive that in the current time , community themselves do not require much help or much time in help . in the past , people of a small town or a village identified themselves a a community and worked towards mutual and communal benefit . there were weekly meeting and the problem of the community were discussed . young people who form the most energetic part of the group volunteered in solving the problem and in arranging festival and local gathering . people were more physically involved the community . they worked a a team and one 's problem wa everybody 's problem . it wa natural for young people to be the most active component of the community . in many modernised part of the world , the situation is in stark contrast to what it wa in the past . the revolution in communication technology and the advent of the internet ha largely devated people from each other to the computer . systems and service have become more efficient and computerized . there is much le need for people , not only young to be involved in any help mainly because there is not much help required . people can discus problem in e-communities and via email and chat . the town administration ha it 's public website and any problem can be posted on it . responsible people can then take necessary action . so today , there is not much help required but there is a big need for idea and in this case young people still form the most active group . so in view of the current time , i disagree .
