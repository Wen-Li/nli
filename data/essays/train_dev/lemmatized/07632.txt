while the factual information is important part of acadamics , i believe the understanding of idea and concept are more importnat to student . suppose darwin only studied fact by anlaysing the artifact without further delveloping idea and concept based on tho fact , the study on the human evolution a we know would not exsisit today . while the factual imformation provides the basis for theory , such fact will bring no academic value if one doe not utilize them to develop concept . also , if wright brother never explored the idea and concept of flying , the aviation industry would not have developed a we know today . we can not disregard the factual information required to develop morden airplane but thoese are also the product of new concept . it industy is also a good reflection of new idea and concpets . without the concept and idea for the computer , software , internet , e-mail , etc. we would not have been able to experience the convinience of modern technology . there is no denying that the fact and science are behind the modern technology . however , a mankind would not have made such a great acheivements without exploring our imagination and developing idea and concept into a reality . therefore , i believe it is important for student to understand idea and concept while paying respect for them to learn fact .
