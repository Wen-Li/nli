generally people which are remebered are those who leave a trace of their life in history . nobody remembers or notice a person whose life ha been carried out in an anonimous pattern . we notice what stem out from daylife , something exceptional , new . the key for success is risk . oscar wilde used to say that an idea which is not risky can not be considered a an idea . to give evidence to this statement we are going to outline some main point and then summarize with conclusion and caveat . first of all , nowadays we consider successful people who occupy certain social position due to their effort in seeking their place . this successful social position varies depending on culture . nevertheless , this position is regarded a successful when the position itself is exceptional . nobody would consider successful someone who work in a normal or standard position . this mean that success depends on extraordinary situation carried out in particular condition : it is finding a new solution , a new idea to obtain something . secondly , people will recognise success only when it is visible . if nothing could lead u to distinguish something from normality , we would not be able to determine the difference between the two . we will not be thus capable of recognising the new into the normal . hence this will not be differentiable . success is also difference , uniqueness . in other word new thing . third , stated that success is based on difference and new idea , it is also to be said that news find their root in risk . elaborating something new , it is not possible to understand whether it will be regarded a something really new and meet the taste of the others or will just fail to communicate it difference . this uncertainty ha to deal with risk . to be noticed a different one idea ha to be new , thus risky . to conclude , we demostrated that success come from difference from normality ; exceptionality and risk . the last factor is perhaps the essential key for success . as oscar wilde said .
