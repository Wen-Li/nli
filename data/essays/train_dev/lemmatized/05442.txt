there are so many subject which entices our concerning during study in university . it is not a matter you 're bachelor or master or doctor . the real essentical of academic subject , knowledge itself , is interesting and attracting for human . but , i do n't agree with the assetion that we must boraden our knowledge better than specialize in on specific subjec . i will give you a two reason . first , there is no such easy academic subject which can conquer in one or two decade . almost every academic subject need one 's whole life 's effort . most important thing to become a intellecture is concenturation in one specific subject not become a know-everything man . actually , human can not kwow whole thing of the world . for example , there is a person who i know . he study philosophy and he also eager to know lot of thing about the non-philosophical thing . it is not a bad attutude i think . but , he did n't get the degree in year what he plan to get that because of that eager distracted his concenturation . second , the society want the person who ha knowledge which is specialized in one specific subject . if he know lot of other knowledge , of course it is a good thing . but it is not a primary but secondary . people who are talent in one specific subject can work a proffessional . but the person who know many thing but not specialized is not a proffessional . for example , there wa two friend of mine . the one of them wa talented in many thing . he wa a good singer and good dancer . he also studed well but not the best . when he became a adult , he get a job . but it wa not a specialized job . the another friend wa talented in only school study . but when he became adult , he got a job in a specialized area and he got a lot of salery . to sum up , very essential respect of academic knowledge doe n't allow multi-studying . because the ability of human is so limited , we must concentrate in one study . and the society need proffesional person not a know-everthing man .
