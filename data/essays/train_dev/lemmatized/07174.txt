i agree with the statement that it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subject than to specialize in one specific subject for the following reason . first , having broad knowledge is more usuful to make friend than specializing in one specific subject . for example , when i wa a junior at keio university , private university in tokyo , japan , i took subject only in relation with marketing that i majored . then i had only friend who wa interested in marketing . but next year , when i became a senior , i took a lot of and wide range of subject . i got many new friend who ha different hobby , knowledge and opinion , and they made my university life full of fun . as the above example clealy show that to have broad knowledge is more usuful to make friend . second , to have broad knowledge give people more job oppotunities . for example , when my sister graduated gakushuin university in tokyo , she looked for her job . because she learned a lot of subject , many kind oc company allowed her to enter those company . so she could select the job which she wanted to enter . this experience demonstrates that to have broad knowledge give people more job oppotunities . in conclusion , i strongly believe that it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subject than to specialize in one specific subject .
