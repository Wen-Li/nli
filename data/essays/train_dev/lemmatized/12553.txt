`` you only live once , so live life to the fullest '' is a well known saying , echoed across culture and country all over the world . people are probably tired of hearing it . it basically mean that everyone can enjoy life no matter how old or young they are . and they should . because lost time wo n't be found again . if someone were to say to me that young people enjoy life more than older people , i 'd have to completely disagree . there are definitely big advantage being an older person . for one , you 'd probably have your own money to spend and i 'm pretty sure there 's no better feeling than earning your own bread and butter and then going about spending it . for example , there 's a strapping young 15 year old lad who like nothing but to spend his day at the arcade and throw away all his allowance playing a pinball machine . allowance . that 's all . now let 's take the example of a millionaire who ha n't managed to let go of his childish way . he just bought an arcade ( and an amusement park ) and had a few pinball machine moved to his sprawling 12 bedroom , 14 bathroom mansion . seems like these oldie have all the fun . let 's take into account that in most country you have be over 21 year of age to go bungee jumping . not that bungee jumping is something that every young person want to do but even if he wanted to do it he probably would n't be able to . enter electronic medium and technology . ever so often we 're subjected to watching millionaire and billionaire on television . they always seem so happy . sure they ca n't really ride a skateboard or a bike but they 've managed to replace that with a more than adequate automatic scooter that they just have to stand on . i can imagine them zipping around on their little scooter , looking at kid on skateboard and thinking that they 're having way more fun . in fact to some extent , i even think that older people are `` allowed '' to have more fun . yes , it 's unfair . but such is life . it go without saying that with age come responsibility and i think a complete person is one who accepts his age and his responsibility towards himself and the society he life in . but that doe n't mean the fun come to an end . it almost never doe . bad health , beer belly and balding are a few deterrent from that life of fun , fun , fun . but then again , you only live once and older people know that better than anyone . they 're trying to get a much in while they can . i ca n't wait for my day a an old man kicking back in a comfortable chair and watching soccer on the television . the fun never stop . hey , look who just bought a yacht .
