`the sound of a fat woman is much better when she is far away . ` i totally agree that most of the advertisement make product seem much better than what they really are . it is like pandora 's box , it look wonderful but you do n't know what you will be face with . however there are some reason why it work this way . first of all , there are so many competition in the advertisement world . if i wa one of them i had to do something which would get the visual attraction initially . for instance , most of u can remember the quisnos sandwich advertisement . it is not only exhibit the product but also compare it with the other item . it is full of collar so when ever i am doing something different , it distracts me and even though i have watched it almost hundred time i ca n't help myself to turn around and stare . it doe n't mean that they make the best sandwich but they do well in advertising . second , a we live in the changing world so rapidly , the advertisement must be easy to recognize . not only they have so many other option to be displaced but also they should be easy to be recognized . when i go to a supermarket i see a lot of product and most of them doe n't have any match in my mind . what i really do is , to go to the aisle and pick up the one that i can remember . because they make it look better than the others . besides , if the advertisement exactly say what it is , i am one hundred percent sure that they will become le attractive . think of a sandwich , it would be so bad if the person eating that sandwich in the advertisement , had done something a he actually had thought that it wa disgusting . as a conclusion , it may not be the ethical way to advertise the product but a long a it get the attention and easily recognizable , that is appropriate in this world we are living .
