i concur what the statement say . since i went to a lot of country in many different kind of way , the best experienced i had wa to travel a in a group led by a tour guide . when i wa eleven year old , i went to phillippines with my family and we thought we would have fun not chasing by time becuase usually with group we are chased by time . but throughout the trip , since it wa our first time visiting phillippines , we did n't know any place so just looking for the good place , we spent one day just researching for place . the following day , my parent borrowed a car and we bought a map but then it wa hard to get to the place because all the poplular place were far away . there were always full of people and there wa traffic jam , when we got to the place , my dad wa all ready tired . but if have gone with a tour guide , since guide know where to go and about the place , he will explaing to u about that place and give u great information . those are the reason why i like to go trip a in a group led by a tour guide . travelers do n't have to drive and we can look at the view in relaxed mood . we go to trip to have comfortable and have exciting time and we go to travel to get away from our normal same day life . what is the point of going to travel , if we are having tired day like a normal day ? also , if we go a a group , we get to meet a lot of new people with diffrent chracteristics . i am outgoing and social so it wa always fun to meet new people . in conclusion , i again agree with the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide . traveling in a a group is a best thing to do !
