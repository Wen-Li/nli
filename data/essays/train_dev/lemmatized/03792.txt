broad knowledge of many academic subject than one specific subject is a wonderful thing to have . it is every man 's dream but i totally disagree . the ability to memorize thing is a gift from god , and it differs from one person to another . only a small percentage of people in the world are capable of memorizing information of multiple academic subject with ease , the others who are the majority ca n't do that easially instead they work harder and read for longer hour trying to compensate for the lack of this ability . in the other hand the majority of people are capable of focusing or specializing in one specific subject which is again not an easy task to do but still without doupt much easier than broad knowledge of many subject . broad knowledg of multiple subject ha many disadvantage , apart from being difficult , chance to forget thing , make mistake or confuse one thing to another are very high compared to specific subject knowledge . in the other hand , specific knowledge is easy to maintain , low chance of error and perfection is easy to achieve . i admit that specific knowledge ha some disadvantage too , like being boring sometimes and if you do a mistake you will be badly blamed . in the end , choosing between the two kind of knowledge depends on the person 's capability and interest . both are really good and helpful to the world we are living in . but i am sure that i am not capable of general knowledge and i 'd rather to sepcialize in one specific subject .
