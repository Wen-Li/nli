in japan , student have to learn a lot of word in many kind of class since they are child untill they are graduated from university . they , even high school student , a learn more fact than idea and concept and they tend to have variety of knoledge . however , they hardly learn how to think and organaize their idea or concept . i do agree the opinion that it is more important for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact . first , learning idea and concept develop student ' skill of thinking . for instance , in mathmatics class , they learn how to solve the question and that make them consider not just indivisual answer but how to solve all same king of question because each mathmatical question is different but there is not each answer . student do not learn fact in the class , but the way of thinking is very important . secondally , when student understand idea or concept of the story , it is fan to learn . when i read newspaper or magazine about politics or economics , i do not want to know just the fact . but once i understand why the crime happen and what the criminal think , or what the new president ' manufesto and what kind of people support him and why , i tend to reserch more and more . if student know only fact , it is harder than extent their interest . finally , learning concept and idea is able to apply student ' daily life . when they are in trouble they have to think the solution . fact doe not tell them crue . for example , if they lost the way in forein country , they should not just wait with standing untill someone would help them . they have to think what they should do themselves , even if they are little child . in conclusion , it is more important for student to understand idea and concept than fact . moreover , they should express their idea and presentate in front of others . japanese are not good at presentation maybe because there are almost no chance to express their idea in front of audience when they are student . facts are , of cource , important because they can give u interest also ; however , for student , they need to understand idea and concept to practice thinkin by themselves .
