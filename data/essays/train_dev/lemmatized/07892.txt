micheal jordan successed a an amazing nba basketball player , just a much a tom cruise successed a one of the most popular actor in hollywood . they both became to be well known people , however they are known for different reason and talent . this show that people are good at different thing , and focusing on their best talent is the key to success . i disagree to the statement , it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subject than to specialize in one specific subject . specializing in one scecific subject is a more definite way to succed , it let you focus better , and it is le stressful . one reason to support my opinion , is that specializing in one specific subject is a more definite way to succed in the future . i feel that having a more broad knowledge of many academic subject , only help you in your childhood . trying to earn good grade in all of the class you are taking , may be the pressure for thinking that it is better to have a broad knowledge . having a broad knowledge may also set you off to find what you are good at . however , i believe that what is most important is what you become a , and working hard on what you are good at would actually get you somewhere in life . another reason why i feel that specializing in one subject in better than to have a broad knowledge of various subects , is so you could focus better . trying hard ro on subject when you know you have to for another one , could be distracting . i feel that working hard for one subject would let you concentrate better . finally , i feel that it is le stressful to specialize in one subject . for example , i believe that it is difficult for someone to be good in both writing and mathematics . i believe that people usually do not like what they are not good at . if there are subject that you would prefer not to take , because you know that you are not good at , you should rather work hard in a subject you know you like to do . my friend who is very talented in art , is unfortunately not very talented in mathematics . so , what she doe is that she doe not take any mathema in conclusion , i feel that specializing in one specific subject rather than having a broad knwledge of many academic subject would lead you for a happier life .
