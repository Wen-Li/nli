i will explain why i disagree with the statement that in twenty year from now there will be fewer car in use than there are today . to start with a time go by more car are being produced and sold allover the world . this trend can be attributed to different factor , such a the world 's population growth or the lower cost of vehicle that lead to higher affordability for the demand . the population keep growing a i mentioned and for this reason more people are willing to buy car . also , a also mentioned above , low cost of production given by modern technology and new material allows more people to buy a car . another reason that make more people willing to get a car is given by the improvement of the transportation system pretty much allover the world . we see big highway and road being built every day so that more place in the world become better connected to each other . there are many country , such a italy for example , where the public transport system is not fully developed , for this reason a growing number of people prefers to have it own car rather than to rely on a way to travel that is not a efficient . a psychological reason also explains why more car will be seen in twenty year from now than today ; the society tends to be very individualistic and le social than it used to be . for this reason more people prefer to be independente when they get around and the car becomes their own shell . cars can not be replaced simply because people need them to go to work , to travel , to see place in complete freedom ; sometimes peole just want to get the pleasure of driving them and feel a sort of freedom . because of all the above reason i believe more car will be produced and sold in the future , therefore in twenty year from now we will see more car than today , not fewer .
