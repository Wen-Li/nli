it seems that young people nowadays do n't give enough time to help their community , i agree with this statement . but i have to say that it only seems that . i have twenty year old , so i 'm young , and then i 'm part of young people . since my point of view i believe to thing about this fact . at first i would want to focus on the fact that young people help , young people want to help , they want the society to ask help to them , they have the necessity of knowing that they are part of something and that this part is useful and that society need a lot of part , society and their community need every young for running a better society and that they are needed . young people want the society to ask for them ! and that is where i want to arrive , nowadays society show an image of the young people a if they are lazy people , a if they only want to have fun and to be with their friend . and at least , a if society doe n't expect no positive reaction of them . a lot of young people travel abroad to underdeveloped country to help a voluntieers . the fact that is , they can be voluntieers on their own country , they can take care of people around them , they can help in project of beneficency in their country , ... but what happens ? most of the time their own community do n't ask them help , they do n't know they can help in their own community and built a better society . in conclusion , i can state that society doe n't encourage young people to help and that is because young people act in these two way : they get relaxed because they believe socitey doe n't expect anything of them ; or they travel abroad , to underdeveloped country where young people believe that they really need their help . since my point of view , and apart of what i have say , there are people that are responsible with their community and have the necessity and the aim to help in their own community and also , they view their community necessity and want to help and satisfy them a far a they can do it .
