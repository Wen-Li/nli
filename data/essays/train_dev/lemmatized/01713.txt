i disagree with the statement that in twenty year there will fewer car in use than there are today . as car become cheaper , safer and more user-friendly , more people will choose car a their main mean of transportation . some people may argue that technological advance in telecommunication may reduce the need for transportation . i think that , while it is true that there ha already been a general decrease in business trip , the use of car for private transportation will continue to increase in the future . others may argue that more efficient public transportation will render car obsolete . however , i believe that although public transportation is a key factor in development , it will never substitute car because of it inherent limitation . the cost of producing a car ha been greatly reduced in recent year whereas their convenience and performance continues to increase . nowadays fully equiped car such a the renault logan or the subaru pleo cost around three thousand dollar to produce and are sold for aroudn five thousand . another important factor is the rapid growth of the automotive market in developing country such a india , china or brazil . in these country still relatively few people own a car but there is a great potential for growth . in china , for example , last year saw a twenty percent increase in unit sold . following this trend , many car manufacturer are launching low cost bric ( which stand for brazil , russia , india , china ) product line designed to meet these market 's demand . in conclusion , although it is true that the use of car may be reduced in specific situation , i believe that in general the number of car will continue increasing .
