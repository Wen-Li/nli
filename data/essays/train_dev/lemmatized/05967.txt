i agree that successful people try new thing and take risk rather than only doing what they already know how to do well . i have three reason to support my answer . firstly , taking risk is a way of finding new chance . i think the bigger the risk is the bigger the chance you have . and to make that chance your own you willneed hard work and that will make you a strong person . secondly , taking a risk and tring new thing can give you new perspective and can make you have a bigger knowlege that can help you to become more successful . for example for me to start cheerleading in my highschool wa a big risk for me . becase i used to be very shy person and did not like to do thing in front of every one else , but for me to start cheer gave me the courge to let myself out in front of the croud . the practice are very hard and that made me a stronger person then i wa before . thirdly , tring new thing give u an oprotunity to meet different people and know there thought . and give u new prospective . these are the reason i agree with this statement .
