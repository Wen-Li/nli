change is an integral of life . things keep changing around u almost all the time on itself . but at time it becomes neccessary for a person to induce a change . a thing which is absolutely new and could be dangerous . what is the fun in leading a life when there is no challenge to be faced no risk to overcome ? i completely agree that new thing should be incorporated and risk taken rather than dwelling on the thing that a person is adept at . firstly , it make the person all the more competitive which is very essential to survive in this earth . if he doe the same thing that he is adroit at , may be he is right on his part . but actually he is missing on the myriad opportunity that a new issue can provide him with . ' survival of the fittest ' a pithy that is so true . if the person ha to survive he should do new thing and take a few risk in order to achieve the zenith . further , by trying new venture the person ha the opportunity to recognise his other skill which were untouched for so long . to become successful it is very essential to recognise personal strength and vulnerability . this is the stepping stone for success . may be they founder intially but at the end the hard and smart work get him across the hurdle . moreover , by trying hand at different thing a person gain a lot of experience and this can be utilised in his present or future venture . life becomes very monotonous if just one task is repeated all through the life . by trying new thing a person can actually make his life more colourful and intresting . by continuing the same task it is just like a frog whose world end at the limit of his pond . but successful people look globally . a successful person never falter to accept a challenge and this is the hallmark of successful people . by hitting at something new it is indeed a challenge which the person through his diligent work , overcomes . to conclude i must say that a risk is there in every action of the entire mankind . it is this strength to counteract this risk and emerge truimphant that make a man successful .
