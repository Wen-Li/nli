that 's surely a good issue . it is impossible to me to look deep into the future to find an answer but , for now , i would certanly hope it . everyone understands how it is important to limitate the pollution today , everyone know that in some hour it 's almost impossibile to walk around . so , from a moral and ecological point of view , we have no other choice but to reduce car . does this will happen ? that 's completly different . we know that alternative vehicle are growing faster ( think at the ecological bus ) .. and that 's sure a good hint on how the future may look like . a lot of people today prefer to use tram and bus to reach office and other work station . because car doe cost too much . and that 's another issue . as long a oil based product will move car , people will look to cheaper way to go around . there are plenty of city all of over the world saying no to the car , in italy , just to give you an example , you can use your car depending on the number of you car and on the day . that 's a good start . another option i have to consider is a restyling of the concept behind a car : everyone would love a car with low pollution rate , free from the oil , cheap to use and why not . .. with a new look . we know that reaserchers are working night and day to create something that look like that . the issue read `` twenty year '' , well i 'm sure that in twenty year we 'll see the birth of a new car generation and so the old car will get fewer and fewer . and do n't forget the development of alternative vehicle . mix up together the the two thing and you 'll have a picture of our future and so yes , there will be fewer car in the next twenty year .
