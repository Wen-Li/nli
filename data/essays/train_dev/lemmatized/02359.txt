the success of a person is only measured on a just way by himself . if it is not a person priority to live in luxury but with knowledge we ca n't assume he is not successful if he doe not have a big house and a big suv . we can acknowledge that he ha had success in his life because he reached his goal . even so , it is my belief that people that succeed in their goal are people that have to , on some circumstance , take the risk and play their chance to what they believe in . if you do only what you know what to do well , you will only do what you were taught . and you wo n't stand out from the rest and succeed if you do only what everyone doe . people follow pattern in their everyday life . many even have routine and feel secure with them , but the key to succeed in life is to take risk when you have to and play to your strenghts . not everyone is the same in attitude and experience , but the fact that someone ha knowledge and information equal to that which we posse is a possibility , the difference come to what we decide to do with what everyone know and what make you special . when we try to leave possitive mark in the world and it inhabitant day by day , we are succeeding on a level of moral fiber and character . then , that kind of success will translate into a series of event that lead to what we chose when we decided what we would do with our life . its hard to fail and believe that we have not succeded , we are forced to believe that because we failed some prototype imprinted to u by someone or something , but if we are really whole and concient people , we will see that to fail to ourselves is the only way to fail in life . money , fame and woman are n't success unless you want to think so that way . media give u a vision of of what is according to them a true successful life , but it is we who make the choice of what to believe . success innovates , success creates , but more than anything , success give you peace and interior calm .
