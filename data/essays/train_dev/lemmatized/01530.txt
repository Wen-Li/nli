i agree with the idea that successful people try new thing and take risk rather than only doing what they already know how to do well . i believe that trying new thing and taking risk are good for u . because doing such thing will bring new knowleages and experience for u . and we are growing now , so , we do not know that what is best thing for me yet . for example , my brother love to play baseball and he play very well , so he desire to be baseball player in future . but i want to recommend him to play other sport . because he never play other soprts before so he doe not know that how much fun doing other sport are . maybe , if he play other sport , he can find more interesting sport than baseball . i think we have to be more active in order to be successful people . i think successful people are not afraid of making mistake , so they can try new thing and take risk . i am taking spanish class in high school . but i do not wanted to take it before taking it , because i am japanese , so studing english is too much for me . but i feel taking spanish is very fun and i think that i want to study more . learnig onother language brought me new opinion and new world . so i am able to speak spanish now , i can make new people who talk spanish , too . trying new thing and taking risk are hard , and people want to avoid such thing . but trying is important for u to grow up and to be successful people . when we talk with successful people , we can find fact that they have many knowleages because they have many experience include bad and good . this awares them something . do not be afraid , you can try new thing even if you make mistake , you can try again . that experience that you did try is not waste thing in your life . you can have confidence .
