i can not deny the fact that some advertisement make product seems much better that they really are . for example , since online shopping is getting more and more common , sometimes i have to buy thing only judging from the information provided by the advertisement , and i received a completely different thing from what i expected from the advertisement . however , consumer are getting smarter , too . there are many advertisement that show the real information by various method . there are various type of method used for advertisement that provide real information . for example , the company provide sample of the product to allow consumer to experience them . with this method of advertisement , the consumer acutually use the product by themselves , and they can make a decision to buy it or not . it is a good example to allow the consumer to get the real impression of the product . another example is that some advertisement provide statistical information . the advertiser conduct a marketing research of their own product to show the user ' impression or customer satisfaction . in this way , the consumer can get the reliable information of what the user actually thought of the product . finally , there are many advertisement that a sale representative actually demonstrate how to use the product . the consumer can ask question about the product at the site , and the sale person answer information of what the customer really need with showing the product . since the customer are actually looking at the product , it is possible for the consumer to get real information . as a result , customer know that advertisement have a tendency to promote only their good side , and company know that it is not enough only to provide good image . there are many method of advertisement that allows consumer to obtain useful information that represents the actual product .
