the question whether traveling in an organized tour with a guide is an enjoyable enterprise depends very much on the travel destination , the personal travel companion , and the physical fitness required for a certain trip . if i wanted to go to a destination , where i do not speak the language , do n't know the local custom or where there are specific region to avoid , due to , e.g. , civil unrest , i would prefer traveling in a group . the protection of a larger amount of people and a , hopefully , well informed and capable guide can make the journey much safer and more enjoyable . also , if i would want to travel with someone who need a certain degree of comfort and protection , such a an aging parent , a group might be a good idea . and then there is of course the company and ease a group can provide when you travel either alone or with a difficult companion , because there are always people to share your thought and feeling with . however , a group can never offer the sense of adventure and indepedence an individually organized trip can infuse you with . also , it may be much more exciting , pure , and romantic to see new place without the filter of the group experience and opinion , and the pre-determined judgement a travel guide may confront you with . would n't it be wonderful to visit a buddhist termple alone or with your best friend or your spouse in the moonlight , to see the golden buddha gleam , and feel close to the spiritual world ? imagine how disruptive the chatter of a group or the insistent lecture of a guide could be in such a moment . all in all , the decision whether to travel with a group or alone depends on a whole number of factor and expectation , and the success and enjoyment of a journey can certainly already be decided by this initial choice .
