enjoying life is living it happily and getting actively involved into it further taking happly what it offer to u , with firm determination , accourding to me i believe that for enjoying life there is no age limit and even old people can enjoy life equally a that a youth enjoys . initially for enjoyment in the life you need to be part of the activity which provokes happiness and give the feeling of enjoyment . i remember that my grand father would actively participate in all festival and use to enjoy the life with u further more he use to enjoy more than u because he wa much older than u and ha more experience . . seconldy certain enjoyment such a walking around garden and watching beautiful tree , hanging out with friend , watching movie are not restricted to age even old people can enjoy them furthermore we notice that older people enjoy most when then are in group and had more stable group where they share their emotion or even they make fun of each other and also there is le chance of fitting with each other , mean there is only enjoyment some may argue that a they had grown old they can not do much phisical activity of enjoyment such a playing outdoor game , swimming and many more such activity . but some people may not regard this activity a an enjoyment and it is not that young people play outdore game it is been proved that old peoles also activily participates in outdore event but with some limitation . but the botom line is that they enjoy the life being part it . therefore accourding to me there is no age liment for enjoyment and even old people can enjoy the life by participatind into different event of life and hanging out with friend or even watching nature .
