i strongly disagree with the statement that young people enjoy life more than older people do , because of two reason . first , older people had already enjoyed their life when they were young . second , older people can still enjoy their life . before my grandfather died , couple of year ago . he used to tell me about his life when he wa young . he used to tell me all his story about ; his girlfriend , his adventure and his passion . but , he cleared me something , he told me that he still enjoyed his life . this is a clear example of how much older people enjoyed their life and they are still enjoying it . the time of enjoyment is like two or three time longer than what we , young people , have enjoyed . therefore , it all sumarizes that older people enjoy life more that young people do . as mentioned before , older people are still enjoying their life , some young people would say that , older people can not use the internet or go to an amusement park like them . but , that is completely wrong . i have a friend , whose grandmother play computer game with him . i could not believe it until i saw her playing with u . my friend grandmother like going to amusement park too . last summer , we went to wonderland together , it wa simply amazing ! here , we can see another example of older people enjoying their life . in my opinion , if older people are healthy enough and strong enough , they can do whatever they would like to do . to sumarize everything up , i disagree with the statement and i think older people enjoy life more than younger people because older people already enjoyed their life before and they keep on enjoying it .
