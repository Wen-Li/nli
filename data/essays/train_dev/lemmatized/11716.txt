i disagree to this statement . in my opinion the younger people should be the one giving up their time up to the community that are having a hard time . younger people are more in to thing but not in partisapating in supporting people . why ? i say because there is no benefit for themselves to collect . i think we should sponcer to the help-outers like handing them out drink and bread . also the reason might be because they do n't really know how much those help - needed people are suffering . and for that i think it would be an awsome idea to set up an comercial for the people who do n't know the help needed people situation . or we can use the idea from my homeland , south korea . in my country student starting from middle school have to fill out hour contributing to others . middle school student from the first year to the second have to fill out the total of 60 hour . they do this by going to school that have student whose life is hard from their birth or by cleaning out area that we all own like park , picking trash from street and etc . i do n't think it 's a bad idea by letting the student know how it is wonderful contributing to our city this way . although these 60 hour effect you from going high school i got to know the wonderfulness of contributing toour comunitiy like this . i am a middle school third year student right now and i assure you this is a great way to get young people stand up to this . at first at my first year i wa stuborned about this with my other classmate because it is hard work . and i too , say at first i only ment to do this kind of stuff because it wa required in my grade . what made me change my mined wa one of the experience i had . i signed up to go to one of the school that have student ` not like u ' . at first i wa afraid of them . that thought changed when i wa cleaning the window . one of that school student came up to me saying hello in a weird way . but a hour past by i learned that that student wa interested in being friend with me . i guess because they came up to me differnently i did n't really know at first . well , thats the case a me . i am hopping to open a volunteer club when i grow up , so i 'm hopping these idea would work in the future .
