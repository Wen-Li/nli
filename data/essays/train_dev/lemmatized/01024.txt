many student at some point of their life wonder if they should choose a specialization in their study or if they should go into a general university to choose class in many different field . i think both can be good , but everything depends on what you want to do . first of all , i believe that it is important that student do n't specilize too early . in high school for instance , it is important that student learn about many different field before being allowed to choose which major they want to study . it can thus make student discover field of knowledge they did n't know before , but some field that can also attract them a lot . besides , i think that choosing to specialize or not depends on what kind of job you want to do later . some job requiere good knowledge in many academic field . this is for instance the case of journalism . some of the journalist do decide to specialize , but the majority are able to write about every topic , whether it concern a pension reform or a football match . on a personal point of view , this attitude - to make the choice of not choosing a specialization - can be very interesting . somebody who decides not to choose a major field of interest will be interested in much more numerous thing than somebody only interested in history or philosophy . but i also think that there is a danger for people knowing lot of thing , in many field . the society also need specialist who deeply know some aspect of the society . for instance , teaching biology requires to be a specialist in biology . and it is the same for all the teacher . in some country , teacher are teaching two subject , but i think it is not such a good idea since they ca n't know very well two field of knowledge . to conclude , we can say that society need both - specialist and people that stay in general knowledge . but personaly , i like having learnt many different subject before specializing myself . thanks to this , i discovered what wa biology , physic and many other field that i would not have discovered without my high school class .
