most people are considering which is better for them between having broad knowledge of many academic subject and having knowledge in one specific subject . some people say that having knowledge in one specific subjet is more useful for people , because they can study much deeply about a certain subject . however , i strongly claim that having broad knowledge of many academic subject is much better . that 's because it is easy for you to talk with many people about diverse subject and you can look more intelligent than any other person . first of all , if i have broad knowledge of many academic subject , there are many common talking subject with others . that mean , i can easily get closed to other people . when people share their thought about common thing , they easily get closed . from my personal experience , one of my friend , soccer player , who well know only about soccer , always used to talk about soccer . whenever we met , he talked how to play soccer and there are many soccer rule which you do not know yet . as time go by , i became to deny him . in this repect , having broad knowledge of many academic is better than having knowledge in a certain subject . on top of that , a person who having broad knowledge of many academic look more intelligent person . if i have knoledge only in one specific subject , i can expalin about that part very well . however , i can not speak confidently about other area . my cousin are good example to expain this . one cousin studied very well and bacame a doctor . the other studied not well , but he tried to learn knowledge of many area . he also changed his job many time . a few day ago , we gathered to see and talked about many thing . as the topic are changing , the cousin who have broad knowlege of many academic subject gave me many advice and expained about whatever i did not exactly know . however , the other did not say much to me except for one subject , medical problem . in conclusion , i believe that having broad knowledge is much better because it help for you to get closed with others and to look more intelli
