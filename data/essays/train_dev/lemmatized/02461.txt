i have been to a lot of different country in the world because of my parent . every year , we must go to two or three other place for vacation . traveling with a group of people to others country is a lot of fun than traveling by our own , so that i agree the best way to travel is a group led by a tour guide . i think you do n't really know what place are valuable to see , if you are the first time to that place . i think you would get lost so easily . i remember when i wa a child ( around six or seven year old ) , my parent brough my younger sister and i went to singapore for a trip and it wa the first time we went to travel by ourselves . my parent asked a person that who work in an information center in the airport for some information of singapore and where can we visit in there . a few second later , he told u some place we can go and which hotel we can stay in . afterwards , we leave the airport and went to the hotel and check-in . in these couple day , we went a lot of place in singapore , of couse , we took a very long time to those place because we did n't rent a car ; we used transportation , such a bus and taxi . at night , it wa so hard to look for a cap , we waited a long time on the street for a cap and go back to the hotel . after this trip , my parent decided wherever we go to travel , we must join a tour guide because it is more convinence for u . we do n't have to plan where to go and where to stay , they will scheluded for u . in conclusion , i will suggest that join in a group led by a tour guide is the best way of traveling . i wo n't be travel again without joining a tour guide ; they really help u a lot and save our time .
