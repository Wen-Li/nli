i really agree with this statement . i 'm studying engineering and even if the fact and info can be important on every course and topic , they really do n't teach you anything but they just show you if you really understood the concept and the idea . for example , if you are studying a physic course , it 's normal to find many experiment made by many person but these experiment are made not only to give you some info about the result but to be sure that you really understood the meaning why they made these experiment and why they can be usefull or not . i do n't want to say that learn fact is completely useless but i say that you ca n't just learn them , furthermore they 're useless if you do n't know the meaning of them . that 's why concept and idea are so important for student . unfortunately , many teacher do n't think the same a me , that what happened to my own experience during my year at university . if i have to be sincere , during the course that a teacher put the attention on fact instead of cencepts , i completely lost my attention and i could n't follow the lesson . not only me acted this way but many of my mate too and the mark that we took by these kind of exam were n't that high . so , that 's what made my opinion , my own experience and i think that once you have experience to support your opinion , it can be stronger and believed by many person . i even hope that my opinion will be read by many teacher even to help them to make their lesson more interesting and expecially useful for their student .
