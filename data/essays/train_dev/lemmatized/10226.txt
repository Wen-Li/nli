i dont agree with the statement that having broad knowledge of many academic subject is better than to specialize in any one subject . i feel both approach have their own pro and con . let u analyze the issue with some specific example . students are asked to take up many diverse subject so a to have a basic knowledge of all the discipline . this is very important because no field work in isolation . the subject of geology or art is incomplete without the study of history . in fact the knowledge of one field is often required to solve problem in others . now imagine a scenario if the specialist doesnt have any knowledge of the other field . how is a physic specialist going to solve his complex problem invoving mathematics if he doesnt have a broad knowledge math a well . can he afford to go to the the mathematician every time he ha some doubt with his math ? that is not a feasible option . he ha to develop an understanding of math a a discipline so a to arrive at a comprehensive solution . we see many master student majoring in more than one field . this is because their interdisciplinary knowledge will give them a comprehensive understanding of the problem . todays world is increasingly putting up problem which often require inter-disciplinary knowledge . the team that work in the field of technology have a diverse compostion . they have specialist of technolonogy working in tandem with people who have a broad knowledge of different techonologies . as a specific example in software technology , many application now require user interface in a technology different from the one used to do back end transaction . to make this work you need more than just two specialist of the two technology involved . it is not going to work if each of them is totally unaware of the other technology . it will certainly help if they can get another member who know a little bit of both . thus both approach are required for a comprehensive understanding .
