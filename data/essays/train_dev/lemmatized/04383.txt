each and every person know how to have fun in his or her own way . i completely disagree with the statement that `` young people enjoy life more that older people do '' what is fun ? all the smartest mind combined on our mother earth will not be able to answer that question . every one ha a different idea of fun . i am ninteen year old and when i wa younger i definately thought that my parent were boring and i never wanted to do anything fun with them . i thought that my friend and i were the end of the world . while on the other hand my parent went out all the time and had fun too . fun is what a lot of people would connect enjoying life too . in my opinion that 's incorrect . i like to go out , party and spend most of my time with my friend but on the other hand my aunt prefers sitting at home and watching t.v or talking on the phone or surfing the internet . she sits at home and i party , to a stranger my aunt would sound really boring but she ha fun in her own way . she 's enjoying life too . older people suit the phrase `` been there done that '' perfectly . they have experienced what the younger generation are going through right now at this moment . younger people want more and older people are saturated and want to do different thing which would relax them . to enjoy life we have to do what we like , even if it just sitting and staring into thin air and we have to do these thing with the people who we love and who love u . spending some quality time with the people who we care about , what more could anyone ask for ? enjoying life is a must but how you do it is n't . pursue your dream follow not only your heart but also your mind . do it well and dont forget the poeple who have stood by your side along the way . to enjoy life older people do n't need to be party animal , a long a you do what make you happy your automatically enjoying life in your own special way . .
