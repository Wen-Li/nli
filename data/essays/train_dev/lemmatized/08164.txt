according to me , i would say that both can have benefit according to the situation . in the first part you will see the advantage of a broad knowledge and in the second part you will see how specialize in a specific subject could also be an advantage . the knowledge is the knowing of many subject , when you have a broad knowlegde you can discus with anyone about anything . and i think that it is a good point specially when you are in the workplace . imagine that you are specialized in business , and in your firm they don t need salers ( or other job in business ) anymore , according to this you wo n't be able to find other job in the same company , because you are only specialized in the business subject . in this case , i think it is really essential to have a large knowledge . moreover , they understand it at school because more and more school propose formation which include various subject . thanks to this the student or the future worker will be able to face any situation at work or in his private life . in our world today , i think that someone ha to be able to discus or to understand the main academic subject such a : computer science , business and communication , because i think that they ca n't be understand by someone separetly . but on the other hand , i would like to say that specialize in one specific subject could be an advantage . indeed , if you know well the subject you can be the best . for instance , at work if you are the only one who know a software you might be indispensable . you can use this to get more money . so i would say that sometimes it s worth knowing something very well than know a litle bit of a lot of thing .
