i think that for student is more important to understand idea and concept rather than learn fact . when studying , and in life in general , it is important to comprehend rather than using the memory to repeat word or fact that eventually will not have sense in the near future . facts are still important and should not be forgotten . still , the ability to understand idea and concept make it possible to reason and discus about topic and matter . we human are able to make logical connection using our ( limited ) memory and few fact . we can understand the real meaning of fact . and we can reason on what it is behind a fact , we can tell why a fact ha happend . on the other hand , computer and the internet are in a certain sense `` stupid '' , but they can come to our help and support when we look for fact . with an internet access we can consult online source such a wikipedia and google . these are some of the best tool for looking for fact and these are the tool we should know how to use . to summarize , for student , in my opinion , is more important to understand and reason on concept and idea rather than memorize mechanically fact , date and number . students will need to be able to think and reason , computer will help to `` connect the dot '' .
