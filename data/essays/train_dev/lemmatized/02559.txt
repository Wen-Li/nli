women and car are the two mayor topic a man is concerned about . this will not change until there is no more man . when i take a look at my friend , everybody owns a car . you turn to 16 . what 's your wish . you want to have an own car . during the last 50 year a car ha became the number one status symbol . having a car is also a symbol of freedom . driving through an avenue on a sunny day make you feel good and confident . i have to admit that our thought about the environment became le and le . what about the air pollution and the fossil energy supply ? these thought are moving in the background . i 'm convinced that the arabic country still have enough oil supply for the next 100 year . thus , our attitude towards car will not change rapidly in the next 20 year . the gasoline price will not reach the two dollar border . everybody will still not refrain from driving and buying a car . moreover the car industry is still growing . new car are introduced every year . for example , the mercedes ml , which need more than 20 litre pro 100 kilometre . another sign that the oil supply is still huge . you also have to consider that car which drive with solar energy or a battery are still car . they all will be count the number of car which will not decline the next - at least - 20 year .
