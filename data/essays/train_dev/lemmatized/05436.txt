some people agree with the statement that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide . it is because people travel easily if a tour guide take them . however , i strongly disagree with the idea . i will support my opinion a follows . first , i am not free to go any place if i travel with others . when i wa university student , i visited to the guam island with five friend a a graduation memorial travel . after i reached a hotel in guam island , i wanted to swim a soon a possible . however , five friend except me did not want to swim and they want to go shopping . i could not reject them . i felt that my want were limited so much . i wa not free . second , i can not meet some trouble if others or a tour guide are around me . i believe that some trouble which happens on the travel such a losting a way is interesting thing . three year ago , i traveled to new york in the united states of america . i wanted to go the central par after i arrived there . i tried to go there using a subway . however , i lost my way to there near the time square . though i could not speak english well , i callenged to ask someone where the central park wa . a kind man told me the way and i could reach there finaly . i met a trouble and tried to find a solution during my trip . this is my interesting experience . if other people or tour guide were with me , i did not lost the way . and i did not talk to foreigner . for instans , i did not meet the accident . to sum up , by taking these matter into account , i absolutely disagree with the statement that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide . i do not want to travel with other people even they are my friend . if i travel alone , i feel free and go anywhere anytime .
