i totally agree with the statement . because first of all , a a very practical example , understanding idea and concept requires active participation of student . in order to understand an idea or concept student would have to think on that idea or concept . without his thinking and using his previous knowledge related with a subject he can never comprehend meaning of an idea or a concept . naturally when student becomes active and can link idea and concept and can see the bigger picture in his or her mind he or she would understand the idea and concept and will be able to use them in future . however in the case of learning fact student may memorize the fact and may think that he or she learned the fact . nevertheless , since without having understanding of general concept he or she can only remember this fact or piece of information in short period without being able to use it in real life and in future . i mean a student can not use fact without knowing idea and concept that this fact is related to . i would like to give the example of learning law . in the field of law we can think rule a fact . people think that lawyer know all rule implemented in a country . of course they know the basic rule in the country , however what they know in fact is general understanding of the law system of a country and relation of concept in legal system together with knowledge of idea behind that formed an improved the system . by knowing these a lawyer can find the rule he or she is looking for easily and can understand the correlation among them . without knowing concept he or she can not even find the rule he is need among thousand of rule . thus the key is knowing the concept and the idea . by knowing these a lawyer can produce solution . however by only knowing the fact meaning rule he can not solve any problem
