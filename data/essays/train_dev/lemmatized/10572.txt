successful people do not have to be the one who `` try new thing and take risk rather than doing what they already know how to do well '' . people can convey other characteristic to be successful . a successful person can be a person who is specialized in only one field . some field are so deep and if a person spends a lot of time on that particular field can be an expert in it and master it better than anybody else . bill gates is a great example . he specialized in computer programming and ha made microsoft the greatest and largest company in the world . as microsoft being his only concentration he wa able to expand it and a a result he ha become successful in that field . studying and learning about new thing rather than trying them could be a good idea for a successful person . it is true that a person should try thing for better experience , but sometimes trying can be dangerous without thorough studying of the topic . for example , trying to make an explosion which then explodes before expecting it to do so will definitely not make the person successful after his/her death in that accident . therefore , risk in such a case would not be a good idea to success . good communication skill along with good knowledge background and ability to choose correct desicions can help in the success of a person . a successful person should be able to convey the message correctly , persuade . otherwise , if the person is not able to communicate with the world and can not get his/her idea to the world , no one would be able to know about any them . they would pas by unnoticed . successful people do not have to be the one who take risk . it is not a necessity to being successful , however , it might be needed in some situation .
