i think young people enjoy life more than older people do . this can be said from my own experience and from what i see from other people 's experience . one of the reason i think this is because , younger people have more power or stamen to do thing . for example , if a 50-year old person were to play baseball , he/she would have a hard time in hitting the ball and running to the base , and catching a ball and throwing it . as for the younger people , they still have a lot of strength and energy left to move around and use a much power a they want . younger people have an advantage that they are able to move quicker and stronger compared to older people , so i think younger people would enjoy sport more than older people . in my own experience , my dad and i were playing catch . i could throw really fast at my dad , but my dad could n't throw that fast . i think this wa because he got tired faster than i did , or he did n't have much strength so he could n't throw a ball like he used to when he wa young . we can see that if we get older , our choice of what we can do will decrease . another example that young people enjoy life more than older people is that young people can fool around more compared to older people . this can be said because if an adult were to jump around naked in his/her yard , he would get caught by the police . on the other hand , if a 5-year old boy were to jump around naked in his yard , he obviously would n't get caught . as you can see , older people have more restriction compared to young people . in conclusion , i think that young people will enjoy life more than older people do . this can be said because younger people have more opportunity to do certain thing than older people like play a sport , or go naked in your yard . i have never been old before , but in fact , i am having the greatest time in my life now , young !!
