yes , i do agree with the statement , that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their community . there are some development in society , that corroberate this statement a well a my own experience in the local community work . let me first outline the social reason that support this current situation . we are today living in an egoistic and materialistic society . people usually just live by and care for themselfs . this can also be seen in the increasing number of single housholds . making carrier and living a hedonistic life is just what is promoted by the public medium and our economical and political agenda . we are living in a society that is largly based on consuming and that subsequently produses a lot of product and possibiliities to consume . suffice to say that this creats a condition where people do not even have the impression to have enough time to engage themselfs in selfless community work . they work much to make a living and to finance all the pleasure the entertainment industrie is advertising a the mean to live a happy and succesful life . but it 's not only that enjoying alle the entertainment is so time consuming , but there is also a lack interest in helping others , due to a missing moral education . in the past this moral education wa largly done by religios institution that where just a cornerstone of every society . you can agree or disagree with the development to a rather secular society , but one can hardly deny , that our society is painfully lacking an institution that would overtake this important moral education . politics and the medium certainly do not fill this gap , but actually are increasing it . my own ecperience a a leader of a youth group in my community is - also talking to the older member of our community - that it is getting harder and harder to motivate young people to engage themselfs in helping others . also the number of young people that are active in our community tremendously decreased over the last 50 year .
