in the modern world that we know , a lot of different product are available . are we always aware carefully about all those product ? should it be the responsibility of company to make sure customer know everything about risk that could create by using their product ? in fact , the law want that all risk concerning a product be identified by the producer . some believe that most advertisement make product seem much better than they really are . personnally , i do n't agree with this . those advertisement make you think twice , and at least , they make sure the customer is aware about risk . first , those advertisement make you thing twice before to buy a product like alcool are tabaco . also , usully those argument are pretty stronght and they make yourself considere it a little bit more before using it . also , i have seen on pack of cigarette , in canada , photograph which are illustrating desease that can be caused by tabaco . this is ugly , that freak you out the first time you see it . this wo n't make a product more attractive for customer . second , at least it informes about some risk that customer may not know concerning the product itself . it could be hard to believe for some people , but it may happen to anybody to use a product and do n't be aware about the effect . if somebody have n't told you or teached you , how can you be aware ? company must be responsible about what they are offering to the population . finally , i believe that the law is not too stronght concerning advertisement on product . they do n't really make product seem much better than they really are . they make sure that everybody is aware about what they will consumed or used . it avoid all misunderstood and surprise .
