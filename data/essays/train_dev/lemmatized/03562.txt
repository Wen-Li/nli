yes i agree , traveling with a guide can help a person find and discover place in an easy way . first of all , a travel guide is a person who is working for helping tourest , so he is an expert . for example , if a person went to a place or a country for the first time in my life , and he say that he will discover it all by him self , it will take him at least one to two month to discover all the intresting place in this country , but if a person is planing to have a tour guide . it wont take him more than 15 day to discover the place . secand of all , it not easy to understand an information that person might have it from a place , because some story ha alot of diffrent virgen , so a new tourest wont find that easy because a person dont now what virgen should he beleive . for that , a tourest need to have a tour guide , so that he would help understand the story . finally , a tour guide is so important for a person who is traveling so that can injoy his trip .
