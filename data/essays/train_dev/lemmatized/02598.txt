i totally disagree with this statement . why there would be fewer car in the future ? now i 'm explaining my opinion . firstly , after a little time from it creation , the car ha become the most useful , and used , way to go from a place to another . even if there are several way to move , for example the public mean , like the train , the bus or the aereo , every family , or maybe almost everyone , ha one on his own . a car , in fact , allows to not to have limitation of time when you move and then , using it , you can go pratically everywhere . furthermore i find that 's a very important thing that you have the possibility to buy the one you best like : you are allowed to choose it colour , it seat , it type , ( familiar , cabrio or any you prefer ! ) , so there is n't the problem to take a journey on a mean you do n't like . the only limitation is the money you can spend , but this is another problem . and for this there 's a solution , too : at now every car-seller give you the opportunity to pay your buyment on rate . last , but not least , i think that the only idea to own a car , give you a sort of sense of indipendence : you 're able to move without the help of someone else , it can be a great satisfation ! for these , and many other , argument , i think that people will continue in buying car , and in using them of course . in my opinion , if there would be a time when there should be fewer car , it 's right now , because of the high ( to use an euphemysm ) prize of oil , and especially because of the knowledge we have that more car are the equivalent of more polution in the air all we breath . so , i think , if people do n't stop buying and using car today , why should they do it tomorrow ?
