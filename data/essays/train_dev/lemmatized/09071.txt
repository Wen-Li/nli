some people might argue that it is more important for student and some might argue that it is more important for student to learn fact . i most certainly believe that it is more important for student to learn fact rather then just understan idea and concept . the reason is that understaing idea and concept only offer brief summery of matter but not specific detail . there are many are that student are required to know detail rather than just idea and concept such a mechanism and history . first of all , mechanism requires student to know all the specific detail about machine . for instance , if a student is to learn how a heater work , then the student need to know not only the concept of device in the heater but also the fact and detail about how it all work together . lets say that one student who understand how heater work want to create a heater . even if he ha idea about heater , in order to actually make one , he need to know all the fact and detail how the machine work secondly , history requires student to know fact rather than understand idea . lets say there is a student who is learning avout the world war two . understanding the concept and idea how the world war two started would be important but know the detail and fact about the world one two would be moreimportant . thus , a can be seen a above , i certainly believe that learning fact is more important for student than just understanding idea and concept in that there are many case that understaing idea and concept would not be sufficience .
