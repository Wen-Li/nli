do young people really enjoy life more then older people do ? being a young person i can not say that i 've experienced old age , and this make the question all the more difficult to answer . however when i hear about all attempt to try and remain young , with skin care product or even people selling their soul to the devil in exchange for eternal youth , i ca n't help but assume that being young truly is the most enjoyable age group . why would people fear old age otherwise ? when i consider all the thing i can do but my grandpa ca n't , i really do consider myself to be lucky . i can play soccer , run around all day , eat thousand of calorie without taking a pound but he can barely get off the couch to eat his soup . i 'm constantly discovering the world and participating in it 's development but old people live in the past loosing themselves in deja-vus . .. is this however only what make u truly happy ? physical well being can not only be the source to happyness . old people appreciate what ha been done , they are proud of their accomplishment . they get to see their familly grow , watch their child become parent , and grandchild grow slowly taller then they are . older people do not have to worry about the mundane and often supperficial preocupations of a teenager . old people get to look forward to retiering , young people only the unfortunate prospect of a lifetime of work . .. how can someone judge happyness to be a inverse relation of age ? older people and young people just a they have different problem , can also have different way of percieving joy . i think it would be using a very limited perspective if we only took into account our steriotypical criterion . can the thrill of playing a hard fought game of soccer not be compared to the blissfulness of tranquillity ?
