recently , there are a lot of car in the world . in some country , one people have some car . car is very convinient , but there are many problem . i agree with the statement that in twenty year there will be fewer car in use than there are today for 3 reason . first , if people who use car a lot of time will decrease , it will be able to slove the environmental problem in the world easily . cars use a lot of fuel and car emit bat gas . it is very serious problem . bat gas damage to people . if people have a lot of gas of car , they might be sick . especially , little child are very weak . if child have a lot of gas on the road , they might be become very bad sick . today , fuel price is very expensive and many people worry about money . however , many people use car a lot of time . people must think about environment . the earth is ours . second , if people do n't use car a lot of time , there will be no area of heavy traffic jam . in the world , there are many city where there occur traffic jam especially developed country . for example , in japan , there occur heavy traffic jam every morning in capital of tokyo . it is very serious problem . japanese government made a lot of new high way and road , but there did n't decrease a lot of car . i think that the biggest reason about it is that price of car have been decreased and many people can buy many car easily . the best way to decrese a lot of car i think is that japanese government try to make tax of using car . if japanese government will do it , car will decrease . third , if many people do n't use car , there will not be in danger . driver 's license is able to get easily . of course , all the people do n't have good skill and sometime , there occur traffic accident . if the test of driver 's license will be difficult , there will be decrease people who can drive , and traffic accident will be decrease . in conclusion , if many people do n't drive car , we can solve many problem , so i hope that many people use train or bus , and there will be fewer car in use than there are today .
