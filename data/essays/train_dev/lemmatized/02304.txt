i disagree with this statement that their will be afewer car from now after twenty year . cars are one of the useful inventoin that are science ha made . it is one of the useful mode of transpot in the recent day . in the recent time car are used by all the class of people in the societyi . e , is the middle , higher and the lower class of people . its use ha been improving by day by day . i t is one of the most convenient mode of troansport unlike the bus , train , automobile etc . transport by acar is at once own convinence . its not like you have to wiat for or go out pf the house much early to get the transport on time . having once own car is very convinient . in the presernt time people are very busy no time to waste at all you cant wait for abus or atrain to get a mean of transport . in the futher year car user will go on because of their busy life to save the time in the recent time many model of the car have been made which are at ahigh sale in the market . ifeel that many more model will surely come up in the mere future to meet the demand . the other factor of many car nowdays and the day to come is that owing or maintaing a car is a sign of status in the society so all the people would like to maintain ahigh status in the societyhence they would buy acar . when the demand go on a high rate the production of the car will definatly ha to meet the demand not only that many bank and other organisation render many source or loan to own a car so inspite of souring price also people dont stop buying car .
