nowadays , some people are obssesed with traveling alone while other people would rather enjoy a relaxed tour by a tour guide . as far a i am concerned , i tend to hold that being led by a guide may bring more convenience and enjoyment , and i will explore some primary reason a follow . there is no doubt that traveling alone may seem comfortable , a you can go anywhere you want without restriction . also , you will not ever never be disturbed by relatively fixed schedule a well . whereas , do you ever consider where to place your large amount of baggage or stuff , and can you imagine how worse will be if you bump into some emergency , ect ? when those thing happen , you will realize that how wonderful if someone or a group of people accompanied with you and even a familiar-tour guide will lead you and other one and always passionately offer you convenient and presice information of this journey . right , a tour guide will definiently assist you and you will relsease from much stress completely . to begin with , it is not that boring or tedious when you invovle in a group led by a tour guide . there might be shade of people who are from different place even different nation . thus , you have amount of time to chat with those people and share various cuturals from one another . secondly , there is always some emergency which is out of your way , especially far away from your hometown or homecountry . for example , you may get sea-sick , have a bad cold or you may get lost , ect . accordingly , the people with you and the tour guide will certainly help you a soon a possible , say , they may provides you couple of pill to heal , even to encourage you or photo for you . seen this way , the assistance , undoubtful , will cushion your troublesome more . last but not the least , you can really be guided to those place of interest or sight which worth your going and you need not to seek on your own , and that will save your time . all in all , i prefer being led by a tour guide a my inclination and that 's really a better way
