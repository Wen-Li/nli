the issue of whether understanding idea and concept is more important to student than learning fact . some people assert that understanding concept is more important , while others believe that learning fact is more important . different people have different view due to their distinct background . as a matter of fact , this issue is complex and controversal one and whether one choice take precendence ovr the other may quite depend one the specific situation . as far a i am concerned , i disagree with this statement and my view can be substantiated by the following discussion . the first argument can be presented is idea and concept are usually unrealistic and un-practical . a good example is about my major - physical therapiest . many of classmate could get good score in the lecture , but they could not get good score in the lab or being intern in the hospital because they could make a good connection between what they had learned and the clinic situation . under this circumstance , i really think learning fact is very important . in addtion , there is another reason to support my standpoint and a good example is not far to seek . before going abroad , people buy the travelling guide book and understand the environment and culture of the country to which they are going . but sometimes , people feel what the book mention is too abstract to understand and therefore , the best way is going that country and have the real experience . admittedly , it may be true understanding idea and concept is very basic and important for student in some specific situation . however , this alone doe n't constituate a sufficienct support to claim above statement . actually , these case are rare and thus are too specific and too weak to strenthen this standpoint . when the advantage and disadvantage of understanding concept and learing fact are carefully examined , the most striking conclsuion is abvious that learing fact is much more important . to sum up , although the statement still arouses diagreement among different people , the issue is quite difficut to resolve . taking into account the above-mentioned reason , which sometimes intertwine to form an organic whole and thus become to be more persuasive , we can arrive at the conclusion learing fact is more important to student than undersatdning idea and concept .
