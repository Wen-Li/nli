although the car market is a harsh business a we can see from the crash of company such a general motor or rover , i do not agree with the statement saying that in twenty year there will be fewer car in use that there are today for two main reason . first , the developed country that are today the first customer for car are still developing new market with electric car or hybrid car and the car market is going really well . moreover , western country population are very attached to car since they allow people to be independant and go wherever , whenever they feel like it . in some coutries you can not imagine how it would be without car . in the united states for example , people would not be able to live properly since in most city you can not do anything without a car . and plublic transportation system are not efficeint enough to make citizen to abandon their car for bus or subway . the second factor that make it impossible for the number of car to reduce in the next twenty year is already in motion . countries which used to be underdevelopped are now emerging and have a flourishing economy . these coutries , like china or india are generally overpopulated and a soon a these population reach a decent leaving standard they will get car . this phenomenon is alreay happening in china where rod are being built everywhere and people getting car . with a population of more than a billion person china will soon be the first customer for car and also the first producer . it is impossible that the number of car will be reduce in the next twnty year because there are many other country like india or china that are just waiting for their turn to be developped . so basically it can not be said that there will be fewer car in use in twenty year since the market is doing good in western country and that a whole new market id developping in the newly developped country .
