i disagree with the statement . in my opinion , it is better to be specialised in one field rather than have incomplete knowledge of several subject which may not serve any purpose . its no good being `` jack of all trade - master of none '' . a person having a broad knowledge of many academic subject is like a blunt knife . it ha a large area and zero penetrating power . a specialist , on the other hand , can make breakthrough in his field and contribute more to the society . these day the knowledge of each subject is very vast . to know about everything and then assimilating that information into something miraculous is not possible . the day are gone when a leonardo da vinci could paint masterpiece , write mathematical theory and create model for an aircraft . today 's cutting edge technology requires specialist from diverse field who can work together and bring about a significant development . for example , consider a car manufacturing company . it doe not have all it employee knowing how a combustion engine work , much the same way a it doe not have all of them knowing how to market it car . it ha specific people for a specific job . it ha promoter to fund development , engineer to design car , accountant to operate logistics and advertiser to sell a car . it is a team of diverse element , each a master in his or her respective field , that can contribute something useful . these day many pioneering research are carried out by group of scientist who are proficient in their respective field . a physic and a chemistry expert may collaborate to give something that one could not have hoped to achieve by himself . a scholar who know something about everything can not do much when the requirement is everything about something . humanity ha thrived on it dynamism and diversity . to avoid stagnation , we need specialist a the field of knowledge have outgrown the capacity of a single human . a jack may fit anywhere in the pack of card but it never beat the king .
