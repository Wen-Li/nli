i do n't agree with the previous statement bacause , modern technology is advancing with huge step . i recently saw a report about a new aeroplane that in ten year will fly from sidney to london in half an hour , well that 's amazing . so if new discovery are taking our world so far . .. car might be able to do thing we would never imagine . maybe in twenty year time we will be able to get in our car and choose a destiny like . .. new york and fly in the comfort of being in your own car and with our family . all of this might be quite exagerated , but car wont stop being used , because it the easiest way of moving around , i even think that the use of car will increase . by that time car wont contaminate , they will be electrical and they will be plug each night in gigantic electronic parking lot , that provide energy by solar panel . maybe car will even move by wind enegy or they will have helix . .. in a certain way we would be kind of returning to `` the flinstones '' , ( where they moved in a car by sticking out their foot and running around ) , but in a modern way . and if the problem is traffic . .. there would be two highway , one at the groung and one at the sky , like this everything would go much faster . anyway , all of this are major word , that probably wont happen , but that doe n't mean that there will be fewer car , that nowadays . if there are so much car right now all over the world , in twenty year that wo n't change bacause defenetly the world is getting faster , more stressed , and more complicated . .. and people wo n't get on a bus to go to work , when everythig is so rushed , people coming in , people goinm out ... , when they could have the facility of getting into their car and driving to work with no stress and no rush . the actual problem is parking . .. there 's no more space to park your car in big or small city . but for example dubai and some other country have allready introduced new robotic parking lot . they are like a circular skyscraper where car are parked by a robot . so i finally have to say that in my opinion , car wont decrease in our world , they will actually continue increasing and they will make our life much easier .
