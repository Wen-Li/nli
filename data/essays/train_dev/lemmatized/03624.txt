i do n't agree that human being will have a fewer car in use than we have them today . there are two reason that i think so . one of the reason is that more and more our popurations are increasing in it 's number because of the explosion of the population all over the world . this is to say , our popuraton is 6.0 billion right now , and it will increase up to 6.5 in twenty year or more than le . therefore the car usage paesantage will increase in it 's number . other reason is that our social attitude toward young people have changed . comparing the past with now , the latter is much more leveral to young people . as long a 50 year ago , in many country , the car are driven by men , not woman but nowadays a lot of woman drive a car because of the social change from conservative to leveral . the age that people are able to get the driver licence is difference country to country , and in certain country , young people who are 16 year old are able to get the driver licence with the social change , some of our country might have such a law . with the reason , i do n't agree that , buteven though we have more car in our future , the fuel will totally change , from oil to electricity or something like that .
