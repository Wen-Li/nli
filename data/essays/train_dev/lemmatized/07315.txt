when it come to the statement `` young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their community '' , i always think of my father 's childhood . comparing the society when my father wa a child and today 's society , i get a feeling that young people in nowadays are too busy with their own work and i often expereince the coldness of people , thesedays . in my father 's childhood , people were not pressured by time . he tell me that there were more chance to clean his town and to help old people who were living soley . however , in our modern society , you can always see young people watching their clock and running around with a number of heavy bag . people in today 's world , are working when they should be helping their community . my father often reminds me that there were nothing more important than family and neighbour when he wa a child . if one of his neighbour wa getting married , all people in his town came to his wedding to celebrate , even the student and the school teacher ! but now , young people do not even have time to celebrate his or her own birthday . therefore , when it come for young people to help or celebrate other people , they are not so willingful because they hardly ever received these kind of warmness before . due to the rapid change of the society , young people have a load of work to do in stead of helping their community and young people are losing their friendness when they should be socializing with people in their community . may be , it is the time for young people to be relaxed and have a look around them .
