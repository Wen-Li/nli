i agree with this statement . i believe that by understanding idea and mostly concept is mainly the foundation to create new fact . understanding idea make a person more focused in the subject to discus . it brings new thought in mind , and it point the correct direction or way that it intended . also i believe , that it allows the student to elaborate on it own and it leaf an open field for new idea . on the other hand , understanding concept is fundemental for the structuring of a future fact . if you , for starter , do not know the concept of thing , you lose complete orientation towards thing . in order to solve a problem , is it imperative to know the concept of it and what you are really talking about . for example , if a student is asked to elaborate an essay on the president of the united states , it would be more appropiate to the student to understand the political idea of having a president , and of course the concept of it . if the student only knew for fact who it is and what doe he do , he or she could not have a reasonal judgement on the matter nor could have a responsible decision in future political campaign . l support school system that involves creative thinking and encourage a student to make decision on their own by understanding and creating own idea . if we were forcing to learn the simple fact of everything , we woul n't be able to make a true opinion for thing and could n't be able to give to new generation idea that will help them grow and develop even better than previously . finally , i will like to finish my essay with a personal thought . not everything is for fact , there 's many thing in life that doe n't have an explanation for it , but if you understand the idea of it , you might a well live by it .
