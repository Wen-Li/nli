in this short response first of all i will explain what i think about this sort of behaviour , then , supported by personal example i will state if i agree or not with this statement . most of successful people i think they are strongly ambitious and owner of great expectation from their life . this is mainly due to their condition : they achieved lot of goal and intrinsic and extrinsic satisfaction . well , once reached such a `` high `` point of their life they do not seem to want to stop and they keep on trying new risk and getting new challenge a if everything they achieved it is not sufficient . personally i ca n't have an exact opinion because i can not consider myself a successful person and neither a person who is taking new risk . i just can suppose what i would do if i could be the subject in the statement . first of all i strongly believe that this decision depends on personality and type of people . for example a brilliant and successful young man is supposed to continue his career taking more risk than a collegue who ha a family and hence can not permit to expose himself to great risk . it is also true that an adult who only ha a great goal probably will not continue to try for harder and higher goal . the behaviour in the statement ha a negative effect too : a the past experience of everyone can teach , in a risky business no one know the result , so it can be negative for most successfull people too , although they seem the most suitable person to hold a challenge . to me it would be right to reach a satisfying status of living , which confers to me sufficient both extrinsic and intrinsic satisfaction . with this i mean that people should not exceed and overrate their capability trying new thing . of course i have and i will always have goal but i do not consider myself a `` risk ~ friendly `` person . i think it is more satisfyng to do greatly a single task than two in an approssimative way . obviously this is why i wrote that it depends on personal behaviour at the beginning .
