commmuntiy - a word that often reminds u the thing like mutual cooperance , unified struggle in developiong the community , good communication between all the people involved in that particular community , so lack of any one of these can not help in developing it . when there 's such a strong requirement of mutual cooperance between different people in community , i dont think that it fair to say that young people do not put their effort or time in developing it in every country we find that young people define their nation they live in , through their activity , so they have their strong impact on the society , it because of their active participation in several kind of activity . young people are more vibrant rather one can say more enegetic than others so they show their involvement more vigourously , one example we can quote here is that if there 's any theft occured in the surrounding house , we call young people for the help but not the elder people because they cant respond that quickly a the young people do . these day we can see that young people have heavy schedule of their life because of the increased competition , inspite of this hectic schedule we can find many young people actively partcipating in social service , if we consider the young cricket player , everyone is aware that they have hectic scheule of their practice and tournament , despite this when there 's a social cause they alll get together , take out time from their daily activity to help the needed . one such cause wa during the tsunami occured during december-05 . not only these people , we find many enthusiastic ( young ) people who work for the five day and devote one of the day in their weekend in doing something that lead to ammeliorated comunity like helping in the social oragnaisations , teaching the austic people to do various thing . one such oranisation is national institute for mentally handicaped ( india , hyd ) which opened gate for various young working people who spend most of their vacation in helping them out . many such situation prove that young people are never out of their responsiblity in developing their community .
