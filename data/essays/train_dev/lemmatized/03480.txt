some people say that the number of automobile will decrease in a couple of decade . however , i disagree with the statement for the following reason . fisrt of all , car are most useful tool for people to move . for example , in 2001 , when i wa sophomore in university , i lived in tokyo and i had a travel to hokkaido , the most northen island in japan . i wanted to visit many place with beautiful forest and precious plant , because my major wa biology and i wa very interested in the diversity of plant in hokkado , most cold realm in our countory . a problem wa that there were no mean to reach the forest because few people wanted to visit there . then i determined to use a car and i enjoyed my trip with various type of plant . if i could not use car , i would not have visited the exciting forest . as this example show , car satisfy our individual requirment , suggesting use of car will be inevitable in near future . second , there are possiblity that scientist create new type of car moving without petroleum . one of major problem about car is that they use petroleum . using petroleum cause natural environment to be polluted . also , shortage of petroleum in the earth is annoying problem . to address these issue , for example , scientist now develop car whose fuel is ethanol , a kind of alcohol . we can easily create ethanol from crop , especially cone because of a large amount of cone 's supply . scientists are also developing car moving with electricity from solar energy . this is completely clean and not harmful . although there is many problem to realize these next generation of car , many country promote these study and the application will be realized soon . therefore , i disagree with the statement that the number of automobile will decrease within next two decade .
