can somebody know everthing in the world ? of course no . so why do we try know everthing . if you think i have broad knowledge of many academic subject . it mean you do not know anything . because one person can not know everhting , you just know something about everthing and it doe not work in the academic world . but if you specialize in one specific subject , it mean you can know a lot of thing on this subject . therefore it is better to have specialize just one subject . i will give an example from the real world . why company have a lot of section and their own manager ? because they are specialist in their section . the owner of the company ha a opinion for everthing but he can not know everthing so he ha to ask somebody , who is specialist on this situation , what he should do . we can use this information for academic world . if you work on a lot of subject , you can not spent enough time for every subject . you can not know everthing for every subject so nobody will ask you some help for their work because you do not have enough knowledge for them . they need specific answer . for example you are studying material science and engineering . you can not know everthing about every material . you can just know all materilas behaviour and some other basic thing . so nobody ask you something about it because they can find this knowledge everywhere . but if you are specialist on the cast iron , it mean you know everthing about cast iron . therefore if somebody need some help about cast iron they will ask you . as you can see , you can not know everthing for many academic subject . it is better to know everthing about onething . we should spent our time for specific subject .
