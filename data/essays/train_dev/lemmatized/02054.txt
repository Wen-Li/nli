this statement is highly hypothetic . how can we predict that situation ? however the situation today is obvious : we will have to go through one of the major shift of our society . even today , the crisis is so imminent and at the global scale . experts say that the world will run out of oil in 30 or 50 year . considering that our economy is completly based on this source of energy , it is easy to predict at least a change of habit from ourselves , and why ca n't we start by reducing the number of car in our street . that is fairly one of the decision we must take quickly , so i have to say i am really convinced that in twenty year there will be fewer car in use . in addition to that , we can observe a real implication of the government lately , wich can be found for example in the endeavour of many western country to develop a large public transportation network . i really believe it 's a decision that can reduce the number of car , at least in the western country . indeed , in opposite , we can see how much the car market grow in the third world country nevertheless , a we live in a world where the technology go faster and faster , perhaps the solution will be le radical . indeed , in our day there are already many source of energy are to be foud to replace fuel . for example , some scientist have achieved to create a cereal oil that can replace completly petrol . it is in use in brasil where the fuel is mixed with 15 % of cereal oil . it is clearly a great step forward , a step that can prevent the car to disappear totally of our way of life .
