people ofthen say that young people can enjoy life more than older people do . it is evident that older people often regret their life and they want repeat their young age . so , in my opinion , older people could not enjoy their life because their energy or enthusiasm is frustrated and they have a large burden . it is widely accepted that younger people have more energy than older people . from my experience , my grandfather wa an athlete . he always energitic and proud of his accomplishment . in addition , he enjoys active hobby , such a hiking . doing hike , my grandfather could enjoy his life and have the sense of accivement . however , after he resigned , although he could have much time to enjoy lifemore than ever , he could n't hike which demand much energy . he always complains his health problem and weakness . sometime , he say that i should do everything i want , when i am still younger . on top of that , younger people have le responsibility . as person age , there are more responcibles that they have to , such a marriage , working , raising , etc . to be specific , my older brother who maraged man with two beautiful baby . he is always busy because he shoud earn much money for their family . unfortunately , he never rest his weekend . when i told my travel plan that took two month , he envy me , since he could not that . i do n't have to worry about practical thing , i can enjoy my life than my older brother . to summary , i strongly believe that younger people have more enjoyment than older people do . of course , i concede that older people could have more meaningful life because their experience and wisdom . however , it is certain that younger people could attempt many thing because of their energy , also , they could enjoy life since they have le responcibility .
