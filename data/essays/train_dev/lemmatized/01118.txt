well according to me , for student , understanding idea and viewpoint is a pre-requisite for any further studying . while on the other side mugging up of fact is a temporary solution . when a student listens to a teacher in a classroom attentively then he would definitely remember his \ her word for much more time than after reading the same thing from a book . . its correctly said that a teacher is a student 's best book . if a person implies the situation practically then he will remember the thing his whole life . `` ideas are understood more efficiently though ear than through eye '' , with which i agree completely . understanding something give a more permanent stability in mind rather than reading it once and forgetting it after a few second . take for example , if you learn a lesson from your history book without understanding it u would just get yourself into trouble and confusion . on the other hand if you yourself or one of friend explain the concept , that why this war wa held , or relate the date with something , then u would remember this war your whole life without even looking into your book once . so the gyst of the concept is that mugging up fact is no solution to your problem . its intrinsic to first understand the idea , grab the main point and then paraphrasing of the fatcts that you have studied
