i do n't agree with this statement about the decrease in the use of car in a twenty year period . maybe a different concept in his use would be possible due to new energetic source or change in people 's way of life , but i 'm sure that car are going to be a needful a today . it is true that town hall in big city are trying to convince their citizen about how harmful to the enviroment is everyday massive traffic . their politics are now trying to be more aware of this problem , but i do n't think they really know how to solve it . they have built lane for cyclist but , at least in madrid , using them is really dangerous due to the urbanistic structure . another reason why i think that car 's user wo n't be reduced in the future is the way that big city expand . people normally live in the outskirt of the city and they need to go downtown to work . how can they go to their job ? they can use public transportation but that 's not a comfortable solution for them . they could spend double of the time going that way than going by car . even if people concern about the pollution problem and they start using public trasnportation or their bike , they will always need a car in case they want to travel to other city or visiting a relative living in the other side of the town . i 'm talking about what is more comfortable and useful for them . this is why i think that reducing the number of car wo n't be possible in such a short period . alternative energy like hydrogen or solar , should be more investigated in order to use them in car engine . this car would n't harm the atmosphere and people could use their car without feeling guilty .
