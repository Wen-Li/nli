it is usually said that people should focus on only one specific subject to success . however , contrary to this opinion , i strongly belief that people who live modern time should have broad knowledge of a lot of subject . the reason behind this is that the period when we are living now need someone who have a variety of knowlege . moreover , if someone focus only one specipic subject , he or she might be biased without balace . first of all , i strongly believe that people who are living this period should have wide knowledge of many acadcemic subject . the reason behind this is that one academic subject is connecting with others . when it come to biotechnology , people are eazy to think that it ha no relationshio with philosophy at all . however , when i wached the some sf movie , ` island ' , i deeply concerned about the technology to make new life , so called gernorm project , is reasonable and ethnical . it is a problem of philosopy . this example show that these two academic subject are very imtimate each other . secondly , if someone commited only on only one specific subject , he or she might be biased losing his or her academic balancing . this is because i believe that academic area originated from one subject , which wa not divided like now . as society began to divided and specialized , the academic subject began to separated too . however , nowadays , there are new try to combine the separated acacemic area for more academic progress . for ecxample , to cure patient , doctor are working with sociologist because the reason that patient suffer from disease come from not only health illorder , but also social problem such a too much stress and envirionmental pullution . in sum , without any hesitation , i strongly believe that it is better to have broad knowledge o fmany academic subject that to specialize in one sucject , all in all , academis in one .
