in my opinion it is true that young people are starting to have lot of different distraction that are separating them from many interesting activity and responsabilities a helping their community . but it is something that have been increasing several year ago . the development of new technology a internet , mobile , televitions , dvd , computer game , etc , have extended another ambition and purpose in life . nowdays teenager prefer to sit in front of a dvd player or play with their mobile instead share some evening in some community where all kind of activity or service are planned . first of all , i think one of the reason is the education that they are receiving from their parent and from the school . it seems to be more important to know how to use internet than which wa the last book that they read . secondly in this community the should try to attrack teenager offering them different kind of activity which could make them interested in going to this communinties and participate . for example , organizing : concert ( all type of music : classical , pop , rock ... ) , football game or other kind of sport , creating a library which would include : internet , book , cd 's , dvd 'd ; also try to perform some play or go to the theatre . also know much more about the place that they live and the enviroment in general not just the group or the city that they live . at last , when young people can enjoy in this enviroment they will be very excited and very decided to colaborate in any kidn of activity or help that the community can create or organize . my conclusion is that if the community present a good range of attractive and new activity any youn people will be so happy to colaborate in the well being og the community
