successfull people try new thing and take risk rather than only doing what they already know how to do well . i agree with the topic for several reason . first of all , successful people have self confidence themselves . that 's why they are successful . they are familiar with that trying new thing , because they might be done before in their life . here is the example of it . there are so many successful people and rich people in the world . many of them have more than one job . you culd see it . second , successful people could be challenger . because many of them like to take risk . if you take a big risk , you will get a big return . i think many of them have taken risk . that 's why they get success . a chance can be a risk . a risk can be a chance . third , i think many of them are tired of doing what they already know how to do well . they also can be smart people . they can handle more than one thing . therefore they enjoy what they never done before . in concludion i can say that successful people try new thing and take risk rather than doing what they already know how to do well for these reason . there are so many thing to try , i would like to do and take risk to get success .
