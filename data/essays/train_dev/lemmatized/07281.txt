the statement asserts that in twenty year ther will be fewer car in use than there are today . however , i completely disagree with the statement for several reason . first of all , there are no substitution for car . today , there are a lot of public transportation like bus , subway and monorail . however , it doe not reduces a number of car these day . in fact , a number of car are increasing rapidly these day . people us their car for personal reason like shopping and moving their luggage . taxies might substitue this purpose however it cost a lot . no one want to use the taxi for personal usage because it 's cost . in my opinion , nothing can substitute need for personal car . second , there are many country in africa and all over the world . they do n't eat food well . furthermore , they do n't even think about car . however , in twenty year , many contries which are in poverty and danger now will be developed . individuals in developed contries might want to have their own car . it will increase a number of car in twenty year . third , car mania 's are increasing now a day . they want to have more than two car to show off . someone have 5 car by it 's maker like bmw , lexus , honda , hyundai , ford . in fact , in china , there are more maker we do n't know . it will grow rapidly and many car mania might want to have more car . finally , the population of world are increasing . as the population of world is growing need for car will be growing . when new baby become a high school student in twenty year , they need to buy car for moving or go to school or for socail activity . someone might buy car more than one like car mania . in my view , growing population also imply growing a number of car . in sum , i fully disagree with the statement . because there are no substitution for car , developing country will need for personal car , and car mania 's will increase too and people who want car will increase . for those reason , i strongly oppose to the statement .
