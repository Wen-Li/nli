i agree with this statement . i think that the broad knowledge of many academic subject is important for several experience . also , it is useful on the several situation . first of all , i think that people who have the knowledge about anything are respected by other people . if the teacher know about not only english but also scientics , when he or she is asked by his or her student , he or she can answer smoothly . and , they can solve their question . in my case , my english teacher ha knowledge anout anything . for example , he know about the art , the history of the living , and the life of the other country ' tribe . when i talked with him about these subject , i wa surprised and thought that i could learn various thing from him a my teacher . i can ask the question what i ca n't solve , and everytime , he responds my question . therefore , i respect of him because he is intelligent . in addition , if people know that , they can use their knowledge anytime . for example , when they are forced to write the essay about the subject that i mentioned before , they can write them without researching . they do n't have to waste of time to investigate or ask to the others . moreover , even if they research about them , they know the basic thing , so they can improve their knpwledge from other information . in my experience , when i had to research to write the essay about the problem about yasukuni shrine because i had no idea about that . at that time , i regretted that i did n't have the knowledge . if i knew about the problem , i could write the essay more deeply or effectively . in summary , i think that it is good thing for them to have the knowledge about various subject . one reason is they can be praised their intelligence when theycan answer the question from other people . the other thing is that it is useful on their life .
