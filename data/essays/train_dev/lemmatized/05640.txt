travelling can be a good or a bad experience . some people rather travel in group with a guide ledding them through attraction because it give them more out of their trip . however , i am part of those who prefer to travel on their own . first of all , travelling with a tour guide do not give you the control of your trip . when you register for this type of trip , you have to agree that you do not have the choice to go or not at one site or to wake up early or not , because you have to follow the group . but if you plan your own trip you can decide which activity you will do or if at one point you are tired , you can relax and change your plan because you are the one in control of your schedule . secondly , guide doe not necessarly like the same thing then you , so you might not enjoy some part of your trip because you have visited place that you did not like or did activity that you did not enjoy . travelling by your own , give you the chance to visit only thing that you like or want to see , maybe you will end out not seeing a many site or attraction a with the tour guide , but you might injoy more your trip . finnaly , if you are travelling with a guide you can not go a deep a you would have like in the exploration of a site or a city . the guide ha to follow a schedule , so he or she can not spend too much time on one particular attraction . if you are in a group tour and you visit a museum , you might only have one or two hour to complete the tour . but what if you are a person who like to spend full day in the museum , you might be dessapointed , rather than on your own , you can decide how long you want to stay at the museum . travelling with a tour guide can give a good opportunity to discover multiple place , but it would not be the type of trip i would enjoy due to the fact that i would not be in control of my personnal schedule during the trip .
