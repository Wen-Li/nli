over the year , use of car ha increased to an enormous extent . it is really not difficult to find road jam packed with car . it would be interesting to predict the usage of car in future when the number of people requiring them would have increased tremendously . in my opinion , the number should definitely go up . twenty year from now , world population would have increased by atleast 15-20 percent of what it is today . the number of car user would also increase accordingly . it would thus be expected that the number of car also increase proportionately . however , there might be certain counter argument challenging this simple hypothesis . one would suggest that the advancement in aviation in coming future would promote use of air transport at the day to day level and would be used for moving around even for very short distance . this would tend to decrease the usage of car to a great extent a a lot of space ( in term of volume ) is really unexploited in this regard . i believe that the advancement in aviation would not counter the difficulty in air traffic management that would eventually come up and so , air vehicle a move around mode of transport , are far fetched for twenty year from now . however , this might be a healthier argument for say fifty year in future when system for air traffic management could be devised . another contradictory opinion would be forced decrease in car usage a the traffic and capacity to accomodate car is nearing it threshold world over . i feel that way would be devised to counteract this problem and some of them could be flooding city with flyover and subway ( city administration ' initiative ) or making smaller and more compact car ( car manufacturer ' initiative ) . another line of thought would be to suggest decrease in car usage a a consequence of increasing pollution level . this can be either forced by law or a an outcome of conscious awareness of the problem among the user themselves . i feel that technological advancement would make it possible to have car operated by energy source other than the conventional petroleum product , e.g. , car operated by solar battery , wind energy and so on some of which are currently at the experiemental level . thus , it seems highly probably that twenty year down the line , number of car used would be even greater than what they are today .
