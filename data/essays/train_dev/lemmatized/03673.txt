universities have considerably different educational system . some focus on providing student with theorical concept and idea , while other opted for practical learning method . both of these method have advantage and i personally think that if a perfect educational system could exist then it should combine them . theorical concept are necessary for student . indeed , they should help them to understand , model and simulate phenomenon . no doubt they may complicated and perhaps boring to study , but student should pay attention to them and check wether they get them correctly or not . nevertheless , practical activity are also required in teaching activity . in fact , they can help student to understand theorical concept . students will more likely understand a phenomenon by a short experiment rather than by a long and perhaps boring lecture . they would understand it even better indeed . moreover student are generally more motivated to learn this way . in addition student understand better when they do thing by themselves through practical project and so on . in other word , they understand better what they discovered themselves than what they had been taught by others . in my school , i had both theorical teaching and practical teaching , and from my experiece i can say that combining these two method in the right way is very fruitful for the student . for example , i have had in two industrial internship . from these experience i learnt a lot which i certainly could not have learnt otherwise . i learnt about how thing work in a company , how worker behave to each other and
