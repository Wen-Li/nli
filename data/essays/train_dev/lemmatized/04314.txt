some people believe that they must not help other people if the action do not provide any benefit to themselves . others , like me , believe that few hour every week must be used to help the community . i would support my view with a couple of reason . first of all , living in italy , i know that most of the young people in my country work or study not more than eight hour a day . other people , like chinese , work for at least 12 hour a day and they have not time to do other activity after they have finished studying or working . conversely , italian could spend a lot of hour doing social activity that could help the community . for example , someone studying in the university located in the centre of rome go back home at 5 p.m . .. probably , he could remain in the city and dedicate his time to disabled people helping them to come back home easily , for example helping them to get into the bus or to take the subway . unfortunately , italian guy prefer to watch soccer match on television or go to the restaurant with friend . second , in my opinion government should think a law regarding young people activity in social community . my view is that few people would do helpful social activity without a strong committment from our state . in the case of italy , there is not a law regulating action that young people can , or must , do in order to help the community . probably a good law should oblige young people that are not still working to spend on this activity at least 2 hour a week . in this manner , the state would help both the community and the young people , taking them far from television or playstation . in conclusion , i strongly agree with the statement . in my opinion , every person that ha some free time during the day should spend few hour in social activity in order to give benefit to his community .
