the idea of taking risk is not only highly important to the well-being for a common person but also become a signifaciant step to success . so i am highly convinced that a sucessful people need try new thing rather than only doing aleady know . firstly , taking risk can make a man try different area , so he can know more knoeledge than a common man . for one thing , knowing more can take a man staying in the right position which let him be brave to face everything . for another , more knowledge is a good tool to do everything cellent and bring him to success . for the second reason , taking risk is a wise way to make more friend , a man can develop his interpersonal skill via meeting more friend . only doing in the already knowing way , however , reduce the chance to see more people , which make a negative impact on one 's communicating skill that play an important part on finding job , doing teamwork and talking with others . appearntly , taking risk doe make a good infuluence on the successful people . last but not least , successful people should try new thing to find what the disadvantage is in a final analysis , we can draw an brief view that taking risk is a good way to develop one ability . so successful people should try new thing more than doing what already knowhow to do .
