i think that , in general , we learn academic knowledge to get a good job in the future , possibly the one we prefer . for this reason i think it 's much more better to specialize in just one specific subject beacuse in our modern life the medium knowledge is very high and there is a lot of competition so i think that having a very goog knowledge of a subject is the best way to get a good and satisfing job . infact almost every school system of every country is projected to give the student a knowledge starting from a basic and general teaching arriving to a high specialization ( like master ) . anyway sometimes in our life it 's not bad to have a basic knowledge of many academic subject like math and geography , when we have to travel or shopping for example . another thing that requires a broad knowledge it 's a phenomenon called job 's difersification , that 's whay very often our job requires a well understanding of many different subject . in the end i think it 's better to know very well a subject but also to have a basic knowledge of other subject .
