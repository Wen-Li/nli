i agree to the fact that there will be fewer car in a twenty year time from now . i support to this point because there ha been an increasing amount of awareness about the rise in the number of car in the city . the street and road have become more crowded and there is more difficulty for the pedestrian to walk on . there ha been surprizing increase in the number of road accident lately . not only this , more car mean more pollution and more pollution mean more global warming , which is a hottest issue in every country . becasue of the problem of global warming , people are favouring to the concept of travel through bus and train . people going to office have resorted to going more than one in the same car rather than each one going in his/her own car . this greatly reduces the pollution and expense of a person , furthur leading to the decrease in the number of car on road . the railway network connecting city and metro railway network with a city is supporting to the travel of many people throughout the day . being cheaper than the cost incurred upon using own vehicle , people are resorting to such option . i oppose the argument of the increase in number of car because of many of the reason stated above . moreover , the increase in car on the raod lead to havoc and doesnt give a good impression of the cleanliness of the city . recently , in new delhi , there ha been an increase in temperature in the summer than the earlier year owing to more pollution in the city . after the starting of metro railway , many people use this reliable , safe and easy service making a commendable impression on other city . this ha caused an acceleration in the making such decision to lessen number of car on the road in other city . concluding , i feel optimistic in the decrease of number of car in use in a twenty year time owing to it much awaited advantage and long lasting effect both for a safe city and for a better nature .
