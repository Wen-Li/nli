i think that being a succesful person includes the fact of being one of those peo new thing and , therefore , take the risk related . if a person is openminded and ha a much experience a possible , this person will have a lot more opportunity . the experience offer the possibility of having new original idea : for example in business , you will have the opportunity of starting a new market if your idea is original ; and that is what happened , for example , to the chewing gum market : the person that startes this business did not sell chewing gum at the beginning . this product wa given a a present to the people that bought soap ; this idea wa original , but it worked ! so the business changed from a `` soap business '' to the chewing gum one . trying new thing also mean , in my opinion , being a competitive person . a person that is competitive with himself , with his life , always want new challenge . being a person that can afford to face a challenge with himself , he will not be scared when he ha to handle with someone else , and with the related risk . he know his own skill and how to use them ; and he is also aware about his weakness already . this self confidence rise the opportunity to be the winner of the challenge . last , but not least at all , people that try new thing not only have to deal with risk , but sometimes with failure . this is the other way of learning while making experience . people know what is `` wrong '' to do in situation , and how not to fail again . for all these reason , i definitely think that successful people are those who try new thing , learning from them how to reach success , how to implement it , and what to avoid so not to fail . they must be a little brave and learn from their own experience .
