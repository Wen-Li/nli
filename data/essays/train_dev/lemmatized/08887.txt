young people enjoy life more than older people do . i agree and disagree with that statement because sometimes you can see an old person is enjoying his \ her life and that depend on his feeling , money , health , and thinking about how he \ she is going to spend the rest of her life either in joy or sad . there are alot of people who enjoy life in different way , i mean that each person ha his own and different way to enjoy life . sometimes you can see old person who enjoy life more than a young person and sometimes you can find young person who enjoy life more than old person and a i said joyness in life differs in each one and also it depends on the person feeling , money , health , and his way of thinking . you can see alot of young people who suffer in life and wish to die , thats because of lack of one of the four thing i mentioned above , and sometimes you can see alot of young people who enjoy life because they are still young and being old is still far away from there life and that they must spend each second of his life happely and joyfully . sometimes you can see old person who suffer in life and that is 70 % of them and thats because they are afraid from death or they feel that they are too old and can not handle and do anything and they want other people to take care of them like small childrens , but still we can find old people who are happey and they enjoy there life alot because it the end of there life and they have to pas every minute happy and that will cause the old person to live longer . in my opinion the statement could be both agreed and disagreed a i mentioned above and joyness and happiness can be made by the person him \ her self .
