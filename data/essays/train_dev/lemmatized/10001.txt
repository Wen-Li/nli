in these modern day , young people are more busy , and they are more concerned in gaining money than doing charity work or in or helping in the improvement of their communties , and i think this condition is happening for many reason . the first reason is , the type and the quility of that life we want to live in . these day every young indivitual is thinking how he can gain more mony , how he can get a promotion in his job , how he can be able to buy a new car . so by thinking in these thing every day of your life , it will be a natural consequense to forget how you can improve your communty . the second reason why young people do not participate in helping the community because of lack of enjoyment , because in these day working for your community is another way of saying boring , and this is because community work is always typical like gathering waste out of the road or planting tree in a certain area , or helping the homeless . but if we add the element of amusement , we will have great result , for instance if we say we are planting tree with a certain celebrity like britney spear , we will see many young people participating because they will enjoy the company of that celewbrity at the same time we are conveying the massege that even celebrity , who ha alot of thing to do , is participating in the event . another rerason why young people do not like to even think in communioty improvement , because of lack of guiduince , in other word , lack of appropriate education for our mentor , teacher , and even our parent of the importance of this work , some of them do not know where are the center for such work , or how to participate in such work , so how can we ask the young people to get intersted in this duty . in conclusion , communty work is important , but it lack the appropriate promotion for it , it lack the attractivness , and it lack the most importany thingspirit .
