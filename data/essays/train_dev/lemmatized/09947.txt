last summer , my wife and i were planning for our vacation , and after we selected the place where we wanted to go , she suggested that it 's better to travel in a group , and i agreed on that , and added that it 's best to have a group provided by a comprehensive plan for the trip , and a tour guide , since i consider this is the best way to travel , especially if i 'm going to a place that i do n't know . travelling ha many benefit , the most important of which is knowledge . by travelling to a certain contry or island that i don ' t know anything about , i must come back with much information about it , otherwise my trip is useless . the best way to get information about the area which i want to travel to is to go in a group led by a tour guide , who will explain everything about the place : history , value , landmarks , and all the important detail . i found the tour guide very useful in last summer when we ( my wife and me ) went to that greek island : rhodes , which wa like a museam in which we studied the greek history . the amount of information we gained about that area of the world is so tremendous , and all that wa because of that distinguished guide . in addition to the assistance for getting the important information obtained from the guide , he is a great help in every other aspect of the travelling , like dealing with the people in the `` strange '' place , directing u to the greatest place that we must visit , and all the other daily life matter that without him , it could form a big issue or problem . finally , i consider the guide an essential element for a succesful trip , and he is indispensible for all the service that he can provide before , during , and even after the trip .
