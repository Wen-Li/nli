advertsiment ha been one of the foremost discussion issue in my country a in many part of the world in the last few decade . altough some people do not think advertisments make product seem much better than they really are , dominant people think vice versa . according to the dominant people company think their own budget , so their advertisemnts do not show true product . and i also think like dominant people . one of the crucial reason for my belief is company behave selffishly and they do not think the customer price . companies show their product more attractive . that is why people want to buy this thing . and a the time pass people are able to understand this product are not useful and beautiful a much a shown in the advertisement . another reason for my belief is , people always want to have much more attractive product . especially nowadays people do not think their need instead they almost think atractiveness . in addition to this , company know this situataion beacuse of this they advertise their product much better than they really are . thus , this situation is good for both side , company and customer , nobody complane from this situation . the last but least reason is that , company always compete with each others for having much more reputation . due to this reason they always want to show their product more useful and more qualty a well a more attractive . hence , they want to advertise their product more efficiently . moreover , sometimes product are not related with real one . taking the point i have mentioned above into consideration , it would be appropriate to say that company use advertisement to have a bigger pforit . in addition to this , they use customer to acchieve their aim . companies think selffishly , and they use people 's feeling which about the having more attractive product a well a they reflect their competition to customer . all of these reason i strongly hold the idea of advertisement make product seem much better than really are .
