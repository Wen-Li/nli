in modern world , we learned almost every subject until university . and many student who graduate university are complaining about this education system . because when they get a job , they do n't use many knowledge they learned in school . i can understand their opinion . in some part i agree with that . however , it ca n't be a reason that we just have to learn one specific subject . learning variety of knowledge is very helpful for the people to be a specialist in some area . if someone want to be a biologist , he need to experience other subject . mathematics , literature , athletic . . etc . .. after he experience these area he can be found his special gift in biology . unless he did n't experience these area he could n't overcome his barrier that will face some day . he can think that he may can do other work even though he is not sure about his gift in that area . especially in law , if you imagine about lack of knowledge about other subject , it can be uneffective . law is the subject to constitute the social system . it is related with all part of the world . it affect the people 's life . judge 's narrow mind can be biased in one side . and there will be a lot of chaos in public . i think balance is the most important element for the well-organized society . for the balance only one subject kowledge doe n't work well
