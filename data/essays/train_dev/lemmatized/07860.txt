i disagree with the statement that young people enjoy life more than older people do . i believe that there is no requirement of an age for people to enjoy their life . i do not claim that young people do not enjoy their life , instead older people do too . those who support this statement would say that when people get old , their enthusiasm dy and due to old age health problem set in . but i would say that once we are old and free from the daily work schedule we actually get time for ourselves , your family , and our friend . it give u the time to pursue our hobby or passion which we could not attend to when we are busy earning money . we enjoy our grandchild more than we might have enjoyed our child . we have the time to take care of our health , which we probably neglected when we were young and busy with work . we are more mature and more tolerant due to our experience , and thing do n't affect u a much a they did when we were not so understanding in our youth . we enjoy our hard earned money after working during all our youth . we have the time to go for holiday with family and see the world which we did n't see earlier due to lack of time . in youth due to lack of time we miss out on a lot of thing which we can come back to later in our old age . in our youth , we are immature and thing that we enjoy are more materialistic . whereas , in our old age , having known the world and become wiser we know that true happiness lie in being a good human and being content with what we have . old age brings with it , a lot of good thing besides a few bad one , of course . but being old doe not mean that one can not enjoy it . there is rarely a time in your life when you are fully content with the way it is going and when all is actually well . it is all about the attitude that one should adopt to enjoy life not the age one ha . old people enjoy life a much , maybe more , than young people .
