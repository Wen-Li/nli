i agree with this opinion . i have two reason for this . at first , we will be able to think about a thing with broad value if we have broad knowledge of many academic subject . i think that a person who specialize in one specific subject is apt to think about a thing with one value . for example , we have to use knowledge of develoment economics and environment economics at least when we think about how to improve the problem of developing country . we can not think about how to solve it if we only use one subject . at second , we need broad value and broad knowledge in this time . that is because the world is getting international more and more . we have to think about a thing at any sight . for example , it is about problem of war . a war is difficult problem to improve . so we have to approach it with broad knowledge . we have to consider economical , financial and philosofical problem of it . there are so many thing in the world that we can not think and solve them without broad knowledge . for this two reason , i think that it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subject than to specialize in one specific subject . it is sure that the world ha many complex problem . and it is also sure that these problem can not solve without broad knowledge . so i assure you that we must have broad knowledge and broad view in whole of our life .
