i agree with this statement because it is a fact and even i am a youngster who is enjoying life . but if we consider the position of the old they might not have much strength in their body and even in their mind to enjoy their life by visiting other place , friend , relative and many entertainment place to spend their life . an youngster can enjoy his/her life by with his/her friend , going out , going to school , college , job but the old may not get this oppurtunity . old people may not have patience , interest in particular thing so many old people prefer spending their life in their home or in their guest house playing with their grandchild . though going to school , college might not be interesting to few youngster but in my point of view it is still an interesting part of our life which if we miss we can not get it back ever . studying new thing is very interesting rather than sitting at home chatting with the neighbour and watching tv . and i guess most old people spend their time in chatting with anothewr old person and even watching tv . old people might not enjoy the new technology and new invention which an youth might be enjoying . i guess that even old people in those day might not have good education than this generation and might have missed many fact and detail which th generation know about it . i hope that the advantage i have listed above are also a part of enjoyment in eveyone 's life . i hope that youth in today generation are in a better working condition than the people at the past . even that is too a enjoyment which the old people miss out becuse people in those day must have worked hard and toiled a lot but now we have machine for everything which make our job lot more easier . thus i conclude that young people enjoy lifr more than older people do .
