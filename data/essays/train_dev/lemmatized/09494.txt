i agree with the statement which say that in twenty year there will be fewer car in use than there are today because i think that the transportation system such a train or bus will be developed more than now . even now , in the big city , people use train or bus more than car . maybe people think convinient to use transportation better than using a car because of dense of the people and car . nobody like the rush hour and everybody want to avoid it . the other reason i agree with the statement is the think of environment . it is a serious problem the mount of co2 the bunch of car make . i guess and i hope that people will care about environment more and for that , using car is not so good way . if many people use train of bus instead of car , much of co2 is reduced . one more last reason i agree with the statement is the cost of the car . to have a car cost much because of gas , insuluence , maintaince , and itself . because of these cost , i think in next twenty year , the number of the people who use the car will reduce . and also , it is more healthy than car because it make peole stand and walk . these are the reason why i agree with the statement which say that in twenty year there will be fewer car in use than there are today . however , of course , there are many good point about car . it is convinient , useful , and for some people , it 's cool to have it . moreover , transportation such a bus and train also have many problem such a the rush time or time it take . but for many reason i said above , i hope the improvement of the transpotation system and i think it will be .
