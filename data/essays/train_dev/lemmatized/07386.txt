a community can not stand up alone . the government doe it best to improve it community . those in charge do what they can inorder to help their community . but the question is : can the government or those in charge improve a community by themselves ? in other word , can they improve a community without the help of young people ? some young adult think that they have nothing to do with their community . they think that it is not their responsibilty to help their community . others believe that they have to help their community , even if they do not have enough time . in my opinion , young people nowadays should devote time to helping their community . there are several reason why they should do this . first , those in charge can not perform all their job or activity alone . they need support and help from the young people . for example , if the government decides to build a healthy , clean club for the sake of young people , can this happen if a young people enters this club smoking a cigaratte or if h/she throw a waste paper ? moreover , the youth should help keeping the river and street clean because this would make their community healthy and free of any pollution . second , young people should help their community by devoting time and money to charity 's activity . for example , they would visit an orphanage , play with orphan , buy them new clothes and toy , and so on . this would help in building up a flourishing , kind community . in conclusion , there are many reason why young adult should devote enough time to help their community . they have to support the governement in new project by avoiding doing such bad habit a smoking or throwing wates in the street or river . second , they may help the community by performing charity ' activity which would help the community in lifting up the spirit of the poor and the orphan . thus , i believe that it 'd be great if young people devote much of their time in helpinh their community .
