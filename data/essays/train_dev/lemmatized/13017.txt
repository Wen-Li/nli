i agree that young pepole nowadays do not give their communites the required time in order to help them in a sufficient way , ther are many reason that support my point of view , and i will discus them here . first of all , young people nowadays tend to spend their time in unuseful activites without being care of the importance of their behaviour , they want to spend their free time speaking with their friend about unimportant thing , such a a television series , consequently , they will not find enough time to help poor people or to improve agood idea in order to serve the local people in their community , such a , cleaning the street and planting tree . second , young pepole prefer investing their time doing their special work and requirement , rather than participating in a common activity that will benifit the others . they see that their time is owned for them only . third , each one of them want to be the best , so he/she try not to help the others and not to enhance any thing around him like the education in his/her community . he/she like to get the best chnces , oppurtinities and to deprive the others from them . in conclusion , i agree that young restrect their time on themselves and not to benifit their community .
