i myself am considered a young person and live in a community compromising of both young and old . it is a common perception that young people enjoy themselves more than older people do . however , i think this perception is faulty . in fact it is the older generation who enjoy life more . youth ha many advantage . it is perceived that young people enjoy more because they have more energy , enthusiasm and time . however , what they do not account is the society and it demand . with time our society ha been evolving , it ha become more demanding , more particular and much younger , even though the younger generation doe have more energy , enthusiasm etc. etc. it doe not have then time to enjoy . `` i wish the week had eight day '' - this is a common phrase heard from all young people across the globe . younsters are pushing themselves to become responsible and successful citizen everday . they are always wanting to do more in le time . their life ha peer pressure , study pressure , exam pressure , job pressure , personal pressure . added to this are various family , friend and other social obligation . there is too much to achieve in such le time . thus the attribute which should have assisted them in enjoying life more become reason for them to work and achieve more . time is always short . in this rush of thing when doe one get time to even breathe ? in contrast , the older generation is at a stage where they have undergone all pschylogical , communal , religious , physical metamorphisis . thanks to various state and public policy they are no longer financially dependant in old age . thus they are free to experince life a it is . though they lack in the attribute favouring the younger generation they compensate by maturity , patience and motivation to truly enjoy life . it is commonly said `` life begin at sixty '' . this is true , because by this age one is free of all responsiblities and obligation and can enjoy life at their own pace . there is true enjoyment only when one ha time to experience every minute particle .
