i agree with the statement because to me undeerstanding is the most important factor in learing for univerisity . the first reason is that if you understand an idea it is easier to remember it and the idea stay in mind longer than than a learned fact . secondly i find it important to be able to apply the learned knowledge to other situation and study area . one should be able to adopt the learned feature and work with them . understanding is very important for idea you have to remember not only for a specific examination but for a long time . they stay in mind because you can imagine how the idea work . although you can be sucessful in an exam just by learing the fact you will not be able to remember them later . the most important reason why i prefer understanding is that fact which are understood can be adopted to your work . for example an engineer who know how to build an engine but doe not understand how it work will never be able to invent new feature to the engine , but someone who undestands the priciples of an engine will be able to improve it . this can be easily transferred to any other subject . so a psycholigist ha to understand the theory of disorder , e.g. a depression , in order to help his patient . if he doe not understand it he can only tell the patient more detail on his disorder but can not transfer the information to the individual . so this doctor is no real use to the patient because the patient can easily find these information in book . if you understand a certain technique it is easy even to transfer it to completely different study field . it can help you to learn and understand even topic which are not related . the given reason are only a few reason why understandind is the more effective learning method . besides there are many other advantage of understanding idea . so for example learning can be a lot more interesting when you understand the idea . it can be motivating and learning can be more fun .
