in general public there is a preconcieved notion that once people become older they are free from all problem , and responsibility hence they enjoy their life very much but i do not agree with this idea because , i believe that the older one becomes the responsibility and problem they need to deal with increase . for instance take one example of a successful person having irresponsible child . when he wa young he only had to look after his carrer which wa successful so he doe not bother about other thing and can actually enjoy his success , where a once he becomes older he should not only look after himself , infact he ha to look after his irresponsible child . so he ha another responsibility and a well a a problem to mend his child way , so he will not be able to enjoy his life once he becomes older . another example is that the older people allways have a fear in thier mind that they will die soon or later which would definitely hamper them from enjoying thier life . another thing is that older people dont have physical strength . they can not concentrate on a particular thing . younger people can actually enjoy their life if they organise their life properly because they dont have any responsibility . even if they have any responsibility or problem they have the strength to deal with these . which come by virtue of their age .
