there are a lot of people travelling on vacation . some people go to abroad while some people travel in the country . they either travel individually or in a group led by a tour guide . for my opinion , i think it is better to travel with a tour guide because it is more convenient , economical and safe . to start with , when travelling to the place we do not know individually not using the tour guide , we may wonder where to go and what to do . also , we have to check the airplane or bus we have to ride , check the weather and so on . on the other hand , if we just go to the tour guide shop tell where they want to go , the touris would kindly introduce u a perfect plan . they would probably plan to go to several popular place and prepare traditional food . therefore , being in a group led by a tour guide is very convenient and easy when we are travelling . moreover , the more people we travel with , the le we have to pay individually . the tour guide plan includes the fee of staying , trabelling , food and so on . since they move with a group , all the thing will be chaper than travelling individually . for example , the tokyo disney land cost more than 5000 yen in dividually . if we go a a group , however , cost only 3000 yen . it is more economical to be in a group . also , we may get friend if we travel in a group . it will be more exciting and fun if we make friend and enjoy the trip . lastly , it is much safe to travel with a lot of people instead of travelling alone . also , the tour guide know about the place and know what to do on emergency . we would feel more camfortable if we travel with many people , too . to conclude , travelling in a group led b a tour guide is the best way . it is convenient because we do not have to plan the trip . also , it would be very cheap but safe if we travel with a lot of people . it is the best idea to rely on the tour guide and have a relaxing travel .
