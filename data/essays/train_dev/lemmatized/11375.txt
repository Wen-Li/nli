i disagree about the opinion that young people enjoy life more than older people . i think it is true that young people , like student , have much time for going out with their friend . but after their graduate school , their life style are going to be changed so suddenly especialy in tokyo . first of all , they lose their private time . they have to work hard that they have to improve their ablility in job to earn more money , for the payment for the apartment fee , haviing dating , saving future marriage , or having holiday . old people have more money and time than the people in young generation . that the main reason why i disageed to the this opinion . first of all , they have a better experience than the younger people . fine food , shopping good quality funiture , clothes , go abload by cruesing etc . from my experience , it could be said , i 'm having more better life in my 30 's than i experienced in my 20 's . i could enjoy eating out at good restaurant , going precious classic concert , buying good quality clothing . only one thing i can said about negative point about old people is , they do n't have enough energy physically sometime . for example , my hobby is used to be skiing , but i feel like start losing enogh physical toughness recently , to keep high speed in the big snow slope , keep moving from mountain to montain . i know it is natural changing for everyone , and not only me to face it , but actually it is kind of sad for me . but i 'm sure about that people could enjoy better life after getting old thant the yonger generation . they know what they want . and more , they could have enough financial confident and much more free time for leisure to enjoy their life style .
