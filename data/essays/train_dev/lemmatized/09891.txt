our population is evolving towards induvidualism more and more each day . what wa considered proper and in the line of duty is now considered boaring and out of date . children tend to think that spending time to help others , is wasting possible time to take care of themself . by becoming more selfish we forget to help our community . young people do not see what is important in spending time with different people , they rely on themselfs for everything and think others should do the same . but our society ha not changed a fast a they think . the world still need help . for example i used to live in a small village were every decitions were made with our whole community , we would attend meeting and decide on how to resolve each problem with the young and the old . i went back to this town a few year ago and realised that child were not even attending the reunion . this show how much they care . but on the other hand young people have le time on their sheschull to help others . with the work load we have at school and the activity we attend , it doe not even leave much space for leisure . so how could we spend time helping out others when we first need to finish everything else . i spend my time between class during the day , in the afternoon i have tenis lesson and at night i prepare my self for the test i have the next day , when could i possibly help others ? i believe that u , the adult of tomoro are more preoccupied by are own problem then our community , and it is a shame to see this happening . but at the same time our life are filled with work and expectation for our futur , that need to be accomplished in the first place for u to go on .
