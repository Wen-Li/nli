i think that if thing are still in twenty year like theyre going today , it very likely to be much more car in use then , than they 're now , so i dont agree whith the given statement . although petroleum is likely to run up before those twenty year pas , i think there might be some other product or substance to be burnt to take the necesary energy that drive a car . its not an illusion and even today there are appearing the first car that use other substance , such a propane or any other gas , on the market . i think that when twenty year have passed by , this technology will be enough developed to let car move with no petroleum needings . this doesnt mean that they wont harm our environment , which might be really harmed by then , but i dont really think noones going to change anything to prevent or solve the environmental problem , a long a noone ha untill today . people could maybe stop using their own car when the earth get so much heatened that living in it get impossible , or at least very annoying , but i dont think that is going to happen between the next twenty year , and the car 's commerce is so powerfull that nobody is going to take care of preventing the use of car before heat get to be unstandable . as i think this wont happen , and car have shown to be a very likely product to be sell , i mean , car are very well positioned and adapted to city and citizen lifestyle all over the world , it very probable that car get on their sell a they 've been untill now , so the new car should be added to the old to finally detect a big increase in the total number of them . not only this , but if looking at the rest of the world , and not only developed country , we will find that some big country are being developed nowadays , like china or india , and they are potential car consumer in a very close future , which , of course , includes the next twenty year
