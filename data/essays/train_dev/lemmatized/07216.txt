l am inclined to believe that young people enjoy life than older people because l think young people are the most energic and healthy than older people . firstly , l convince that young people could made a lot of thing to love life . for example l can go somewhere where l want. l could go to christmas party or club and l could go to paris only valantine day . but older people , for example my ground mother could not go such a this place owning to the fact that she is tired or she posse healthy problem . secondly , young people more hopefull than older people. l definitely believe that having this hope improve young people to love life than older people . significantly young people have time and hope to finish university or find a good job and marry a good people . however all older people almost made this life experients and they wait to die . for instance , l want to find a good job and than become a product manager or l desire to find a handsome boy to marry or take a new car . but my father have already done this thing and he only want to live healthy life . thirdly , l am inclined to believe that older people sometimes a lot of healthy issue and this effected their life view point . for example my ground father posse a lot of crucial healthy problem and this make him disappointed about enjoying life . actually l think he only wish to die . sometimes l go to cinema with him but his hearth start to beating fast and we are going back to home sadly . as a result of that l am inclined to believe that young people have a lot of time and they are more healthy and hopefull than older people. l think young people spend time fully to go cinema , theatre or party . because when young people become old they do not like life and life only give them pain like it give my ground mother or father . sometimes l want to have a stick with witch and give them chance to love life like me
