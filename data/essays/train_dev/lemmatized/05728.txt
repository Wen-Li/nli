basically i agree with the statement but there are also many case that demostrates that i could possibly be wrong . i think it ^ s true that successful people always try to do new thing , but i also think that a successful man is a man who make his thing well . maybe trying new thing could be a reason of a success but i don ^ t think that trying new different thing cause directly a success . surely being able to do various thing or type of work it ^ s a great gift . in the past many group of people ha had the need of adapting on the work they need to do to survive . for example a man which escape from fallen down airplane and find himself in a desert island ha the need to adapt himself to do various type of work ( like finding food or building a home to repair himself from rain ) instead of survive . if he reach his objective he is surely a successful man . a man that only doe specific kind of thing that he know well could be a successful person in the same way a the one which always tryies new thing . the positive thing about making only what you already know is that maybe you could make it better . probably a man who tryies always different thing could not execute those thing very well in the first time . a man that doe what he know well can surely offer a more quality and specified product . for example a baker that make bread from twenty year can surely sell me better bread than a math teacher that doe the baker from only one week . in conclusion i think that success is not related to the risk token or the ability to try new thing , but it is related to the ability on doing thing well .
