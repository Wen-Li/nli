i am agreeing with the topic that in twety year there will be fewer car in use than there are now today , why because for better convenience , due to le cost , to show status purpose , and need of the human . day by day the technology is growing and also at the same people also improved technologcally and these people preferring to live better convenience , those convienients are protection from rain and sunlight etc. , and also people can travel longer distance with out suffering than that of other vehicle like two wheeler and three wheellers . secondly the cost also show some reflection on the usage than that of past 20 year back . at that time people may not be able to put that much money why because at that time he resourses not available properly . the old people think about money not for what they are using for travelling . day by day car becoming cheaper and people willing to purchase the car . thirdly status purpose . some people think that if one have a car he belongs to some higher range , not only status purpose but also for build-up . finally earinings of the people incereasing day by day at the same time living cost of the people also increasing . if some budy earns more than $ 2000 he must have acar in this tren people changed like that . people thinking that there is no need of saving money for future , what they have they have to enjoy now it self . thats why the number of car increased than than of past twenty year back . in conclusion definately the number of car increased due to some of above reason . the main reason is accorind to the technology the people modernizing them self , owning the car is also one of the modernization . so the numer of car more than what we have twenty year back . what ever it mat be the usage of car incresed in these twenty year .
