in my opinion it is more important for student to uderstand idea and concept rather than learn fact . although it is very important to know fact , because they are necessary to understad many of the event which are occurring in our day-life , it would be very hard to deeply understand them just learning everything by heart . in fact , it is important to understand concept because it 's very easy to forget fact . for example , it would be quite impossible to study litterature or better history just trying to remember al the fact by heart . maybe it would be possible to learn like that for an university test but there are a lot of possibility to fail the test because it 's very easy to forget some information or to invert some fact . so , it would be better just to try to undersand and to make some general scheme about a topyc in order to have some clear and general information and in this way it would be easier to remember the fact because they would have a logical order . for istance , once i tried to remeber all the fact which occurred during the french revolution for an high-school test . i had little time to study so i thought that the better solution wa to learn a much a possible all the fact by heart . i did not sleep at all to be prepared for the test , but anyway , i did not pas . the test day i wa so nervous and tired that i almost forgot all the fact occurring during the french revolution and i wa not able to pas the test , that it wa actually very important to me . it would have been more usefull just trying to keep in mind all the main idea and maybe i would have passed the test , or at least , i would have slept during the night time !
