in this essay , i will discus how and why young people enjoy life more than old people . i will use an example from my personal experience to support my opinion . though old people are able to enjoy life , most are not able to enjoy it to it fullest . this may simply be because they are typically not a physically able a young people . a young person is usually able to play sport and participate in other activity which may require substantial physical strength . an older person , however , might not be able to enjoy such acitivites for a very long duration of time . take aggressive in-line skating for example . this is an activity that a group of friend and i frequently indulge in for recreation . we sometimes skate for 3 hour straight . but , when my dad tried to skate , and he wa exausted to a point where he could'nt go on after only ten minute . though my dad wa very athletic when he wa young , age ha slowly stolen his vitality . another reason which old people are not able to enjoy life a much a young people is the inevitable advance of technology . most old people today simply do not like new form of entertainment . recreation today is quickly shifting from physical activites such a sport towards newer form of entertainment such a video game . i have noticed that most old people are not willing to enjoy video game . most even refuse to try them out . though they may have liked pong when that first came out , they usually do n't appreciate newer more complex game and dismiss them a meaningless and time wasting . young people on the other hand , are able to appreciate both new and old form of entertainment . i myself participate in a multitude of sport such a soccer , but i am also an avid video gamer . unfortunately , most old people are not capable of this because of the reason described above . unfortunately , this leaf them with very few way of enjoying themselves .
