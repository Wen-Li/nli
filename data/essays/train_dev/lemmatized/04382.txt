some people might disagree that it is more important that student understand idea and concept than it is that they learn fact because the fact are more concrete and easy to understand and distinguish each other . but personally , i think it important that the student learn something adjustable to each environment and flexible to the problem they will encounter . therefore , i agree that it is more important that they understand the idea and concept than learn fact . first , if student learn the idea and concept from their experience , they will be able to easily adjust themselves to the similar problem in the future . for example , my major wa biology and i have done a lot of experiment related to the cancer bilogy . when i extracted the dna , there are many different kind of method . sometimes each laboratory us a unique way to do so . but at the begining , i read the book and understood the idea and the concept beneath the protocol , i did not get confused when i changed the laboratory and encountered the different method of the dna extraction . second , if student learn the idea and concept , they can modify problem and even produce the new discovery . fo example , when i read the vast amount of research paper , some people reported the differnent result from the others and there were a lot of confusion . but once i leaned the concept of the reaserch purpose and approches , i could summurized why they produced the different fact and realized that all of data were actually suporting the same consequence . even , this finding leaded me to a novel discovery . for these reason described above , i think that it is pretty important that student learn the concept and the idea of their problem and experience . these concept and idea would be very useful for them to resolve the problem and find the solution of the difficult enviroment in the future .
