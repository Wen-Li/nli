the topic issue is that they will be fewer car to use in next twenty year . this issue is important because in today time it doe show where the world will reach if it continues like this . i agree with the fact that in next twenty year there will be fewer car on road . firstly it could be true because of the traffic on road . in today 's world the traffic is so much that we can not accomodate the number of car we are having talkless of the number in next twenty year . so i believe in next twenty year there will be fewer car than today . secondly could be that people driving get frustated . many people now-a-days are already complaining about how frustated they are when they are outside on the road . they have to face a lot of stress in order to reach their destination . so i think they will opt out and not buy car and rather use the public transportation provided for them by the government . so that state that there will be fewer car in use in next twenty year . lastly it may be because of the government . the government may ban the use of many car and put a check on the number of car being imported or produced in the country because of the noise and air pollution it creates in the environment . so finally the reason brings u to the fact that in next twenty year there will be fewer car . in conclusion i would want to state that i agree that there will be fewer car in use in next twenty year because of the several point stated above . ultimately i want to end by saying that it will be better for all of u if it actually happens . that will improve a lot in a person life , thats le stress and the impact on the environment will also be reduced too .
