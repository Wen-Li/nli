taking risk and trying new thing out rather than doing thing that have already proven to work ha been the source of major invention and accomplishment . i conlude that trying and taking risk are the most important factor for people to be successful . in most area there is a need to have a good education and knowledge base to get a job done and to be succesful in a certain filed . to run a business , for example , it is necessary to know everything aboout your product , the market and the customer and once you have gained the knowledge and experience and the product or service are streamlined and are successful in the market the business owner could try to just keep everything `` a is '' to run the business from that point on . the problem is that if the outside factor change the demand for the product might decline , competitor might have similar product , but lower production cost which all cause the business to decline . thus , the business owner need to constantly try out new thing , do new investment , issue new product - take risk to ensure that his product are successful in the market . trying out new thing give the one who doe it the best experience and the best knowledgebase he could have ; inside knowledge of what work and what doe n't work . someone who only stick with what he ha learned already and wht he ha been doing for year will never get the insight and cannto be successful in that specific area . the same is true for taking risk : chance are always associated with risk which mean , in conclusion , that only those who take risk are also able take chance . to start a new business , to travel to an unkonwn territory , to do scientific experiment always contain risk ; but most of men 's major accomplishment have been made by those people who started the new business and travelled to unkonwn territory . my conclusion is that people even need to take risk and try new thing
