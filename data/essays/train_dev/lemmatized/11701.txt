nowdays , before the launch of the any product it is usually advertised . the advertisement of any product help alot in it marketing . advertisements are so catchy that make the viewer to think over the product and sometimes they are convinced to buy it . but usually it ha been observed that the actual product is so effective a shown in the advertisement . i have been also misleaded by one of the advertisement . i wa having dark circle under my eye . so , one of my friend suggested me an under eye gel . she came to know about the gel from it advertisement . in the advertisement it ha been given that it will decrease the dark circle . and one have to be regular in applying it . the course period wa about 3 week . so , i tried the under eye gel . in first few week it wa giving positive result but a the time passed i noticed wrinkle under my eye . and my dark circle were also not improving . the gel ha the side effect of causing wrinkle to my skin . and wa not helpfull in clearing all darkness . i wa really dissappointed by this . so by this i came to learned that product in the advertisement are sometimes are much better than they actual are . the advertisement company do this in order to promote their product . but they actually are foolishing the customer . like this there are several example . another example can be the good , actractive packing of the candy , toffee , icecream and etc. but in actuall they can be tasteless . also this in dress material this is been seen . thus from the above point i believe that advertisement doe n't given the actual picture of the product .
