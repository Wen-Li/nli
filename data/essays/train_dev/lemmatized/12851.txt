in an age of mass production and consumption , manufacturer engage in a harsh competition to survive . the consumer want to know that he is getting the most out of his investment and may rely on advertisement to decide which product would be the wisest purchase . it is then no surprise that when company advertise their product , they focus on it benefit - perhaps exaggerating them - and rarely disclose it shortcoming . advertisements of beauty product are a good example of this type of embellishment . the consumer want a mascara that will lenghten , define , and thicken her eyelash without making them appear clumped together . all cosmetic company know this and , year after year , advertise a new mascara designed to do all this . dramatic picture shown on television or printed in magazine display it unique ability to thicken thicken , but never mention that this same technology also lead to a clumping or , worse , shedding of eyelash . if the company mentioned these side-effects , who would buy this revolutionary mascara ? this scheme seems to be working , since the new formula keep entering the market every year , and woman are still buying them ! diet pill are also advertised a being much more effective and safer than truly are . the typical advertisement show picture of ( pretended ) consumer before and after using the miraculous product . of course , the `` after '' picture are always taken in a more flattering light , with the happy customer wearing better-fitting clothes and often sporting a tan . they are also digitally enhanced , to the point that one may come to doubt whether these people have even lost any weight or used the diet pill . in any case , the pictured consumer appear thinner , healthier , and happier . but do diet pill really bring about such formidable change ? advertisers conveniently omit the need to balance diet and exercise in order to maintain a healthy weight and the customer is more than happy to purchase an easy solution . just the same , the maker of these diet pill typically mention the possible side-effects in small print , while the numerous advantage of their product are spelled out in bright , bold letter . finally , even if these diet pill are effective , the customer hoping to gain a better self-esteem and happiness may be very disappointed . after all this person ha not changed his or her definition of personal worth along with a new , shapelier waist . in conclusion , manufacturer must resort to somewhat dishonest practice in order to sell their product . however , i do n't believe this is done specifically to dupe the consumer , but simply a a matter of economic necessity . it remains the consumer 's duty to understand this and to develop a more realistic understanding of what a product can and can not do in order to critically examine an advertiser 's claim
