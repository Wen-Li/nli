i think it is important for student both , understanding idea and concept and learning fact . if a student understands idea and concept he will analyze different position about a topic and also can have discutions in class . there are some idea aond concept that werw introduced in a particular fact . so , concept can help student to understand some fact , because a new concept that explains something can bring a change that became a fact . for example a discover is a fact in which a person introduce a new concept . facts for student are very important in all the fiels of knowledge because it is the way that they can undertand the change for instance in literature , or history . there are some fact that show a change for the people that are includend in this change . when cristobal colombus discovered america wa a fact that cause a change not only for all the people living in america in the fifth century , but also caused ne challenge and goal for people that came from europe . so a fact is important to understand all the period that follows it . concepts and idea are basic for learning because they give student meaning in all the subject of study . in literature there are concept that student may understand the different literature movement or concept that some writer introduced in literature that now are important . in biology is important the concept of living specie : or in geology , evolution of earth is a very fundamental concept , all the geological change that have occurred are also fact that scientist concludend in some research project . in conclution , not only fact , but also concept and idea are very important for the learning process of a student because in some case they are relationed and give the student detail to understnad and learn in a beter way .
