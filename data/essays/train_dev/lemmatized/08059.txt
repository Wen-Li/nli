i do agree with this statement . people who take the risk are the one who are successful . for exmaple , if we look into our everyday life , we can see that most millionares and billionares are the people who have actually tried something in thier life and the people with normal wage are the people who are working for them . the difference between the employer and the employee . not all these successful people begin successful or even have a gift that they are born with . .. in some case that is . most of those people are born just like you and me , and just have vague idea of particular suff excatly like everyone else . the only problem is that they have the courage to actually take a shot and see if thier idea work unlike everyone else who walk around saying that i had an idea or i though of that ! if no one actually took the shot of doing something and showing the whole wide world what he wa thinking about most invention in our time now would not have existed and we would be where our ancestor were before thousand ands thousand of yea ago , right back to the time of caveman using tool made out of wood and rock . so imagine this , no cell phone , no tv 's , no car , no washing machine , no drier , no oven no nothing ! yes you probably envy those `` successful '' people and wish that wa you or you just pray to god that he would lose all his money in a way and eventually become a `` normal '' paid citizen just like you are but a a matter of fact if it wasnt for his risk on showing his idea your necessaties or good that you buy for liesure would not have been provided for you . we are all basically the same , but these special people who come up everytime and time again are the successful people . now i know for a fact that i might not be one of them but you can always hope for thing to happen for you . try your best at taking risk a you never know you might end up on the `` successful '' list . theres no use of living your whole life without taking a risk ... whats the fun of life then .
