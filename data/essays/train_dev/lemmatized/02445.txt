more and more type of advertisement are being developed and improved , due to better knowledge and advanced technology used by the professionnals in communication . today , everywhere you go , at anytime , everything you read , contains advertisement . in the newspaper , magazine , in the metro/bus station , on am/fm station , on tv commercial , on internet etc . our life are surrounded by advertisement . the problem is that all what we see or hear about is not truly the exact product or service that the advertisement claim . the most accurate example is the advertisement of food , especially fast-food . in fact , the picture advertising a huge hamburger made with fresh ingredient , in a precised shape , at an affordable price , is not quite realistic . it give you a feeling that it might be true , real and make you go and check it out . but when this perfect lunch is in your hand , you do not look at the picture in the same way ! this is the main purpose of advertising : it is not only the opportunity to make people know about the company , but it is more about a product that we do not know , we do not necessarily need , but it look attractive and accessible to all . also , with today 's advanced technology in designing and imaging product , it is even easier to show anything , anything but what you really sell . the actual hundred way to `` sculpt your body '' , `` redefine your figure '' , etc. using these new technology in picturing perfect body , make the product seem to be the best and valuable , which is not . in conclusion , i can say that i do agree with the fact that what we see in everyday advertisement is very far from what we really get . in other word , everything that seems to be is not what it really is .
