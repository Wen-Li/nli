in my personal experience , i agree that it is the best way to go on travel in a group that led by a tour guide . there were lot of advantage of go in a group . in this short essay , i will discus with reason and example that why is traveling the best way within a group . first of all , we can make a lot of friend during the trip . when we are on an airplane , a train , a boat or a bus . we can all commiuncate with each others , and having fun . one of my best friend , who name kim , i met him the first time in a bus on a trip with a group to hangzhou , he just sits next to me , and we sarted to talk to each other , after all we became the best friend . so that traveling in a group can make friend . secondly , it is well organize by traveling with a tour guide . he/she could led you to the most popular and interesting place that the touriest always like to go to . for example , if i go to place by my self that i never went on before , i wil totally get lost , and do not know where to stay and where to go and where to eat . .. so on . but if i go there with a group and with a tour guide , the thing will totaly be changed . last but not least , we can get more fun by traveling in a group . for example , if i go to a place individually , i will get bord on the airplane or train . in the other hand , it will be more interesting and funny by traveling in a group , because sometimes we can talk about some funny story or interesting personal experience on the trip , so we would not get bord . in conclusion , i discussed the reasones and example that why is travelng the best way in a group and b y a tour guide . in my opinon , i would like to travel in a group , cause i can make new friend during the trip .
