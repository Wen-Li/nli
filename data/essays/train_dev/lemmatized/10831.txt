i support the argument that young people do not give enough time helping their community . in today 's context and scenario the concept of benevolence and brotherhood no longer exist . the youngster these day have become so obsessed with the materialistic pleasure that they tend to overlook or appreciate the environment they have been brought up in . they are part of a rat race and constantly competing with their contemporary so a to get ahead of them . they seem least bothered when it come to actually doing something for the benefit of someone else . it is the `` i , me , myself '' scenario that prevails today . i can say from personal experience that the essence of belonging to a community is lost let alone helping others ! in the stranglehold of societal demand , we are all subjected to just working for ourselves , to achieve a much a possible - more perhaps , if achievable ! its all about goal , target and result . we seem to have forgotten that at the end of the day , we , the human race must live in cooperation and share a symbiotic relationship with every other being . we must learn to ` give ' and not just ` take ' - for the sake of morality if nothing else ! but moral and principle are a thing of the past , long gone and forgotten . we tend to forget that only when we give something do we get something in return . but again , just for our own selfish reason we must not resort to helping anybody else . the realisation must come from within , it must be like an awakening that would lead u to helping others , sharing with others and creating an amible and comfortable environment . as citizen of a community , it is our responsibility to give other member their due . it is indeed the need of the day to reinstute the value of helping others for the upliftment of society and the entire human community .
