although the other transparation vehicle like train , plane and ship are improving the percentage of usage of them , in the future i strongly believe that the number of the car will be more than today . because , a car is a need for a person today like air , food and water . all of the people try to have a house and a car for a better life . a car make life more simple that you can go everywhere without waiting any other vehicle when you need . you can go your work , shooping and other social activity you wish . this situation lead to gain time , so you do not lose time for waiting . today , time is the most important thing in a modern people life . therefore , people prefer to have car to gain time and making life more easier and comfortable . this event show that people will continue to have car in the future , too . the population of the world is increasing day by day , so more people mean more car will be in the future . a second reason about the fee of the car . today , there is a big computation between the car producer . all of them try to produce a better and chaper car . that computation cause to decrease the fee of the car . therefore , people who have not enough money to take car , can buy a car because of the low price . another reason may be about the technology . in the future technology can lead to u to drive flying car . flying car can destroy all the disadvantage of a normal car like tarffic problem or traffic accident . today , most of the people rather to use metro or ship to travel because of the trafiic problem and accident . if in the future scientist will be successful making flying car , then people can prefer to use car instead of train and ship . as a result of these reason , i think in the future the number of the car will be more and people will continue to use car effeciently and affectively .
