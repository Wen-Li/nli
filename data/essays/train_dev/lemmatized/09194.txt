in my opinion , it is more important for student to understand idea and concept a only learning fact . because learning fact is not the elementary problem . if they understand the main problem in general , it is easier to learn the fact , because they have enough scientific background . additionally , if they understand the scientific concept and model , they do not need so much help , for example from teacher . the student can learn in self study and answering their question themselves by analzying the problem . the student have to learn how they can solve such problem . this is what the university and school want to show the student . because in real life are too much fact . nobody can learn all these fact , because there is not enough timeand it will be very inefficient . so scientifics want to formulate general concept that are based on an important idea and developing a model , on which they can show the fact of the real world . these are the basic of research . the scientific result based on researching activity come form an idea of the researcher . if the student learn these concept and model they can use them for other situation and they will get new fact . the understanding of these model and concept summarizes a lot of information and fact . it is very efficient to use such concept and model and understand the main idea they are based .
