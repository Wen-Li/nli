i honestly can not say for sure if or if not there will be fewer car in use in twenty year than there are right now . there are several reason why there are still car in the future . one is that having an own car is much more comfortable - right now and probably also in the future . you do n't need to sit in an overcrowded train or bus to go to work . another point is the structure of public transport . for getting rid of car the government ha to make sure that almost every point in the country ha to be connected by bus or any other kind of public transport . this would cost an enormous amount of money which would n't be affordable for any state . especially for state like usa , canada or sweden where the biggest part of the population still life on the countryside . but on the other side i honestly belive that even with the discribed problem the amount of car will be reduced over the next twenty year . mainly because of the price for fuel and car . almost nobody can afford a car for almost 30000 euro anymore . the price for fuel rise up even in the states so that there will be a need for an improved public transport system . another point is the air pollution in bigger city . by visiting city like los angeles , new york or even dallas - it get on some day even almost impossible to breathe . .. most of that doe n't affect u right now - but i am pretty sure it will turn in the next couple of year . finally it is to say that there are a lot more reason why there will be lot le car in the future but in the short time it wa unfortunatelly not possible to mention mor important one .
