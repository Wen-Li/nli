students understand idea and concept . students also understand form learn fact . in my opinion it is important student understand idea and concept before going to learning from fact because there are somany reason in that some explanation with example is given bellow . student learn idea and concept of some topic is very important before going to learing fact . for example take an experiment from a chemistry lab , without knowing idea and concept of the experiment what would do in the lab . if possible someone do the experiment without knowing the idea and concept definetly some explosion go in lab because in the chemical lab we do the experiment whith carefully . with out care , if we do the experiment in the lab definetly will going wrong . for example h2so4 is highy acid , i remember in my class room in my college stadies some student without knowing the experiment detail and idea he want to do the lab . he put some water into the h2so4 a big explosion took then my teacher scold that boy that is another matter . without knowing the knowldge and detail he do the experment will give some bad conclusion . take another example some neclier experiment are down there in some country . if we do the some wrong with knowing or without knowing there will go a big explosion . in that place definetly we know the idea and concept , without knowing the concept and idea we can not do anything such place because nucclear wepones give big energy than any other . even son also give the energy based on the neclear energy . forthermore give the safty and full detailed information about what student want to learn . if student learn abouts concept and idea , he know the entaire point about what student want to learn from fact . this give no loss of any thing around the place where the application do . moreover some fact know by without knowing the idea and concept that is another matter . in my opinion we must know the idea and concept before attempting to learn the fact .
