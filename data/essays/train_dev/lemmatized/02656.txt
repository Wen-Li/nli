from past 20 year one of the grooming industry is automobile industry . it showed it impact on all part of the world . there is a gradual increase of car every where . i dont think that number of car will be reduced after some year . instead therewill be more number seen than what today . they are palying major role in transportation . firstly , car are ragarded a status symbol for many people . they buy it just to show their status rather using it for some genuine reason . cars seem to have drastical impact on every class of people staring from lower middle class to upper class . so nowayo a car can be disappeared . . seconly they are considered to be more comfortble . car is preferd because it is easy to raech our destination rather waiting for some public transportation . it dont give much stress and make people get relaxed when compared to other mean of transportaion . any time it can be used and make our work done in a cool way instaed of rushing for other way . finally , now a day the price of car are also declined due to some reason . so they are affordble by even a middleclass person which again symbolises rise in the car population . being a car owner any person can make a plaln spontaniuosly and even implement it . like planning for a picnic . and example why anyone go for car is it may be used for all purpose both for official and personal thing . and car doesnt realease much of the gas and it is not the victim for pollution too . car not only serve a personally but they are even used a public transpotation like taxi . so car ha it effect on every walk of man 's life to reach the destination and to enjoy luxieries too . i conclude that i cant imagine road without a car a it carry many advantage .
