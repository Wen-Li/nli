as our world developed and became industrialized , the need of car had increased . however , in twnty year , will the need of car continue or will there be fewer car in use than there are today ? i belive they will be fewer . the oil price ha been increacing , and car pollute our enviroment . more and more people are concerned with enviroment nowadays , and i believe there would be a better transportation in the future . as most people know , car destroies our enviroment and pollute earth . cars have long been used in our history , and it ha made improvement . there are car that produce le carbon dioxcie , but they are expensive and only available to rich people . there are many people who would prefer those kind of car , but i believe that those car would not be available to everyone even after twenty year . in recent developing china , the need of car are increasing in incredible high rate . it might look a a good thing because china is begining to enter developed society and becoming industrialized . however it is a big propblem . china is one of the most populated country in the world . if every family of china had a car and used the car , our world would be polluted and be done with in very little time . we can not stop china from developing . so in order to avoid that situation , we need new none eviroment polluting transportation . in the future all country will develop in some way . in conclusion , i belive that in twenty year there will be fewer car in use than there are today , and that there will be new transportation that is kind to earth .
