i do agree with the statement , untill unless a person is willing the take risk and try thing differently the posibility of success is le . a doing the same thing will produce more of the same result , which he or she already is experiancing . if they are not enhancing a person life , no matter how much he do what already he know will not make him successfull in anyway , in my own example i did by moving to united sated , if i whould have left in my hom country i would have not been successfull a i am right now . by moving to this coutry i took the risk of leaving my safe job back in my country , which i wa doing for almost 5 year , i wa well estabilised in job know what i wa doing hence i dont have to worry about job , but the pay wa not great . if i would have stayed i would making same amount of maney , and my experiance in life would have remained the same ever since i moved to united state i have making more money , i have bought a home and leaving very happy life . and more imporatanly i have oppertunity to meet the new people and know about various culture , a many people from different coutries come and settle heit whould have not possible if i have stayed back .
