i completely agree with the statement . nowaday advertising show you a lifestyle . they mainly speaks about the feeling or how your life can change buying a product . that because this is the most important way to sell product . playing with the feeling : a psycological approach . the more advertisement are made the more a product became important in people identity . advertisements are le involved in the quality of the product . to show the potential of a good is le actractive . if a product will became a trend a big amount of earns is sure . on television the advertisement are like a short movie and the target is leave something in the people life style . the `` slogan '' or `` jingle '' is important too . it is part of our life . it must be a funny statement . poeple must remember it easily . but sometimes it 's not related with the quality of the product . i my opinion showing a product at the supermarket or during an exibition is important too . i particulary agree with `` test promotion '' . for example , going at the supermarket and testing by yourself a new product . in this way investiment in advertisement are more important then the work on the product . sometime it depends on the kind of product we are talking about .
