for my it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subject because learn more . the diferentes material : arts , science , mathemathics , literature , politic , world , economy , languagues , cook , technology , history . learn to the watherver topic , or subject , realize a person . most learn most prepared to great job in anything work . wao ! need talk about all topic with all people and help in different material . and specialize in one specific subject realize people `` genious '' on the specialization . special people , learn about science for example and specialize in this maerial have big concement in the cotidians job . in my opinion learn the all academic subject realize the people or much very intellectual people . maybe readding more book , le television , more educational program . whn travel at other country , learn the other culture , your idiom , custums , religion . the world is totally different and more learnd of the other material more prepared for any situation . noy bad for specializa in specifict subject no , no . no . but always y need learn , i nead have a knowledge for evrethyng topic . i like i enjoy knowledge . this my live . i am play instrument and learn evreday at the other material . it 's so funny learn , funny and intersting .
