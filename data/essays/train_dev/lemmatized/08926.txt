in the next twenty year there will not be a fewer car in my opinion there will be more car in the next twenty year and there is a reason for that . first reason is pepole in this world will increase and thats mean increasing in the car they need to use , for example ; some cityes give the license driving on the age of sixteen a a result there will be a more car in the street , second reason is pepole need car so they can get there thing and go to work and such thing like that . for example i will talk about a family have a four person how many car they need ? propably not le the two car and thats another reason why i think there will be more car in the future , to slove the problem i think we should make a train , bus staions . in the summary i thnk more pepole thats mean more car and i thnk there will be a more car in the next twenty year .
