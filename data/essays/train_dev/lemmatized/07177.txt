knowleges are the most important thing in everybody 's life . we usually get them from school and \ or from personal experience . is it better for oneself 's developpement to have broad knowledge of many academic subject than to specialize in one specific subject ? i would answer : yes , for several reason . first , have you ask yourself the following question : why are we taught so many subject at school ? the answer is clear : because the gouvernement ha told to do so . it want the best for the population . it give you the opportunity to open your mind and `` taste '' many subject . second , with broad knowledge , you are more able to understand one 's opinion or point of view . this is a great advantage in life , you will better understand the world and the person you live with , but also you will be more understandable by others . third , have you ever experience a conversation with a specialist in a particular subject ? well , i do , and i found it very interesting at the beginning , but when i tried to change the subject of the conversation , i wa faced with a real wall . .. specialists are really good at what they do , but seem to be a `` bit '' narrow minded as a conclusion , i realized that you ca n't have the same level of knowledge in one particular subject than in many one . this is true , you have n't got the time to learn everything . in fact , you will agree or disagree with the statement based on your own value . in my opinion , i am sure that you can be a specialist in different subject . for example : you can be a moviestar ( you are then a specialist in acting ) , and a famous and apreciated politic ( specialits in politics ) . i wa thinking about arnold schwarzzenegger who ha also taught how to be healthier in his early life . are there muscule training for the brain ?
