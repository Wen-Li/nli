i personally do not think that the travel in a tour with a guide is preferrable for several reason . instead , i suggest the travel alone a a best way . this essay compare and contrast the advantage and disadvantage of travelling alone and in a group led by a tour guide . first of all , a tour led by a guide requires a set schedule : tourist can not go around a they like ; instead , they exclusively have to follow the guide all the day . by contrast , travelling alone permit a person much freedom : she or he can decide the schedule of that day according to her or his will . second , although the existence of a guide might seem to be helpful , it sometimes doe not function so . for example , at the tourist site , the guide give an explanation to it , and tourist just listen to the guide . this form of information-acquring is just passive . instead , i prefer learning thing by myself actively , and i think this is the major advantage of travelling alone because the knowledge or memory acquired by positive attitude should be better than memory got by passive attitude . third , the guided tour might not allow people to take a closer look at tourist site or monument . since there is a certain number of people in the group , it is hard to estimate that an individual can have a closer look at tourist feature until he or she get satisfied . this is precisely due to the set schedule a indicated . people have to go around the one place to another in a rush in order to make it on time . again , on the contrary , sicne traveling alone allows much freedom , a traveler can take a closer look on the site or tourist feature . having said that though , travelling in a group led by a guide doe have some advantage such a : some interaction and socialised relationship amongst other member of the group ; safety because they travel with other people . however , a far a the first advantage of travelling in a group is concerned , it is still achievable even if it is a travel by alone . being open , friendly and social enables the traveller to have the interaction with other people along the journey : even if s/he doe not have any friend or fellow at the beginning , s/he can acquire them through the trip , and this is the exactly exciting point of travelling alone . as far a the security issue is concerned , the advantage seems to rest upon travelling alone . yet , considering other aspect , a argued , travelling alone should be still entitled to be a desirable way of the journey overall .
