some people might think learning fact is more important than understanding idea and concept . however , i agree that it is more important for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact . first , it may not all that you are seeing . for example , there are so many movie out there such a charley chaplin who made very famouse movie and history of movie , and you might think that movie is stupid and just funny but nowadays people ca n't deny that it is one of the best movie so far . because he representitive that generation with the funny behaviers and people understood what he want to express of that movie . so umderstanding is very important . moreover , it 's not worth it even though you see somthing an if you do n't understand the idea . when i see the prida callo 's self - portrait , i thought it 's so aufull becaus there is not even any human 's face and there is only blood and animal . but after i learned to understand idea and cocept , i totally agree and satisfied with her art wark . if people see only fact , they will miss so many beautifu and sifnificant thing in their life . finally , think about seeing disability . even though they ca n't see at fact at all , they feel everything . so , i realized the fact are just part of our a cleary , i stronly believe that understanding idea and cocepts for discovering inportant meaning which is hided and have acknowlege to enjoy our life .
