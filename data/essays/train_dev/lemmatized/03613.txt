yes , i agree the following statement `` in twenty year ther will be fewer car in use then today '' .the usege of car depend uponpopulation . bcoz population is one factor to increesing the use of the car . today man life is very tight with his schudule here time factor is most importent , so many peple are prepfer to buy car . this ha somany advantage are there one is to travel with his family with out facing any problem . today public transpotatoin line bus , train etc are avialaba but the problem is in this trans potation we have face somany people . it will take time also some time we will miss our work . thats way suppose we r haveing car we travel anyware in cirrect time . one disadvatage having many car is trafic . so we fallow the trafic rule correctly . and we haveing car will save lot of time . after twenty year the population ni defnatley incresed so fewer car5s in use there are today . today every person life busy with his work and schudle . and ever man prefer change in his lifestyle . so ever body prefer to buy a car becausethe car rate are very chep . and the market annouce so many offer . so every body prefer to buy a car . so every to take cre about the pollution . if we take some care about pollution is must . use of good gas we will reduce pollution some what . in twenty year the population is increseed then need of wil , l also incresed . so in my opinion in twenty year there will be fewer car in use than there are today .
