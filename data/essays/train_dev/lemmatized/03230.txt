people do not always reach success by trying new thing and taking risk , even though sometimes it is necessary . if someone ha the formula for success , whether he/she found it or is given by the environment , he/she should not change it unless wanting or pushed to do so . carlo ancelotti , coach of ac milan , an italian soccer team that ha won several tournament and award under his guide , declared on the day before the final of the champions league `` a team that win never change ( set up ) . '' the next day , using the same player a the previous game , ac milan won the champions league , the most prestigious tournament in soccer . just like carlo ancelotti suggested , something successful should often remain uncorrupted to succeed again . not everyone , though , already ha this oppurtinity in his/her life . this is the case when a person should shold try new thing and take risk . for instance , considering a large and profitable factory , the son of the bos will not have trouble in order to reach working success ( considering this is the kind of success he is looking for ) a his eritage includes a business already started and well run , but one of the worker in the factory ha great manual skill , but in the factory he doe not gain much profit and doe not fully use the resource he ha . if he never took a risk and never tried anything new , he would always work in the same factory and hardly reach success . instead , if he decided to start his own activity , taking the risk that such a choice bring , he would have a much larger chance to succeed . nevertheless , looking at the society in a bigger scale , risk might be necessary to succeed and develop . in fact there is one important factor to consider : competition . the pushing force for many people is often other candidate , who try to reach success by doing something innovative . unfortnately , there are time where the success of one is the unsuccess of others . this cycle infact is infinite . the positive aspect of this situation is that the society will always offer newer and more innovative thing . therefore success is not always found by doing something new and taking risk , bet there are time where the situation requires it .
