when walking on an early night through the street of any bigger city in european country ( especially on weekend ) , you will notice laughing group of adolescent having a nice time wich each other . when you think on old people enjoing live , you might think on grandpa sitting in a wheelchair while reading a book , a more comfortable way of enjoying . but in my oppinion , the younger people are capable of enyoing live much more , due to several reason . they dont have so much restriction on behavior by the society , they expierience much easier new thing and they have the better health do to what they want . at first young people have mus le expectiations by the society about how they should behave . when a old woman is seen by relative while she is drunken or she missbehave in other way , she will do hard by explaining her behavior , because of her experience she should already know how to behave . in contrast to that , young people are much more free to do what they want , and nobody is blaming them , because everybody should enyoy his or her youth . second , first experience are always those with the greatest impact . somebody who , experieriences something , like kissing , for the first time , will enjoy that in most case much more than the next time he will do the same . because of the fact that older people have made a lot of expieriences in their life already , it hard to find something new . the first thing are further these we remember best , because we like them most . furthermore , young people do n't have normally any problem with health . while older people often suffer on several deseases , younger people can live without having to fear anything striking them down in the near future . an old man may not be able to dance the whole night , simply because his unhealthy heart wouldnt let him . of course older people can enjoy life too , and sure they doo . they have often more free time , and more money than younger people to do the thing they like . often older people like to travel around , to find the new expiriences mentioned above . but in conclusion , life is more interesting and enjoyable for young people , because they have to fear le , and fear is the direct contrast to joy . they are more free , and expierience new thing much more easily .
