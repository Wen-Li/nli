how do we know if this human being is successful ? success is not a word you can give to any human being , a successful person is a person who learns new thing or do new thing with taking all the risk . well i surely do agree that a successful human being is a person who take risk in his life , he 's a person who us all the apportunities he got , bieng riski is one of the most important thing to make a career and to be one of the best . some people think they reached the limit of knowing everything and they think that there 's no way this thing would work better , but they are definetly wrong , they still have much to learn , let take an example a small employe in a company working on a desk , am sure thats not what he want , he should learn more about what he 's doing so he can become a bos one day , then we can call him successful he reached to the top from the bottom . taking a risk is a way diffrent from learning somthing new , taking a risk need thinking and full conssence of what might happen , you cant just take a risk and jump from the 7th floor while you already know that something bad is going to happen , thats what we call suicide not a risk . people should take risk on good thing , thing that might end with good result , like buying a used car might be a good income to you at last while you wa afraid it would be a loss i just wanna say at last that people who look for more education or more of anything are more successful than any othe human being .
