with reference to these different solution , i think that both the possibility have got advantage and disadvantage . in my opinion , if it is better to have broad knowledge or to specialize in one specific subject depends on several factor such a the country where do you have to work and which kind of job you are interested to . indeed each country ha got it own tradition and political system that surely influence the academic choice of a person . in my country , it is more common to have a broad knowledge of many subject so people could have a wider choice between many job . it is also very important which job you would like to do in the future . indeed scientifical job need specialized knowledge of a subject such a chemistry or math . on the other hand there are several job which need a broad knowledge of many subject . for example a person who want to teach licterature have to study grammar , poetry , history , and so on . although specialize in one specific subject ha got it positive factor , such a the possibility to find early a good job , i surely prefer to have a broad knowledge for several reason . first of all , i would like to know a lot about our world , and if i studied a specific subject i would know only a topic . secondly by having broad knowledge you will be able to choose between different job . after all you can specialize yourself after that you have found a good job . so i generally do agree with the statement
