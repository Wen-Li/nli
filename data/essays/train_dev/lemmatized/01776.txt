education is a very important and vital throughout the world . but unfortunately there many obstacle for student to go on the right way when they begin to learn . educational system in country have different kind of aspect and different kind of qualification around the world . for example in some country finishing the class and exam are so important for student than any other objective so the first aim is to pas the exam and the possible way for this is to memorize the concept and formula . in addition student are generally looking for the previous example amd question which help them to pas . generally the meaning of education is that when you can pas the exam than you are prosperous only a few are curious about the fact that are the reason for these formula . in contrast in some country there are really good indicator for prosperity . in other say student are diverted into searching the fact they are told that searching the resanos are more important than the result by these information informer are really the pioneer for development . devolopment is really possible with the fact or with reason that lie behind the concept . for instance think about the science the reason and fact are really very important especially when you are a doctor and your main aim is to help people in their operation so to know the fact is necessary for the right and fair act . to sum up in my opinion it is generally more important for student to understant the idea than to understand the fact which lay behind the information . awards are generally based on the ending so people are generally concentrated with the outcome so at this point concept must be learned firstly .
