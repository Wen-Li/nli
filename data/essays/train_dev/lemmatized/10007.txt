imagins that you have to work far from your house and you should take a way of transportation , on one hand you have a confortable car and , on the other hand you have an unconfortable public transportation that is going to take too long to get to the place that you like . .. what kind of transportation do you prefer ? you do n't need to answer . . in twenty year , i do n't belive that the current situation is going to change . first of all , people need to move from one place to another and also , eveyone like to be independent , and that is n't goint to change in twenty year . in fact , we need car for everything . cars give people a social status , depending of the brand of the car that you have you are in a different social class and everyboy need to be in a group . ono the other hand , due to enviroment problem , people could stop using car in order to reduce co2 pollution . perhaps , another reason why could be le car in twenty year could be the extintion of fossil source , such a oil and gas . in that case , scientis will invent new source of energy to use in car instead of oil or gas . maybe scientis can find better way of transportation , but , in only twenty year i beflieve that it is impossible . in conclusion , i think wo n't be fewer car in use , because car are like a part of our body that we need to move and not only that , also we live in a period in which everybody want to get the much a they can , and if you can have more than one car , that 's better . these kind of behaivours are n't going to change in twenty year , thus the number of car will be increasing year by year
