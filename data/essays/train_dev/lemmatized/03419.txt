young people enjoy life more than older people do . i am against this statement and have strong point to support myself . we read the newspaper and magazine and see that it only the young people dominating the front page and party scene . this creates a general misconception in people 's mind that the youthful age is the age when life is meant to enjoy rather than when we 're forty or fifty plus . we might think that this is true , but if we put ourselves in , say , our father 's shoe . we conclude that life is all about going to work in the morning and coming back home tired . this is n't fun right ? well , now that a misconception . older people attain enjoyment in place where we do n't see anything but a boring event . let me compare myself and my dad . i enjoy myself by going out to the movie with my friend etc. , which i do n't usually see my dad doing . does that mean that my dad doe n't enjoy life ? wrong . my dad love his work and take pleasure in going to work everyday , and even on sundays . he ca n't stand sitting home just lying in front of the television having pizza and sundae . that wa supposed to be fun for me but for my dad , no ! my dad really enjoys his early morning yoga session and tennis game , and really look forward to them . to me these are nothing but time wasted which could be spent in sleeping , going out to party etc . whenever i take a close look at my dad i notice that he is really happy and enjoying life to the fullest while i 'm not . concluding , it all depends on the way we analyze the given statement . we may think we 're the one getting most out of our life but no , older people also have a life and look forward to it more than we do .
