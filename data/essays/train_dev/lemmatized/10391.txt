sometimes they believe that learning fact is important for student . however , i agree with the statement . this is because understanding idea and concept is prerequisite to learn fact and because learning fact itself would not have menings . i will explain these 2 reason . first of all , understanding idea and concept is prerequisite to learning fact . student would not be able to understand what the fact mean if they do not understand idea and concept . for example , suppose student listent to the news of first degree murder case . in this case , student only know `` bad person wa arrested by the police '' . they have no idea about what the `` arrest '' and `` first degree murder '' mean . it is not useful for educating student . on the contrary , if they have already studied the concept of some legal term they can understand the case better . thus , they may be interested in law and they want to know law more deeply . this is the effect of understanding idea and concept . second of all , learning fact itself would not have meaning . facts have meaning only after idea and concept are understanded . for instance , suppose that student are taking class . speaking of history , if we just know `` president washington is first president of united states of america '' , this is just `` fact '' . but for the student who do not have any idea and concept about it , is this fact important ? who care about it ? they should not understand importance of this fact ( this would be easier to understand if student are not american ) . however , if student understand idea and concept of `` independence '' `` president '' or something , that fact can become important one . as a result , studets can study effectively . of course , i do not think learning fact ha no meaning . rather , it will be helpful to student who are interested in outer world . all in all , though , i strongly believe that understanding idea and concept is more important that learning fact because of avobe-mentioned reason .
