how do we recognize and differentiate successful people from other people ? what is the secret that brings someone from bottom to top ? is it a lightly touch given by one 's guardian angel , or a genius one is born with or merely just luck ? i think that successful people are defined by their creating or discovering of something that others have not . it is their ability to forsee thing and have the courage and ambition to realize them . it is not only that they do take risk what lead them to success , but it also the commitment and the sacrifice they make along the way to success . for example this year 's oscar winner for best director martin scorsese , ha comitted his life to a career of directing movie . for many year he made film that others did not dare to make . for many year he wa nominated for the oscar but remained empty handed . but he did not yield and he continued to make movie with the same enthusiasm and resolution , always trying something different and new , wich finally brought him the award . he is an example of lifelong success . some people might be coragous , some very lucky . but i believe that what make a person different and gifted than the other people is his or her resolution and the undying belief in what one 's doing .
