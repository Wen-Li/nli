i precisely agree to this statement . people seldome doe not happen to challenge new thing sicnce they are afraid that they are going to fail on that task , in other word , they are unwilling to challenge new thing because they are uncertain and do n't think that they would success . however , in my opinion , i think what is significant is that you actually attempt on doing something even if you fail . i even think that failing is more important than not attempting to try . only doing what they already know is not going to make you improve more . it would make you confident in only one thing . for instance , if you a person is trying and trying to do on something a much a he can but he is unsuccessful , he would be successful sooner because he would realize the reason why he failed on this task . in fact , if you attempt to do something however you fail on it few time , it the leading road to success . for the person who only doe what he already know , he will not improve at all but a confidence . even if this person really know what he ha to do and how to do a thing well , he wo n't be a good a the person who fails and had failed many time . the chance will only come to you if you would start doing and try doing new thing . the more door you open , the more chance to have more opportunity . if you keep the door closed , nothing would come to you . chance would come only if you open the door . people want to success , and want to have more chance . however , in order to do that , you need to make opportunitie by yourself . it seems difficult and it is , however you just have to open the door and you will see a road where fail leading to success .
