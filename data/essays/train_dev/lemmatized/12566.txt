i have to admit that concept and idea are often neglected next to all the fact that student have to learn . history lesson are a good example . if you know all the date , name and place that doe not mean that you have understood the complex interaction of cause , consequence and motivation . sometimes it is not even necessary to know exactly on which day or where something happend . important is that it happened . what led to it and it impact on the future may be of much greater interest than it exact date . is it not much more important what einstein discovered than knowing on what day he wa born ? is it not more important to know that his invention led to the nuclear bomb than to know the place where he wa born ? of course , without fact nothing work . you could not teach history without date , name and place . you could not explain any concept or idea without the fact that it base on . facts are the foundation to any thinking beyond . you can only understand why einstein gave his idea to the american if you know the fact that he wa a jew . that is why i think that there should be a balance between fact and more . students should get those fact that are necessary to understand the concept . in my eye they are both equally important . one without the other is nothing . if you know all the element of a computer you still can not put them together correctly . if you posse the instruction but do not have all the element it doe not work either . and even if you have both it is not easy . but if someone explains it to you you might succeed . this is what teacher should do . they should give student the fact , some material about how to understand them and explain the big connection . i do not think that idea and concept are more important than fact , each is important in it own way . ideas and concept are based on fact . students should learn both to be prepared for life .
