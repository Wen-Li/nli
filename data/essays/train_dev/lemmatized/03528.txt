according to my opinion , specilize in one specific subject is better than the broad knowledge of many academic subject . student need knowledge in one specilize subject will give good and positive reaults to him . he would get confidence on that particular subject . specilize subject give chance to get more knowledge , grip and command on that particular subject . they mey get more chance to focus on particular thing , it will help to reserch on that specialized subject . it lead to invent new product , it may help to moderen society . also it may give good name and also chance to improve economical position . for example , i finished my specialization in pharmaceutical division . after that i did reaserch work on one particular molecule . that molecule given positive result against hiv disease . i got a huge amount of prize money from my country . and also they awarded in many way . with this prized money i started a one large pharmaceutical company . in other way many people are serviving with my medicine . this result given good name in my career . another example is , one of my frieds also specilize in the computer programm . he invented a new programm , for that he awarded by the government . due to that programm people are enjoying computar game and internet fecility . due to internt the world become a small village . finally , my opinion is specialize in many acdemic subject will not foucus in one particular thing , he may not get satisfaction with all subject . didnt get special recognisation in society . so specialize in one specific subject is better . many scientiest are invented by specialize in one specific subject .
