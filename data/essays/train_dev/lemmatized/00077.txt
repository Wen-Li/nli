marketing ha evolved throughtout time and ha become more complex a time pas . what used to be very simple , like introducing a new product to a market , ha become a real challenge . now a day there are so much market that are compiting between them , that the product that ha the best marketing strategy is the one with the biggest revenue . the best way to obtain attention from the client , is showing them a product that cover all their need , product that can do everything at the same time . that is why most product seem much better than they really are , because there is no such product that can cover all , and even most , of the need or want of the posible buyer . in television most product that are being advertised , really doe not work . that is why they tell you `` if you call within the next 2 minute you will get a bonus pack '' , this way they get the attention of the person , by making them think they are getting not only the fabulous product , but also the amazing bonus pack , distracting them from the real product . another way of getting the attention of posible buyer is buy selling them lie . advertisements tell you all the thing that the product can do , but really most of the time it just work partially , or not at all . at the end , most people are really unsatisfied with the product they have bought , and end up buying the one which they really needed , and not the one that is giving you lot of promotion , that at the end doe not satisfies the custumer . it is really important to show what you are really selling , that way costumer will be satisfied with what they are buying , and they will continue to buy the best brand .
