i firmly believe that exist any men 's finest hour , and i am not able to say if it come in early or latest period of our life . generally i think that a men 's finest hour come when he worked hard for year and year , to finally discover that he wa right in his life and so wa the thing he had worked to , and this discovering happens when he finally lie on his battlefield , exhausted , but victorious . homer said that men become more tired of drinking , dancing and making love , than making war : so he would say that men are always in war , and only the dead saw the end of it , not because their are bad or barbarian , but because they enjoy to live their life on the edge , to take match every day , to demonstrate they are victorious . i think this is the meaning of `` enjoy life '' : to take part every day in new competition , going away victoriuos , in the end . now , i 'm not able to say when occours our best hour , it may happens when we 're old or when we are young , the meaning thing is enjoy this moment . young boy , probably , live their life and do n't think too much at the far future , when they will be old , like de'medici said in his poem . opposite this argument , we can say that old people have a heavy bag full of cultural notion and experience , and they think much more at the thing they have to do , careing not only to themselves , but to all the people they have around and with have relationship . in ancient time they said : `` only the good die young '' , but this thinking wa strictly joined to a pagan vision of the world and life . now is the coulture of the christian that found it way to rule the world , and we can say that we have not only a heroic youngness , but also a respectable middle or old age : this period of life is not yet rated like the autumn . we can enjoy life in every period of our life at the same matter , it do n't care how much year you carry on .
