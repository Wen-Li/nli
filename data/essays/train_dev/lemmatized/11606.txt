the question of whether young people spend enough time to help their community is a difficult one and need to be discussed . to answer this question , i want to compare some argument which do not support the statement to some argument which do support it . after this , i will reach the decision that i agree with the statement . people , especially younger one , have to handle growing time restriction in different place and situation . young people need time to play when they are childreen , they have specific problem while becoming adult and there is more and more pressure on younger people to finish their education a early a possible . as one might argue , this lead to the fact that younger people do spend enough time on helping their community . or it lead to the opinion that young people waste time while doing a year of community service like it is made in germany . but this view only focus on economic point and doe not take into account that the community we live in doe not only consists of work and money , but of help , friendship , respect , and other value we do not want to miss . as our relationship get more and more economised it is very important to remember that not everybody is `` good '' enough to get money and that some people need help . because everybody could face problem which one can not solve alone , younger people should be teached how important it is to help others and , thereby , help the community they live in . elderly people , for example , often need help in many different way . since some elderly people can not afford to pay for somebody helping them , younger people should do community service to get a feeling for the kind of problem elderly people face . younger people will sooner or later face the same problem a they grow older and at one point need help for their own . this is called the `` generation contract '' in germany : younger people help elderly . to summarise , i agree with the statement because everzbody could need help .
