i disagree this question . a lot of people want success thieir life . but success people do n't afraid new advantage . here is one example . you know walt elias disney ? when he built movie company , he need new creat something . actually when he built movie company , nobody recommand what he built company . but he did . then he lack money . he wa really poor . so he wanted earned money . but trying to make a new movie is very risk thing to him . however he never give up . because he had dream . he always said `` if you dream it , you can do it ! '' and he got a idea from mouse . he confirmed his business . so he lend money from his brother . at first his brother do n't want borrow money to him . because if he fail , he lose money . however he beilieve disney 's dream . at last , disney made mouse character . that wa `` mickey mouse '' after he made mickey mouse , he became a rich . that mean trying to risk idea with dream , never reget . also here is another example . i 'm exchange student . at first , when i said to my parent `` i want to try exchage student program '' , my parent disagree . however i had dream . at last i started my risk advantage . actually i wa afraid . afraid of english , make friend , adjust new country , etc . i did . i overcome my afraind . trying to risk is nothing . if you have brave and confidence , i recommend try new thing . i think really poor act is afraid of fail . you know what ? we grow by fail . also fail give good lesson for success . these day , successful people try new thing . lots of business man try to new business for thier dream . also i will try new thing . even if that is very risk . i will try again and again for my dream . so i disagree with following statement .
