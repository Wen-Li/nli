i agree with this statement . i think that young people enjoy life more than older people . there are two reason . one reaso is that young people are more activity than older people . also , the other one is that young people have new idea for life . first of all , young people are more activity than older people . it 's because young people can do dance more activity than older people . however older people ca n't do dance more activity than young people . it 's becuse older people do n't have enough power of dancing for a long time . second of all , young people have some new idea for enjoying in life . for example , there is festival in life . young people can open up thier idea for festival . it 's because young people can think of interesting idea . in conclusion , young people can enjoy in life .
