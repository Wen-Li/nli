i agree with the statement . in korea , all the highschool student work on only studying . also their parent force to them study . as a result , all the student lose time to help their community . they do not even help their family . most of korean life in apartment . once upon a time , everyone knew all the member in their town , and there wa not someone who do not know in their town , because they always cared about their neighborhood . however the apartment do not give any chance to meet their neighborhood . one more , the job are getting more proffesional . everyone engage in different part of job . so they do not have chance to think about their neighrhoods and community . so the reason i think are studying , apartment and proffesionalizing of job . first of all , the studying culture made student do not help their community . in highschool , all the student compete eachother so badly , they do not have anytime to think their community . they will have to go to academy after school , and they will be so tired . after the academy , they will fall asleep right after arriving at home . this culture make this society like that . second , living in apartment is one of the reason . apartment is a seperated place . all the people do not care about their neighbor and do not know who are their neighrborhoods . the apartment are getting so big , and they will not remember who are the neighborshoods . then no one will help each other , because they do not know each other . this is big problem of apartment . third , i think proffesionalizing of job is the biggest reason . originally , people engaged on same work in korea . everyone growed crop . the agriculture wa developed in korea , so they always helped eachother . however , these day , everyone ha different job . so they will help only people who are in their company . neighborhoods will not have any chance to meet each other . helping community is really important to live this society . if we need help , no one will help u . we need to help each other and make good realationship with all the people in our communication and society .
