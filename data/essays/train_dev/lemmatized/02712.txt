according to my opnien on argumrnt evolves an approch int he direction of supporting the that sucessful people try new thing and take riks the said aspect that title there by illustrating some factor that are seginificent to the point put forroward a stated below . most of the sucessful people try new thing and take riscks . because sucessful people mind is very shorp they think differently compared with others . if they see ant new thing suddenly asks him self 3questions what ? , why ? , when ? . then they start thing about the newly seened objest then they keep patent to learn about that . we know that `` room wa not built in one day '' and they take risk for that . as we know that `` where ther is a way there is a will '' . they not live inthe middle they research up to end . form past we learn lot of thing sintests discover every thing now we are engoying what hey discover . sintests are always sucessors they do not leave any one in the middle they fight up to reach the goal . thats way they deisover alot . they do not stop at the discovery off one thing , theysearch for next time morre accurate one or else for any new discovery . sucessors or god gifted people teir mind always think about new thing and resesrch for now one . as they do like that now we enjoy all leaxury thing . every one thing for new thing but some people fight till end of the battle they are the sucessors . try for new thing have lot of benifites than only doing already kown to do well . for example robbrt didnt think about plain now we cant move from one city to another . search for new thing give more leaxuories life for the next generation . at the ame time doing already know we can improve the performans in more acuurate manner . rearching for new thing govern ment give more encoragement a it benifies to socity . altho elabration if argument ha sreveral sucess aspect and few draw back over weight give
