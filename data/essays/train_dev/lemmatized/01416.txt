i think the best way to travel for the first time to an unknown place is to be in a group lead by a tour guide because of their experience , their knowledge about all important turistics site and how easilly he can move between the city , place and small village you are planning to visit and the facility to carry your suitcase all day in the truck with thinking that it may get lost . it is not the best way for all case but yes for the first time on a different and far away place . when i first travel to europe , i did it with a friend and we went on a group that lasted more than a month . it wa great because we met a lot of friend on the trip , from any age and nationality . we felt secure because we were in good hand just being with honest and reliable people who wake up every morning , take care of our personal stuff and reserved all exposition , destiny and place with previous anticipaction without thinkig if we will get ticket or not . the leader ha a lot of experience in these trip so he will be more informed of the most relevant thing of each place . also , if we were on a tour if there is alot of people in the trip it will be more easily to obtain discount for exposition , also you dont need to worry if someone stole your money or if you pay for something that you may never receive or see . when you are travelling on a bus trip all your luggage will be handed directly by the personal staff and delivered directly to the bedroom you will be in . if you do that by yourself you may need to carry all your heavy personal stuff and there will be no one who will lend you a hand carrying them all day long . in conclusion i think it is better to go on a tour specially if it is the first time you have been there and the country or place is quite different a yours . however if i return to europe some day to visti the exact same place i did during that month i will be travelling backpacking just visiting the most interesting place for me and just carrying the necessary thing just to make my trip a pleasant one .
