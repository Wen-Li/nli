successful people try new thing and take risk rather than only doing what they already know how to do well . there are several reason why this statement hold true . first of all , people who take risk are usually more adaptable to new situation and feel more secure out of `` their comfort zone '' . for example , when a student from another country decides to move to a new city with a completely different culture , he is allowing himself to experiment new experience , such a the music , the food , the architecture from that city . this factor do not only enrich his life , but broadens his horizon and allows you to think `` outside of the box '' . additionally , when a person try new thing , they put themselves in a more vulnurable state , thus learning from their mistake and helping them build a stronger , more powerful personality . for example , when a person know that their option are limitless , and that even if you fail the first time , you are strong enough to try for a second time , their chance for success increase . sucess can be described in many different way . many people associate sucess with monetary compensation , others with personal satisfaction . regardless of how success is considered , i believe that taking risk will directly improve your chance to be a succesful person .
