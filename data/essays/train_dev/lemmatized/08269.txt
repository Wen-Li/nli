successful people try new thing and take risk rather than only doing what they already kown how to do well . this statement is absolutly perfect and i completely agree with it . most of the successful people try new thing and take risk rather than sticking to the traditional and know way of doing thing . all the new thing invented in this world were a outcome of the experimentation of new thing , some people try new thing to satisfy their natural instinct of experimentation and after experimenting with the new thing if the result is productive the person who tried it automatially get the credit . here we have take an account of risk involved trying new thing . firstly , success come with effort and not every effort is fruitful . the success and experimentation is also in same relation . but people who have already tasted success are more willing to experinment and take risk because they alredy know what happens if they follows the same treditional method . if they could suceed the expeiment they can get additional accollades . secondly , some people with out having sucess in the past are tend to experiment new thing to satisfy their natural instinct . they may suceed if every thing go a planned . all the people who are successful are not born successful , but their harwork and tried thing came in there way and got success . thirdly , if any body try new thing he may loose all his credis this is call risk factor involved in experimenting with new thing . but if the experiment is fruitful he will get patent for his result and lot of money in return . he can also get the satisfaction of contribution to the modern world . finally , success and try new thing are directly related but it is not always currect , because all experiment are not fruitful . we can say thet all the succesful people tend to try new thing and get success . if the experiment fails they may learn from the failure .
