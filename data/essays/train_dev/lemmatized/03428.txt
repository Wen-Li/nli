i think that in twenty year there will be fewer car in use than there are today . the first reason is that the car is necessary to do most of tha activity that a person doe . for example , if a person want to go to swim and the swimming pool is far from his home , he take his car to go there . the car is very important for the family . infact parent need the car to bring their child to school or to go shopping . another reason that i think will make the number of car increase is price of them . infact forty year ago , for example , car were very expensive and so only a part of the population could buy one . today there are lot of different model of car and almost any family can buy a car . i think that in the next twenty year there will be fewer car in use also because they are reaching a very high comfort level . today a person can have a long trip without arriving tired . another reason is that car are being more and more safe . for example twenty year ago if someone have to make a long trip he probably had taken the train . infact if a person had an accident with an old car he probably hurt himself seriously . for these reason i think that in next twenty year the number of car will encrease a lot .
