it may depend on what kind of field or job these successuful people are involved in . if they are involved in a business industy that requires rapid update and application of creative idea such a computer or car industry , i agree that sucessful people tend to try new thing and take risk rather than doing what they alreayd know how to do well . successful people in these field make a lot of money from successful business . for example , bill gate is known to be very rich person in the world a a founder of microsoft company . but his company is consistently trying to update the existing computer system or invent innovative new system , rather than staying a they are . it may apply to most of the big company that produce brand name product , including vehicle and electronics . they spend large amount of money for research for the new and better product . this kind of investment can be considered a taking risk . because they may not come up with better product a a result of research and may take a lot longer time to generate better product than they planned . however , there is a chance to produce product with much more improved quality and this may lead to more successful business . on the other hand , people that are considered a successful a working in traditionally respected profession , such a doctor or professor , they may not have to take much risk to stay successful . becasue their mean of making money-treating patient or teaching students-do n't change fast . although they may have to keep up with a new trend of field needing to modify their method . therefore , it may depend on the profession or business where they are involved inwhether they have a tendency to take a risk or not .
