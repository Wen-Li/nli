based on my own experience and on other people comment about this theme i agree with the statement . especially today new invention are made so quickly and life is often changing so fast . these fact bring new question and problem to be solved and although a certain knowledge is of course necessary in every field , it is most important to be able to adapt to new situation und to be flexible in most job . everyone can look up information , especially since the internet is available almost everywhere . but knowledge and skill like `` soft skill '' are kind of individual and important in every part . i myself experienced this throughout my internship at a tourist-company last summer . nobody asked me about number or specific knowledge about hotel or sight , the question were if i could outwork an interview or if i have experience in moderating and working with group . in addition , i read about this topic a few time know . there wa for example an interview with a popular german journalist . she explained that she studied history and politics but what she really learned at the time of her study is how to search for information and present them to the reader or viewer . to write a paper you have to find reliable literature-sources , which is n't always easy , but a skill you may need later a a journalist or if you want to manage a project of something specific . all in all , i think it is better to teach idea and concept to today student than make them learn fact because that way they get the `` tool '' to succeed in managing new situation and challenge .
