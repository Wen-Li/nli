i quite agree with the statement'intrinsic meaning . i would personally support the idea that the kwoledge of concept and idea is extremely functional in order to better understand fact and phenomenon . i would like to clarify my point , stressing the important functional relation that exist between the two cognitive process . actually , i would get beyond , saying that undersanding concept and idea is essential in order to ace real phenomenon . for instance , we know that many wall street investment bank sistematically hire phd student from top us school , for their researche department in order to get a better understanding of what wa going on around the economic world and for bringing into their organization the great theoretical kwoledge they have . on an overall basis , it'also real that learning fact give an important opportunity for student in order to put on to a practical dimension what they have learned from book . a clear example of this approach is provided by the harward business school teaching method . it wa totally based on bringing real business case into the class , so that the student could touch the essence of the reality , and at he same time , improving their problem solving skill . i would better suggest to see the problem in it complementar nature , saying that the two aspect are both important and student should enrich their knowledge regarding concept and idea but simultaneously go in depth analisying real life fact , getting a more pragmatic view . this approach is intended to be largely supported by stronger relationship between academic environment and corporations world .
