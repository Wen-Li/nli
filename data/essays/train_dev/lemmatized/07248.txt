generally , i do agree that young people enjoys life more than older people , because it is a matter of fact that young people life in le stress and responsibility than older do . from another perspective the lack of maturity might be one of the major reason for this enjoyment , also no much attention is paid to the consequence of any action made by the young . furthermore the youngster enjoys life more due to le exploration and expectation than older people which involves exitement , the older we get , the more we know and expect even if we are travelling to a new site , while for example if you observe a kid in a park you can tell the difference in the approach and the movement while olders are setting still because they till them self that i already know the feeling . on the other hand the more younger the le mind occupation and complexity while proceeding in life , you find the teenager with bigger smile and exitment than the college boy who started thinking of his career and how good his gpa should be , who is any way more happier than a recently married man with more responsibility on his shoulder , not to mention a man spousing a wife and a group of child and responsible financially about their schooling and clothing , a we can note that pressure and responsibility get accelerated when we grow older which unfortunatly minimizes the joy in our life . nevertheless , i do think that those accumilated problem becomes the joy of a life time when a son is noticed graduating with first honor from school or getting married , yet the price of sacrifice made through the year is refunded at once with a joy no young people can ever experience . in conclusion i believe each age got it is own joyness , depends from which prespectives and angle we are looking from , even though if i 'm to choose , i will spend my whole life a a teenager .
