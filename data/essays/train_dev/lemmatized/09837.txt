befor three year , i met with my frind who finished his university befror one month in that time and he wa very sad because he did n't find a job in any company . when i aske him about the reason for that and he had gotten an exellent mark , he answerd that all comany want diffrent of skill in the emploee who will work with them . it is better to have broad knowledge to get a good job , big salery and high postion in any comany . if you have diffrent major in you education or several of knowledge you 'll have a big chanse to get agood job . for example , if you have engneering major withe some course in coputer , you 'll get job faster then if you have just an engneering . also , you 'll work in a diffrent department and that wiil make your job more exciting . it 's not hard to get a job , but to have a good salery is the hard thing . to improve your skill snd to get a nice salery you should diffrent then the outher eployee . alot of people try to get one major in teir education and ther want to work , if you want to be diffrent then the outher you have to get5 broud of knowledge . not every one can be a manager or importent one in his company . the manger ha a special proparties then the outher , more education and strong behavior . we can get the diffrent education by having broad of knowledge . if you study difrrent major with diffrent of people you 'll get the strong behavior . in cnclusion , you can be an importent man with big salery in an exellent job if you have broad of knowledge and diffrent of education . my frivs also have knowen that .
