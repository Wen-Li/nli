i agree to this statement . first , the technology are growing so i think there will be more better transportation invented . using car ha many demerit like traffic jam and car accident . recently i see many car accident on the news report . especially by the drunk driver . i think there were be more better invension after twenty year . also , recently , the increasing of the carbon dioxide ha been a serious problem in the world . it cause global warming which is very serious . this cause the ice in the north and the south pole melt . then the sea level increase and many land will be covered with sea water . there are already an island that ha been influenced by this problem . so japan ha been working on to decrese the carbon dioxide such a the kyoto protocol . i think the main cause of the increasing of the carbon dioxide is the car . the fossil and oil pollutes the air and increase the carbon dioxide . so i think the best way to solve this problem is to forbid car . in twenty year , this problem will be more serious in the earth . many country will be influenced by this and i think there were be no more solution other than to lessen car . from these reason i think there will fewer car than today after twenty year .
