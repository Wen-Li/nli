i think young people enjoy life more than older people do . young people is younger than old people and i think young people are teenager to about 20 year-old-people . teenagers have very healthy body . so they can go many different place . if they have many trip , and camp , they will experience many precious memory . maybe they will experience with their friend and family . also they can make freinds in the camp . but old people ca n't do that . they are maybe 50 to 70 year-old-people . so most old people have some disease in their knee and shoulder . their healthy also very bad . some old people also do n't have friend except their neighborhood . if he or she is very healthy , they do n't have much money . they ca n't go trip for other country . young people have lot of dream . so they can enjoy their life . they can be singer , teacher , doctor , and actor ( actress ) . they will try their best . it is very important . dream is make people alive . in the world , every teenager have dream , and they make their way . however , most old people do n't have dream . some pool old people is waiting only death . they are so pity . if they have dream and hope , they can heal their disease . i believe it . if someone doe n't have any goal or dream , he will be fail and pool . i also have dream , i will be oriental doctor , because in the chaina , some doctor revive a man by his oriental medicine . i think it will have dream to revive man . old people can enjoy their life , too . but it is le than young people . young peopl can have many memory , healthy body , and friend . also they have lot of dream . so i think young people can enjoy life more than older people do .
