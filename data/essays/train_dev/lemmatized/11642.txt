i believe that it is better for people to have broad understanding of many academic subject than to specialize in one specific subject because a wide scope of knowledge in various academic subject is required for multi-tasking , for maturing into a knowledgeful person , and for conducting specific task efficiently . firstly , due to the change in the business enviornment , employee are required to carry out various task at which they may not have specialized . for instance , a business manager is required to facilitate stratergy formation which requires an understanding of various subject such a finance , account , operation and human resource . secondly , knowledge is a vital component for a person to mature . maturity doe not come only from age and wisdom but also from an understanding of various topic that may not be necessary for fulfilling the task in a job description . for instance , a person need to have an understanding of biology and chemistry to either consume over-the-counter medicine or prescribe them to thier relative . the very same person could be working a a receptionist at an hotel where no information on chemistry or biology would be required to fulfill the task in the job description . lastly , a broad knowledge of many academic subject will help an inidivual to conduct a specific task more efficiently . for example , a marketing manager will be required to be knowledgeable about technology , finance , and account in order to form marketing plan and budget . without the knowledge about these subject , the marketing manager will not be able to complete his or her task efficiently . in conclusion , it is better to have a broad knowledge of many academic subject than to specialize in one specific subject because broad knowledge will enable a person to multi-task , to develop into a more wise and mature individual , and to conduct various task with ease and efficiency .
