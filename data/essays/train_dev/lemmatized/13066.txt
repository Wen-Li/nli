students all around have to obtain learning facility . but it varies from a person to another the way they should obtain this information . i agree that it is more important for a student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact due to alot of main point that support my decision . and it is supported with futher explaination throught out my essay . for student to learn the fact they are provided with . it is very easy for them to forget the information later on . the student do have a rate of acceptability for information , if he/she can not be able to understand the idea these fact are based on , they simply are forgotten by time . another point to discus is the amount of pleasure takin in when the student is recieving this information . it is very dull and boring for a person to sit and accept alot of idea into his head and simply just memorise them . it is more fun to understand the concept , discus it and then understand it so that it would not become temporary . student should be recieving information in an orderly manner . for example a physic class , it start off wid introducing the topic and then orienting the student to the type of information in this course so they are able to understand the idea and concept faster . rather than giving then the formula and letting them memorise these fact and try to solve on their own . it is very convenient for a student to understand first and then try to work the rest out by himself . the last and main point is , that understanding the information enhances the student self confidence . for example , if the student is asked about a specific topic he could easily recall it and explain it from his understanding rather than reciting what he learned before . i agree that it is more important for a student to understand idea and concept rather than learning fact because a i mentioned before it is easier , it is no temporary and mainly it is enhances self confidence .
