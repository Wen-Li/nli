cars are verry inportent to a person , we use it for transpotatins , travilling and more , but it need alot of moneyfor the petrole and inshorens and not forgeting the cost of the car it self . there for i agree that in twenty year there will be fewer car in use . because of teqnology other replasments wich will provide a better service and sheaper cost will be invented or expanded . for example before car were invented people used to ride hours and camls , a for the futer maybe jet-planes in the cise of car whold be invented . another reason for dicreasing the quantity of car would be for saving the invironment from the poloted are causd by car , espcially the ons that run by desel , that is why those cind of car are not allowd in serton country like lebinon for example . after twenty year i believe that evry thing will be provided at home , our work and thing we need . so no need for any body to get out of the house and go into their car and drive all the way to go to worl or to get somthing and go back home , because you can simpply pick up your phone or get on the internet and order what ever you wish . as a resoult there will be no reason to buy a car is the first place . after all , why go to something when that thing can come to you ? at least i hope that fewer car will be used after twnty year for the reason i menshioned erlyer . because i believe that the world would be better of with le car in the futer , because the invairoment will be le ploted , and we will get to save time by staing at home , and not driving the car around to go to place .
