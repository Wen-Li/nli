in the future there will be fewer car in use , i think . today , buying a car is more possible than in the past . because it is cheaper and more essential for people . however , while the time is going on , the road have been crowded and traffic problem have increased . therefore people 's complicates have raised . now , there are no adequate road . the government may build more road so that provide the translation . on the other hand , there are so many road that building new one may not be possible one day . to illustrate the government may be increased the saling price of car and buying a new car may be difficult . i think this idea should support and the people should encourage to go somewhere with the government bus . moreover , going anywhere with the bus is cheaper than the fact that we go with . the population in turkey is also a factor of increasing the number of car . while a number of person is increasing , these crowded road and traffic problem will increase . to sum up , the government should provide the using of car to be decreased .
