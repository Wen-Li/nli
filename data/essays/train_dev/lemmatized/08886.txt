people who are in successful in their life , will try new thing to do and take risk in their job and find new thing to develop thier idea . this suggest that people who are successful in their field will try alot thing in their field , rather than doing what they already know how to do well in the perticular field . let u take an example : who is famous person in sport , who always win the 100mts distance . all the time and he will not try to participate in100mts but he will participate in 200mts track . thus he want to take risk rather than only participating the 100mts race , this is the way sucessful people try new thing and get succeded in their life . let u take an another example : who is a great scientist and he invented the thing which are helpful to the people , and inventing thing like that he will not keep quiet , he will try to invent another sort of thing which are helpfull to the people . a successfull person will not stop to invent new thing . rather he want to take chance to do thing . in any field , people who are successful in their life will take some sort of dare to do new thing . let u take about the business man who start with small capital , if he get profit in that business he will not stop to expand his business dealing , rather he will take risk while expanding his business and make new event to elaborate his dealing . finally , i agree with the people who are successful try new thing and take risk rather than only doing what they already know how to deal with in their respective field
