the car is one of the most important machine the man have created . human life have changed a lot since this machine , that at first wa exclusive but that now is consider a one of the most necesaries , wa invented . the car ha become one of the most important way of moving around . it is used for every type of trip : long trip , where it use is le common , or short one , that we ca not imagine doing without sitting at the wheal . new generation had become more dependent on car than old one . nowadays the city are not biuld for walking . the distance from one place to another are so big that noone can go walking from here to there without getting exahusted . the new type of city make the need for car greater : the job are usually allocated on the city , but the house are placed on the suburbus . for example in the state they are area for everything , nothing is mixed . with this what i mean is that the house are all together , then you have the moll area , then you have the area where the office are placed etcetera . some people will say that public transport could make or need for car lighter , but the truth is that it doe not work . people drive car because they have concrete need that they need to fullfil . for example there is never the same bus that take you to the grocery store , the school where your kid study and your own house . it is simplily easy to drive your car wherever you need to . this are some of the reason of why i belive that in twenty year ther will be more car in use than there are today , beacause a the time go by the need becomes greater .
