i agree with the statement , which said it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subject than to sepcialized in one specific subject . having a varity of knowledge is much better than studying one major . as a student i have made a plan to apply this rule or what stated . this plan are based on what i think and my personal openin . my theiory , is people and specailly student have to study what major they liked . as a student , i am trying to study arts and designs but in the same way i would like studying economic and bussiness . studying art , is the first step for my plan . after i take my master in arts , i will heading in studying bussiness . these are not my main goal to a chieve . my main goal is builting and running a company which specailized in cartoon so by studig these tow major , i 'll be able to have some sense of art , in addition , i can run my own bussiness . i think if every person should study what he like , he will be satisfied in two way . one way , he will be pleased that he is parcticing what he like and he will not feel bored , which is the major cause of lack at work . moreover , he will not give in something that he do n't like a if he in something that he acutally love doing it . seconed way of satisfaction , that what i observed that people who are doing what they love are succeccfull . the main thing i recommend people who are inttending to study more than one major is to study what they love . because not all of people have the potentail to study a diffirent major . in the moment i consider myself a person who hane all the potentail to study a veraiies major .
