i disagree with the statement that young people enjoy life more than older people do . this is because although young people usually have a healthier state than old one , this doe n't mean that this is the only factor that control a person 's enjoyment of life . i believe that each of these two category - young and old people - have their own way of enjoying life . for instance , despite the fact that old people ca n't do some type of enjoyment that the youngster can do - such a hanging out , and playing some type of sport - however , they also have a wide range of enjoyable activity that they can perform . the type of activity that older people can do to enjoy life often depends on the age category they belong to . for example people at the age of sixty or above often enjoy their life after retirement by buying themselves house in quiet and calm area , where they can enjoy the free time they have by relaxing . they can also spend their time in gardening , playing with their grandchild and taking care of them , or discussing any subject in life . they also have their type of sport that help them relax such a golf . on the other hand , people at younger age - from forty to sixty - often enjoy their life by making trip around the world to place they have n't visited when they were young . this type of enjoyment , and other `` time consuming '' activity , are usually not available for young people because they often do n't have enough time to do it . this is due to the reason that young people usually spend most of their time in their study , doing homework , and writing paper . i again emphasize the idea that each ha his/her own type of enjoyment , and that he/she probably wo n't enjoy doing what other people in other age category do .
