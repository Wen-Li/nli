i partially agree with this statement if we talk about the young people living in the developed country , say , taiwan . as i see it , young people in today 's society like technology more than people . thus they may not pay enough attention to their own community . but on the other hand , young people nowadays have more opportunity to help other people , because we lead a richer and knowlegeable life than before . we can say that young people born after 1985 are the generation of information technology . they 've got familiar with usaing computer since they were very little , even at the age of 3 or 4 . growing up in this kind of background , they seem rather to pay more and more attention to `` machine '' such a person computer mp3 player and game player than to people . in other word , they may spend much more time getting along with these device of high technology instead of other people , including their community . yet young people , who have grown up in such condition , have more opportunity to help their community . why ? by using their outstanding computer skill , they can help their community do a variety of thing . for example , they can teach elder people how to use computer and surf the internet . the thing like that is very simple for young people yet is quite meaningful for older people who can not use such technology device . connecting with the world through computer , and these older people 's life will change a lot . in my neiborhood , there is a young people liking to teach older people in my community . he said , `` by doing so make his life more meaningful , and he is very happy to use the computer skill to help people . it 's easier for him to do so
