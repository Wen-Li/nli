i hardly remember any incident when some young elder member of my community ha offered to help me in any way . the growing globalisation and ever-increasing competetion see to it that evryone becomes self-celtred and work for one 's own gain , thus significantly reducing any chance of social service or social commitment . i totally agree that the youth today are not sparing sufficient time helping their community . increasing competition , decline in the moral and ethical standard , uncontrollable desire , advancement of technology have been depriving today 's youth to even think about helping their community . if we check out any field , be it academic or non-academic , we see that there is an increasing competetion . so , to survive in the world of competetion and to retain his place in this very tough world , the young man of today is driven to focus on his career aspect and to continuously spend huge amount of time bettering his prospect for a better future . moreover , we constantly see a continual decline in the moral and ethical standard in any community . and the people who are more into degraded moral and ethic are the youth . this degradation of moral value leaf them so hollow that they can hardly think about their community , let alone helping them . this moral degradation can be seen quite predominantly in any part of the world today . someone rightly said `` man is driven by desire '' . the `` desires '' of today 's youth have become so intense and so uncontrollable that they can hardly resist these desire , and moreover they are being driven by the not-so-good desire . desire to advance positively is always conducive to one 's personality , but desiring for `` illegitimate '' thing ha been having a lethal effect on the individual personality . so , this deprives him of the need to think about others in the community and even help them . with newer and newer technology arriving in this world , the youth are engaging themselves in taking pleasure in these technology . for example , with newer and newer video game in the market , the youth are driven to purchase them and spend most of their time playing video game . this culture of playing video game is stealing away so much time that the individual hardly realises it . moreover , this particular activity is eating up most of the available free time so that an individual can hardly think about helping his community . so , keeping all these factor in mind , i totally concur with the statement that today 's youth is not giving adequate time helping their community .
