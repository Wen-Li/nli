taking risk and trying new thing is an important ability in many job nowadays . if people had not taken a certain risk , many business idea would never have come on the market for example . thus a risk often bear an opportunity . on the other hand , new business might also fail and leave their owner highly indebted , which mean a sudden crash into poverty that often ha effect on a person 's self-esteem . in that way risk bear both opportunity and the possibility to destroy everything that ha already been achieved . the question is , however , if people who do not take any risk are in total more , le or equally successful a those who do . i guess that the only job where fleeing responsibility and not taking certain risk doe not limit career option is a a state employee , for example a a teacher in germany . when people can not be fired , they actually do not have much of a risk in their job . still , i have made the experience that teacher who try something new are often preferred by student . so trying somthing new is a good thing even in their job . i consider it to be very important to try new thing anyway , and a in the example of the teacher , not everything new bear a risk . in any other case , i suppose it is important to make a decision by comparing the size of the risk and the benefit it might have . a high risk for a little success is in my opinion not worth striving for . if it is the other way round , however : why not ? because concluding i think : those who do take risk and try new thing really are more successful .
