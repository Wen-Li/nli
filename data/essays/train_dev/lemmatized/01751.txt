as unfortunate a it may sound , there is no doubt that it is true . `` young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their community , '' but why is that ? what ha changed in the principle and moral being preached to adolescent over the last decade or more ? in reality nothing ha changed , except for today 's previously unseen rapid adancement and development in the technology sector of society creating a world of technocratic country . young people are really the victim of this technology-centered lifestyle , because they are the primary consumer of video game , computer , and listening device . engulfed in their own world of entertainment , teenager do n't care anymore about the slum and the sub-standard education that many of their country 's citizen are experiencing . today , what 's constantly on a teenager 's mind is whether or not his parent are going to buy him a playstation for his or her birthday and not what he or she can do to help society . therefore , high-tech advertisement ha created a highly capitalist consumer culture , which doe not allow for adolescent time to think about their surroundings or world issue . in regard to advertisement , television is it best and most common mean of transfer . television a neil postman ha said , is gradually corroding our once highly regarded societal value . the discourse of television is quick and entertaining , introducing you to the world 's problem in an entertained manner and thereby rendering them a far away dilemma with no conern what so ever to the person watching . for example , a person might watch a news reel describing the high amount of toxic fume in his or her area , but they would'nt do anything about it , because the advertisement following the alleged seriousness of the news cast put infront of it audience a brand new xbox . now the concern of the teenager is to find way that could get him or her that xbox . what happened to the toxic fume story ; it just becomes something he or she heard . technoloogy is quickly eliminating the importance of family and societal value . as a result of globalization it is practically impossible now to hault the growing self-centerdness that is characterizing more child . children are growing up and all they see around them is fun and entertainment , even when one ha the urge to turn serious and turn on the news cast all he or she encounter is another form of entertainment . therefore , with entertainment so easily accessable , then it would make sense that teenager or `` young people '' would become engulfed in a bubble world of their own , where the problem of society are nonexistant to them .
