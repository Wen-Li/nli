the lack of social commitment among young ha been a common perception since always . it is very common to listen on medium or simply when old people are chatting , that yougsters don-t participate or that they are not interested on the community problem . however , i disagree completely with this opinion , not only because i think that it is only a prejudice , but also because from my own experience i can state the oposite . on one hand , the base in with the opinion that yougnsters don-t give enough time to helping their community lay is the comparison with the behaviour of older people nowadays and in the past , when they were young . in the first case , it seems to me that there is no data to support any different behaviour between the different generation . in my opinion , what creates this perception is the recall or past day , which never is accurate . in the second case , i think that the great demonstration that happened during the 60 and 70 related with the war that took place and the stress between the eastern and western block help in a large extent to magnificy the false impression that youngster used to be more commited . on the other hand , i can say from my own experience that young people dedicate time to helping their community . i collaborate a a volunteer in a local ong and there , the great majority of the volunteer are a young a me or even younger . but young people are also commited with their community in many other way that perhaps are no so visible a struggle in demonstration . i have friend who form part of political party and who are very active in any action that is carried out into the community . in conclusion , young people is a commited with their community a they used to be . the reason why it is believed that their commitment ha changed is that the way of participating helping the community are le visible , a can be an ong .
