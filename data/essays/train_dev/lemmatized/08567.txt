i disagree with the statement , in order for a student to learn something and benefit from it in the future he need to learn fact because fact are based on thing happened in reality so when a student get to learn from a fact he will be able to face each negative point of the subject . first , learning fact especially from history and literature men like shakespeare , roald john , etc. will help the student to learn and be foretasted about the subject than just giving him what shakespeare wrote and requesting him to memorize . understanding idea and concept make the student to hate the subject because he feel that he must understand and memorize so for him it a long process while learning fact is more helpful because it a study of reality that happened once in life to simulataneous people . second , a importance absolutely it is more important to learn fact because student have to know and feel about others who suffered previously before them and how were they able to reach their goal . this way of learning will encourage student to know about these fact and also be able to learn them to their friend and other people . furthermore , some people may disagree the idea of learning fact and prefer understanding concept while they dont think how will the student be able to understand all idea because most idea are unreal and many student hate to learn fake thing such a science fiction , terror story and so on . third , another popular reason is that most of our education place follow the rule of understanding than learning fact , i dont think student are more realiable to this process maybe if they try to learning process the educatinal zone would find a good reaction from the student . in conclusion , i advice all student so tha they enjoy educating themselves to learn fact , any given fact that would feed them in the future for them a individual and to others a acknowledged student .
