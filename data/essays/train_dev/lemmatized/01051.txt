some people want to try new thing while other prefer to do the same that they knew all over their life . i agree with the statement which say that successful people try to do new thing even take risk rathre trying known thing . i agree becuse of severals resons . the frist reson is that successful people shoud try to do new thing otherwase they will not bring new thing . for example , the neoten is well - known and pioneeir in this feild . he looked to the apple which fall down from the tree a other but he looked to this case different from other and asked himself why did it fall . as a result , he interdouced a new law of movement . secondly , successful people take risk to do something new . forthat , although they will not get benefit of all thing , they can success in something new . thirdly , successful people try to do new thing with sometime high risk rathre trying known thing . becuse of high risk they can get high benefit and this according to the statment which say high risk give sometime high rate . this statement which is high risk give sometime high rate is mainly used in marking . becuse of doing new thing and taking risk i agree with successful people try to do new thing even take risk rathre trying known thing .
