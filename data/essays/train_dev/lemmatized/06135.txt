in korea , student who are before entering a university should memorize most of evrrything to prepare the test of university . why should hey do memorize everything ? i think understanding those and experiance are more important than just learnig . there are some reason . first of all , if student just memorize idea and comcepts fot theit goal such a entering a university , getting a job , and graduation , will they remember it long time ? i think the answer is `` no '' . because thier ultimate goal are not learnig and understanding for themselves . thus , they just have studied to enter a university and if they enter a university , they will forget it eaily because they got thier goal yet . second , if student do n't understand idea and concept , those will be furtile . it is because although they study those , they did n't try to understand idea . if they did n't understand , will they use the knowleadge ? and then can we call that is `` knowleadge '' ? the learnig that is not be understanded is just waste . i think rather that not to know those better than it . finally , in korea , there are a few exentric school now . those are same other school to learn . however , the style of study is different . it is that their lesson are focused by understanding study . so , sometimes they go out to learn in class time . they experiance and understand everything so accumulate those . as a result , the student of the school enter a university easier than ordinary school . this tell u that understand is more impr in conclusion , if student try to understand idea and concept , actually they should spend time long . however , the effort of them will appear clrealy and develop themselves more .
