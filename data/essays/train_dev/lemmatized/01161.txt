systems that academy adopts are much differents . some academy give a broad knowledge of many academic subject , and many academy give a specialize in specific subject . two different way to interpreter the wide range of teaching . in the first one you have a knowledge of many subject , but it could be a general preparation doe not give you the right preparation of what you are studing for . in the second one , about the academy that prefers specialize the student in one specific subject , the risk is that they give to the society people who are able to work only in their specific subject . for example the ingeneers are very good in their topic , their work could only be realised from theirself because is much difficult and it requires a particular preparation , but when you ask them to talk about art , or literature , or perhaps hystory they are not so good a in their specific subject . so i think that it could be better to prepare the student about many subject , but there is some subject that must be specialize . some academy divide the course . for the first three year you reach a general preparation , and in the last two year you wil reach a specific preaparation . that is the case of myself . i am studying architecture in milan . here we have two kind of degree . the first level degree and the second level degree . the first level is long three year and you became a junior architect with many academic subject . the second level is long two year and give you a specific subject preparation . finally i think that the method adopted in my academy is may be one of the newest but it give me the better preparation .
