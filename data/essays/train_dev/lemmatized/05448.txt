some people think that young people enjoy life more than older people do . however , i disagree with the previous statement that the younger one enjoy life more than older people . there are several reason for holding this opinion . first , younger people are always busy with their study and schedule because of competition among them . this hectic life might be painstaking and arduous job for younger one when compared to the older one a they are settled and no tension are around them . they relax themselves playing with their kid , gardening , which soothes their mind . second , younger people need to go to their respective job for their servival . but the old people already struggled with their job , and earned sufficient money for their rest of life . so , they do n't need to worry about job . as someone stated that enjoying life is nothing but doing the thing which soothes our mind and body . for instance , a retired police officer may not enjoy his / her younger day a he/she is busy with his / her duty a it is impossible to meet his family and friend . however , after retiring she/he can enjoy her/his remaining life . finally , younger one do n't have matured intelligence and the do n't know the importance of enjoying life . they think that enjoying life is nothing but having bad habit such a drinking . but , the older people enjoy life with their family and friend , which is the best . even the younger one do n't know how to enjoy life and the meaning of their life . in sum up , i feel that older people enjoy their life than younger people do a they dont have much time , need to go to their job and they dont have matured intelligence .
