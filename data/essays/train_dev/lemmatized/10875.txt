the major aim of young people of this century is following the popular trend . they do not know anything about politics and recent development in science . they follow the concert of madonna instead of following technological development . the youth is careless about their community . besides , they see their friend who have concern about the community a antisocial . i do not know many young people caring about their community . in fact , most of them do not have any idea about their community . they only care about computer game , partner that they meet by internet and the latest trend around the world . in other word , they are not interested in anything important like how they can help their community . they think that they do not have any responsibility for their community . for instance , paris hilton who is known by almost all young people doe not have any idea about who is the president of england . she is also young and she is a role model for youth with such a little knowledge . i have to state that there are some people who concern about their community in the set of young people . however they are not seen a role model . instead , they are the most antisocial group according to young people who do not have any concern about future of their community . they think that you are a creature coming from space when you want to talk about important issue such a politics or problem of the community . i believe that the young should also follow important issue in addition to famous trend . nowadays young people do not give not only enough time but also no time in order to help their community . they do not have any concern about future . also , they see young who want to help comminity a asocial . all nation should take some measure about these problem . otherwise i can not imagine the world with country that have president chosen from these careless young .
