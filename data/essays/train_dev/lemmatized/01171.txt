nowadays people use car for transportation so much . but this make the rush traffic and stress in our life day by day . we have to find solution to solve this traffic problem such a public transportation , airway and underground transportation . this solution such cause the car will be more le than there are today . first of all , in twenty year people want to avoid from the traffic problem . in fact , they dont want to be a part of a rush traffic because of not willing to be stressful . because of this they want to use public transportation such a bus , train , metro , ship for transporting . so this will help them to avoid traffic and spare more time in their life . secondly the airway will cause the decrease in the number of car in twenty year . in the future depending on a technological investment people will use airway instead of car . because the airway provide u to transport more quickly than car from one city to another city , also , from one continent to another continent . the other effect of airway in decrasing the number of car are safety and comfortable travelling . people will want to safer and more comfortable travelling in twenty year , so that , aircraft will provide them to the people . the third reason of decrasing in the number of car will be the underground transportation . airways are the fastest and the most comfortable way to transportation , however people can not use this type of transportation everytime . for example , when people need to travel in short distance they can only use helicopter a an airway which can be so expensive in short travel distance . but in this situation people will not need car and public transportation also when they want to travel more quickly . i think in twenty year they will use underground transportation for short distance travelling . in contrast of using car underground transportation provide them more quickly and safer transportation . in conclusion the car number decrease because of these three reason .
