there are lot of perspective and opinion about the number of car in use in the future . some people think that we will have plenty of car a the day are going by , however , i definitely think that we have fewer car in our future than today . i 'd like to represent my argument based on the three following reason : the shortage of fuel , the mass transportation , and restriction . first of all , we are going to face the shortage of fuel . as we know , car definitely rely on fossil fuel such a oil and gas . without fuel , no car can be moved and worked . current and future situation related to the shortage of fuel will lead u to hesitate to buy and produce new car . furthermore , development in our science allows lot of country to build well-developed mass transportation such a subway and express train and convienent bus system . increasingly , people will prefer to utilize mass transportation rather than to drive their own car when shopping , going to work , and travelling . developed system in mass trasnsportation will casuse a revolutionary commuting habit to city dweller . lastly , we are expecting governmental restictions on using car in near future . currently in my home country , car driver have to pay high tax and fee for causing trafffic jam and environmental burden . environemntalists strongly suggest that car producer and car purchaser have to pay more money for using car . in addition , many people agree to the idea because they want to take clean air in . government ha no choice but impose more fee and tax for using car , and will create various way to prohibit car owner from using car . in short , i absolutely believe that we will have fewer car on the road in near future based on the above-mentioned reason . shortage of fuel and governmental restriction will make driver hesitate and at the same time , they will choose to take mass transportation .
