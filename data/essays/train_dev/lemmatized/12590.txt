i 'm agree with this statement because in the future there would be new type of transportation . i also think this because the the oil someday will finish , and the oil will be only for the rich . but let me explain my reason point by point . the first point and the main one for me , is that car are not very safety , even nowadays with the new intelligent car . only in my country there are 45.000 death each year . this is a big number of death , so thats why i think there are a lot of people working in new type of transportation . and i imagine you asking your self why doe this guy know that information , i know this information because in spain many family suffer the consecuences of this type of accident . another important point is that the oil someday will finish , but i think we do n't have to wait until that day , i say this because in europe the price of the oil is very very expensive , many people ca n't pay it . as i read the other day in a prestigious newspaper there are a lot of company working in alternative type of oil . this is something that i do n't know too much , so let keep it for the scientist . finally i wanna express my conclusion , and it 's that one of the gratest invention of the human bean in a few year will finish . i do n't want to look like a dramatic person but the only thing that car give u are problem , for example many people suffer stress because the traffic jam . but on the other hand car also help u now the trip are more shorter than before , but this is only a little advantege . there are more disadvanteges .
