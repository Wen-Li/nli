i disagree with the statement that `` young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their community '' . firstly , we have a large number of charity where we there are considerable number of youth who are helping the need . we can also see the case where youngster are ready to give a part of their hard earned money to help the diseased , needy , etc. , this all help is in order to improve the poor and get their need for their survival . secondly , effective ruling of the government is needed for the better making of the community . the government is voted to power by the people . the large percentage of voter is the youth a given by stastical report given the different country . if this stastical report are true then how can we deny that young people are not helping for their community . thirdly , now-a-days also we find that all the youngster have a common meeting place during the festival . for example , chrismas the younsters will given holiday starting a month before . on the day of the chrismas all will have prayer , party etc. , thus , letting their childern know about the tradition . fourthly , we observe that the young people are taking up the responsibility of helping the aged and old . for example , once i have seen a old person falling on the road because of some health problem . a lot number of young people who were storng enough took him to ho thus , by above all the point it is clear that inspite of having strenuous work in their day to day life , the youngster are doing a lot of thing in order to improve and help their society .
