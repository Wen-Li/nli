the issue of whether young people these day , give enough time to helping their community or not , is an issue that ha been debated on extensively over the last few year . i personally dont agree with the statement a i feel that young people still play their part in helping their community . the issue come up again and again because people just take the action of these young people to heart without actually understanding the situation they face and seeing how thing have changed for these young people over the year . first , i have always noticed that it take a thousand good deed to be appreciated and just one bad deed to be cursed . very often the action of one person are taken a the trait of a group of people without actually knowing what these other individual are like . a few bad example have helped promote the idea that the young people nowdays dont care . secondly , a lot ha changed in the life of young people . the world is a great deal more competitive today than it wa ten year earlier . everything from an education to an occupation demand much more . time can not be taken for granted anymore and young people find themselves more and more time bound everyday . i dont think this aspect is completely understood . yet you see these young people doing the best they can to help their community . a simple example of this is how at the time of someone death everyone is there to lend a helping hand to the family which ha suffered the loss , and at such occassions if you try to think about it it usual the young people who run around to help all the time . moreover , there are so many young people who have dedicated almost all their time to sever and help their community . there so many young people either involved with or running ngo 's or organisation which deal with serious issue like education or ample food and shelter for their community . these people have devoted all their time and energy for the betterment of their community . in the end i would just like to say that , there might never be a common agreement on this subject , but i firmly feel that the young people are doing their part . i guess all we really need to do is open our eye and see the bigger picture and i have feeling that the result , like me , might not support the statement either .
