it is said that `` knowledge is power '' . but i believe that knowledge is power if it is used in an efficient way . we acquire knowledge on different subject around u . but most of u get interested in a particular subject and try to learn more about that . i prefer to say that it is better to have broad knowledge on many subject than to specialize in one specific subject . i feel so because with broad knowledge of many subject we can become multiskilled . having broad knowledge of many subject is always helpful . every science we deal is related to other science . even the technology that are getting developed now a day are also demanding knowledge of other subject to cope with the situation . for example an electronics student need to have knowledge of computer , to analyze and make his work easy on chip design . the world around u is made of many thing which are related to physic , biology , mathematics and many other subject . if we focus on a particular subject and leave others it will be difficult for u when we may suddenly have to face a situation that need knowledge of other subject other than our subject of specialization . for example one of my friend specialized in botany , he doesnot know anything about electricity . he once kept his hand in bucket of water in which a heating water coil wa placed and when power wa passing . he got a sudden shock because of that and he took two day to recover from that experience . when i asked him about this , he wa saying he wa not aware of the fact that he will get shock if he place his hand in bucket containing water heater . he is very good at botany , but this didnot help him out , to face the situation that dealt with electricity . finally considering all these issue and example , i prefer to say broad knowledge of subject is needed . ofcourse specialization in particular subject give u a proper career , make u learn deeply and have good knowledge of that subjectbut broad knowledge of subject help u to live in the society comfortably which is even more important .
