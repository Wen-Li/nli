i am 22 year old now , that mean i should be included to the `` young people '' used in the statement . that make me think how my life is going . i ask this question to myself . and my answer is to agree with the statement . i think young people , including me , do not or can not give enough time to helping their community . i will show my point in the following . the question asks using `` young people nowadays '' in the statement , therefore , i should compare the young people in the old time with of them in nowadays particulary in the stiation of their family . i study in the university 4 time a week and i work at the restrant in nearby 3 time a week constantly . moreover , i study english for the graduate school everyday . that show that i can not have enough time to helping my family because i am too busy to do it . but tipically in japan , woman did not go to university to help their family and to learn how to be a a housewife . the enviroment that both young poeple in old time and nowadays ha changed . it became giving chance to woman to do what they want , on the other hand woman became much more busy and lost enough time to help own family . i think there should be enough time for young people to helping their community , though it seems difficult for me . to make it possible , not only young people but also all of the member of the community have to help each other .
