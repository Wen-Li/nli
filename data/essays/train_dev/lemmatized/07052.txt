in my opinion i think it is better to have a broad knowledge of many academic subject instead ofspecializing in one specific subject . i believe it is not so easy to specialize jonly in one thing because there will be always something you will not be able to know . suppose you are a person who ha been always interested in one thing during his life : people would expect him to have always the right answer at the right time . but what happens if the person doe not know the answer ? people will be disappointed and will consider the person not so well prepared a they thoughtbecause is not even able to answer to what he ha to know . several often it is easier to criticise instead of asking ourselves why the `` specialist '' could not answer the question . it is also important to consider that the specialist will be disappointed too because he could not demostrate he is a real specialist . he may start doubting about himself and he maybe give up about what he is doing . in order to avoid this embarassing situation , you may prefer to have a broad knowledge about several and different subject . i think there are two reason for it . first of all , you can improve your cultural background and you will always be able to understand most of the topic people may discus . the other thing is that people will come to you asking some help . if you can help them , you will impress them and they will realize you are a person with a good education ; if you can not help them , they will understand you because they know you are not a specialist and you are not supposed to know everything .
