well , i dont think so because old people tend to be more setteldown than young one . because the young one have to start their why from the beging for example they have to make money to live and buy a house and find a partner so they can buld up a family . all this is a really hassel . while aldey people have found thir life and worked har and by that time offcourse they have made alot off many to buy a nice hosue , and they maybe dont have find work , espacially it is not essy to find job these day , and everything is expensive not like it use to be for the older people , also the real estate ha gown up which made it difficult for youn one to buy a house this is also wa advantage for older people . older people use to have more kid , inorder to build up their family while youn one cant have many there day , because not everone can offored to raise their kid . partner , it becomes so difficult to find a nice husband or wife to live with for the rest of your life , older people already naws who is going to stay with for the rest of his or her life , young one do not seems to take it easy or be more understandable these day . well , eveything seems to be the oppisate for both of old and young , but it a fact and we have to excapt it . because at the end this is our way of living , and it might chasnge to the better or to worse . in conclousin , i belive in evry old or young heart thir would still be a nice memory
