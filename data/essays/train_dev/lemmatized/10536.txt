the role of a student is learn a much a possible from olders idea to create is own one . then he need to relate that idea with an older idea to learn it . but to do that is important understand the concept that gave origin to that idea . because the idea is based in concept that are observed due to an especific situation . for example if we want to create a research project we motivate our study due to the knowledge that we obtain from book or past research . but the idea that wa create due to that knowledge are base in similaritites that we observed or some fact that are present in the area of interest . so , for that reason i think an student need to learn but more important is understand the fact that form those concept but mo for that reason i disagree with the statement presented here .
