nowadays car are the most common transportaion vechiles for human race . the reason for this fact are firstly car are individualstic so you can use whenever you want . secondly it can be faster than public transportation . finally and absolutely car are much more comfortable than any other vechiles . but what are going to happen to car in future ? i think in future the car will be use le often than today . there are too many reason for this opinion . for example in my country the number of car are increasing but the road ca n't be enough for this much car and the driver are exhausted about traffic jam so they start to think about getting rid of their car and using public transport . furthermore i think the biggest problem is gasoline prize . they are getting higher and higher so one day we might not be afford to buy any . these are the socio-economic disadvantage of using car . also there are different possibility to make car le important and le usable . technology is growing so fast and scientsit can make faster train , faster plane and the station and airport are becoming more comfortable place and the ticket for more comfortable transportation are n't a high a they were before . by this way using plane is n't a luxury anymore . furthemore technology might make a flying car like in science-fiction movie . i think this is n't a waiting for too much because 40 year ago automatically openning door were utopia in book or movie but they are real and common now . so maybe someday we will travel by flying on ourselves not in plane . in conclusion by the developing of technology and the socio-economis difficulty of having car make u to find alternative way to transport . even now car are very popular that doe n't mean that it will go on like that . new discovery will make car unpopular but this will take long time .
