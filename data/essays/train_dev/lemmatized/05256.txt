i agree with the statement , it is a need to take risk in life to be successful , if you stay in your confort zone you will never improve and grow to become a successful person . we are all born with no knolege , we do n't event know how to walk , that is one of thefirst chalenges we face in life , to lear a new thing . if we were to start life staying safe and not exploring we would not even know how to walk . later in life we have to push our self to go to school and become part of a class , and keep trying new thing like reading writing , improving and getting smarter . by the time we take that first job we have already done alot of thing out of that confort zone , new thing , and there is people that in that point of there life are confortable with were they are . in my oppinion you have to keep going . trying to inovate , change and grow , learning new skill that can make you successfull in what you really want to do . becoming seccessful mean something different for every body , to me a successful person is one that know what is looking to get from life , and is not afraid to try new thing in order to do what make them happy . i thing everybody shoul take the risk of doing new thing in order to become succesful and happy people . the last time a took risk doing something a did not know how to do well wa learning to surf . now is one of the thing i like the best in my life and i can not picture my self living in california not doing surf . taking risk pay off .
