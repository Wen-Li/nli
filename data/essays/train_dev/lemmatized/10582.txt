i agree with the point that `` better to have broad knowledge of many academic subject rather than going for a specialization in one specific subject '' . i support this point because we can learn many application by having many subject in academic . the main reason is by learning more subject we can interpret them and can apply the knowledge one through another . for example if we have to work on a project like developing a machine . we have to about the strength it will withstand , to know this we have to work for stress that apply on the part of the machine . but it is difficult to find manually , because first designing the machine the load that with stand on the machine , etc . now day that we have simulation software that can work by producing a model in that . for this we need a computer knowledge and how to work on the software . and then how to design the model , load , etc . for all these we need different subject like , for working with computer we have to computer knowledge , for working to design we need to know the drawing , for finding the load we have to the mechanis of material , then to solve we need mathematics , and then for assembling we have to learn how to assemble the part . by seeming all these for one thing we have to work on for different subject . we need to apply all the skill in on project . after learning basic in all subject then we can go for a specialized one because we work for a perticular model . so i prefer to have knowledge of many academic subject in order to have a specislized subject , because if we know all the subject we need not go for some other specialist we can apply all those .
