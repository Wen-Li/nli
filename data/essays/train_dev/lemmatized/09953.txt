i can not agree with this statement for the following reason . first , the need for community action should be assessed taking into account the evolution of society in general . for instance , a few decade ago , providing ressources to older people wa a major part of community action . nowadays , older people have le need for this kind of material support ( development of pension plan in the ` 50 and 60 ' ) . they tend to be more independent then in the past . older people are more in need of social contact and activity . i believe young people do their best to respond to these need . second , the concept of community investment ha changed . in the past , community action wa viewed a some kind of obligation . people were helping the community only , or mainly , because of the moral pressure to do so . nowadays , of course the moral aspect of community action still exist , but it is not the main motive for people to get involved into such action . community investment ha developped a an activity of it own , more like a social activity or a hobby . a good example of the way young people approach community action nowadays would be the project developped on the campus of the university of louvain , where i studied : student would group themselves around a particular community action and live together in a flat . the help provided by these organization typically include help to people with disability , amnesty international support , providing free basic legal advice etc . students involved in these project basically spend most of the academic year to make sure the project is efficient and achieves it goal . but they never see it a some burden . as a conclusionm i would say that young people do spend a great part of their time in helpimg their community , but that the need for help and the concept of help ha changed .
