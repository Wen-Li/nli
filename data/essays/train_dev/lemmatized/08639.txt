i 'm not quite agree with that the travel would be the best when it ha tour guide . but it is such a good idea to be with a group . and that guide lead you to know wonderful site that the guide know them better than the tourist . i would prefer have group guide if i have know idea about the country that i 'm visiting . i will discus that difference in detail supported by example . traveling is something nice and let you discover many thing that you do n't know before . first , to discover the site that you visit you must have a guide because you have any idea about it at natural . you might be see this site by the internet or a catalog . in this case , the leader of the group will show all the site that you came for them . second , the leader will give you a coplete idea about the city that you are visiting . for example , you might visit such a country that ha historical site and some these site 's inhabitant home or their ancestor 's home . and the leader ha plenty background about the history aspect of this country the tourist might want to know from him . in the other hand , i a a tourist i might use the tour guide for just some trip or some site in particular . for example , i can not use the tour guide when i want to visit a country that i have an idea about it . also i will not use the tour guide if i 'm going to visit safe country or small country which i can go around the country veery easily . many case that the tour guide must be with you . for example , if you are traveling with senior people or very old people . the tour guide would make it easier to move from site to site for the old people .
