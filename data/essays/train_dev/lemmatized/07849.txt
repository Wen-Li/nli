in my opinion , it is more important for u student to understand idea and concept we are taught . everybody is able to learn but we will see in this essay why understanding make the difference and what are the advantage coming along with that study method . i consider understanding a the masterkey of learning , i have many example to support this idea such a the following one : when i wa fourteen , i use to take biology class and my big brother use to help me before my exam . depending on the topic he wa explaining to me how a part of the human body would work . i remember it would take him 10 to 15 min to explain the functionning and to describe what wa in question . i did not even need to study or do anything else to remember everything and i wa then even able to explain the topic to my classmate and get the best grade . it wa a easy a understanding . on the other hand learning take time , and if we think about my previous example we can easily understand that if you do not understand what you read it is going to take you ten time the time to learn the subject you are studying . in addition , what is the point to learn concept if you do not understand how they work ? we are not machine . the main point is the following one , you attend school to shape your mind and in order to shape your mind you read and hear about concept that very important researcher worked on and the main purpose is to understand how they worked to build their theory . to conclude , it is quite obvious that understanding is the most intelligent way to study . it is the best method to shape your mind and get the best result . understanding is also a good method for lazy student .
