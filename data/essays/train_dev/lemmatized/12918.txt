personnally , i think that successful people must to try new thing and take some riskes . first at all , those people have the chance of being qualified on this specified task , a the adjective `` successful '' is given to those people , they have a particular success on life and in everything they are working on ; with their skill they are able to help others and then communicate their knowledge . to illustrate this , i can take a specific example ; for a scientist whose study are based on the biological research , we can imagine that he could know very well how the processus of a clonation work or how to study the consequence of evolution throughout time on the environnement , but what happens if this person take the decision of making some research about new illness that had developped on some poor country ? or to study the consequence of chimical product origined by the industrialization on people ? presonnally i think that this person must to take that risk and developp a much a possible his skill , we are talking about a successful person , somebody who is good when he make good resolution , this person will be able to manage this new risk , and then be helpful to other people . i think that people are not robot that can just stay doing the same thing over and over again , they must to discover every single detail of their potential and share it with humanity . risk had been created to be taken , the human being is always looking for discovery and to experience new thing .
