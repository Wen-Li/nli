i reckon this statement ha to be regarded in a more dimensional way . on the one hand , i agree that learning fact is significant but on the other hand , only understanding idea and concept allows student to really move something . learning fact , a deductive method , is according to my view an important basic to invent something , do research or work on new programme for the governement or society in general . to illustrate my thesis , i would like to explain how my father work . my father doe research concerning synapes , the junction between neuron . together with his student research group at the university in munic , he reflected all the known fact about neuron . that wa the basic for the research and experiment . after being aware of the way a signal is transfered from one cell to another , they started working on concept how the information transfer can be blocked . therefore , they employed poison like atropin which is responsible for rejecting specific neuron to pas a cell membran . with this illustration , i would like to emphasize the combination of knowing fact and discovering concept . another example which conveys my opinion very well is the political system . of course , a student can learn all the fact about the german democratic system , for example that it wa established after world war ii with the help of the americans , britains , french and ( former ) soviets etc etc but this is not necessary when he should think of new opportunity of citizen participation . facts are sometimes an important , essential basic or background but to be innovative and creative it must be guaranteed to have understood the gist of an idea or concept . drawing a conclusion , i would advice the student to learn fact and regard them a a measure of understanding sophisticated idea and concept without any problem .
