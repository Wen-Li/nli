i think it is more important understand idea and concept of the thing than learns only the fact , but i also think it is important that you learn real fact of the idea and the concept you have learned before . when you study something that is not obvious or immediatly rapportable at the real life , for example math , if you are a student , you 'll ask to yourself why are you learning it ; on the other hand , if you plan a little information program , you 'll know immediatly what are you doing and why . if a boy decide that he is n't interested much more on the why of the thing , he should have to learn only how something is done . this is the case of most of the physical job like seller or something else . otherwise , if you are interested on idea , you can learn a lot of thing . if you study properly something , you 'll discover that all in the wolrd , is strictly related , for example the same law that govern electricity , govern also the the water flooding . in spite of this , if you do n't learn any real fact , you might loose any capacity of use what you learned ; in fact i know a lot o people that are famous professor at university , that are n't able to take care of a flower , or they are not able to make most of the simplest house work . when i wa younger , i attended a technical school . there , i learn how to make an information program , how to build a little integrated circuit , and similar thing , but i did n't really understand what i wa doing . only when i came to the university , i discovered that the thing i wa doing were not a `` god present '' , but were something that came out from the law i did n't studied . finaly , i think if you want to become somebody , you 'll have to study the idea of the thing but you will also learn the fact .
