some people argue if it is a general truth that it 's more important for student to understand idea and concept than fact . but to be frank , i totally think the idea and concept is more important than the fact . here are numerous reason why i agree with this statement . understand the idea and concept is way more important than just learning the fact . both idea and concept are the two main element for student to understand what is going on and explain what is happening during their learning period . it is like havin a good background always make yourself more succesfull . for example , my best friend and i both doin well in the english class , but when we were testing on our toefl , he got lot higher mark than me . becuase he understnad the idea and concept . and i am n when student have a good understanding of idea and concept based on the subject they are doing . normally it help them to learn faster , and able to memorized it . most of the test question came from one simple idea or concept , teacher just make change to the question to make it look more tough . for those student who understand the basic idea or concept can easily answer the question . on the other hand , for those student that only understand the fact can easily be fool and not get the answer correct . to sum up all of the example above , i definatly agree understand idea and concept is more important than just lean the fact .
