what 's the goal of advertising ? selling , is n't it ? every punch-line , every jingle , every smiling girl or playful baby is used to sell u a product a a mean for obtaining satisfaction and , eventually , happiness . of course advertisement make product seem much better than they really are . but is it enhancing it quality they only thing they do ? or do they work our mind in a much more complex and wicked way ? we should n't ask ourselves if advertisments are the result of lie , because the answer is quite evident . we should ask ourselves how they affect u and how to deal with them . what publicity try to do is not making u believe that their product is the best in the market , we can verify their promise by going to a local store . what they really try to do is to sell u value and life-style along with the product . venezuelan beer comercials are the best example i can think of . their target is young people , so they take activity young people tipically do , like going to to beach or partying . then , they create a clever and delicate web of image , phrase and situation that work our mind into believing that consuming that beer will make u cooler , funnier and more outgoing . drinking beer make u into everything we 've always dreamed . the sexy lady who drive boy crazy , or the stud that hook up with ten girl on a single night . beer equal fun , like in a mathematical equation . of course , this process doe n't occur at a conscient level , it 's way more subtle . at the beginning we may not feel particularly atracted by the product , but after some party where the situation showed in the ad repeat themselves contantly - marketing genius make sure that they do - we are unwillingly drawn to it . we start drinking , we feel confident and then we become consumer . advertisements have achived their goal . the beer story is only a small fragment of the world of comercialization in the modern world . there are way of persuading people to consume that we ca n't even imagine . so , what should we do ? should we leave the city and assume an amish way of living ? should we deny civilization and return to a roussaunian state of nature ? i do n't think the answer must be that radical . it all lie in our capacity of being critical , of seeing the thin thread intended to manipulate u and deciding whether to accept them or not . luckily , we are provided of freedom and capacity of choice , therefore we 're not determined by the influence of publicity , no matter how hard marketing genius try . we must ask ourselves if we want to be comercial puppet or if we want to decide our vision of life and our social behaviour . both choice have their advantage and disadvantage , it up to u to decide who we want to be : the stud in the club or the outsider glaring full of contempt .
