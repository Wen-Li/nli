i personally agree with this statement and hope to justify my opinion by the following reason and example . firstly , the idea and concept are the origin of the fact . for example , if some one understand idea or concept then he can make a research and experiement . if this proved that this idea applies the real data then he can argued that it 's a fact . secondly , when we talk about fact , in effect we talk about constant thing . in other word , no one ha the encouragement to search in this fact `` the door is closed '' . but if he ha an idea he ha the freedom to extent it into another field . thirdly , the person who interested with idea and concept ha the ability of thinking more than the person who just keep some idea in his memory because the first one do n't know what is the end and he will contenuously try to find this idea . for example , when a profesor talk about nonotechnology , he always mention the idea micro-robot and the scholar who interested in this idea endeavor to use this idea to treat the cancer by some way . finally , specialization or majority of a student in some field or science need to idea , because if he want to write his thesis or project in this field must do some new but who can gain acadimic degree by discovering some fact , if this method of graduation will have a few profesor . butif you like to have this acadimic status you must interest in idea because they are the key of future and way to invention .
