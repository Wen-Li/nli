that is what i have in mind . actually most of the successful people must try new thing and take a risk rather than only doing what the already know how to do well . this is because if they did not do like that , they could not succeed . there are a lot of people who can do very well about something , if someone want to succeed , he/she ha to do something special just like the following statement . i will show a example about the statement ; about einstein . if my memory serf me right , he took lot of risk like earnig money to do something for invention , or studying himself instead of going to school . at that time , many people criticized him , but now everyone can know him and his invention , and admire him . as einstein did , if we try to succeed we can do . unless we do not try , we will fail . that is why i agree with the following statement . and the other is about me . i used to tend to do something easy . someday my parent aksed me `` do you want to study abroad ? '' so i said to them `` sure . it will be fantastic `` then they talked to me '' yes it will be . but will you be able to do ? it will have a lot of problem . '' i thinked about going to america . and i decided to go america . since that time , i do not have thedency that make me do something easy . it make me like this . as i told , if we want to succeed in our whole life , we must try . that is the only way to succeed . i mean we have a difficulty succeeding in something that we already know how to do well , because the thing that i know how to do veery well , another people knew it just like me . personally , the way to succeed is to try new thing and take risk . like einstein or the others who are successful people , they might take a risk . i can be sure about this . we can not succeed in our life without any trying or taking a risk
