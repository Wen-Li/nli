having a broader knowlege of a many subject is not a very good thing to achieve . a person who defines this will be called a `` jack of all trade and a master of none '' . i think being an expert in one specific field is a better choice . having a knowledege of too many subject at once will make a person feel undeducated since they have not gone into enough depth of anything in order to achieve a living out of it . also whatevr kind of work they do will be never be done to full perfection due to the gap in their knowledge . an example of that would be a normal mechanic doin odd job around my neighbourhood fixing television or computer or diswashers . when he fixed my television set once it proved to be fatal for it . instead of getting better , the picture quality worsened and therefore i had to send my television set to the professional company mechanic who specialized in engineering . after that my set started working and i do not have any more problem regarding it . in economics we have a specific term for people who have a broad knowlege of many subject , it is like a household-type society when all the people dab their hand in almost everything , `` a doer of all , but a master of none '' , this ha several problem like low efficency , due to nobody knowing to how to actually carry out a task with full efficiency , the rate at which good work is being done is very low and damage is more . on the other hand if people in a society are specialized in different area , it is called a specialized society . in a society like this , the efficiency level will be extremely high , and also the time taken to carry out task will be le . therefore this kind of society will generate more money through the high quality good and service they produce . this also prof the fact that being specialized in a particular field is a wise thing . if we leave the people to decide , will people prefer their housemaid stiching clothes for them or a specialized tailor . most probably people will opt for the tailor . people who choose the opposite will hemselves see the diffrence in quality of the stitchig of the clothes by the housemaid and the tailor . the tailor can only stitch and therefore he wll do his job with the most amount of sincerity and wil put in a lot of hard-work in that , since that is how he earns a living . whereas a housemaid also know to to cook and clean and therefore will not pay attention to the sitchin a much because he ha other mean of earning . as a conclusion i would like to say that people who specialize in an area or field of study will prosper in their life . being a jack of all trade may seem impressive but there are many drawback to it and people like them will never have advantage over specialized people in anything .
