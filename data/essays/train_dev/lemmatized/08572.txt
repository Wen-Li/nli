i have always been and still is an `` understanding '' kid . i could never learn the fact a `` such and such is such preiod . '' i had to think about it until i knew and understood the main reason why such and such is such and such . it wa a good habit of studying for when there were comprehensive question , i would find it easy to apply the thing i learned in to real-life setting . once understood , i would then be able to learn higher level knowledge on the same topic . things i tried to memorize a fact never semmed to sink-in and stay . it is because of my personal experience that i agree with the statement , `` it is important for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact '' . first , in present day life , you ca n't always learn fact and memorize it . in the past accepting and learning fact were the mean of education . however , now it is more important to understand the idea and concept . every now and then we here about the imp [ ortance of creativity . creativity come from understanding idea and concept and applying them to situation to make new thing , handle the hard problem in the situation , and make new idea . in present day life , you the ablitiy to understand is important especially to growing student . second , the `` fact '' are always changing . it wa a fact that the no man could ever reach the moon befora the space shuttle wa invented . it wa a `` fact '' that the earth wa the center of the universe couple centries ago . the `` fact '' change a people learn more and more about their surroundings . if the fact are learned without student actually understanding the concept , it would be hard for them to take in the new `` fact '' or understand why the fact ha changed . also , it would be impossible to have great scientist if all student belived that fact are fact and none of them will ever change becaus they learned it this way . last , it is a more effective way of studying . for student who have a limited amount of time to study 8 to12 subject time efficientcy is very important . by understanding a concept or idea the student can take in all the thing that are related to that subject . because of the reason stated above , i agrree with the statement , `` it is more important for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact '' .
