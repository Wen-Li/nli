as a student , i agree totally to this statement . it is more important to understand idea rather then memorising the fact because the final result of the two method are totaslly different . when you just memorize a text , a formula , or a date , it is very rare that a few week or month later you will remember it at all . this method can be useful only for test or oral exam , but totally useless if you want to remember that information for a long period of time . instead , when you understand an idea or concept , and then you study it , the result is totally different , because that notion will become part of you , part of your cultural baggage that will accompany for your entire life . although this can look obvious for most of the people , many still do n't understand it . this can be a problem if the person mentioned is somedy that is in tight contact with a student , like a teacher . i can say this thanks to my personal experience : a a student infact , i 'm in contact with a person that is the perfect example of what i 'm talking about , my math teacher . although she is an experienced teacher , she still is of the idea that student do n't need to understand totally what the exercise is about , and think that it is possible to do thing just by memorising formula , without knowing why those formula are like that and why we must use them . the result is that during the year people can do thing correctly , but the following year , nobody can remember anything . so i personally think that just memorising something ca n't help a student , if not for his or hers immidiate future . but the problem arrives when the student need the notion he ha learned during high school to be able to get into university and to understand thing once he is in . in conclusion , if you understand an idea , it is right for you to explain it to somebody else , especially if it is the teacher that wa n't able to explain it to you in the first place .
