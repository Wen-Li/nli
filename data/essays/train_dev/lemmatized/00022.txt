as older people always say : times are different now and the past wa always better . when you are a child , you are not afraid because everything is new in this world and your parent are there to support you . then , you grow up , you become a teenager and you think life is to live it and enjoy it , then you are an adult and your responsabilities increase , you have to forget about yourself and think about people around you , and when you are an old person you wish you had more time to do what you never did and always wanted to do , you wish you could have made more mistake to learn from them but . .. time is gone . young people enjoy their life going to the club , dancing , drinking : this is what they call `` having fun '' . older people go to the winery , listen to the music that brings old memory , they enjoy themselves on their own way . i think both generation younger and older people live their life the best way they can , they enjoy doing the activity they like and they consider are fun according to their belief and their philosophy in life . the difference lie on the risk they take . when you are young you feel no fear , you think there is only one life and you have to live it the fullest , you own your world . but , when you are older , you also know that only one life wa given to you , but your pholosophy , your perspective is different because you think since there is only one life to live , you have to appreciate it , take care of it and enjoy it loving and respecting yourself : risk are not the same in each stage of life . when you are young a risk can be skipping school and that would be very exciting , when you are older skipping class is not fun , it is being irresponsible . i do not think there is a list of activity to define whether or not someone enjoys life , i think it depends on each one and the way you were raised . the gift of life wa given to u and we can enjoy it the way we want a long a we do not affect other people 's belief and life .
