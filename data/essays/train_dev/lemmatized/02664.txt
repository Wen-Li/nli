first of all i would like to make clear that the objective of marketing and publicity are to highlight the good side of the product they are presenting so the most natural thing is to find that most advertisement make product seem much better than they really are but this is something related to a consumer impression not to a advertisement creator issue . it could be a problem if the advertisement say lie during it presentation or present inexact information that could guide the consumer to a invalid choice . for example if a detergent advertisement present a cleaning proof , comparing two type of detergentes , it ha to present the truth result because there are law that protect the consumer against abuse and missinformation . because of this law the advertisement world have to be very carefull in the presentation of fact and image and they have developed . over the year , they have developed many tactic for saying the maximun great thing about their product without telling a lie but making the consumer think that their product are the best when sometimes it not the case . for example , talking about beauty spot in the tv , everyday we can see that in the screen supermodel using cremes and beauty product that they say put the skin or hair in an excellent condition but we are fooling ourselves if we think that using that product it will make that we became a beautiful a those supermodel . that is not the fault of the advertisement guy because it is their work try to make their product the most desiderable for u . finally , consumer need to be realistic and critic with the actual advertisement world , puting in the balance all the concept and knowledge they have to determine if a product is a good a it is presented .
