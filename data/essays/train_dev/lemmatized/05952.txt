i definitly agree with the idea that it is more important to learn fact than to understand idea and concept for student . there are 3 reason a follows to support my idea . for most of human being , the ability to learn fact is much stronger than that of understanding idea and cencepts . facts equal specifiction and concept stand for abstruction . for an example , we may distinguish a hign value picture from a low value mainly by the whether it look like the real stuff or not . on the contrary , expert define the value of the painting by their color or some painting skill . we may not understanding the essential thiings in van gogh 's painting beacase we even not kown what he drawed on the paper . for another thing , it is easier for student learn thing from teacher than learn by oneself . that is the reason that teacher can make some specific example and fact to descibe the new concept which made student make sense easily . when it come to learn fact , we can not take into account the part-time job . why there are so many student like to take it when they are in school ? because it proive some interpersonal ability with them which are not learned from book or class . additionally , they learn thing with the joy of earning money . in spite of this , understanding idea and cencepts are basic for student . such u some acdemic subject math , caculation , science , historyand social science , they are essential for student to learn something new . suppose a man can not read or writing or simple caculating abiliy he will learn nothing even he know quite a few of fact . at last , in my opinion , i thing understanding idea and conceprs are a important a learning fact . we may build up tow side abilitly at the same time .
