i agree with the statement that understanding idea and concept are more important for student than learning fact . if a student invests his time to understand the basal idea and concept on a matter rather than just learning the fact he can use these in similar subject . generally human tend to do just a much a neccesary to solve a problem they faced . so many student are just learning the fact to pas exam . but they often seemed to forget the importance of idea . as an example in my first year in mechanical engineering i learned in my material science course not only the fact or calculation for the exam . i used very much time to understand the consepts of structure of material . after i passed the exam that i could really understand the basic of solid mechanic and it helped me very much for my preparation time for this course . i have seen that my investment really paid back . in other hand the concept or idea are more likely to be reminded in later year . the learned fact can replaced by new one and you could not remind them even after some day . as we are student and learning the subject to use them we have to call them whenever we need . for example i have been a very good student in high school and especially in physic . after i begin with the university i have seen that i could not remind some formula in physic which i used to know . but with my understanding for physic helped me to derive them for very basic formula . hence when trying to learn a subject it better to use more time for understanding then just learning fact .
