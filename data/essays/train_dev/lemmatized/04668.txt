i do n't agree with this statement that `` there will be fewer car in use than there are today '' . in today 's fast life , a no one ha time even for breakfast , and time for more competetion and hurry ha come for everyone . i think there will be more need of car in coming next twenty year , because life will become more advance than today . first , people use car for going different place such a school , college , work place or any other place such a going for a trip with family or friend . going on a trip with family or friend is not possbile without car , we will not enjoy if we will not go by car . if we will go by train or any other way , i think we will not enjoy our trip more . this prove that use of car can not be stop , and it will become more and more in the coming year . and one important thing is that people are going towards luxourious life more in coming year . second , a competition is growing more and more between people of the same or different organization , they need to manage their time fastly and effectively so , they use car and use of car can not be stop in the coming year . in a daily routine business people , job worker , self employed everyone need a personal car so that they can use that on their personal level . in morning they go to their office , from office to their mettings at different place and then again return to home at late night . these all is not possible without the use of car . overall , i think that a long a life will go on the use of car will go on on and in the coming year it use will become more .
