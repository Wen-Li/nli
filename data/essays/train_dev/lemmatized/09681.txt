i do agree . in fact i would say that this issue mark one of the most important cultural difference between europe and the united states of america , and that it is one with enormous economic impact . while in the usa there is a very strong culture of the succes , exemplified by the working people whose valour and will to reach a high a they can lead them to a great economic succes not only for them but for the entire society , in europe nowadays economically succesful people is being regarded more and more each year a demon guilty of the misery in which so many people around the world live . as many modern european intellectual vice this opinion is very likely to be found ( but more a a trend to exhibe than a a reality ) in france . i must say that when i use the term `` economicaly succesful '' i do not refer to plainly rich people but to people who ha achieved to make money by themselves and by a productive activity . this leaf out speculator and the like . i will now justify my opinion on the french : french youth nowadays would prefer , in a seventy percent majority , to become civil servant rather than to work in the private sector . being a civil servant in france ha even more advantage than in the rest of europe about free service such a health care or education for your child . however this way of thinking is leading france to not being able to keep up economically with the rest of europe , and europe to not being able to keep up economically with globalization in general and with the usa in particular . on the other hand once you have acquired deep knowledge about something it seems such a pity not to use it , and the labour market usually demand more specialist than entrepreneur , and much of the feature that make the usa so dynamical in economics also create great inequality in it social tissue not to be seen in europe , so in this issue a in many other i would suggest to find an equilibrium point instead of clinging to an extreme position .
