it is true that sudents , today , are really more inclined to understand the idea and concept than to learn the fact . though it is not what is supposed to be can we blame the student ? the education system in many country , itself , requires it to be like that . and today 's world ha nothing to do with the ` fact ' indeed . in many country education system are so restrictive and so close to development and resarch that student find themselves in an environment which is totally close to the fact . when using textbook is the only option the student have and when they are expected to be succesful in a kind of competition at the end of which the winner take it all how can we expect the student possibly try to reach for the fact ? the system forge the student to be tend to get the idea and concept . in addition to that we live in a world which ha nothing to do with the fact . for there is not an unique objective ` fact` . the fact are made not occur any longer . all the fact are mere deception . the worst of all noone is really interested in the fact . since the fact are not of any use it is kind of no surprise that the student are not involved in them . all in all it is so clear that student do not pay much attention to the fact . when there are so many obstacle and problem why do we think they should ?
