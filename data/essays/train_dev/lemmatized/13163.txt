some people believe that young people enjoy life more than older people do . on the other hand , some people think that older people enjoy their life more . as far a i am concerned , i am a combination of those two opnions mentioned before . my opnion is that if you want enjoy your life you must spend your life both in a young way and in a older way . firstly , young people are more active and willing to try new thing which lead to a exciting life . for example , when there is a kind of new music , young people must be the first group of people listening to it . they can relax and entertain temselves through this new mean while those older people keep amuse themselves by listening to traditional song . secondly , older people enjoy their life in a more profound way . for instance , an old couple walk along the creek near their home in the splendid sunshine is so lovely and romantic that nobody can deny that their love of each other . young couple can n't taste feeling like that . lastly , older people know the importance of reading . reading is very important for people to acquire more information and knowledgement . most of young people like traveling . even travling can give you some information a well , it is not a important a reading because you can n't taste the complex and wonderful feeling of reading . when you read a book , your feeling will follow the author of the book go a lot . i am a young people . that is why i can n't refuse the attraction of new thing . i alway try different kind of new music and new game when i am at home . i realy feel exciting at that time . however , i know the importance of enjoy my life in a more profound way . that explain why i always visit the libary of my school and read a big range of book and article .
