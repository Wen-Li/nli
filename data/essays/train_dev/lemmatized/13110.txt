though some people think that it is more important for student to learn fact , i , personally , perfer that for student to understand ideans and concept are more important for the following reason . first of all , in the math class , it ha a lot of formula that we need to use when we are solving the problem . yet , some student just mermorize the formula and they do not really understand why this formula come out . therefore , they will confuse , when the question change to which they are not familiar . in contract , student understand the idea and concept of the formula will help them easily to solve the question . that is why most of math teacher spends a lot of time on teacing the concept of the formula . second , student will easy to forget , while they only know the fact ; because they only mermorize it . they do not know the idea or concept of the meaing . for instance , the computer programming is a very hard course to some people , and they memorized all the code in the programming class and when they are typeing they only can type the basic stuff . if they meet a more complex question then they can not do it , and they will forget the code very soon , because they do not know how to use it . last but not least , the idea and concept are all made up from people . therefore , we can not just know the fact . once we get the concept or idea , we will very easy to know the whole thing , and we do not need to study day and night for memorrizing whole book . although , this is not to say learning fact are without the merit , i firmly belive that it is important for student to understand idea and concept rather than just learn fact .
