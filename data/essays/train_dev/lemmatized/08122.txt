i am now 20 year old . older people would say i am very young to understand the society a an adult . younger people would say i am enough old to go out of family and experience the world . in the year 2006 , many thing happened to me . i went to the united states of america for the first time , and have been a student in a college . i had to experience everything in a foreign language , english . imagine , it still might have been hard if i wa a student in my country , but i had to do in a foreign country . it gave me new experience in my life . i had to make my decision by my own . my family and my friend were too far from me to give advise . it wa a hard year for me . so younger people enjoy their life more than older people do . young people might feel the world and think in their own way but they still stay in a particular place like house , school or by their friend . they would also do n't know exatly what is happening in the world , what they do everyday is playing , hanging out with their friend and do their duty a child in their family . when they grow up and become old people , they might have many thing to consider in their life . they have to consider about money problem , have to consider about their child , have to think about their future and so on . also they will find out that the world is not so easy to live than they were expected when they were child . in conclusion , younger people will enjoy more their life than older people do , because they have le thing to care about and doe not know how hard the world is to live a a human being .
