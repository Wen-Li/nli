every generation is criticized by the one immediately before . it 's natural and i 'm not surprised about that , but the fact is that i simply do n't agree with statement so general that involve such a huge category of people a `` young people nowadays '' , because it 's impossible to me to group in only one category a so large number of individual a `` young people '' are . anyway , beside the fact that this sentence sound somehow more a a common-place than a a deeply analyzed statement , i do n't agree with it in detail too . i 'm going to explain myself . there are various way to help one 's own community , and i know some people involved in those activity and i am too , someway . when i wa at liceo , a lot of classmate of mine used to be a part of a catholic association whose purpose wa to help elderly people . every sunday they used to visit some old people and play chart or other game with them , giving them joy and happines . i think that this would be a clear example of the fact that young people usually help their community , even if most people doe n't always recognize it . moreover , a i 've always liked dealing with child , i spend some of my spare time helping kid who have problem in school-subjects , and that is the way i usually help my community , i.e. in the way the most fit me . i could number and write about plenty of other young people helping their own community , but i think it would be useless : the most important thing is that i strongly believe that sentence like that are just nonsense , a you can find some young people that never help people around them but also some others deeply involved in providing various kind of help to their community . nonetheless i strongly believe that it would be better if more people helped their community , but i do n't think that this is due to the fact that young people are worse than adult , but to the fact that there is always a need for help , and there will always be . my opinion , indeed , is that young people nowadays are not so worse than young people of previous generation : the just behave in their own way .
