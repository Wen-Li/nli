most advertisement make product seem much bettere than they really are . i agree with this opinion . first , there is no people can make the best product by himself . everybody always need some help from other people . may be the mind , may be the hand , nobody can do it best without help . that is the first reason for the most advertisement make product seem much better than they really are because they are not do it by themselves . second , want to do is not a same a real do . there are so many thing may been happend when you make product , and you can not know them before they happend . so the product may be better than you really are , may be not . third , when the advertisement want to do some thing , they almost want to do it best . but is just by thinking . plan is not equte to the truth . these are like a dream . in this kind of dream , they thought everythings could been happend follow their mind , no change . but it can not happend in the really world . we are not the god . so we can not contol anything . we can build the best buildind in our mind , and do every wonderful idea in the dream . that like the adverisement make product , always better than him really is . because they did not think about other thing which might be make some chance for their product . three people are more better than one people . this is a old idom in china . as same a this idom , advertisement and his friend make p
