we can assume when we read this that it would be right to say that young people enjiy more life than older but how can we be sure of this ? when we are young we do lot of thing : like to party see our friend , go abroad , but we do n't enjoy more life , no ? for exemple young people can be born very quickely and often do not take time to do thing , or spend most of their time watching television , or on internet . and sometimes are not aware of the chance they have to be young and to do lot of thing . some people always want more and more , the more they have the le happy they are . at the contrary older poeple are knozn to have the notion of what life really is and know that time is precisous . we can see that in general older people schedule all their time and are really organized . the older people get the le they want to loose time , they want their life to be like a calendar . we wish we can suppose so that they enjoy life too but in differents way but we can not be sure that they enjoy life a much a young people . what is nice when you are young is that you only think of what you do at the moment and not of teh consequence you are often le responsable , so have more fun . we can see that in disco for exemple or during vacation . to conclude we can assume that young people do not enjoy life more then older people but in a different way .
