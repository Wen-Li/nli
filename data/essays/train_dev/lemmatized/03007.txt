i agree with the author statement `` successful people try new thing and take risk rather then only doing what they already know how to do well '' . it is said that `` god will help them those who help themselves '' , it is infered that take the risk and try out for new thing which may lead to great success . for example if edison would not try for new thin he would not invent electric bulb . if newton would have eaten the apple fell from the tree we would not know the law of gravity . always it is better to take calculated risk when ever required which help u to florish in life . when is risk taken the reward is sure some day . it is suggested that try for new thing , experiment which lead to development and growth in field you are interested . aim for star atleast you can each moon . the good example for successful people is gandhiji , the father of the nation of india , he had try in a different way of doing freedom movement , he followed truthand nonviolence and took a much a risk he can , atlast he succeeded in getting freedom to his mother land . thats how the risk is alway rewarded which be for a good cause for maximum benifit of mankind . most of the scientist are the innovative thinker they like to do thing differently with a calculated risk and end up in getting great scientific invention . people will successful if they try out differently and take risk , if people are taking active participation in welfare for country there will be a great development in the country and this give confidence to people and economic status of country will improve . try for new thing for your and human bene
