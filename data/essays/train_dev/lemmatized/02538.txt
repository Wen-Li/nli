i agree with the statement , it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subject than to specialize in one specific subject . broad knoledge on many accademic subject play an imortant role in the future a ample exposure to all the profficional subject , get an analytical sill , know all the thing about the society . in my view broad nowledge get only taking many accademic subject offered by the university . knowledge is gain only by learning more thing in the world . todays world is globaliged one thats why we learn more thing . we grip on many subject we get ample exopsure greatly and easily . secondly , analyticall sill are use full for every person in the society they get by learning different subject . they give broad variety of knowledge to communicate easily with the others . all accademic subbjects are related to the our proffictional programming . those are use full in the future . those subject give thining ability to your mind . besides specialization subject they give stenth to your mind . some time i thin that many of the academic subject for upto undergraduate level are more usefull to get wide varitey of knowledge , after complition of undergradute , concentrate on the specialized subject that is related to our proffectional academic that time it give an more information about specialize subgect and accuire good knowledge easily and quickly . more evere concentration also play an important role in specialized subjet . in sum of all the above important point , many academic subject give broad nowledge than the single specialized subject . many accademics provide skill , good knowledge thinking , strenthen his education period . so it is better to take many subject .
