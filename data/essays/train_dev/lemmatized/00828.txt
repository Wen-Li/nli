i would like to think that in twenty year there will be fewer car in use than there are today . however a far a i am concerned , this is very unlikely to happen . the only solid argument that i can find to defend the reduction in the number of car is that due to the lack of gas and consequently the increase in it cost , people will buy le car . nevertheless , people are so used to have a car that in my opinion it is more probable that we will move to electric car . furthermore , what would happen with the big car manufacturer ? i think that they would find way to keep people buying car . another fact that we have to take into account , is the growth of city . things are further and further nowadays and there are few policy trying to increase the use of public transportation . therefore the use of car becomes very important . it is also relevant to measure what car imply . they are an evidence of economic power and they provide independence , a feeling of freedom . are people going to renounce to those feeling ? honestly , i do not think that teenager are going to reject their only source of independence . the same way people in their fifty will keep buying sport car . those are tradition that have become too relevant in our society to be changed in only twenty year . what about the new powerful country like china ? as the salary increase people tends to consume more . china is a new market willing to buy more and more car a it citizen can afford them . for all the reason sated above such a , the power of big manufacturer , the new demand in country like china , and the role that car currently play in our society , i do no think that thing will change in twenty year .
