man is a social animal . from the time being mankind had appeard on this earth , the real man is contiously trying to achieve maximum of knowledge in order to attain the ultimate peak of success and power . for this many way had been organised by u and one of the most important way to do this work is to attain excellence in science , research , art and technology . th topic of discussion here is that whether it is better to have broad konwledge of many acadmic subject or to specialize in one specific subject . in my point of view , i can thoughfully say that it is good to have only one subject to keep in concern than to deal with many area of acadmic study . first of all , to live in society where educated people recide it is important for each one of u to have the minimum required knowledge of all the subject which could be of essential use for our future . for this i would like to take an example which about a child who want to becom a pilot and ha always studied physical science amd math and no other thing . but now , how can he communicate with others , to feel others and to show his feeling towards others , to mix and organise thing related to the world of other subject . so this is cumpulsory for all of u to attain a minimum amount of knowledge about all the thing so that our life move on smoothly . but , i would lay more stress on the fact that one should be more specific about the subject or the area of study when one is going though his higher study . the main reason behind this is that , now in this accelerating world we ca n't excell in an area or field unless we are very specific in that work . the other main here is that if we are specific we can show our complete effort in a particular field and can serve the society in best way we can and this is th omly thing required for excellence in all the field . as a conclusion the best way to move is to be specific together having required intrests in all other are also .
