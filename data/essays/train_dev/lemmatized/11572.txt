some people like to try new thing and are n't afraid of taking risk . but taking risk and trying new thing make people succesful ? in my opinion the key to success is to take risk and try new thing which doe n't exist . first of all , without taking risk people can only remain the place where they are . only doing what they already know how to do well help them to stay where they are and doe n't give any opportunity to make a good career in their life . i claim that taking risk is a very dangerous way of being succesfull . because there is nothing guraantied after taking the risk and trying new thing . the ending could be very miserible . but considering the benefit and the award of taking risk and trying new thing , taking risk are preferable than doing always the same thing . secondly , taking risk can give very good vision to see the world in a different way and affect the culture of people in a good way . as a simple example , trying a new kind food is very hard thing to do for most of the people . people would prefer eating the same kind of food all the time . but one who try the new kind food gain a knowledge about this kind and his culture about food increase . to think taking risk in business , for example , thinking about a factory which is producing the same kind of product since the first day , can only earn little amount of money because the product is old and could be produced by other factory and the demand is reduced to this product . but a new factory that try a new product and take risk by making an investment to produce the new product can be very profitable and earn better than the other factory . in conclusion , if people want to be successful in any area of the life should not be afraid of taking risk and try new thing . this will bring the succeess to them .
