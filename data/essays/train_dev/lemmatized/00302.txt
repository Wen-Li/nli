all over the world , the importance of the advertisement to convey the information about product is not negligible . the reason for this importance is stemmed from the fact that the advertisemetns givce the detailed information about the product of some company . however , there is a discussion about whether these argument make these product seem much better than they really are or people can trust in these advertisement about the information about the product . in my opinion , most advertisement demonstrate the product not a they really are because of the some reason such a economical , social and political reason . one of the crucial reason in the unreliability of most advertisement in conveying information about the product is caused by the economical aspect . for instance , if there is a company who need money and support to develop themselves , to trade with another company in order to improve their skill in their own sector , they may show their own product much better than they really are . in addition to private company , the public company may desire to benefit from the people 's interest in their advertised product to make money from their sell to increase their prestige in a government . consequently , the economical purpose of the producer of the advertisement about their product may result in illustrating these product much more better than they really are . another significant reason in agreeing with the idea of not trusting most advertisement in representing the product can be proved by social reason . the reason for this that generally people always believe in advertisement and they do not try to know more about the advertised product in order to collect more detailed daat about them , because this kind of people choose the easiest way to get information about new method , new innovation and they try these product without any advice from professional people . therefore , the existence of laziness in social life in doing research in order to learn more information about product is a factor in the creation of unreliable advertisement . in addition to economical and social reason in making the advertisement to show product much better than they are , the political reason can be demonstrated a a proof . the reason for presenting political reason to prove my argument is that in some country , for example in turkey , there are some distinct rule in making the product available to use for people ; because these product shoud be reliable , tested in order to avoid the devastating result after using them . therefore , most advertisement try to show the product much better at the beginning to have the goverment approval in distributing them . as a consequence of giving the situation in political side of the advertisement , it can be claimed that the desire to have approval from the political power in order to introduce the product led to the increasing number of the advertisement which make the product much better than they really are . as a result of giving detailed information about the reason in economical , social and political field , it is ovious to see that most advertisement try to present the product in order to develop their economical structure , prestige in government and benefit from the the support of people , who are lazy and so not capable in doing research about the advertised product before using them .
