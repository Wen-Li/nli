i agree with the idea that most advertisement make product seem much better than they really are . is n't that what advertisiments are supposed to do ? to begin with , advertisement and publicity are very strong tool that company have to make their product know . moreover , they will do anything they can to attrack consumer and influence them to buy more of their product . that 's why advertisiments will show them a a unique and esential thing that we shoul all have , implying for example , that if you wa n't to be successful you have to buy the new dell laptop . in many ocassions , product look a lot better in the advertisement than in the store . for example , it is common to watch a tv advertisement on some brand of trouser and inmediately think you would love to wear them . but then when you get to the store and you see the real thing you sometimes get dissapointed . the situation get worse when you try them on and confirm what you have already guessed : they look awfull on me . another reason for product to look better than they really are , is that many time , radio and specially television advertisement star one ore more celebrity or respected member of the community who state that they use a certain product . this give you the feeling that the product is one of high quality and that it promotes positive value . for example , if tiger woods us nike golf club then they must be the best . or maybe if the prince of wales say he us dunlop deodorant and he feel satisfied with it , then we will assume the product doe n't harm the enviroment .
