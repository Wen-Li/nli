the issue whether there will be fewer car in the near future is a question many are wondering about . it is important to maintain the amount of vehicle on the street just to keep the balance more accurate . it is possible that human will discover some other new transportation method than riding a car , but highly doubtable . not to mention that we are living in a generation that is addicted to oil product , which is called oil addiction . as a result of the oil discovery we have seen too many product perfectly made to be sold , car is an example of that addiction . this essay will prove that we are not only addicted to oil but also in a `` cars-addiction '' generation . firstly , many argued that we are going to discover some new kind of vehicle that fly , and we will be having street over sky , now let u be more realistic here . some would rather going back to the generation before to using horse , donkey , or even camel for transportation . moreover , i can see the fact that car are a high risk for the the ozone layer , while this layer is protecting u from many radio active wave which might get u deadly disease . however , i know that car are helping parent drive their kid to school , go to work , and even do their own business trip . indeed , cars are number one transportation method for people . secondly , let u take kuwait city , miami city , ca , or even ny state example for people who are in love to show off what they have . some might claim that they have nothing to do with these kind of people and they would never be like that . however , they might be your cousin or brother and sister , but what i am trying to say that we can not neglect the idea that these people exist . infact , they do a big affect on whether there going to be an increase or decrease in car number driven on the street . finally , many asserted the idea of our generation getting oil addicted . some individual might be living in farm , or even desert with peace . however , we can not be ignoring the fact that we need to be more modern in our life . the human brain keep improving it self so we keep improving our group , country and , in a general way , the whole world . i believe there will be ton of new model for sale , which they already have how the structure of the vehicle will be . thus , i highly think that million of car will be cruising on the street within the next twenty year . according to human addiction guess what is going to happen if you do not have one ?
