i do n't agree with the following statement : young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their community . i know nowadays we are all selfish and we do n't have enough time to help others or to think or to take care about social condition where we live in , but i know that some friend of mine spend their free time taking part in event community . helping others or taking part in social event brings gratifycation you feel usefull for the society . many young people are involved in collective activity in different place of the city . mainly these activity have the aim to help someone or to improve something which should be better . secondly i think many adult in my city do n't believe in young people and i think the governament should give voice and space avaible for all , in particular for younger . the crime and deliquency rate 's increased especially between the younger , and i think the adult shoul be their teacher . the teenager is not the only one guilty . finally i think the current daily life is faster than sooner and the living condition for young people are not better nevertheless i know many people help their community . it will be better to believe in young people
