in my opinion , i disagree with the statement . i think both of the situation is very important for the student . ( understand idea and concept , learn fact . ) the two situation combine with each other . firstly , understanding idea and concept is useful for the student . by the way the student can learn the idea . so the student have an opinion about the situation . for example ; while learning about a war , the student should learn the idea and concept of the war . ( what is the importance of the war for other company , the other person opinion about the war , where it begans . .. etc ) before the student dont understand the idea and the concept of the war , they cant have a focus on the war . not only understanding idea and concept of the war but also learning the fact of the war ha an important role for the student . if the student want to learn about the war , the student have to being successful in two situation . secondly , when learning fact is not enough for the student . for example ; the student learn the fact of the happening , ( for example by learning the fact of the war , the student can understand the war anda then the student can built their opinion strongly ) but if the student dont understand the idea and concept of the happening , the situation doesnt have a place in the student mind . then , the student wont remember the situation . so it mean the situation is temporary for the student . by understanding the idea and concept , the student can develop their idea . so the student can improve yorself about the situation . in conclusion , the student not only understand idea , but also learning fact . they gave enough importance for both of situation . so they learn the situation well by understanding idea , concept and learning fact .
