the importance of understanding concept learning fact is an important part in an educational system , but what count most is understanding the concept and idea . first , if a student get to understand how a certain system work , he would be able to understand the effect it ha and be able to assimilate the informatioon faster . if he memorized it a a fact without understanding the concept , he is probably going to forget it the next day . i take myself a an example , i am a pharamacy student , and in my field there are lot of fact , a example , a drug lead to a certain effecs , but understanding the mecanism by which this drug work in the body and why it lead to this specific effect make it easier for me to learn it and later use it . another point in favor of understanding concept is that by doing so , the student will be able to develop his logical and analytical thinking which wil allow him later to applicate what he learned in another field or problem . for instance , understanding why the earth gravite around the sun is more important than the fact itself , because understanding this concept enables the student to apply it to the whole astronomy field including the understanding of eclipse and season change . finally , when learning fact , student tend to accumulate information and stick to them , whereas trying to understand an idea lead them to do their own research on the subject , to have their own judgment and approach . they tend to broaden their mind and increase their curiosity . i think that learning fact is important depending on the field of study because there are thing that ca n't be explained or are beyond student understanding , but what is the most important is to understand the concept whenever it 's possible because by doing so , a student manage to develop his way of thinking and to apply the concept to another field .
