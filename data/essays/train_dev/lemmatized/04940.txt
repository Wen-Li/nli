there are a lot of responsibility on the young people shoulder . they are trying to discover themselves , discover their ability , their place in the communuty eventually draw their own path . i believe eventhough i spend most of my time for studying , i give time to helping my community . is it enough ? i think this statement is both true and not true for different reason . it is true in a way that we do n't do our best . we can spend a lot more time to make our city a better place . we can take part actively in regualtions . also we can spend more time with the elderly . we can do this by carefully planiong our spare time . but usually we choose to relax and be with our friend whan we have time . one of the reason for tghis is that nowadays people do not need each other like they did before . almost everything in out life can be done with professional . because of this people le intefere to eachpothers life . on the other hand it true that we are doing what ever we can . even studying not to be a useless person is helping to the communuty . i do not have time but when i see my neighbour i ask them if they need something . i am living in a flat and my neighbour are two old sister . i ask to them if they need anything when i am going to the market or example . if something is going on in front of my eye i do not close my eye , i interfere and help . if i am not aware what can i do about it ? i think this sentence is both tur and not true from different view . it is true that young people might be little bit isolated from community and because of this they are nto helping much . but young , especially student are busy with studying and developing themselves and should not be balmed for not giving enough time . it is communuties responsiblity to create the occasion for sharing and helping .
