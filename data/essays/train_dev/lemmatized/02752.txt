this subject could be considered a a mixed blessing for society and for me . i agree with this statement but also being old have disadvantage it doe not mean that older people not enjoy life . altough young people have more available for fun from their health , there are also older people like young childerens in their sixty . i agree that young people enjoy life more than older people . to begin with , young people have more ability and energy to spend their time and acting a active role in the social activity . they can go wherever they want and they can enjoy with the society like concert , cinema , theatre . also they are spending most of their time with their friend at school so they are always in a communicaton . on the other hand , older people have not got the full physical ability like young a they they are old . they can not even walk without any help so they can not be able to see their friend for talking and sharing , resting and strolling . so when teenager want to have fun there could not be a chance for them so they become uncomfortable becouse they need to walk , run , talk a they also have the responsibility of being a teenager . on the other hand there are some exceptionals both for older and younger people . some teenager do not like being with other people and they do not love anything . so i do not understand how they can enjoy life without loving anything to do and complaining about getting bored . despite of being older , i can see them , especially woman , in their sport car and driving through most popular avenue , shopping with their friens , play game , having party . to summerise , we should not consider the statement like young people always enjoy life more than older people do because it is not something related with the age . it is something coming from the inside of the people and have the ability to know how to enjoy life .
