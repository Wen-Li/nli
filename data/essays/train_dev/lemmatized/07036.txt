when it come to advertisement , quite a few people would claim that most advertisement make product seem much better than they really are . as far a i am concerned , i agree with the statement . among countless factor which influence my point . there are three conspicuous aspect a follows : firstly , according to a survey , the majority of people have unpleasant association with some advertisement because they believed that they once were cheated by some advertisement . these cheat take place everywhere and everytime , on tv , on radio , in supermarket , in cyberspace . thousands of people are suffering these kind of advertisement . another reason can be seen by everyone is that the purpose of advertisement is to appeal buyer . with the development of high-tech , product are eaeily produced and designed . they are similar to each other not only in design but also in function . how a factory or a supermarket can win in such keen competing advertisement is the key . although honesty is a very imporatnt in morden society , not all advertisement can be honest . nobody want to spend money on useless produce . so those product should be seemed much more better , beautiful , functional than they really are . thirdly , for many factory and supermarket or sale , maybe they consider cheating a part of advertisement . advertisement is another beautiful none for cheatig advertsements can perfect product . there are not product but music , beautiful scenery in them , of course , not alll advertisement are cheating . many advertiments are good a well a their product . however , just few of them . to sum up , i reallly agree with the notion that most advertsements make product seem much better than they really are .
