i do n't think that it will decrease the number of car in just twenty year . i support my opinion with some reason i descrive below . first , nowadays , car are one of the most necessary thing in our everyday life . japanese people sometimes express about car into `` leg '' in our conversation . for example , a man say `` we do n't have leg to go to the station. '' , then an another man sais `` we can take a bus . '' . first man said `` lag '' , but of course , it not about real leg . ordinary people have their leg , so correctly , he wanted to say about a vehicle , but he exchanged the word into leg . now , you get an idea how car are important for u like leg . we will keep driving car even in twenty year later . secondly , everybody think car are convenient . we can move far away , and we do n't need to pay for driving without gas or oil fee . if something new vehicle or machine invented in near future , people might change their way to move , but this invention must be more convenient and cheaper than car . in addition to this , this story is not reality , so we should ignore this now . cars are too familiar vehicle to throw out , so i think it will nothing to change about car in future . in conclusion , car are very convenient , and necessary for u .
