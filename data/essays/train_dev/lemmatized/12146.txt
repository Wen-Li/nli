there are too many different way for a student to learnd and undesrtand different kind of topic , but there is huge difference between understanding idea and concept and learning fact . first of all , the fact that a student it 's only understanding the concept it mean he is learning . understanding is the base of education , and the base of knowledge . for example , if one student ha a test , and he memorize everything , he migh be good at the test , but week later , if you ask him about the same topic and if he is not able to answer any question about the topic , that mean that he did n't learn anything about it . secondly , understanding idea is the best way for learning , and remember different fact . for example , when you are able to understand some topic , and you are able to answer any question about it , that mean that you actually learn something about , maybe not everything but just what you thougt it wa important for you . finally , the main reason why student now a day feel confortable when their are going to present any kind of test or exam , is because they undesrtood what they read and the undesrtood the main idea of the subject or topic they where asked to study . for example , when a student ha his final exam and he wa all night studing and he did good on his test , that 's because he undestood most of the information , and that 's one of the most important thing for a student to be succesfull . in conclution , i totally agree with the statement because i think that by understanding the idea and the concept you could better learn they way that thing happened , and by that you could understand the fact . if you learn , it 's because you understood . understanding idea and concept will make you learn about everything you want , whenever you want .
