learning is a natural process that everybody owns , most of child go to school and start learning very early . the point is , do they really know what they are doing or do they just learn without understanding ? we will see what is the most important for a student , learn fact or understand idea and concept ? in my opinion , we can not separate those two part one from each other . it is impossible to understand a theory or a process if we do not know the underlying element ( the fact ) . i would say that both part of the statement must be given an equal importance . it is the basis of the knowledge that to learn fact and use them in various situation ( talk , lecture or project ) . otherwise we would not be able to speak or communicate to each other . this is our general knowledge . in the other hand , you learn fact or lesson by heart , it is often not very usefull , because a few day later it is almost impossible to remember everything we learned . for example , for my a level in france ( baccalaureat ) i had to learn by heart map of europe or usa describing either population or exchange etc . the month after i wa not able do draw it again because it came out of my mind . i agree that sometimes it is useless to learn fact . precisely in the case if we know we will not practice what we learned anymore . regarding understanding of idea or concept , this is a very important process for a student . that is how people acquire a specific state of mind , and with practice thing can be understood faster and faster . the purpose of an idea is to be well understood and this idea ha no reason to exists if not so . therefore i would give a special importance to the understanding of concept and idea too .
