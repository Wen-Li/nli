i am inclined to agree with the statement that the people who take risk and try something new rather then doing what they know make them successful . i have certains reason to agress with this statement which i would discus later in my essay . i would also like to highlight the fact that taking such risk might not get the success in1st attempt , sometimes people need to attempt multiple time . the main reason for this my view is that i believe in `` more risk , more gain '' philosophy . if i decide to get into some new business/idea , which nobody ha tried , i need compartively more resource in term of money , time and effort to purse this new venture . there is a chance that this new venure could fail , but on the positive note if that business/idea succeds , i would have a tremendous potentail to make money in this new business a i will not have much competition . i will give an example of john chambers , ceo of a networking company . this company wa traditionally in the business of selling networking device . as it buinsess became more matured and competition increased , john decided to take some risk and expanded into telephony business and became successful in this new business . this company rank a number one in telephony buinsess . the 2nd reason for my view is that unless i venture into unknown terrotories i will not know what lie there . as a human , we always have this comfort zone which we do not want to leave but there is no guarntee that there is no risk in what we are doing today . my brother ha a gift business and he wa very comfortable in that buinsess . i insisted him to try export business , though he wa initially reluctant but he tried and became successful . in conclusion , i believe that risk taking is a shirt cut to scuccess which we should try .
