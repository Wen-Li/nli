today , many people have a car or even many car , however will it be the same in twenty year ? many clue show that thing will change in the future because car are dangerous for the environment , oil will depletel in few year , but also because car are not healthy . now , everyone know that car are polluting , and a a consequence , are very bad for the environment . scientists try to make car which pollute le , but currently it doe not exist a car which doe not pollute . i think it is very important to be aware of the environment problem and to be concerned about the global warming . the first step to reduce the global warming may be to reduce , or even to stop the using of car . there could be a solution to this problem if scientist would build clean car , but it is not the case yet . an other important thing is that there will be a lack of oil in few year . currently , with no oil a car can not work . so if scientist do not make car without oil , there will not be any car when oil will deplete on the earth . finally , car do not help people to be healthy and do not incite them to walk , which is in a way quite normal since people prefer to choose the easiest and most cumfortable thing . while the obesity keep growing , people use their car instead of walking , even for a short time . i thing people should walk more often and not use their car every time they have to go out . this is why i think , and i hope , there will be fewer car in use in the twentiy year . maybe cycle could replace car , it would make people more sporty and healthier and it would be better for the environment .
