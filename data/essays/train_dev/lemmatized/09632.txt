the statement presented above is far too general to really capture the complexity of actual life . there are two main point i would like to discus here . first , factor other than age may explain why a person is happy or desperate with life . second , we need to look at what we really mean when we use the notion of `` enjoying one 's life '' . at all time in history are we confronted with unhappy young life : or do we think that the young british soldier in iraq `` enjoys his life '' ? he may be proud to serve a cause or proud to be able to live up to the challenge . but when we think of the deadly risk always present in the soldier 's mind , the old lady in her cozy house with her entire family around may look like the happiest person . the term `` enjoy life '' is too much associated with a life animated by party , travel around the world and the perspective of having one 's life before one . it is true that in most case young people , given their physical strength , have more option to lead an eventful life , a long a they have some freedom and financial mean . however , more eventful may not mean more enjoyable . can an old couple not also enjoy life , looking back at a fulfilled life and having the support by a loving family ? in some country in africa , it is the eldest who have the say in the village and the respect of the young people is theirs . in chinese , there is a saying that go exactly the other way round : if you drink tee , the first sip are a bitter a the young life . when you poor more water , the tee becomes a sweet a the adolescent life . and only when you add water for a second time your reach the balanced , slightly fragrant stage that resembles old age . in the buddhist tradition , this last stage is clearly the preferred and the symbol of this is the old , `` useless tree of happyness '' . maybe we people in the west should learn that every stage of life ha it own happy moment , and experience of sadness form part of the human condition . neither should young people be `` condemned '' to enjoy life , nor should old people always hear that their happy life are over anyway .
