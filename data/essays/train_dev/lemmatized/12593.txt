there are a lot of product in the shop and it doesn ' t matter what you want to buy , you have really a lot of choice . in order to convince the costumer of a special thing , there is advertisement almost everywhere . i agree with the statement and think that most advertisement make product seem much better then they really are . the first example is the tv . when you are at home and want to watch tv , there is shown a lot of promotion . this shall convince the person for the product and lead him automatically to the next shop to buy it . and because we live in a modern world , you can phone a number and they ' ll send it with the post . so the person thing , he bought the best teeth brush ever . and when he want to brush his teeth , it break . so you see , that the advertisment make the product seem better a it really is . a second example is buying a new car . you saw it in a newspaper , the tv and want to buy it , because it shall be modern , fast and the best ever . after a few month you have a breakdown on the highway and have to call the garage to repair your car . so you learn that it ' isnt a good a the advertisement said and showed in the newspaper and tv . you better think about buying a new car and ask a person who know car from his job and who could give you tip . and not only see an advertisement and buy immediately ! products seem much better a they really are because of advertisement . in general , you can buy all product you want to buy , but you have to be careful about the advertisement . better try to find out on yourself how good the product is and when you thik it ' s good - buy it ! the world of today is full of advertisement and so the people have to be more and more careful about what they buy !
