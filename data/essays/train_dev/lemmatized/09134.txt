i agree that with a tour guide is the best way to travel because if a group of person are visiting a place that never been there will be in le risk of having a bad incident and also will visit the most important place of the area . the guide will have the time planned helping in maximamizing the time during each visit . this give the opportunity to the visitor to visit all the place that wa planned in the tour . they will simplify the everyday logistic of moving from one place to another with the tour guide the group are not exposed to place that may be dangerous to them , because they now the area very well . tour guide also will help in explaning the history of the place because they are there for that , to give a better understanding to the visitor of the visited place . if something happens in the area of visiting the guide know how to overcome or avoid a potential problem to the group . for example visiting a coutry that have a different language , the guide tour can understand what is going on in the area and avoid potential harmful to the group . the guide know the route to visit each place avoiding delay or waste of time in traffic . people can have a brief of the place before getting to it , helping these the visitor to prepared such a appropiate dressing . definetly the guide is very impotant from my point of view because help in making easier the visit to an area . also , visitor can get much more information from the visited place in comparison is they go and visited by itself . i recomend that doe not matter which place peolple go it is better to be with a guide in a place that you do not know .
