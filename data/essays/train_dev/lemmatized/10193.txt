whenever people is planning to travel and visit place , they make sure to include a tour guide in their visit , because they believe it is the best way to travel . they see in it many advantage , especially on the knowledge the tour guide posse of the place in question , knowledge that would definitely enrich the traveling experience . as a matter of fact , the knowledge a tour guide ha on a specific site constitutes a very important key in the discovery of the place itself . let 's say , for example , that summer is right next door , and a much expected and anticipated trip to copan ruins at last ha come . a tour guide will take tourist to the most important part of the ancient mayan site , and in detail will explain to the group the historic event , be it social , economic or intellectual , that led to the specific scenery the tourist are observing . this knowledge , especially if the tour guide is native to the place , will help the tourist immerse in the culture and the history of copan ruins . on the other hand , having a tour guide of copan ruins will in some way make the group see thing a the tour guide see them ; also , the trip will be narrowed to what the tour guide or the agency he work for , decides to include , leaving out ineresting fact that just ca n't be included due to lack of time . i agree with the statement that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide , only if , after the tour i get the time to wander by myself around the place , let 's say copan ruins , and see thing through my own eye and personal experience ; only if i 'm able to bring to my mind the thing i previously read about this ancient place and draw my own conclusion based on what i 've read and seen ; only if i get a moment on my own to feel the magic of the place and to be a part of it . if a trip lack this essential part , then it is incomplete , even if we get an experienced tour guide that know historic fact like the palm of his hand .
