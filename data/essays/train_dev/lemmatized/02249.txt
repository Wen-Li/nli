going on a nice vacation with a relative and without a tour guide is the most relaxing vacation . traveling in a group ha it postive and negative side . one of the negative side is that people have to compromise to other people 's suggestion . if a tourist travel alone or with a partner , they have the opportunity to go wherever they want and to do wantever they want . to see a forgein country and it original culture , tourist have to step out of the box and leave the tour guide behind . going into a tiny village far away from tourism in which no tourist have been , is an adventure that speaks for itself . who want 's to see a place that ha been seen by million of other tourist ? my family and i went to kenya , south africa , and visited the tiny village along the river . we were the only tourist they had seen in year . we saw the `` real '' life they are living and realized how greatful we should be for a life like ours . this experience show that not only will a vacation be memorable by seeing the hotel pool and hotel buffet but also by doing something exciting - something out of the box . considering the statement , i have to admit that it depends on age wheather tourist choose to travel in a group led by a tour guide . it would be more amusing and exciting for older people to join a group since they like the company of other older people . older people would also enjoy the freedom of letting somebody else do the work - like a tour guide - and relax and enjoy their vacation . at the end , it is a personal choice rather people want to travel alone , with a partner , or with a group . every choice ha it positive and negative aspect .
