it is an old statement that `` young people enjoy life more than older people do '' . in my opinion this is true for all the new old generation . always will be an old lady that looking at some guy going to disco will be agree with this statement . but , at the same time , i am totally sure that , when she wa an athletic never-stopping girl , there wa an old man telling the same to her . so thing are ! in my opinion , for the old generation , is a sort of criticism to the running time . it is quite understandable that an old person feel a little envy of the freedom and enjoyfull life 's style of younger people . of course they have forgotten how amazing and enjoyfull wa their life when they were twenty ! on the other hand , we , the last young 's generation , can not denay that time are changed and that our parent , or granparents , had much more resposabilities and no so many way for enjoing their time . above all , nowadays the time to enjoy never stop : everyone of evry age can have a lot of funny . it doe n't matter how old are you , if you are twenty or sixty . it is suitable for everyone travel all around the world , gain , or lost , in to the casino , do bujing-jumping , make news friend , go dancing , go to concert or do all the crazy thing you want . the age is no more a problem . so the statement , now , should be rewrite a : `` old people enjoy life more than younger people do '' . supporting it , there are a lot of statistic afferming that old people are enjoyng a lot their retirement .
