i agree this idea that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide . there are two reason : relieved and expart of the guide . to the beginning , i 'm relieved when a tour guide lead u . because she know everythingfor example , i travel to a foreign country . if i can not communicate in english and not mother language , i worry about it . i may not to able to listen guide and not to see the direction . then i may get lost . in my case , i traveled in london alone . i have a map and book which is written the detail about that city . i walked around the city while i look the book . but i got lost . i wa so nervous because i could not find that there were no japanese and people who could speak in japanese . then i thought . if i belongs to a tour group by a tour guide , i did n't get lost . next and the last , a tour guide is expart of introducing . because she or he know the imformation better than ordinary people . for instance , in this case , it is also a foreign country . last summer , i went to italy in a group led by a tour guide . this is my first time to visit italy and also the first time to travel led by a tour guide . i wanted to visit various place , so i often asked a tour guide like this . where should i go in order to eat dinner to cheep restaurant ?? or which place is the best to go to the church ?? a tour guide always told me . and also she told u the history of the city , country . furthermore she showed u the secret place where it is not written in the book . i felt it wa happy to know . for those reason , i agree this idea that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide .
