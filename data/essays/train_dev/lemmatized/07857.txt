every one is able to remember when one day he ordered to a shop , thanks to an advertisement , a beautiful green pull over and just received a kind of thing he wa not sure he had one day desired . .. the power of advertising ! indeed i agree that most advertisement make product seem much better than they really are , thanks to art photography , great transformation thanks to a computer , and then by a good presentation with music , laugh . .. first , i do think that photographer make a really good job ! actually when one see on a newspaper a really beautiful dress , wearing by a very beautiful girl , one just imago she will be a beautiful a this ! but be careful , photographer know how to make it so appealling ! moreover , all the photography are redifined by computer , with amazing logicials able to transform the whole thing in a pretty magic one ! it can appear unrealistic , but i am sure that one can rarely trust what one see : it is a ` created product ' . then there is a great effort made on presentation , which sometimes can be comparated with a real show ! for instance one can see on television advertisement people dancing , laughing , smiling . .. so much happiness on the screen , and for what ? a new burger !! however this work ; most of the people who were watching it will surely taste it soon . finally , even if advertisement false the reality , i think they can be so funny that i do not care . just be aware of their method .
