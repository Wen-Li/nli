although there are several advantage of a broad knowledge , i prefer to be specialized in one specific subject or area . first of all , i have got the opinion that your chance concerning getting a job are better when you are specialized . if you have studied business , for instance , with a specialization or main topic like chinese language and it global feature , you will become more interessting for a range of special company . you have the advantage to separate you from the mass of other student or applicant . therefor zour chance are better to get a job offer from maybe a chinese company or a company that ha got close connection to china . however , if you have just studied business with a wide range of different subject and area , it could become more difficult to find the right job . there are no specific position in a company that would fit to you . there is of course no doubt , that education is really important and broad knowledge is always be a good basis . but concerning the job market it is probably not enough . especially today , it is pretty hard and exhausting to find a job in germany . you have to offer special skill and education to get the chance of a good job . according to this , people should concentrate on subject where they can provide necessary skill and which they like to do . normally , that is only a small and limited area of a subject , in business , for example management and not the whole subject which would also includes financing for example , a completely different area . concerning the knowledge you are learning or using in private , i think it is an advantage to have broad knowledge and to be educated . in conclusion , i support the point of specializing in a subject to improve your chance getting a job in being more unique .
