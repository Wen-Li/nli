at first sight , i think successful people have to take risk because it is important , when we manage everywhere , to try new thing to see if we succeed in these . the failure would not be grave . when you are the possibility to do something you do not know , you must do it . although successful people are proud of them and do not change what they represent , it would be interessant for them to try other thing , to show that they are able to do something that they do not know , in order to prove their actual possibility and value . on the one hand , the fact they do something new , show that they want to research the difficulty and become interessant person who do not stop at they know already do . their life have not to be borring . doing what we already know doe not permit to meet new circumstance and event . taking risk stress our volonty . some people who decide to try new thing understood that the life is interesting so long a we want meet the surprise of the life . for that we have to take risk when we have the possibility . on the other hand , doing only what you already know , prevent you from discovering something which would please you . to put it in a nutshell , take risk , it is live , when we are successful , because we have the possibility to manage the new thing that we do . on second thought , it is a security for the person to do only what we know to do . somebody are not really keen on discovering new way of living and coming into the daily . i respect this point of view . successful people can continue their life by doing what they already do . in the meanwhile , to my mind , i would like to encourage successful people to take risk because it is important for them .
