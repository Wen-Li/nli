i agree that young people enjoy life more than older people . this is very evident when we go to see some sport or carnival or even a club . more often we find very active and enthusiastic participation of the youth . old people generally do not get interested in new thing a easily . new thing do not invibe the same level of excitement in old people a it doe to the youth . many reason can be given for this difference in the way of looking at life between old people and youth . young people at their stage are still exploring new thing in their life . every thing excites them . nothing is usual for them . a base ball match may be just another match for an old man but for a youth it may be very important . he get involved into it much more and hence enjoys it more too . after a certain age life becomes mundane , every thing seems to be routine . people get used to a very fixed kind of life . small event which one full filled them with joy seem to be just another thing . one reason could be the coming of stagnation in one 's life after a certain age . we get bound by a lot of thing after getting old . we refuse to being dynamic . relationships become stagnant , we stop thinking of growth even in our job and all these thing reduces the interest towards life . wherease someone who is young , say a fresh graduate there is so much unstability in his life which inturn give his life more dynamism . this keep his life more interesting and hence he enjoys life more . health aspect can be another reason why young people have more fun . young people are more healthy and spirited . for an enjoyable and fullfilling life good health is very important . in old age , people generally become weak and lose their health too . this prevents them from enjoying their life fully . all the above reason result in youth people being able to enjoy life more than the older one .
