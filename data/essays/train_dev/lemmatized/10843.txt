some people are of the opinion that in general successful people try new thing and take risk rather than only doing what they already know how to well . in my opinion , however , successful people only do what they already know how to do well . this essay will discus two key reason to support my statement in more detail below . first of all , i am convinced that in order for people to succeed in their career , they need to perform what they already know how to do well . the reason is that people make le mistake by inplementing thing based on evidence . for example , a my profession is a cardiac surgery , my bos in the department of cardiac surgery in my hospital always emphasizes that the most important thing for heart surgeon to perform surgery for a patient is to implement a well recognized and scientifically established procedure so a to save a many patient a possible . my bos ha now become one of the prestigious , successful cardiac heart surgeon in north america . thus , a a cardiac surgeon , i am always inspired and influenced by his policy , and i do believe that successful peole like my bos try to do what they already how how to do well . second , i am definitely of the opinion that achievable people perform what is widely recognized and approved by everyone because basically when trying new thing and taking risk in their life , the success rate is lower than doing what they already know how to well . in the worst senarions , it is probable thta they end up losing their finance and life if they fail to overcome taking risk . therefore , in order to suceed in their life and professoinal work , it is more appropriate to do what is widely recognized and established . to conclude , i strongly feel that successful people only perform what they already know what to do to avoid making mistake and causing irreversible result such a financial difficulity and losing their life .
