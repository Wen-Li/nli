im strongly disagree with the statement a i iknow old pepople and young people the can enjoy in deferent way according to their age and their ability . there are many thing old people can enjoy doing for example going to cinema or going to park with family . i think some old people they did not agree to go out or they are unable to do so but if we are encourange them to do that they will . in addition the child should treat there parent in a polite way so that they can enjoy their remaining life even though they are old that is not an excuise to deal with them in a bad way or to keep them away from comunity . furthermore some people may not be very good with there parent thats why the old people may refuse to enteract with others and the prefere to be aione rether than going out and enjoy thersself in some country the goverment provid a special place for the old people to leave especialy for those who do not have the place to leave and it may contain alots of function that created for them to take off there worried and boring that is a good thing and also there is a special place that builed and designed for the old and disabbled people to move easily . in conclusion i think every one right to enjoy there life and it not setele
