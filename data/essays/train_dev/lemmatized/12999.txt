many people prefer to travel with group with tour guide , but i totally do not agree with this way of travel . there are number of disadvantage if someone choose to make a group tour with guide . such a lack of flexibility of the schedule , loosing the oppotunities to meet new friend and inconvinience caused by the large group . first of all , the schedule is not flexible for the guided group tour . let u assume that you are on a trip . if you are in the group , all you can do is just folloing the guide and listen to him/her . on the other hand , if you make your own trip , you can go to anywhere you want and whenever you want . if you feel tired from hiking yesterday , you can sleep a couple of more hour if you want . the second reason that i do not prefer the group tour is that i do not want to loose the oppotunity to get close to native people . the hilight of a trip can be making new friend from all over the world . i simply can not afford to loose the chance to make a conversation , exchange political opinion and so on . finally , if you are in a group , it take much more time to move to another place . for example , if you are waiting in the line in the airport , you have to still wait for your company even though you are finished with your process . however , if you are alone or with a small group , you do not have to waste your time to wait for the people whom you really do not know . in my opinion , true travel ha to made up by traveler themselves so that they can experience more and feel more . the most important thing you can get from a travel is how much you felt and experienced , not how many place you have been or see .
