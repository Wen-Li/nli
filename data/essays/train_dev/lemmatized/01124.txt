my neighbour family had a car for all the family . when i wa visiting them last time i saw three car in thier garage ! i really surprised and i think after twenty year they will 8 car . i belive that in twenty year there will be more car in use than there are today . i think that because of two main reason : economic and population . first , i think that we will have more car for economic reason because the world is becoming a idustrial world and all of people have a higher salary than before so they will spend more money in buying car . as many rich star do if they have mony , simpley they buy new car . it is kind of luxsuries . many people belive that if u have money , you have to buy a car . because of the money that people will have and becoming bussniss people they must have a modern and more car than the people had . also , the car factory will try to satistfy the consumer and they will produce more car than any time . second , because of increasing in population , many people will need car to do thier daily job and thier work . as a result of this increasing , people try to satistfy themselves and thier family so they will buy more and more car . i noticed that my uncle family have five car because their family is growing and if we imagine what will happen after twenty year , we can clearly relase that there will be more car in the future . if many people are trying to have a higher level for salary and the population number will growing i think we will have more car than the number of people and the name for the next age will be `` car-person age '' .
