i do agree that most advertisement are some time misleading to the customer and the customer end up spending huge amount of money . although there are law which will take in to consideration about the product which are misleading and in bad taste , there are many product which are coming into the market . for example in the e commerce , the customer rely on the perticular supplier and some time the customer recieve an inferior quality product and it is time consuming for the customer to return back the product a he ha to follow the procedure . advertisement should have a proper information about a product for the layman to understand . the advertiser should act according to the law and the customer should have a easy accessiblity to return back the product if such product is not how it is described in the advertisement . there should be customer line for every product for the customer to explain how he feel about the product and whether there any suggestion on the product . in the third world country customer endup in paying huge amount of money relying on the advertisement and they hardly have customer line . in my openion there should be proper information about the product and the product should give information in case where the customer is not fully satisfied about the product and the consumer care line should be there wherein the customer can complains about the product to the specific authority . lack of customer care line and not having a check on the bad advertiser , the customer will be in loss . the law should be strict and customer should be informed where to complain and whom to approach to give a complaint . there are so many product which are advertised but dosent give clear message , customer often get confused and mislead with the advertisement .
