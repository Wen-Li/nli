i agree that most advertisement make product seem much better that they really are . my argument is clearly supported by the following reason and example . to illustrate the point , we first want to know the purpose of the advertisement . why are the manufacturer spending so much money on advertisement . the anwer is quite simple to everybody . they want to make money out of the product . that determines that most advertisement exaggerate the advantage of the product , and rarely mentioned the downside . and the disadvantage are usully played down if they are mentioned at all . for example , toyota claim that the prius , the most famous brand of hybrid car , can run 42 mile per gallon of gas . however , that 's not true , at least for most of situation . the typical mileage of prius is only around 35 , a quite gap from the toyota 's claim . in fact , you can get mileage close to 42 when you drive on the highway only . obviously , the advertisement put out by toyota handily never mention that . there is another example . proactive , the famed medication for treating acny , state in the advertiesment , that it work very well on different type of skin , no matter dry , sensitive , very moisture . it turn out that it is not true either . it only work fairly well on dry skill . it doe n't work on the sensitive skin at all . in turn , it could make the situation worse . the nature of an advertisement is essentially determined by it mission , marketing the product for it producer . thus i strongly believe that all advertisement are doing exaggeration , more or le . since almost all risk generated by using the product are on consumer , therefore , consumer should do their own research when puchasing product , especially for higly valued good or important product for health .
