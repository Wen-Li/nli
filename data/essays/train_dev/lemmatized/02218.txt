i do n't agree that there will be le car in use in twenty year comparing to today . the history of car production and of ownership of a car show that the amount of car is rising and rising . ok you can say : `` but the bad enviromental situation will lead to le car and more to alternativs like public bus and subway ! '' but in my opinion this is not the way people will think . the most highest value for most of the modern people living today are mobility and flexibilty . you can go where ever you want , when ever you want ! further than that : you have to be flexible . it 's important for your job and to catch up with the speed the world is running . for example : i 'm working a a cinematographer since several year for different broadcast station . the medium of television became so fast during the last 15 to 20 year because there were such important invention like mobile phone and the internet . you can react on certain news much more faster than some year ago . when the medium is becoming faster the people who are feeding the medium have to become faster . following this line it is important to be flexible . one way to be flexible is to have a car . so at the end the circle is closed . on the other hand it is a must for the people to think about alternative next to the using of car . the raising of the amount of car on the street will lead to a traffic-collaps . in this case the gouvernment is also in charge to support alternative way of transportation . this can be in spending money on traffic research project or in supporting scientist who are developing new way of energy supply for car . at the end it will lead to more car but with alternative way of running them . fuel - and diesel-driven car should be reduced and instead of this solar , hybrid - or hydrogenic-based vehicle should be supported .
