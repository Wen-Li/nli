the topic of discussion today is whether it is good to travel in a group led by tour guide . i believe that travelling in a group accompanied by a tour guide is a better option for several reason . travelling in a group with guide enables u to visit all the place of importance which we may otherwise miss . it give u the opportunity to know about the place we are visiting in a better way than what we can do on our own . secondly historical place have certain history associated with them which we would never come to know if we do not have a travel guide . someone with appropriate knowledge can only guide u about the story behind various momuments . suppose if we go visit taj mahal in india without a guide we would just be able to see a building and would not know what it specifies on the other hand if we are accompanied by a guide he would tell u the story behind the taj mahal which would make it more interesting and attractive . moreover travelling in group make u enjoy more than what we can do alone and have better memory associated with certain event happened during the trip . we can have more people to share with what we are feeling and enjoy with . additionally travelling in group prof to be more cost efficient than travelling alone a the expense are shared amongst the group and one individual is not overburdened with all the expense . so we can conclude that travelling in group led by the tour guide is the better option for visiting place a it turn out to be more opportunistic and cost efficient morever we enjoy more when in group rather than alone .
