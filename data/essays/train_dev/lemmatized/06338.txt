unfortunately i agree with the statement because young people are not effectively so much helpful with their community . actually the most of young people think that if you do something in order to help your community , such a going for a walk with elder people , you are not considered normal . the conception of normality is not useful in this case . in fact while it should be considered normal if you give an hand to person who need it , you are defined a normal only if you show that your not interested in action like these which are more significant than doing only the thing that you want to do for yourself . the problem is that most of young people have an individualistic way to live their life . they do not think that it is possible to share time between fun and helpful action . personally i have not met many helpful people so far but one of this is my girlfriend . she decided to work a a volunteer in order to help people that can not do every day action because of their age or their disability . she go each day to the same person . for this reason she ha also built up good relationship with them and she assured me that it is an experience that she never felt in her life and it is not boring a most of the people think . they can transmit to you their volunty to live a they did when they were young . in the past i also thought to wirk a a volunteer during a few hour per week , but now i am attending the second year at bocconi university and i faced some difficulty to share my time between the school and this possibility . for this reason i hope i will be more helpful for my community in the future than i am now .
