young people and the community i think that i would have to agree with this statement , according to nowdays young people dont help or participate enough in thier own community , and i mainly think that this is because of the world today and it busy busy life . becasue nowdays a lot of young people ca n't even afford to loose time on playing or engaging in any kind of fun activity , because they barely can make it from home to college and from college to thier part time work ( if they have one ) and then going home again to do thier chors and finish studying and doing thier homework , which take a lot fo them dropping them beat on the bed at the end of the day . but then again this doe not apply on every young person , some people chose not participate in thier own community because they dont think that the community itself is not doing a good job maintaining thing at hand , and so they dont want to interfere with the bumpy road ahead . but also there is a quite fair amount of young people with plenty of free time who would love to help thier community to prosper and to feel good about them self a indivisuals in doing so , and not to forget that working pro bono for the community mean no money , and not mnay people who would want to waste thier time and not get paid in the end , so sticking to thier job is the better answer fo their time . so in conclusion , i do agree with the statment that young people dont give enough time to help thier own community , but in the same time i dissagree that should help the community and give thier time and effort away on the count of their future , but this doesnt emply on those young people who dont think and give much time about thier future or their community because they should , after all our community is what we have and what we stand for .
