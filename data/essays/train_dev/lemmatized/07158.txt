in my opinion the staement listed on the right doe n't consider the reality . the world is turning into a medical knowledge world . by that i mean that medication in this year save thousand of people in the world . the death rate in the world is decreasing time after time . nowadays we can compete with nearly all infection in the world , accept the hiv virus . but a we all know , also the hiv infection in the world are decreasing . people do care more about their health . the government encourages smoker to quit smoking , the usa help other country by providing them food . this all lead to an increase of population in the world . another aspect is that freedom of opportunity . in our year we do n't have slavery or other criminal action , besides war , that can lead to death . the usa and other country provide starving african kid with food and medication . they also teach them the knowledge which is general to u , for example using a condom to prevent the most known virus in the world hiv . more high economic countries help citizen of country with lower economy to share tequinical knowledge , which help these citizen to grow their economy . thus the people have a longer living time . through all these factor in my opinion people will drive more car than today . cars get cheaper , because the production of car will get easier with new tecnology . thus people will buy more car or some might have more than one car for themselves . in short term , when the population of the world increase the more car we will have in twenty year . we all know that it is comfortable to drive a car to get from one point to another . this will in my opinion not change in the next twenty year .
