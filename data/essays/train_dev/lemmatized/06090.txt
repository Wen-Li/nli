without question i agree the statement that young pepole need to perticipate in their community mpew . there are three resons for it : economical benefit , learning social ability and improving their personality . firstly , helping thir community is purly benefit to economic . if they take part in a non-profit group such a the one keeping environment good condition , the gorvenment do not need to spend the extra money in order to improve the environment . acording to the survey country where people help their community spend le money than country where not so many pepole help their community . for these reason , it is certain that we need to make young people help their comunities . secondly , helping community enables teenager to learn social ability . i used to help home which is for the old . before helping it , i did not know how to comminicate with old pepole . however , by helping them i begin to learn how to speak to old pepole and also i also understood that it is really important to talk with old people . but for this experience , hardly would i learn social ability . lastly , young people are able to grow by helping community . my brother wa used to be really rude . however , he become far more humane bny doing it . from this experience , i maintain that the more they take part in community , the better their personality become . for resons above , i would have to say that helping society is really important . nevertheless , recently young pepole do not spend time in taking part in community . consequently , they need to spend more time in participating in community .
