in my opinion it is not simply to say , it is more important for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact . i think it ha to be analysed by different view . clear , in general the student should understand the idea and concept . because if they would not understand the idea and the concept , it 's to expect that they wo n't be able to practizise the think , they should have learned . when the student get into the job , they have to reproduce what they learned in the university or school . and if they only know something about fact , they can not be very successful in what they do . every student should wanting to be successful in his job or in whatever he doe . if they do not care about what they do , they normally can not expect a life , what other student could have , cause the did a little bit more . so i think , that it is the better way for all student to understand more then only the fact of an individual topic . but there is another point of view . during the time of school or university , there are often time - period of test . some university have test - period , where the student are forced to wright ten test a week . in that case , it is not possible for every student to understand all idea and concept . it is necessary for the student to finish all test in the best way it is even possible . therefore , it could be a better choice to learn all fact , that you are able to finish all test . i think this is a typical problem for student , studying in the first semester . afterwords , during the main semester , the student have found their special theme , they want to work on . in that case , it is much easier for them to learn more about the idea and concept . in the main period of studium , it is much more important to understand the idea and the concept . so again , to understand the idea should be the task for every student but it is to accept , that there could be moment , where it is better to use the fact , to get a better result .
