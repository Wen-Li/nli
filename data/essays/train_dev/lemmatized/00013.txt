today , most young people are very busy about their work , such a studying , clab in the school , and thier some hobby . because of this , i think young people nowadays have le time to help community and they are not enough . my primary reason is that school work have made young people very busy . we have not only studying in our school but also club activity . i am a high school student now and i am in the drama club . when i go back home form school i have to do my homework , and prepare for the check test which we have alomot everyday at english and language art class , and also ihave to practice acting from the club . i am the main person of the next show so i can not quit practing . these thing made my very busy and not to even allow me to wartch my favorite tv show ! also , i think many yong people are not interested in their community very much . some of them doe not care about thier communitiy at all . i love where i live now so i do not understand why they think like that but maybe they do not have friend in their community or they think thier parent are enough to help community , so they do not need to . as you can see , many yong people are very busy about their school , and some of them are not interested in their community . therefore agree young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their community .
