i disagree with this because the thought doe not exactly consider the situation of young people nowadays in the modern community . and really doe not have support for it arguement . it will be acceptable if proposed that this is a general situation for all people but not for only young people . in the day we live life is getting harder for all , living is seem to be getting harder . people have certain need to survive like food , house and such like thing . moreover if the person is the only worker in the family and have kid she or he ha more responsibility . despite this most of them really try to work harder to help their community aware of that if thair community doe not exist this will also be the end of them and their child . as in my situation although people need to work to earn money for them and their family to live they spend all their energy to dig all the ground to live . but in such a bad condition too , they try to help others in the community . i have many friend that can run to help anybody that they do not even know before . a short time ago one my friend saw somebody shot in the middle of the street , after the voice and overcoming the shock he ha he run to help the man who wa shot . after his attempt everybody in the street came there to help . in such a dangerous situation too you can find more people than you aspected . they create group and team to participate in social work to help improving community . we have one of this team . and in this group i have met many people full of desire to change to condition not only for them in a selfish way but also for their community and for the human being too spending a really much time for only those kind of thing . this sentence ha absolute judge doe not mean sense to me . as having such experience i can not accept this thought .
