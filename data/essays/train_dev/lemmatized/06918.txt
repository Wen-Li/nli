johnson & johnson , a successful organization with lot of patented formula is inventing still more combination everyday . some of the project are a big success and some find the way in trashcans . i believe successful people try different thing and involve in a lot of risk than just running behind what they have already achieved . life is a series of good and unfavorable thing . no one can stop trying just because it ha risk involved in it . when individual endavor a task with lot of deligence some time they make it beyond axpected and some time fail . when people stand up to their life and give everythings they are more likely to become successful . successful people have the greed for success . they willput numerous effort and try out different method to make the thing happen . once someone becomes successful they also go through undetermined pressure to keep their work and give something extra to the community . brad pitti is a successful filmstar but he just can not stop at action movie such a `` ocean eleven '' he felt the need to show his art and success by proving his performance in `` babble '' ( a kind of offshore and intense film ) . though people are successful they try to jump further high and take risk and become more successful . astronauts have reached on moon but they di not stop there they invented the satelites which can remain in the vicinity and be usefull for age . `` newton '' successfully established his first law but he continued his contribution and work to the community by establishing two more law of totally different phenomenon . success is an addiction . in stock excahnge market people often engaged in different short term and long term bait and investment . once they are successful in one bait they explore the market more and tempted to take more risk for more monetary benifits . also when you get success to tend to think more positive about youself and try out many more thing which would prove beneficial . risk is imporatnt part of every task . evene if we start walking on road there is a risk of accident but world simply doesnt stop because life ha risk of death . moral of the story is successful people try out different trial and error for the sake of maintaning their success , and sometimes also to offer something new to the community .
