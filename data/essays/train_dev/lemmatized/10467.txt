i agree that people sould keep tring new thing nomatter they already know what to do , because of they keep tring new thing , and have new idea , it let u devolope many new thing , and when everything keep getting better , it 's mean that we are keeping process . they keep finding new thing , so our tecknowlege can be really good these day . because when the new thing come out people will use it for sometimes , but after that people will want to use better thing , so they will tring to find so more convenience thing to use . if people did n't try to make some new product , and people wo n't support them . like music , althout every composer follow privent composer , they still will try to add many differents idea in the music , or broke the rule , and built the new rule , than it will bring the music to the other peried . when we compered these day music and the romaness music . it 's not only the style very different . we can also find many differents interest thing on it , because we learn what 's the idea of the music before , and what we can do some new , or make the sound different , so music will keep changing by day to day . people have to keep tring the new thing and take new risk , not only doing what they already know how to do , that will let our life become very boring , because we want to make our world and our life better and better , not just staying at the some step .
