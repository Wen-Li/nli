you often hear that in the future there will be fewer car in use than there are today . i also agree with this statement . there are several reason why i think so . the first is that the cost to drive and posse a car would be much higher than today . because the price oil would get higher . also today you can see this , because in the last year the price for oil is exploded . and also the tax for car would raise because the government care about the environment and need money . so not every person will have the money to use a car . another reason why car will be get fewer is that there will be a lot of other option to come from point a to point b in the future . for example a transrapid will be built in munich in the next year . so many people would not use a car if they have the possibilty to go by the transrapid . and today many people research for new way of transport people that are not a bad for the environment a car are . a third reason is , that more and more people move into the big city to get a job . so there will be more people in the bigger city of the country . and in big city you normally do n't need a car . i think so because with the car you need su longer than if you user other possibility because there a many traffic jam in bigger city . for example a friend of me study in munich and he need with his car one hour to come from his home to the university . with the bike or the subway he only need half an hour . so i think many people will then use a bike or go by subway . for conclusion you can say , that there are a lot of good reason why in twenty year there will be fewer car in use than today .
