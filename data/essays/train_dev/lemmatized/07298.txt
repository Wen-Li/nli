certainly , these day it is said young people do not give enough time to helping their community . in fact , it might be dicreasing time that young people help their community little by little . but they still give enough time to helping thier community . i disagree that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their community . the primary reason is that a lot of young people work for community . parhaps the best example to illustrate this point is that where i live , in japan , there are farmer . some elder people do not have the person who succeed in them . so it must be difficult for them to keep on working . but young people like student of university or community college help farmer a lot . second , young people help the elder people in their house . there are a lot of elder people who can not do thing by him or herself in japan . the example of this is that many young people help elder people in their house and also in the rouzin home , which is the home take caring for elder people . young people help them to go to the rest room or to clearn them up with hot water or to make them eat easily . considering the above factor , i disagree that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their community .
