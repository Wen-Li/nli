a good teaching can adopt different form and pedagogic pathes , but the most appropriate way to learn efficiently lay in the method adopted , in order to understand thing , rather than simply learning them . at the very beginnning of our scholar ` career ' , we learn by heart a whole bunddle of thing : poetry , multiplication table , grammatic rule , definition , and so on . .. but most of these learning are ment to help u work faster without having to waste time in searching and understanding : this is the case for instance of the multiplication table ( even though we know how they work . .. ) . all these item are also usually the base to acquire a good memory and to enable u to learn more and more , always further . yet , in many case , learning by heart will not be sufficient if not accompanied by a full understanding . if considering for instance the case of a mathematics formula , it will only be efficiently applicable if it necessity and logic is understood , so it can be utilized appropriately . an idea will be better defendable or criticable if all of it argument are well known and understood . a concept will be optimized and well utilized if it functioning is evident and logical . moreover , being aware of the origin of an idea or concept , understanding it evolution and purpose , will help undoubtfully in it appropriation and memorization . it will help acquiring it own opinion or vision of it , a it entire process is known and understood . yet , other thing will not necessarely need to be understood in order to learn . some fact can not be understood , or their understanding would be way too complicated , useless and timewasing to enable u to advance in a learning process , depending on what the goal of the student are . in this case , one can learn without understanding , a it will help advance further in learning more and more , which is the main objective .
