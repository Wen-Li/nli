it is debatable that what is the better choice between having broad knowledge of many academic subject and specialize in one specific subject . some people say learning about many academic subject is more useful for their life because the more we learn , the more we can use during our life . however , i disagree that opinion because there is no enough time to study on specific subject perfectly and studying many thing ha no use in society . our life are too short to study one specific subject . if we learn about all of thing , we can get only a few knowledge from them . for example , when i wa young , i ha interest in piano , art , and taekwondo . i learned those of thing in same time , but now i have no much skill in all of them . today , i have a regret because if i had chose one thing among them , i could have one professional skill to show my ability to the people . so , we have to concentrate on one specific subject for more efficiency . in conclusion ,
