i really enjoy to plan my trip by myself or with my girlfriend , it 's a sort of pleasure for me to make research on the web about all the detail such a traveling , housing and main destination , so most likely i disagree with the given stimulus . when you experience a tour organized by somebodyelse there are many thing which are not under your personal control . many important decision are often taken by the group and i do n't really like to vote on thing when i travel , by contrary i like to spend time where it 's more valuable accordingly to my taste and personal interest . in addition i think that a guided tour usually present event which are designed for tourist . i still remember when i went to thailand with my family in 1991 and the tour guide basically wa always showing u cultural event and show which were very far to be authentic expression of the local habit . i prefer to manage my own time during the trip and do n't be bothered by any time constraint or scheduled appointment a usually happens with guided tour . thus i really like the intimacy of a romantic trip with my girlfriend , so i will eventually consider other option when i 'll be older .
