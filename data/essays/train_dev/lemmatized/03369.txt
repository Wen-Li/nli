there is a general discussion today on the issue of whether the most advertisement make product seem much better than they really are . as far a i am concerned , i agree with this statement . there are several reason i want to show you . first of all , the company need to make better advertisement to attract more people to buy their product . if the advertisement look bad , no one want have it . for example , the icecream seems very pretty in the picture or on the tv . in additon , in the advertisement when a person eats it always show amazing expressing because the taste is so good . from that , we do be attracted . so we choose buy one , but it always not a good a the advertisement . in the second place , when we saw the advertisement on tv or whatever other place , we may expect the real good are better than the one they showed u . it is obvious that our mind influenced u when we saw the realy one behind we already saw the advertisement . that the one reason why we often feel the product seem much better than they really are . the thinking of long for the better thing play an important role in our community . that why i believe this statement . i think also there are some advertisement may make product the same like they really are . however , the others which seem better than the real one are more outweight it . in conclusion , i agree with the statement that most advertisement make better than they are
