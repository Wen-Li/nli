in my opinion , young people have the chance to enjoy life more than older people do . first of all , i am convinced that young people have more opportunity than older people do . indeed , they have all the possibility in front of them . as they have no real responsabilities , young people can do what they want without thinking about their child or their job . moreover , we can denied that young people have a good health . so , they can travel a lot , discovering new country , doing lot of sport . hence some old people can travel but they have to face to their physical limit . the social life of most of student is particularly developed and active . i have the feeling that young people meet friend everywhere and everytime . the lecture offer the opportunity to see friend everyday . even if their family matter , they have the opportunity to live their root to enjoy new experience . they have no fundamental obligation . i am myself o good example of a free joung woman . in fact , i have recently decided to live my parent in order to do an internship in a big company in paris . i have two roomates with which i share lot of thing and we have the project to go to australia next summer to find a job a a waitress and improve our english . finally , i think that young people have le doubt and are le disappointed by the life . in fact , i believe that some experience could affect you and change your frame of mind . i have often remark this phenomenon for the old people . sometimes the lost of their friend or a member of their family could make them sad . given all of these point , i am really convinced that beeing young is a chance and offer a large range of opportunity .
