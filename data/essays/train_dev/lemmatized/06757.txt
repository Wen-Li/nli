i personally believe that one of the main trait of successful people , is their ability to try new thing and take risk , while keeping a very moderate and limited approach in life will probably diminish a lot the opportunity of a person . in my opinion the key aspect is being open to new idea , trend and influence because only by having an approach like this you learn about new thing , push your boundary and discover new opportunity . all of these require a fair amount of risk . i do n't neccessarily agree that the more risk there is involved and the better it is . i just think that by taking calculated risk a person could incredibly increase it 's chance for success . a perfect example is my grandfather . he wa a small carpet wholesaler in italy in the mid 60 's , when he realized that he could have made much more money if he went directly to turkey , and directly imported carpet from there . he wa the first one to do it , and when the other dealer heard what he wanted to do , most of them tought that he had lost his mind . it soon turned out to be a very smart idea , and within a couple of year he became the biggest wholesaler of antique rug in europe . i think that the approach that a person chooses depends a lot from it 's aspiration . not everyone want to become rich , powerfull or successful , some people are happy with what they have and do n't see the need for change . this is why they keep on doing what they already know how to do well . the problem is that if what you know to do well , for any reason is not good enough anymore you are in big trouble . some one could know very well how to use the telegraph , the problem is that today most people either use telephone , fax machine and email . these tool achieve the same thing , in a better and faster manner . the way that i try to leave my life is by bein open to new influence , trying new thing , taking calculated risk with the hope one day of becoming successful
