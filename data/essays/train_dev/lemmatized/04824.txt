one of the famous social institution amnesty international ha more member than ever before and the interesting thing about their member is that are more young people than adult which seems to negate the common sense that young people are egoist and prefer to do more for themselfes than for other people . the important and connecting fact on this diverse thesis is that there are more young people which are social engaged , usually work for different organisation , but also try to look for their own interest and career . there are a lot of pupil and student who work during their free time for non-porfit institution like place where homeless people can food , clothes or a place to stay during the cold time . and also there are many student who chose their subject on the university in social area like medicine or law to help other people . but the important distinct of now and the past is that the young people do not go to demonstration or show their politiacal understanding in the society like their parent twenty year ago . the young adult combine their modern life with own car and expensive clothes with social engagement . but in fact , there a few student who do not care about other people . but this fact depends on the way they are treated by their parent and they society they live in. to show social responsibility is something which must be learned . as far a i am concerned most of the young people try to show social responsibility and engagement for their community . they try to help their society with every little step they can do .
