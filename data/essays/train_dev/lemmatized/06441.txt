i agree this point that it is more important for student to undestand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact . because understanding concept make them to deal with the problem which are occured with that particular concept . let u take one example by learning the concept of computer we may able to use it in an efficient way . we are also able to deal the probles found with it . only the person who know about the computer can only deal with it . by knowing the concept we are able to have good idea about developing that concept . and we can creat a new concept . we are well experienced by knowing the concept concept undertanding make u to have more command and control over a concept than learning fact . we do not get experienced by learning fact . we only know about the thing and working about it . but knowing the concept we know the process of it and internal structure of it . by understanding the concept we can even try to work with the other field for example . if a person know about the programming language ` c ' he can also try to work with ` java ' because some syntax are same in both of the language . we cannnot have an idea by learning fact . they remain unchanged even after the many year . we may have new idea by understanding concept . we also become expert in taht particular field . by understanding the concept there is no scope of forgetting it . so i suggest student to understand idea and concept rather than learning fact .
