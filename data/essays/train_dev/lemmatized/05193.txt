to my mind the statement at hand is a very important issue to discus . from my perspective , it seems reasonable to say that successful people try new thing and take risk rather than doing what they already know how to do well . the first point to support my view is that only if new idea are put into practice , new field of study and area of business can start to exist and emerge . suppose , bill gates had not taken the risk to start his business at the start of his career . if he had not taken the step to try a new thing and to take up a business risk , he now would not have been the famous and rich person that he actually is in the presence . due to these circumstance ( his status and the amount of money that he ha earned ) , bill gates is now considered to be a very successful business person . thus , he is a perfect example to show how trying new thing can determine the success of a person . another argument to support the statement is the fact that in today 's highly competitive market it is not enough anymore to be good at what you are doing . competitors who will offer the customer better and more innovative service will steal the customer from business which are only good at what they are doing but which are not improving and innovating their service . an example of this can be seen in the fast food industry . if mc donalds had not reacted to the customer ' wish for healthier product , mc donalds would have lost it own customer to it competitor . therefore , one can see that successful business people continously think how to excel and how to outcompete their competitor . this , though , they can often only do by offering new service and good to the client . when trying new thing , the risk taken doe not only include a downside but in particular an upside potential . thus , when talking about riks of trying new thing , one also talk about the great outcome that a new idea can generate . as successful people are usually convinced that their new idea will be successful , the upside potential is very high in contrast to a low downside potential . successful people , one can add , try new thing and take risk considering the potential outcome beforehand . to sum it up , the above mentioned argument support the statement that successful people try new thing and take risk rather than doing what they are already good at doing . one could add to the statement that successful people consider the risk to be taken beforehand and thus decrease the downside potential of trying new thing . this combination make people successful .
