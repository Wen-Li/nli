is the number of car going to decrease during the next twenty year ? that is a question we have to study according to many point of view . firstable we have to determine if we have enough ressources like petroleum to make our carswork . we do n't have precise figure about that subject . that let u think that producing country prefer to hide them to make u think that it is not a problem . however the amount of petroleum is still decreasing . that 's why we can think that it wil have a bad influence on the number of car during the next few year . we may escape to this fate thanks to biotechnology . environmental effort should be made to transform a car into a le pollutant machine . we have to protect the ozon layer . researchers try to create oil thanks to some plant ' specie . it is an ecological solution to keep a certain amount of car on earth . but we will have to adapt car to this new oil and that cost time , money and need governmental authorisation to make it possible . another aspect which can inflence the number of car that will be used in twenty year is that every owner ha some habit . he us more or le his car . some people have to take their car each time he ha to make shopping , to see other person . they can do anything else than using their car . researchers ha to develop another way to move so that any physical effort ha to be provided . indeed , a man is not going to take his bicycle to replace his car just because of environmental reason . he will not be enough concerned about that . but if there is another choice to move , i think i will agree to try it . to conclude , i think it will be very difficult to decrease the number of car in the next twenty year mainly because of economical and practical reason . however , in my opinion , the environmental problem the number of car cause must make u react to create a le pollutant machine than car . everybody must to keep in mind that the whole planet is in danger and we have to change our behaviour .
