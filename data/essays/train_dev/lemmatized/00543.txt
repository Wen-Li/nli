the issue at hand is young people enjoy life more than older people do or not . i disagree with the idea that young people enjoy life more than older people do . i believe that older people like life more than young people do because of many reason . first of all , old people enjoy life more than younger person do because they know they are much close to death . they know very well the meaning of death and they will die in anytime . because of this reason , they try to spend their rest of life very effectively . on the other hand , young people feel that they ever do n't die and because of this reason they do n't aware the value of life . additionally , old people like life more than younger because they have many reason to enjoy life . for example , they generally have child and a wife . they need to care about them . they enjoy life because of her family . on the other hand , young people do not have a doughter or son . they are single . because they do not have any concrete reason to glue life , they do not enjoy life more than older people . finally , i think old people enjoy life more than younger people because their expectation from life are not generally big . they generally expect quiet place in peace with their family . this is enough for them to enjoy the life . on the other hand , a i am a young man , i have many expectation from life and if i do n't obtain any of them , i will easily hate from life and i will be depresed . i expect a good job , much money , brand new car . .. it is very difficult to obtain all of them at the same time and due to these reason most of time i do n't enjoy from life . ultimately , i believe that old people enjoy life more than younger people do . i believe this because , the life will end for them in a very short time later , they have many thing to do and many people to care , and they do n't have a lot of expectation from the life .
