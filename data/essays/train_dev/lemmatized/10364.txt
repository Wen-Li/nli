some people think that nowadays young people do not help their community a much a they should . i think this statement may be true for some people , but not for many other young people who actually make a great effort to help the community where they live in . it is true that modern society is becoming more and more individualistic , and this mean that more and more people only care about themselves , disregarding the life and potential problem of other people living in their community . this phenomenon is specially affecting young people , a they are growing in a society in which the most important value are realted with the personal achievement . the post a person occupies , the salary he or she recieves , the commodity of his or her house , the car , the clothes , and other material thing that a person may own are nowadays far more important than the ethic of a person and his or her behaviour towards other human being and the place he or she inhabits . however , it is not fair to afirm that all young people act in that way . there are many young people that really help their community in many different way . some of them apply for taking part a volunteer in program designed to help people with different kind of problem that range from disabled people , inmigrants , child who suffer from cancer , old people who live alone , and so on . some of them even travel to remote area in asia , africa and south america to enrole in international aid organization that deal with very serious problem affecting million of people in those continent , such a natural disaster , war and epidemies among others . summing up , because ot today 's society , there are some young people who are forgetting to take care about the others and their community , but there are many other young people who dedicate an important part of their life to help people that are in a difficult situation . in my opinion , everybody should follow their example .
