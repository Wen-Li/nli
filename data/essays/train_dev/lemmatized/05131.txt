in my oppinion product seem better than they actually are in advertisemets , so i agree with the statement . in order to make any inference about the advertisement we first have to consider why and by whom they are being produced . adverstisements are for firm that wish to increase the sale of a product . apart from a few exception , the number one priority for the modern firm of our time is profit making . thus the advertisement 's final objective is to increase the profit of the firm by increasing the number of good being sold . in that regard the firm want it product to look a good a possible on the tv , newspaper , billboard or any other medium which advertisement have infiltrated . to that end the advertisement maker is likely to show only the thing about the product that he think will increase it sale and a a result what the consumer see is not the final product but rather an idealised version of it . let me give an example to better explain the previous paragraph . imagine diet coke and advertisement about it . in those advertisement what we always see is good looking people , drinking diet coke and having fun . they almost always look good , are extremely happy on the advertisement . does it reflect reality ? obviosly what made them that good looking is not diet coke , a any person will admit , but hard training . or think of a man in an advertisement who just bought his brand new car . he is driving on the countryside away from traffic jam and enjoying himself a most a possible away from the real world . but in reality he would be stuck in a trafic jam most probably and not bu that happy . what the advertisement are trying to do is not giving information about the product , but rather trying to depict it in an ideal setting and make the consumer want it .
