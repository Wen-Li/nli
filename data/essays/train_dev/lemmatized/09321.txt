i agree that young people do not give time to help their community . recently , the world became very busy and the society changed drastically compared to 50 year ago . there are two main reason which prevent young people from helping their community . first of all , young people become very busy , they can not spend enough time in their community . for example , nowadays , young people go to not only school for studying but also private school . around 75 % of junuior high school and high school student in tokyo , japan go to private school twice a week till night . in this situation , it is very difficult for student and young people to spare the time in their community . moreover , young people 's life ha been changed . they play with their friend in the city not only in their community . the city ha been developed , and there are many entertainment , such a movie , internet cafe , and shopping building . this attracts young people so much and let them spend most of thier free time in the city . thus young people never come back to their communicty . second of all , the community itself ha been changed . nobody in the community doe not care local activity any more . 50 year ago , there were alot of local event and meeting in the community in even tokyo area . one of the reason of this is alot of people are moving in and out in tokyo because of their study and work , and people do not settle down . thus nobody will take care of local activity . on the otherhand , young people in the suburb tend to move out to big city for study and work and come back several year later , and naturally , they can not join or help their community . as a conclusion , i support that young people thesedays do n't give enough time to help their community because of luck of time and change of community .
