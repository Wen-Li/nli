now a day the young people do not devote their enough time for helping their community which they should do . a youngster should always help his community because they are the one 's who will help him if he will have any problem . they safeguard the youngster . from my point of view , the young people are not devoting sufficient time to the community . instead of this they like to party with their friend . some utilise their time in studying and tutions . some find playing game interesting rather than providing support to their community . the have now a day no feeling in their heart which the people in the past used to have for serving their community . they are unaware of the fact that the community is the one who is going to help them when in need . he should therefore work for it to take his community to great height and create a level for it i.e a separate entity . for example - mohandas karamchand gandhi wa not called the father of india like that only . he had suffered a lot in freeing his country from the britishers who were ruling it for many year . he did not did this all alone . slowly and steadily he gathered indians to support him and carried out several movement to rule them out . at last his country gained freedom on 15th august , 1947 after struggling for a few decade . the young one 's should therefore wake up from their sleep and help in strengthening freedom . the should not leave it at the stake . thus , the youngster view should always be on helping their community a guru nanak did for the sikhs . therefore the primary function of every people belonging to a particular community is to have the potential to do whatever his community requires from him . he should serve his community a best a he can .
