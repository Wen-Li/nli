the issue of the reliability of advertising is controversial due to the impact it ha on consumer and authority . on the one hand , company need to advertise their product and create awareness in their target audience consumer 's mind . but on the other hand , the actual market is constantly under pressure , a well a it worker who have obligation regarding the company they belong to . however , sometimes we could argue that enhancing the reality of a product in order to achieve good result and sell more of it remains strongly unethical . the first reason why advertiser should not make the product they are selling seem much better than it really is , is simply because they will not attract consumer on the long run . indeed consumer might try the product once but if their expectation are not fully satisfied according to what they saw in the advertising , they will not repeat the buying process . in the same way , by doing so , consumer will lose faith in the brand which is advertising . as a result they will turn toward more reliable company and product . this could have a very negative impact on the companie 's result . for instance , a company which would claim the efficienty of it washing machine amoung the other on the market without the actual benefit would certainly lose u increasing number of it target audience . as a conclusion , i firmly believe that advertiser should not allow themselves to lying to their customer so that they will gain consumer attention and trial .
