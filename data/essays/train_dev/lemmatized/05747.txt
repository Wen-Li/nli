in my opinion , knowlede is presently the fuel that is driving the engine of the global economy today . however , the exact nature of knowledge that is fuelling growth is new-knowledge rather than re-hashing of old knowledge . it is hence my assertion that this is the day and age of specialization . hence , i disagree with the statement that it is better to have a broad knbowledge of many acadamic subject rather than specializing in one field . success , in today world is monopolized my super-specialists . be it the investment banker who make million dealing ony in hedge fund , or a doctor who only treat with patient with one ailment . the human race in general , and science in particular , ha advanced so far today that it is impossible for someone to replicate madame curies unique achievement of being bestowed with two nobel prize in two seperate field . i would like to draw an analogy between acadamic knowledge and day to day life . in a marketplace there is a barber shop you go to to get your hair cut . in the same marketplace there is a bakery where you buy bread . the barber doe not know too much about baking while the baker is not really adept at cutting hair . the market place thrives , despite not having a barber shop cum bakery . if the market place can thrive using specialization how can acadamic knowledge be worse off by it . in any case knowledge is so infinite that what i ( and this hold true for even the smartest person in the world ) know , is but a small fraction of what i do n't know . if there is no chance that i am ever going to know everything regarding all the subject , why should i not choose a particular subject and master it .
