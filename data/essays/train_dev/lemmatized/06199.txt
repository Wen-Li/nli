at the beginning i would like to give a short definition for the three term idea , concept and fact . facts a the number and date behind idea , concept and theory . for if for example the `` theory of adverse selection '' wa published in 1957 by milton freeman , the fact are 1957 and milton freeman . the idea and the concept are the problem of adverse selection and the influence it ha on economic problem . my definition lead me to the opinion that i am supporting the statement in some case , for example in the field of business adminsitration , especially in marketing . for instance is the 4p concept about formulating a strategy for bringing a product into the market . to use this theory in practice , it is not important to know when and who someone established this theory . it is more important to know what the general idea is , the fact would only be a nice add on , in which nobody would be really interested . in the field of economics it is somehow different . as theoretical concept are the result of an idea a person had , it is quite important to know when and why someone concluded his or her idea in a theoretical concept . economical scientist often refer to each other , especially in microeconomics and macroeconomics . to understand each single theoretical concept , it is important to know when the concept wa published . the author might might have included the idea of another scientist , have used the other author theory to formulate his own theory or there ha been other external influence like war which affected his work . to conclude my statement i would say that the necessity of understanding concept and idea and learing the fact strongly depend on the field of study in univerity . it is a little different during high school . the target of high school is to provide a good general and basic knowledge for young people . here it is absolutely necessary to know everything , the date and the idea a well a the concept to get a good general overview over the society and the development for example in history .
