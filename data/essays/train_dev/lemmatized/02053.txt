i believe , that when student are exposed to many different information , many chose to understand only the information which attracts their curiosity . in this case , the other left over fact which did not interest them , are only stored for a short period of time . usually , these information are stored for sometime , but are eventually forgotten . this is because human are only capable of storing a certain amount of information in their brain . due to this fact , i agree to the statement , and believe that understanding of idea are more important than storing more fact . students are tested , quized , and marked for their knowledge in everyday basis . they have grade which mark their progress in learning , which affect their future , such a college application . in order to enter a desirable school , student are forced to learn information which might not interest them . for example , if a student wish to major in mathematics , he doe not need to learn about great poet of the english language . however , he will not chose to not learn these pointless fact . this is because it will simply affect his overal grade if he doe not learn them . basically , he is forced to learn fact which are not wanted . if they are not desirable these fact that are learned , will be forgotten . this is due to the fact that the student will not come back to these fact after learning them . there are massive amount of fact which are learned , but put to waste because they are simply not interested by the learner . in order to understand idea and concept , your mind must reach the deepest core of it meaning . this is a extremely difficult task , and many will fail without grasping the goal . however , if a man understands , it is highly unlikely to forget the idea or concept . this achivement will be kept in his/her mind , and at somepoint in their life , will return to help them . the experience is simply more real to them , thus they will be able to use it in everyday life . humans are not perfect creature , and their skill in learning have limit . they can not process , interpret , analyze information which are too much for them . in addition , if a person learns fact which are not desirable , or interesting , they will be forgotten . people do so , because they are forced to earn good grade with their super ficially aquired fact , so they can go to a better school . i believe this is a waste of time . if student understand idea , these are likely to be true knowledge which will never be forgotten . i believe that it is more important for student to understand idea and concept because they are memorable , and strong knowledge . undesirable fact are potencial `` memory waste '' , and should not be obtained forcefully .
