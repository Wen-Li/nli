in my opinion it is better to specialize in a specific subject or area instead having a broad knowledge of many academic subject , although it can be argued that a general education is also necessary . most obviously the goal of all academic education is to ultimatly give u specific knowledge and educate u in a particular area or subject . it is the reason why we go to university after secondary school . being a professional and knowing one subject thoroughly give u many advantage on the job market by giving u appeal to customer , client and future employer . after completing my undergraduate study i plan to get a master 's degree in law and study one specific area of the law . in today 's market , professional are getting more and more specialized because there are so many change , and so many topic and subject to study . when a client is having a divorce they will not go to a surgeon or a a coporate lawyer , they will go to a lawyer who specializes in matrimonial action , because he is more likely to help him , after seing so many client in the same situation . further it is not time sensitive to cover many academic subject and know them all . some people have more than one degree and spend their life studying and going to one school after another . they know about economic , finance or banking but it is not possible to know them all very well . in addition it can cost a lot to study so many subject and at the end not being able to compete with one person who spent le time in school but only know one subject . finally it is impossible to learn many subject and know them all well . it is a sign of lack of stability and indecision . some student spend their college year changing from one major to another and they can never decide which one to study . so they end up spending year in school and get discourage by the time to graduate and quit school in sum specializing in one subject is the best choice for me , although i would also like to learn about other complementary discipline like language sport and art and be able to exchange intelectually with other people .
