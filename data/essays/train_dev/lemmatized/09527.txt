i agree this idea . it is more important for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact . the student should find a new idea or new concept for the our future . if they learn only fact it is bad because they will be afraid from the fact than they can not to find new idea or they can not learn the concept . for example when my father start to fruit business he tell me about the business and some information about the money i said this is very big business and we can earn lot of money but when he started to tell me the fact i afraid of that business and i promise myself if started to work i will not do fruit and banana business . now i am 18 year old and i dont do that job and i can not find idea and i didnt learn any concept about this job i am very upset now and than i promised myself again and i will never learn the fact before i started the new job . i want to mantion about that now my father the best in the banana business because he always learn new idea and new concept . the student should learn and understand idea and concept . when we started to new project or new job we have find and learn new idea and consepts than i think we will see the fact . the life is hard and every time you have to learn something and you have to learn idea and concept .
