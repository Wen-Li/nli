travelling is the greatest opportunity one can have . it open up new horizon , expose you to different culture and open you to a realm of exciting possibility , all necessary to make you more open minded and a better human being . some say that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide . i strongly disagree with this way of travelling . though it ha the advantage of making the planning of the trip easier , a well a showing you the major attraction of an area in a short period of time , it negative point are too great to be ignored . travelling in a group mean that you have to follow a planned schedule . now we all know that different people have various interest , and this limit you in experiencing and seeing what you are really interested in . also , travelling is not suppose to be routine , you should be able to decide where you want to go and when , and be able to change your intinerary according to how you are feeling that day , or depending on the weather , etc . it is true that you do get to see the main attraction of an area when travelling in a group , but you do n't get to experience the culture of the country your are visiting . being surrounded by a group of people who roughly share your culture and social status doe n't leave a lot of room to meet local , be immersed in a different language , explore spot that are n't major tourist attraction , discover the cuisine of the country or it 's every day tradition . having traveled a lot , i believe that the best way to travel is without an itinary or a plan , being flexible and deciding your schedule according to who you meet along the way , your discussion with local , your interest and your feeling . is n't that what travelling is all about , discovering a new area and culture and learning more about yourself along the way ?
