i have mixed feeling about the statement `` mostly advertisement make product seem much better than they really are '' . not all ad are same . they may be made to lure the people for purchasing the product but may be educative and of help too . advertisements are always made fansy and appealling for pulling attention of the general public making them aware about the presence of particular product in d market . but at time when the product are not advertised it never reach the customer even though they are there in the market . i can suggest the above view by the following eg : my mother always used to complin this creepy sensation in her leg which would keep her from sleeping at night , we did everything even went to the doctor but he also could not help her much , till the time i saw this advertisement on the tv for restless leg syndrome and a specific medicine for curing it . i went back to see the doctor , spoke about it , got that medicine prescribed to mother and now she ha much better relief . so in short i can say that an advertisement educated me and helped my mother . they can be deciving too like if it say for eg that a particular will remove all ur scar or mark it may not be completely true though it may help to some degree . in the end i would like to conclude by saying that advertisement are basically made to market a product but it totally depends on the the wish of the consumer whether to buy one or not . so be an intelligent buyer and make smart choice , never buy anything by just seeing the ad but buy only when u have reseached about it and are convinced to go for it .
