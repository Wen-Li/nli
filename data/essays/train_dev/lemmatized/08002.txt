learning fact are important a well a learning and understanding idea and concept . but i strongly agree with this statement on how important for student to understand idea and concept than to learn fact . that is because if student learn the idea and understand the concept that mean they can use those idea a some kind of example to solve an answer . for example , student can learn about fact , but when it is time for them to use what they have learned like test or in some kind of social event , even if they know about the fact they wo n't be able to solve those problem . in math test student need to know how the procedure work in order to solve for the answer . but what if student know only the fact ? `` division wa discovered by . .. etc . '' these kind of fact wo n't help student to score well on their test . if student learn only fact , they wo n't be able to make their own hypotenuse or to learn how to study new enviornments by themsleves . most college professor learned the basic , in this case the idea and concept of how the thing work out and why they got that solution . if they did n't learn the idea and concept of what they learned and only learned the fact , they would n't have any idea what their doing during their new experiment or research . learning new fact are waste of time . people can learn fact while they learn and study idea and concept . reason why that is possible is that because through learning idea and concept people can end up learning few or more of new fact from their experience . so if student understand idea and concept that mean they are learning fact alone and without teacher yelling at them . when teacher teach student the idea and concept more than fact , student will probably do better in academically and socially . that is why i think it is more important for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact .
