i would support this statement . it is logic that advertisement let product look much more innovative und better a it , in fact , really is . look , if you were an advertisement creator and know innovation for this product , which should be emphasized , the thing , which improve the usage of it , you have to focus on it . let the commercial look like it 's an incredible invention made by the company and this only for the viewer of the ad . it ha to be attractive for the consumer , so that he think about buying the product . if there is a advertisement telling me , a a consumer , about the advantage and a lot of other thing , i 'd not think much about it , because it 's only one in a million of new thing . but by telling me the outstanding advantage , the product could attract me and so led me to a shop to buy it . to reach this point in the mind of people who see this commercial , you have to emphasize the improvement and even let them appear much better than they are in real . you can also use a comparison between the product , which you are advertising for , and another one . by doing this the other product ha to perform very bad , while `` your '' one act normal or even unbelievingly good . now letting the bad performance seem a the standard before the new advertised product were invented , creates also an overrated image of the new one . doing advertisement in this way is the only opportunity to led people to buy this and not another product . it is even the only way for a commercial to get recognized by the audience . the way how advertisement are made led to the statement that most of the advertisement produced make product seem much more better than they really are .
