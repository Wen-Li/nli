i agree with the idea that young people enjoy life more than the older people do . in my personal experience when i wa young i enjoy myself with simple thing like play football , riding bike , go to meet all of the relative in the christamns hollyday , and many other activity that today i consider boring . i think that the guy enjoy life more than the older people do because is the first time . the first time that i take the motorbike i think that one of the best day of my life . than today when i take the motorbike to go to the school i think `` oh no ! what distance i must do today ? terrible ! '' . i think that the caotic and full life of the old people do n't give the possibility for enjoy from simple thing like the young people do . an old people wake up on the morning and go to work early . at lunch hour he take an sandwitch and reuturn to work and in the evening she came to the home at seven ot eith o'clock , have dinner and the day after he restart the same life . i believe that she le enjoy life a an younger people that after only four hour of school in the morning come to home to have lunch and have all of the afternoon to do whatever he want .
