i do not agree that in twenty year the number of car in use would decline . the usage of car is directly propotional to the demand of car , which i believe will increasely significantly a we move on . here are some of the reason to support my point . first of all , the population of the world is growing for past several year and this trend is expected to continue . for this simple reason only the demand for car and their usage is bound to increase . secondly , a we are making more and more progress in technology , the price of the car would come down . also the economy of people is grownig and people will have more money to buy car at low price thereby increasing the usage . also with the advance in technology , the time seems to be flying more quickly and everyone try to achieve the maximum in a little time a possible . therefore people would like to switch to faster travel option such a car to spend time spent in travel . also , given the alarming increase in polution due to industrialzation , the polution after twenty year is expected to be unbearable . it would also lead to harsher climatic condition and hence pedestrian and two wheeler driver would have no other option then to move to much safer option such a car where utility such a airconditioner would be able to keep the air healthier and maintain a proper temperature . currently some of the people , specially in developing country do not prefer car because of problem such a traffic . but a the country develop over the next few year their infrastructure would improve substantially and traffic condition would improve considerably , again favoring car usage . to conclude , i strongly believe that a we make more and more progress in technology over the next few year the usage of the car would increase significantly .
