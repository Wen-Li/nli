i do not believe that younger people enjoy life more than older people do . however , i do believe that at each stage of our life we experience a different taste of fun and appreciate life in a different manner . when we are child under the age of ten , we have fun playing hide and seek , catch , and other similar game . as teenager we go out with our friend and enjoy our time at the mall . when we become adult we spend our fun time going clubbing or to restuarants , and a we grow older we have fun cuddling witth family member at home . at each stage we feel that we are enjoying our time and we do not really consider other option . have you ever seen a child prefer to sit with his parent rather than play in the mudd ? someone might argue that yes younger people do enjoy life more because they are more active and more energetic and that older people most often suffer from one disease or another . then i would have to point out that many teenager and child suffer from disability or illness . therefore , if somone is determined to have fun and enjoy his life , then what 's inside of him is what mattters andwhat allows him to enjoy his time or not .
