i think that in a certain way you can learn more from place if you go with a tour guide but probably will not be much funnier than going with your friend . also if you go with a tour guide you need to wake up at an specific time and be at that moment in the place he told you or if not you will missed that trip . i think that if i want to travel to a place i will need to analyze for what purpose i want to go . if i want to go only for pleasure or if i really want to know the turistic place and their history . probably i will decide to travel with friend but i will go to the tourism office to get information about the touristic place of the city and select which place we like the most and visit them . if the place will require a tour guide we will pay for it if not we will only enjoy the place and the moment . sometimes going with a tour guide make you feel bore because you can not go to eat or sleep at the time you want because you need to finish the program he have . but for example if i go to a city for few hour or only for a day i will choose to go with a group led by a tour guide because probably if i go by myself i will not have enough time to visit many place and know the city . in other word i can say that if you want to stay for many day in a place you can go visit place that seems interesting for you and later pay for the attention of a tour guide to talk you about the history of the city .
