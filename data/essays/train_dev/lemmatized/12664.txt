some people think that young people enjoy life more than older people do . but i do not agree with this statement . i will first give some reason why one could find young people 's life more enjoyable and then explain my reason to reject the statement . one could think that the life of a young person is funnier and that young people are happier , because in general young people have a lot of freetime . they often participate in sport and art . in addition , they go to a lot of party meet a lot af friend . furthermore young people do not have a much responsibility a elder people have . they are not yet compelled to earn their own money and sometimes they even live in their parent 's place and therefore have also le duty . but one should not forget that while having le responsibility young people have also le right . they are not yet allowed to take all their important decision on their own . in addition , they have lot of problem to resolve , such a passing exam , discussing with parent , making plan for their life . especially the latter might yield a lot of struggle , doubt and fear . therefore , one should not forget that also for young person life is not only fun . in my familiy i have two very good example of people who seem to be more satisfied and happy now than they were year ago . first i have to mention my parent . in my opinion they are very satisfied to see their child succeed in life and they take advantage of the opportunity a life without small child offer to them . they are travelling much more today than they did when i wa younger . thus they are also happier in their relationship . the same account for my grandparent . since my grandfather ha retired they are travelling a great deal and i think that they are really appreciating it . therefore , i do not think that people are le happy later in life in comparison to their youth . every age ha it advantage and it disadvantage .
