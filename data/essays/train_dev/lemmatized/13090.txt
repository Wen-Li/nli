i strongly disagree with the statement . it is not possible to establish a general rule a to whether the age of a person determines the intensity in which this person enjoys his life or not . to evaluate the statement against real life , we would need to understand how do we establish who is young or old , where the frontier is , or , if what the statement is saying is that the ability to enjoy life is directly related to age , for instance : does a person of 37 year old enjoys life more than a person of 36 ? in what proportion ? ( - 100 ) * (( 36/37 ) - 1 ) ? the extent to which life is enjoyed ca n't be accurately measured and should be determined individually , independently of age . as a person of 28 year old , i have met friend and colleague that enjoy far le their life than , let 's say , my mother , and she is 60 . while they are working 14 hour a day and spending most of their weekend sleeping and resting for a demanding week , my mother travel around the world , visit different place and enjoys a lot of activity that are commonly thought to be exclusive for young people . activities like surfing , playing tennis or soccer are enjoyed around the world by a lot of people above 60 year old . on the other hand , i have also met people around the 70 's , like my uncle , that are only sitting in their chair waiting for death a well a friend around 25 that live their life to the maximum possible and are always looking for opportunity for fun and joy . giving the above , how can we define if age ha anything to do with the way life is enjoyed ? i believe that age ha nothing to do with the level of joy and true happiness , and that none aside for oneself can determine they way one enjoys life . i could say that my brother , who spends most of his life surfing , doe n't enjoy life because with no money on his wallet he ca n't buy new thing , eat in fine restaurant and go to different place because he ca n't pay for gasoline , the truth is that if we would get to ask him , he 'd respond that he ha enjoyed life more than anyone in the world . in conclusion , i do n't think one can establish a general rule to determine who enjoys life the most . i would leave that question to be answered by each person .
