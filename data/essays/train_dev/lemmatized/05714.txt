i agree this statement that most advertisement make product seem much better than they really are for following reason . most of advertiesments are made of professional computer technition or professional team . and the stuff that advertised is not the only stuff we can get , we might can get better stuff . first of all , most of advertisement of cosmetic attract many woman . by using this lotion , many woman dream that we can get smooth and soft skin like this model . but the face of model have retouched by computer . so nobody can get the skin that have retouched by computer after all . i spent lot of money for lancom when i wa young . and i know i am a victim of this kind of advertisement . second , most of advertisement of food in the restaurant or fast food are better than real product . because when they make sample of food many professional work for that . for example , professional cook , food arrangement adviser , table arrangement adviser and cameraman work for that advertisement . but only part time staff work in real . third , advertisement of fashionable clothes or shoe are also better than real product . whenever celebrity wear new fashionable clothes , many magazine put that picture on it . and many woman of all over the world try to get same stuff and that cause higher price . if we can get same stuff , we can find same kind of stuff more cheap price at another place . when i got a bag that cameron diaz ha , i realised that . unless we have same style body or color of skin or hair , it doe not work for u . in conclusion , i believe that most advertisement make product seem much better than they really are .
