i agree with the point young people are not giving enough time to help their community . nowadays youngpeople are forgetting the social responsibility to help others . people who help others are becoming rare but some are there to help the community . young people are spending much of their time in studying or enjoying with the friend and they are thinking that they have to help others when they start earning money and they feel like improving burden to the parent by such thing . some wo n't bother about the community around them and they will just enjoy spending money without thinking about the parent . they are just enjoying their life without feeling any social responsibility towards the community . this situation is the impact of western culture . this western culture is increasing the lazyness in the young people . for example , the young people are thinking very much selfish that they only have to increase the knowledge and they only have to do earn good job and spend more comfortable life . nowadays young people are falling in love and without any hesitation they are doing crazy thing like murdering the loved one . they are not at all bothered about the community inorder to get their wish fulfilled . young people are the ` buliding block of the nation ' but they are not thinking like that and they are doing these type of thing . some people will feel their social responsibility towards community and they will help others . young people have to feel responsibility in the thing like ` gathering the people to the safe place at the time of draught and tsunami 's . they can also help the poor people by giving the economic assistance or showing some work to them to earn money and lead their life . young people can also help the physically handicapped person by giving them physical assistence in acheiving their goal . young should feel responsibility to help others and give their assistance to the community .
