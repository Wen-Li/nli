i think that it much better for a person to have a specialized knowledge of a specific subject than having a broad knowledge of many academic . because being specialized in one subjuct get you to know more about it and to be able to discus it easily and thoroughly without any problem , unlike having a broad knowledge of many academic because having broad knowledge leaf you on the suface of eveything not being able to dive in any subject . for example if you where in a conversation session or on a debate about something , having broad knowege would let you be able to talk for alittle bit with everbody using the thin layer of knowledge you have to discus stuff with people , but if you are specified in one subject you may be able to get into a deep intresting conversation . also being specialized in one subject give you better working opportinities than the opportunity given to broad knowledged people . because these day institution want specialized people that can handle complicatied i in buisness and life , people that can be put in hard situation wich they can handle easily without panic and to problem , and talking about money wise these institution pay alot more money for those specefied people . another thing is that when we talk about the career issue specialized people are always remembered and respected everywhere they go and thier name will not ever be forgeted , broad knowleged people they are not well known or at least the majority of them . for example when we try to say who is the best in chemestry of all time we have a name , or when we try to remember who is the best in math we have name . that doe not mean that people who have broad knowlege are bad or have le experience but i think that specialized people leave thier memory on the mind of others or they leave thier finger print on the book of history .
