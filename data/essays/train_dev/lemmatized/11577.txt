nowadays , it is more common to travel in a group led by a tour guide , but it doe n't mean that it is the best way to travel and discover a country . the fact that you are dependent of a group and that you have not the possibility to meet native people are reason which explain why i do n't think that travelling in a group is good . firstly , when you travel in a group , you are not independent . you can not visit monument and place that you want . you have to follow the group and the schedule which are provided by the tour guide . for exemple , if you want to eat in a specific restaurant , you have to ask the permission to the guide and come back in a specific time . another thing is that if you are exhausted and you need to have some rest , you can not not do it because of your appartenance to the group . secondly , travelling in a group led by a tour guide doe n't permit to discover the culture of a country and to meet native people . in general , when you stay in group , you have to go in a specific hotel . you have not the opportunity to sleep in an bed and breakfast . tour guide will show you the most common or famous place , but not the secret and amazing place of a contry . in touristic trip , you can not be immerged in the culture or be in relation with the abits of the native . even if yo are in a different country , you stay with people who are the same heritage . to conclude , i think that the best way to travel is to organize a trip by yourself . even if it requieres more effort , i am sure that you will apreciate your trip much better than if you travel in a group led by a tour guide .
