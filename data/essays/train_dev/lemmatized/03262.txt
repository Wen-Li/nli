according to the statement it is difficult to decide it is rue or not . for my opinion there are student who spend most of their time in community and on the other hand it give people who did not spend any time for helping them . first i disuss the positive thing to helping community . for example you are in a group of many people you have to listen to them and answer , you can talk about different topic . that is important for your future life , because in the job you need to talk in a group or highlight your personality . in the carrer life it is important for te bos that he know something from you . another thing is that helping our community is a social aspect . a very good example is in our family . when we help for example our mother in the kitchen , she can help u in other thing may be on doing our homework . when we do other thing for somebody mostly we get an good advice back . that help u also in our later life . but on the other hand there are lot of people in our society that have no time and no attention of our community . may be they work too long and than they can not meet an community . or some people mostly the younger one did not helping them because they think that is too boring . i think when they read the statement they think only about old people to help them . but more and more younger one join in a group to talk together about different problem or thing . in my opinion i think that are too many people have le time to join and helping people . but it is for their own help and for their own life . when they try it i think they are finding the thing good . finally it is good in our society that it give people whe ; like thi and other one .
