i strongly agree because i believe that if you manage to understand the main idea of an event , it will last in your mind and you will be able to remember it for a long time , and that if you just learn the fact of the event they wo n't last in your mind that much . an example that i believe can be given is when high school student learn about hystorical event , if they just memorize date , name and place they will be able to remember them just in order to aply them in a test , unless it 's a super important subject of history . but if they analize the situation , analize the event that ocurred and comprehend why did that event ocurred in the first place , they will like the subject more , they will feel a little bit smartter and the date , the name and the place will be left in a second place , so this will even help them when they will have to memorize date and such , because they will be able to associate the purpose and reason of the event with the number and the name . i believe that is not necessary for learning to be boring , if you just memorize everything and study just because you want to get a good grade , you are not doing the real purpose of learning , you 're just dealing with a lot of problem and getting yourself tired and bored . studying can be fun , if you understand everything you will feel smart , if you just learn the fact without actually understanding what they mean you will feel bad and le intelligent , so i think that teacher should encourage student to exceed themselves and to develop their intelligence and not to memorize a thousand book without understanding anything or withouth even learning thing that will truly be helpful in your life . people that are truly smart can solve a problem without the necessity of consulting someone else who 's supossed to be more intelligent , and if you need to read something a thousand time to actually get ahold of the idea you 're just a mere puppet and is pointless to live a a puppet because at the end of your life you will feel bad for having restricted your true intelligence .
