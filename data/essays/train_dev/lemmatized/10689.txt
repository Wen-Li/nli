i doe n't agree with the statement ` young people enjoy life more than older people do ' ! i think one reason is that there are some big difference between young people and older people because older people have other experience than the younger people ! you can not put them on the same basic . in my opionen older people enjoy their life in an other way then in their past . in the past parent were much stronger with their chlidren than today . older people enjoy their life with doing other activity than the younger people do . they have n't go to a club or a disco to enjoy their freetime . they do thing like travelling and walking around or reading interesting book or something else . when you are older you also have more possibility to enjoy your life because you may be have more money than the younger people . for me it is really terrible that young people enjoy life often in a very strange way . often they have to drink alcohol or putting drug into their body to have fun ! for me it is not a way of enjoying life . for example there are my parent . in their younger life they did n't enjoy life like they do it today . that is because they became mum and dad in their younger day and so they were n't able to have fun like teenager or young people in nowadays . but today their childern are adult and do n't live at home , so they are able to make holiday or go to cinema or something like that whenever they want to . i think that is a good way of enjoying life and freetime . to give a short conclusion it is important to enjoy life when you are young and when you are old .
