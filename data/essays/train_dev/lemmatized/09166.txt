i do agree with the following statement ! i think that older people are n't in form enough to do think that young people do . . young people can do want they want to do . older people must always think of their body when they do something . for example older people must always think about where they will do their next holiday . they must always think about if there is an evaliator in the hotel or other impotant thing referring the hotel . young people can go where thy want . most of them never have to worry about their health and body ! another important aspect to explain my answer is that i think that young people always think about their dream and futur . of course older paople do it too , but they know that life can end soon for them and young people always know that they have still the entire life to realise their dream . young people also can always do their sport they would like to do . i think that sport activity are very important for having a satisfied life . so i think tht old people can not do the same sport activity i do and therefore i conclude that a life a an lod person doe n't seem to be excitng and interesting for me . all in all the are a lot thing that either young people or old people can do , but i thing that there are also a lot thing that older people can not because of their body or health . even if they were able to do the same activity a young people do , i think that the quality of doing the activity is gone . the same is with an old horse . an old horse can run , but it can not run a fast a a young horse and it definetely will not able to jump high in the air a a young horse . referring this example to human i want to explain that when you are old you will loose a lot of the life quality . therefore i can just agree with statement , because you can just enjoy your life if you have a good life quality !
