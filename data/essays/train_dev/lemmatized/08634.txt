every time i have the opportunity to travel i like to travel by myself , but sometimes i also like to travel with a group led by a tour guide . when i decide to travel by myself i make a little research about the place i am planning to visit , in that way i can know what place are the most popular , where are the cultural and archeological zone . after that , i make a schedule with the place i would like to go and the route i should take . traveling like these allows me to learn more about the place i visit . if , on the other hand , i decide to join a group led by a tour guide , it is a different expirience because i am traveling with more people and by doing that i can share my anecdote and expiriences during the trip with other poeple , and i can also learn about the place by listening to other people story . in my opinion , if you want to do a little more research about the place you visit it is better to travel alone but if you only want to enjoy your trip , you can join a group . i like traveling by myself and with group , so i have to say that i partly agree with the statement . i agree because traveling with more people make the expirience better tran traveling alone but i also disagree because sometimes , when traveling with a group you would have to follow the direction or the order given by the tour guide and sometimes that just not what people is looking for or sometimes you will want to stay for a little longer but the schedule of the tour guide will not allow you to do that .
