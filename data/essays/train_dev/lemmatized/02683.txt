at the begining of 19th centry , the fisrt advertisement appeared in the public life . in fact , certain good are meant to described a much better than they really are . however , in my personal opinion , i believe it is not fair and logical to just simply say that the ad maker are over promoting their good . first of all , human being are the animal that full of desire . we want ourselves to be respected and popular among others , so we usually willing to pay to help u make that target . for example , most of u using shampoo to wash our hair everyday , and we believe this matter is able to make our hair look better and cleaner . yet , is that true ? is there any science data ever prove that shampoo can clean up our hair ? look at the tv show , magazine and internet again , there are still full of sixy woman who make themselves more charming by using certain brand of shampoo . as soon a we believe tthose advertisement , and presuated by them , we will go stright to spend money on buying their good . and at most of time without even a reason . also , if you pas by a fancy shopping mall and see the huge ad of a sport star wearing a pair of nike sport shoe and look so happy and cool , wo n't you strat to have a idea of `` wow , that shoe look so good '' ? even so , is the truth truning out a a pair of nike shoe is the reason that we become cooler and happier ? easy enought , the answer is no . actully , it is not the game of advertisement make most of prodeucts seem better , but persaute you by connecting different signal and message into your brain so you will own the idea of would like to have them . such a the shampoo and the pretty , sixty girl with their good looking hair , and the sport shoe plus the cool looking sport start . therefore next time , if you see another great-looking product advertisement that make you own the desire of buying , think twice about are those good really that good , or just yourself is simply thinking that way .
