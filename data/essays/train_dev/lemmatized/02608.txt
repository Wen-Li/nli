the issue of knowing if young people enjoy life more than older people do is a interesting one . on the one hand , young people are certainly healthier than the older . but on the other hand , older people have a lot of free time to enjoy life . however , my firm belief is that it is easily to enjoy life for the young people rather than for the older one . firstly , we have to think of the matter of the health . it is an undeniable fact that young people are in general healthier than the oldest . for example , it is easily to do exercise when you are young . indeed , a lot of old people do have disease which make them not unable to do what they want . therefore , if you really like a sport , you will be more able to practice it when you are young . secondly , young people do not have a long experience of life . on the whole , youth may be considered a the time of discovery , and there are different discovery . some young people may want to travel all around the world , for example . of course , it is a fact that generally , old people have more money than the youngest . but actually , it doe not matter ! when you are young , you may think that the comfort is not a prevalent point in a trip . whereas most of young people , old people may have difficulty to travel a lot , just because it is really exhausting . last but not least , young people may enjoy life more than older people just because they have le thing to matter . for example , a young people doe not worry about his job , about what he ha to pay or not each month . a young person ha not lived his life yet , and a lot of opportunity are openned to him , he can still decide what is life will be . to conclude , i would like to say that young people do not often enjoy life more than the older , even if it may appear quite obvious . there are also a lot of way to enjoy life when you are old , because you often have more free-time , and you have much experience than the youngest . you can see your child and your child ' child growing , and i think that is one of the beautifulest thing in the world .
