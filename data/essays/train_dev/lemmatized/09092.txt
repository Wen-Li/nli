while many people think that it is more important for student to undertand idea and concept that it is to learn fact , i think that a stronger case can be made by pointing out that learning about fact and real case of life can give the student the opportinity to re-live togheter with the people invloved in those case the situation which they went through . it is important to undertant well the concept but nothing a study a real case . learning case method lead the student to a group of posible solution and teach them how those solution affect the final result . however to get involved in the fact and real life case , need a previous preparation obtained not only by the well understanding of idea related to the fact , but also by the study of all the material concerning the case . in many university program , the profesors make a well balance combination of both method and they obtain very good result . first they prepare the idea and material to be learned by the student and after they present the real fact . it permit the student to apply their recent acquired knoledge and give their best result in order to reach a solution . not only the result gived by the student , but the final solution is then compared with what really happend . it allows student to know wich solution to the problem wa right and wich one wa wrong . a survey made by people maganize by the end of the year 2002 , shown that the learn real fact method had a better approach of the right solution to a specific problem that had the traditional method of just understand the idea without application . there also exists thoudands of study that support this topic . for that reason i think that undertanding idea alone without application in real life , is not much a good method a it is the applicability in already lived case .
