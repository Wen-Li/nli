i agree with that understanding idea and concept is more important than learning fact for student . there are some reason to surpport my opinion . first of all , think about the ordinary thing . for example , a we all know , the water becomes a ice at the point of the temperture is 0 degree . this is a fact and it is common knowlegde . however , how can we understand the fact ? we understand the fact by knowing the idea . almost people have taken the science class when they were in school and learnt about the temperture . they might have done some lab and seen the idea of the fact . seeing the idea is effective to understand the fact . secondly , in an advertising . i have learnt about marketing , and i realized that the fact is the only the fact , and i have to know the concept of an advertisment . i had n't known that the knowing the concept is very important to improve my skill of advertisment . i always tried to think about the concept of advertisments . even i did n't understnad the meaning of the advertisments , i could know the fact of the advertisments after i researched the concept of the advertisments . i then gradually became to be able to understand the fact of the advertisments . therefore , i needed to know the concept . this is helpful to creat the advertisment to me because i have to think the concept so i needed to learn about the concept . for these reason , i think student should understand idea and concept well . it will help them when they have to think about the fact . i also think that the fact is the only fact , it is not well-understanding if student do n't understand idea and concept . therefore , i think that it is more important for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact .
