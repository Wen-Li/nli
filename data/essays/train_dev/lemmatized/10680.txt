i disagree with the statement that `` young people tend to enjoy life more than older people do '' because having a fulfilling life doe not depend of age a people can have the same activity or responsabilities . although many people would believe that age is a factor for happiness , this is a false statement because older people can enjoy life by having the same activity that young people have . many adult might not see hapiness a simply partying or having holiday ; however , this doe not mean that they are unable to do these activity . adults tend to value thing that young people do not see a part of their daily hapiness ; such a , having a family . and , they choose to stay home with their family instead of going out with frinds to the closest pub . nevertheless , the activity someone doe depend on personal choice and should not be confuse with matter of age . other people believe that young people enjoy more life because they have le responsabilities ; however , this is not completely true . with globalization , young people are facing more challenge everyday . they not only have to obtain the best grade they can get at school to secure a future job , but also they have to become self-relient at an early stage to help paying for their education . on the other hand , adult are seeing everyday people better prepare in the workforce , and they have to return to the classroom to obtain more knowledge which is a responsability that many people associate with youn . in this way , adult do not necesarily have more moral or monetary responsabilities than young people that avoids them to enjoy life . in conclusion , for people to enjoy life should not be seen a a matter of age because anyone can choose to have not only the same activity , but also the same responsabilities . heppiness depends on free will which all human posse .
