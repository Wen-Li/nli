in fact , people usually think that life is more enjoyable when a person is a teenager . i actually dont agree with this idea . i think it depends on the personality rather than the age . in this passage i will try to explain my opinion . first let u have a look at the period of life . a child usually seems happy with his or her toy . and a young boy may enjoy the time that he spend with his girl friend . a young lady may find her hobby or interest after her work time . an old lady may be very happy when she is with her grandchild . these are really a sight through the window of an optimistic person , are not they ? thus , it can easily be seen that a person can enjoy the life at any age . although these example can be expansed , we can sometimes ran into pessimistic people . when an optimistic person can be happy with his bicycle , small but pretty house etc. an optimistic can look for the way in order to be worried . this kind of somber person usually copmplains about unnecessary thing like not having much money , not being a famous person , etc . i think , this kind of pessimist people cant be simply happy even if they are 17 year old . from this it can be concluded that i dont agree the statement and believe that a person at any age can enjoy the life . i have talked about the period of life and gave example of both optimist people who enjoy the life and pessimist who make life harder unnecessarily . according to me , every person may not enjoy life a much a others , however , it shouldnt be forgotten that every age give the same chance to enjoy .
