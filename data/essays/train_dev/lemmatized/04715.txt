over the year there ha been an increasing number of car in use thanks to the new technology which provided new motor and ha enhanced car ' security . such evolution ha lead to reduce the price of car which turn out to be one of the main reason why car have become so commun . however the way car harm the environment and the high price of oil can lead to reduce the car in use in the next twenty year . indeed the emission of noxious gaz from car are at stake in the greenhouse effect . that 's why the environmentals movment tend to inform population about the serious impact of thesis gas . therefore they try to prevent people from using their car . they advise them to take bus or subway instead of their car . otherwise we can also point out a serious variation in the oil price . since a few year the price keep on growing and is now so expensive that people can not anymore afford for it . it is over their mean . so they have no other option than stop using their car . fortunatly a solution is being developed which could solve both of the two main problem explained above . i 'm talking about the new bio-energies which are biological oil to use instead of petrol . this kind of oil could be used by every car and will only cost 0 , 80 cent of euro wich is a great stride toward oil price . besides this new oil is natural and doe not harm the environment . the bio energy are expected to be in sale in 2007 and are presently developed by ' gaz de france ' conserning the country . to conclude we can notice that solution have been found to solve problem which could explain an eventual deacrease in the car use in the next tzenty year . according to me that wo n't happened
