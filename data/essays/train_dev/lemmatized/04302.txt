understanding idea and concept and learning fact are two completely different approach of learning . both have advantage and disadvantage and serve more or le on different subject . from my point of view it is more important to understand the idea and the concept than to know simple fact . to understand the world , how it function and why some thing are the way they are it need a lot of knowledge . there are so many event and factor that shaped and still shape the world and the people that the human brain is to small to now everything in detail . that is why it is much more important for student to get the skill to work with information . the ability to analyze a subject and to bring it in order with the general frame is much more important than to know a thousand fact . in some case learning fact might be the better solution for teacher to test how much their student work for the class and grade them easily but this knowledge wo n't last very long . it ha been proved that something a person ha learned actively , like thinking about it and discussing it , last longer than thing that have only be learned by reading and hearing . i think the best way is in the first year of education of a child to give him the basic information and teach him the skill . in the university the student should only be asked to understand idea and show that by working in an academic way .
