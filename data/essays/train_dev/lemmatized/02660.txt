i agree with the statement which indeed result in the student future and this is important for the student that understanding idea and concept is more important that it to learn fact . according to my concern i will say that if a student is perfect or atleast having the basic idea of what he is intrested then he will be the eligible person to learn the fact , it may be any thing like studying about archietecture or concern about sport and intrest in discovery or else studying about a computer programming all this type of quality are need to know about their fault and advantage and when a student is enough to learn then should learn fact on their particular stream . i agree only if a student is having particular quality not like a child coming to u and asks u to teach me computer programming it just can not happen in every situation and when a student without having any concern of playing the gittar and he just want 's to give a play on his concern of intrest than if u allow him it will be a great problem , similarly many such kind of situation are there which just can not lead learn fact it should be a step by step process then only he will acheive the concept in his intrest . other kind of situation which i intend to present in my essay is if some student who are intrested in many thing and will achieve the greater height are those only who work hard and they learn through step by step process only but the have practiced a lot which inturn produced them to reach victory , it not like that if a child learning the concept of addition in his math subject and sudenly when he looked his elder brother note and want to intend to solve division concept which is at that movement difficut for a child but when he study step by step he will be th eliglble person who can achieve fact quickly but not knowing the idea of the particular subject or view . so according to me i belive that every student should have particular idea in the field of their willingness without any idea their is nothing to have a particular learning , what ever it might be but the student should have some knowlege regarding that
