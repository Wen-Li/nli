there are several reason why i agree with the proposed statement . first of all , because the ability to understand the esence of the information provided in school will give the student the possibility to apply that knowledge to a many situation a they have to face in the future . meanwhile , knowing fact will just provide them a mountaion of rarely useful information . in fact , the comprehension of the idea and concept should be teacher ' primary concern . learning fact can be useful for life , but much greater is the importance of understanding of why those fact happened . during the practice of my profession i can remember a large number of opportunity in which i took the example and explanation given by university professor . even when at the moment of learning the i did n't give them the importance that they deserved , eventually they turned out to be valuable asset for my career . probably , that is why some good advice will never be fogotten and will possibly be applied to many up coming experience and situation . personally , i find very difficult finding the esence of thing . mostly i chose the wrong way to solve problem of my life and profession . actually , that can be the main reason why i have n't gotten to the top yet . usually the most important leader are those that posse bright mind , so bright that they get to see thing in a different way the normal people do . in other word , they are able to see the most important aspect of the issue they are facing , while the rest of the people just get to see matter that surround the most importan point . i think that i will probably spend the rest of my day trying to understand the idea and concept with which i have to deal in both , my life and my career . in short , i will always recommend young student to learn and understand the concept and idea they have to study , otherwise they will have just a great amount of useless information .
