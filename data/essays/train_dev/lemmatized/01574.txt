people often say that giving is receiving . a lot of people argue that nowadays , young people do not give enough time to helping their community , to help people . first of all , we will see why it is possible to argue that in our society , people do not open up to the others , that young people are not engaged for helping the others . then , we will point out that in the new coming century , a lot of people give time to their community , that they do not hesit in involving in program opened to the others . on the one hand it is possible to argue that the society we live in encourages people to live without looking around . everything go fast , everything is turned to the financial aspect of the existence . thus , young people hesit to give some time to their community because they do not see what the community can give them in exchange . nowadays , the process of profit is the origin of the lack of involving of young people into association or into charity . a lot of association need young people to act . but unfortunatly , a lot of these group only receive help from senior . for young people , they just have to give to the other , who is also able to give him something . that is the reason why it is possible to say that young people really hesit to give time to their community . on the other hand , it is also evident that young opeople are today definitly involved in several group aiming at helping their community . indeed , a lot of these young people join every year some student association , some group aiming at helping homeless people , or disabled citizen . today , after each crisis like a war , or a disaster just like the great tsunami or katrina in the us , young people activly help the others . they often are the origin of several movement . as far a i am concerned , i believe that young people know how to act and that the way of actinfg are nowdays differents than some decade before . young people are creative and do not hesit to give time to their community . the way of acting for junior is different , but it is still the same idea : giving is receiving .
