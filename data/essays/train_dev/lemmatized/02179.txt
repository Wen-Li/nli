the issue at hand is whether understanding idea and concept is important for student rather than learning fact . this is an important issue because the essense of education is not `` whats '' only but also `` how '' . in my opinion , i believe that student need to understand how thing happen rather than only learning fact about these thing . this is because of different thing . first of all , some student are not satisfied about just learning and memorizing . thus when the professor explains how certain thing happened , the information will be stuck in the student head and they will have no future problem for memrizing some fact . for instance , when it come to engine , it is not likely to know only what engine are but how they work . this will help in fixing both the result and the fact in the student 's mind . moreover , when it come to real life , student will eventually start practicing what they learned in academy . some student will maybe forget some fact but just when they remeber how the professor explained this subject or how it work they will be able to work accurately in their real life . thus , understanding idea help the student to accuretly apply what they learned . furthermore , some fact could n't be learned unless understandable . this is the fact of many physical theory . for instance , professor can spend a lot of time explaining what current is . but student need not know fact about current but they need to know how it work to know where it field of application is . as a result , it is important for student to understand idea rather than learning fact . this is because this will help them in their academic , future career and the field of application
