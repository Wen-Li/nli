i disagree that car will decrease at society after twenty year . i have three main reason for this : environmental problem , lacking of space to park car and reducing fossil fuel . first of all , today , car strongly effect to environment . thus , the goverment may restrict the use of car . for example , automobile emit a lot of carbon dioxide . according to research of environmental ministry , second of all , increasing population , there are no land to park car . it mean that house for living people will be built priolitily in free space . finally , fossil fuel for car may shrink , because the industrial structure , factory , power plant , and so on , are more important for nation . for these reason , i disagree with the idea that there will be fewer automobile than there are today .
