if i wa asked some detail on the exam , i wrote last week , i probably could n't remember a lot , although i spend quite an amount of time on preparation . is n't that a hint for the necessarity of changing learning requirement and student education - in my opinion , the teaching of basic qualification concerning the achievement and comprehension of knowledge and thinking is the more effective way to a fluent , highly adaptable intellectual ability . being able to understand idea and concept is a capability which is required in nearly any kind of intellectual situation . to be capable of the most important tool in dealing with academic material which maybe catching the main idea of a text , summarizing basic point , understanding the intention of an author or speaker , etc. is the basis for any kind of apprenticeship . unfortunately , this qualification play a subordinate role compared to the learning of fact . of course , fact are also of importance to be able to treat a certain topic , but without the ability to integrate single fact into one 's fluent knowledge , they wo n't last in mind for long time . being able to use the basic tool for dealing with any kind of knowledge presented will strongly improve the ability to find out important fact if needed . like one of my teacher told me `` you do n't need to keep any fact in mind , but you need to know where to find it if necessary '' , it is important to konow about source and connection between them - which mean their basic idea - while dealing with any context of apprenticeship . as described above , i think , student should get familiar to understanding idea and concept , and even to develope their own one , because this will allow them to deal with unknown information und context . as especially at an early age , the human brain is able to develope , it is very important to implement basic competency of learning and thinking at that time . the fact will be learned , when the basic concept are clear .
