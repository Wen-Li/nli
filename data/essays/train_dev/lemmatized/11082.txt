i believe that the issue of whether or not you should have a broad knowledge of many academic subject instead of specializing in one subject depends on your plan for your future career . if you plan to study a subject and gain a much academic degree a possible in it , you may think of becoming yourself a part of the faculty staff , maybe an academic teacher or even a professor . in such position you should have a broad knowledge in your specific field of study so that you are able to provide the student body with an excellent education . you also have to represent your department and thus seem very competent and confident concerning your `` speciality '' . on the other hand , i think that this field of employment is rather limited and much more student will apply for job in enterprise or other firm . we live in a world which is characterized by growing globalization and a tendency to change faster and faster . in such time you should be able to adapt to an ever changing environment , for you can never be too sure of your position . you may be asked to do additional work which ha nothing to do with the subject you studied at university . it is expected that a modern employee is able to improvise and to be open to change . as in these time of modern medium the time we need to acquire certain information is much le than some year ago , we are expected to have a broader knowledge of the world , especially in the field of history , politics and culture . the world is a melting and meeting pot of culture and country which struggle to keep update and remain or become a leading nation in this world . for that reason every citizen ha to play his part in economy , and he play it best if he is flexible and able to solve any problem he face whether it is part of the subject he specialized in or not . in my opinion you should try to gather a much knowledge a possible and the best way to do that is to study many academic subject and everything that you are interested in a well .
