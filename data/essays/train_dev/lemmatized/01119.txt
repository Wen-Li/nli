with time generation start living on different life standard where they start looking out for them self more than their own community . the meaning of democracy came from the latin word democratus which wa writin by aristotle , a famous greek philosopher . the meaning of democrasy is when a group of people are working for a common cause to help their own country or civilization . i think that people today areussualy more keen on helping their own desire even if their own desire can interfere with other people standars or affair . darwin 's theory `` survival of the fitist , '' is what basically going on in the world today . i for one like to help both the community and my self , but i would stop helping the community if doing so will effect me personnaly . one thing i have noticed is that helping the community is in such a low level , that most school require community service in order for a student to graduate , forcing people to help the community is a great sign that people are not really paying attention to their own community . helping the community can come in many different form ; polution , respect , civilized behavior and following the rules. a person can help his community by buying unleaded car causing le smoke in the enviroment , another problem that can be characterized a polution is littering , i have watched many people in my community litter a the government doesnt have strict rule for people to abide by them . respect between people in the same community is quite necessary where a person should never fight another person or argue , which is good for communal stabilization . people should work harder on helping their community instead of their own , because by doing so your benefiting yourself and the people around you inderectly . if the community is shown a a a quiet peaceful community then the urge to benefit one self will become le , for other people can be benefiting you .
