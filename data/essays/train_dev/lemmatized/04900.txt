the issue at hand is , whether it is good to travel alone without a tour guide or in a group that is led by a tour guide . this issue is very troubling to me because there are so many people in the world who enjoy going to different place by themselves without a tour guide although they can afford one . but i 'll support the tour with a guide with a group of people because sometime you can find many good life long friend in a group and many beautiful scenery that you can not see without the help of a tour guide . i prefer the best way is to travel in a group led by a tour guide because a tour guide can give you a lot of information about the place you are going to view . you can not find that information if you are travelling alone without a guide . moreover , if you are travelling in a group you will actually enjoy the travelling & you would not even know about the time that you spent for travelling . on the other hand , if you are travelling alone without a tour give you can cause trouble for youself sometimes . for example , you can not find all the sight scenery without a tour guide & it will be a great hassle if you are travelling alone in a taxi without knowing anything about the city you are visiting . second reason why a grop travelling with a guide is preferrable because of the economic figure . for example , suppose you are travelling alone without a guide it will cause you to spend a lot of money if you do n't know the visiting city well . on the other hand , in a group tour all the participant pool money so that every individual ha to pay a little amout of money . furthermore , travelling by a group of people can enjoy their travelling a lot instead of a single individual . in conclusion , i 'll say that travelling in a group is far more exciting experience a compared to travelling alone withot a guide . i believe this is better option because it is economic , exciting , worth spending money to travel with a bunch of people rather than alone .
