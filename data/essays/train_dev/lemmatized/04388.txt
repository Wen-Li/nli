the statement , `` it is more important for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact '' , is a controversial one , but personally i agree with it . thera are many reason for my to believe that idea and concept are more important when student are in a learning process . firstly , when understanding and idea , you should support it with a wide range of example , but all the fact that could be mentioned are never more worth than the idea itself , just because is the idea the main source for all the fact . consequently i understand that the comprenhension of the idea is the key for all the fact . on the other hand , i really belive that concept , even though when they are drawn through empiric example and high complicated laboratory experiment , will be always concept . as a matter of fact , those concept will be ready to be applicated on any new fact . so even though we learn from fact and experience to get empiric conclusion and therefore new concept , i have observed during my life that concept will remain over any fact . besides the argument listed above , i also support the rule of being up to date on learning idea and concept because understanding the cause you will always ready to discover new fact and the insight reasoning of them . otherwise we could get lost in a pool of number and figure without knowing how to solve many question and challenge and turning an easy situaition in a difficult problem , just because the lack of idea and concept to overcome it . in conclusion , i close recomend to all student to enhance their ability to understand the core idea and concept on whatever the might be interested on , and to get the skill for future successful career development .
