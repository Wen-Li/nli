i strongly hope so ! i am rather stuffed by the continous hearing of noisy car , the pollotion they produce and the stress they increase in people all the day . i think that the number of car must be reduced for a lot of reason of any kind . there are too many car in cityes : i m thinking of all the time i have been blocked in traffic , i m thinking at the stress that produce a situation like been in a jungle of clacson sound , peolpe that insult each others with no reason , all the important appointed posticipated . .. cars are expensive : since the car ha began a status symbol it price ha risen enormously . and the more people continue buying the car at any price the more the price will rise air pollution is caused by car : have you ever asked yourself _ `` how doe it cost all the public work to clean the building of the cityes from the thick dark layer of smog that cover them ? '' , or `` how dose it cost to restore the street every two year ? '' the public transport can be more efficiet and le stressing : i think that public transport are the ony solution to the problem of the car . we offcourse can not avoid to travel , we need to , we only have to consider more efficient way to move . the most importan feature of public tranport is that the allow many people to travel at the same time with a grate maximization of the result at the same price . furthermore there are new technology that use not energy that involve pollution such a solar energy , wind energy and so on . i think that future must go in this direction to have a safe life for u and for future generation .
