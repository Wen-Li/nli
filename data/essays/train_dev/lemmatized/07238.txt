if we talking about the people success we can analize if it true the statement that say that successful people try new thing and take risk rather than only doing what they already know how to do well . we can analize that statement in differents topic of the society people can do the same thing everytime and if they know how to do it well it is very probably that they have a moderate success . in otherwise , people that take risk maybe have differents result , but the most related with the succes . the dimension of his success is related to the knowledge about the thing that they doing . for example , if we analize that statement in the business term . when people that have the knowledge about the `` know how '' to do an especific product ( very common ) and make an asociation with people with the ability to take the risk and explore new market associated at the product maybe hace a great succes . in conclussion , is not enough only to take risk , we must have the knowledge about the thing that we are doing and the ability to make change in order to obtain the major success .
