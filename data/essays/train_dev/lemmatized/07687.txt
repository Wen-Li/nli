people react to everyday life in different way . there are some human being who prefer to follow the ` known way ' in each of the activity they perform . there are some others who always prefer to experience new thing and new , probably risky , way of reacting to problem or stimula from the outside . i firmly believe that these are the people who often demonstrate to be the most succesful in their life . taking risk and exploiting new solution are universally recognised a the characteristic of succesful leader . business world is full of example of people who took risk and had great success . ceos of the most succesful company in most of the case are succesful themselves because they decided not to follow their sheer experience , but to take risk . mr jobs from apple co , for example , put most of the resource of r & d department of his company to exploit a new area of business , the mp3 one , when it company wa facing a serious crisis . his decision were the right one . history ha proved how the perception he had about the potentiality of that new product were right . however , the business field is not the only one where people proved to be succesful by trying new thing . when talking about italian politics in the early eighteenth century it always appears that the most commonly cited name is the one of marco rossi . this famous politician wa considered a fool when he proposed , first in the country , to pas an act to consider to give also to woman the right to vote . he took the political risk of his proposal , which wa totally new for that period . after that he had worldwide approval and success , just beacuse he took the risk of a new action . anyway not only famous people can be taken a example . in everyday life there is plenty of normal people that are considered succesful by the one who know them because they decided to experiment . for example in a small village the first person who move away to another area or even country is often considered a a hero for his village fellow . as before , he took the risk and tried new thing ( i . d : moving ) . this make the idea of experiencing new route and thing stronger into my mind . being succesful is hard but it is proved that taking reasonable risk and following unexperienced territory help . this happens not just in famous human being ' life , but also to normal people .
