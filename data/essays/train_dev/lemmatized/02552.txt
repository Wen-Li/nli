depending on personal experience , personality type and emotional conern , we find that some people hold the idea of learning fact which are important . while others prefer to understanding idea and concept . from my point of view , it is more advisable to understand idea and concept rather than to learn fact . the main reason for my propersity for this point is that concept is from human ' activity and object fact . for example , why doe an apple fall down ? this is a fact that everybody know . if you understand the idea and concept which the earth ha gravity . not only doe you understand easily the reason of an apple falling down , but also you can understand everything related problem . another reason can be seen by every one for my point is that understanding idea and concept have numerous benefit to our life . for instance , socialization is a concept that a process for a persos to learn from infant to child to adult . if you know this concept , you can find many agent of socalization , such a your parent , your peer , and your teacher . you find these agent influence your behavior . if you just know people need to join the social activity , you may not know who you should be learn from . third , in spite of there are some advantage to learn fact , such a it is earier and simpler , i feel that the advantage of understand idea and concept are more obvious . taking into account of all these factor , we may reach the conclusion that understanding idea and concept is more important than learning fact .
