success is desired by almost all the people . in all aspect such a , school , work , and personal life , success is the main goal that every person would like to reach . in order to reach success people may use different `` technique '' such a : using their own experience and / or knowledge , and taking into consideration other 's experience . but , it is important to use all the resource that may be near our possibility and to find new way to reach our goal . in my own point of view , successful people reach success because they are open to new experience and they take risk to achieve their goal . but also i think they should be aware of what they are good at , taking into consideration their ability and weakness so to pay more attention on what they can perform better in order to reach success in an easier way . for instance , if a businessman is planning to open a company , it is more reliable that he performs better in an area where he ha previous knowledge that in an unknown area . a man that ha study in graphic design may open a design agency where he can offer his service based on knowledge he ha obtained previously . additionaly , he can make his agency more succesful if he take some risk . the businessman can try new thing , for example : he can hire people who know different thing and create new department or division in his company in order to obtain more client and have major profit . all in all , people who are decided to reach success , no matter the aspect they are concerned with ( school , work or family ) , they should apply personal experience and try new thing to obtain wished result in order to feel satisfied with the effort we have done .
