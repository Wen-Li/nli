i agree with the statement that advertisement make product seem much better . it is because of my thought , survey , poll , and experiment first , famouse person usally make most advertisement . it appeal to people enoughly . most person want to be like actor , singer , and actress . maybe the product that is advertised by superstar is more attractive to the people . scondly , the survey , conducted by cho-sun daily , one of the best paper in korea , show that three of fourth of overall candidate of survey feel advertised product more quailified . also the poll , conducted by same company , show that people think that advertised product is more safe . thirdly , when i wa a high school student , my friend bought a product that is not advertised . it wa expensive tape player . it wa disorder in next day . my friend want to get gerentee service . he doe not get it . so he have to buy again and he buy advertised product , sony , because of service . lastly , when i wa young , i had two toy . i do not had discremination between two toy . however , i wa perfectly changed in my mind after advertisement of superman , my hero in the past . although the toy is much cheeper than another , i alway take superman 's toy because i had proud of myself . in the conclusion , given several reason , i think that most advertisement make the product seem much better than they really . it seems that advertisement make u atractive to the product . ..
