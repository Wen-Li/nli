young people and old people have different life style . as far a i am concerned , young people ha more method of enjoying life than old people . in the following paragraph , i will reasoning and provide example to support my opinion . young people are full of energy , which mean that besides their study and work , they have much more energy to have fun . young people are normally in good health so they do not feel tired after work and fun . at night , the dancing bar are full of young people . they dance , talk to each other and drink together . during the holiday , young people drive to the mountain or the sea shore for hunting , canoeing or hiking . because old people need more time to recover from the tiredness of the work , they can not spend a much time a the young people on the holiday travel . they normally stay at home and watch the tv or chat with their old friend . young people have more new method to enjoy the life because their brain run faster than old people . because there are a lot of pressure from the job , young people need more method to remove the pressure otherwise their health will be damaged . young people develop new method everyday and then spread them all over the world . they practise new method of entertainment and discus them on the network . on the contrary , old people normally stick to few kind of entertainment for a long time and do not want to try new method . old people know how to enjoy life and they have their method of enjoying life . but comparing with the young people , they spend le time and energy in enjoying the life . from the above discussion , it is safe to conclude that young people enjoy the life more than older people .
