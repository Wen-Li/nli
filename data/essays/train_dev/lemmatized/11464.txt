i agree with the statement because , after all , the purpose of the advertisement is to point out the advantage of a product and this is usually achieved by exagerating them . one common scenario on tv advertisement is to show happiness situation that are not necessarily related to the product being promoted . for example , you can see a sad person in a gray rainy day whose mood change to absolute happines a the sun rise automatically when they drink a coke . even though the weather ha nothing to do with people drinking coke , they try to sell the idea that a refresh drink can make you happy no matter what . on the other hand , magazine and photograph based advertisement usually tend to use very simple triks such a showing product bigger than they are , or accompanied by a lot of accesories wich are not included , and sometimes not even sold at all , but make the real product look a lot more attractive . furthermore , some advertisement show result that can not be completely achieved by the product itself , to convince people to use them . this is very common in diet product , where a very thin model wake up in the morning to do some exercise but she just go to the refrigerator and drink a diet yogurth . desite of the fact that the yogurth could only prevent you from gaining extra weight , the propaganda make it look like it actually can make you lose weight . finally , another issue is that the advertisement do n't show the dissadvantages of the product or if they do , because of some reglamentation , they do it a fast an ilegible a it is possible . this is the case of alcoholic beverage ' advertisementes , which show a very small and really fast read phrase were they advertise that drinking in excess is not good for your health . as a conclussion , it can be forseen that advertisement do n't usually say the hole truth about a product and one ha to be very carefull in examining the real characteristic of it before buying or using it .
