i am of the opinion that it is hard to say if in twenty year will be more car in use than today or not . today a lot of people - almost everyone - in germany have a car or even more than one car . a car symbolizes someone 's status nowadays which is pretty said . i think that there are too many car on the street because of the pollution and damaging the enviornment . why ca n't people walk or drive by bike ? why ca n't they even use the train ? people get lazy . but i presume that the ticket for a train cost too much also . it is said that german have no money but it is possible for them to buy a car . ? ! where is the point ? i think there is no point . but i really like that truck are not permitted to drive sunday a coulpe of hour because the noise is gone . in twenty year peolpe are probably even lazier than they are today because everything becomes automatically and robot are going to be a normal use . so i actually do not think that there will be fewer car in 2026 . on the other side it is possible that there will be fewer car because people get poorer . everything becomes more expensive nowadays and people get le money . cars will be more expensive in a couple of year , too , and of course the gas . the gas is one of the major problem . it get too expensive and people can not effort buying it anymore . and maybe there will be a law which say that people are not allowed to drive a car in a certain time period of the day and then people do not need a car . as a conculsion i would like to mention that it is very hard to say wheather there will be fewer car in 2026 or not . people change and time change , too . you never really know what will happen in the future . everything happens for a reason .
