i 'm disagree with this statement . there are very difference in young and older people enjoy . the energy in young people can influence in their enjoy for example the young could to dance every night , but it is n't to older people , so they are not enjoy in a party every night . the health is other factor to people enjoy . if i 'm sick and i wanna to drink beer with some friend , i could not . the mode of enjoy life is determinated how it see the life . if i like the party but i 'm older for it , is obvius that i 'm not enjoy life . but if i like swim in the ecean and i can do it , then i could enjoy life in every moment . the young have their own enjoy , so the older have their own enjoy . i could n't to say this enjoy life more than this other , because their like are very differents . i think the people that do the thing a like them , they enjoy life , it would be young or older , anybody would be very happy . finally , the energy , the health , the like or dislike influence in our enjoy . the young people or the older people can enjoy life alround their like . anybody could enjoy life . when i do the wanted , then i enjoy life . whatever , wherever and whenever i can enjoy life , but it have to like me , i have to can do it , young or older i enjoy life , it is not determinate for the age or for the time . it could be always when you want to do it !
