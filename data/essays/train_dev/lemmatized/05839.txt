transportation is a very importnat factor in today 's global life . as the number of people increase on the earth , the requirement for different transportation way increase a well . one of the very important mean of transportation are car . i will argue opposed to the statement that , in twenty year there will be fewer car in use than there are today . firstly , the car industry is a very old industry , which is mainly developed through the last century . the improvement in the area are still very exciting , therefore the idea of earing higher and higher amount of money trigger more and more people to spend their money for constructing a bussiness on car . as a result , car industry after twenty year will be greater and more important than today . moreover , car are not attractive only for their being of a mean of transportation . there exists a great number of fun , who can pay million of dollar for old car and special car such a the last model of ferrarri . an other example is , the famous formula race , which help to trigger a worldwide increase number of fun for using and buying car . on the other hand , people choose to use their own car rather than using mean of public transport such a bus and metro , because they do not offer them a comfortable travel , which they can have in their private car . in turn , the number of private car increase in correlation with the increasing capacity for car industry , since everyday peolpe are introduced to this industry a customer . in conclusion , i believe that , in twenty year there will be more car in use than there are today , due to the continuously improving car industry , which is in correlation with increasing number of fun of car race , collector and customer .
