in my openin , it is better for student to understand idea and concept rather than learning fact . when student learn how to use the idea and the concept to anylise and make their own dicusion that will enable them to be more reactive . learning some fact and momrizing some information are not the ideal way to learn student how to use thier won ablitiys . students howm use their own idea that they conclude by their own accadimic or even in elementry school are more likely to learn more and faster than student howm just repeat some fact . they more likely to learn in different area and feild and to be in connect with the latest devlopments . maybe they will invent a new sebject or improve the field of study they lean about . alse they could use they fact that aready have found to increase modify them . on the other hand , student how depend completely in the fact without even understanding what they mean will not think about any hting which doe n't follow the rule that they learn . sometimes the rule are not correct , but they only do what they learn . they used to follow the fact , and they will not be able to think logicaly . therefore , we can see that understanding the idea and the concept is more useful than repeating just the fact .
