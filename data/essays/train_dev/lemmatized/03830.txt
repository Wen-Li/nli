i do not think that it is better to have a broad knowledge of many academic subject instead of specializing in one specific subject . having a broad knowledge doe not mean that one ha a good knowledge . however , it is more important to be good in what you , i think . if a person ha a broad knowledge of a lot of subject , usually it is not very convincing . it take a lot of time and effort to really learn fact about a certain topic and to understand them . therefore , it is nearly impossible to have both . it would take too much time . furthermore , when applying for a job one usually need to have specific knowledge of the respective sector they will work in . therefore , one should know what profession they want to prepare for and then get a good education for that specific profession . employers will usually appreciate it more if their employee is an expert in his job . my most important point is that one should not have a broad knowledge because they will not be able to enjoy their life . they will realize that they are not really good because they do not know detail and can not support their idea with reasonal fact , for example . hence , they will get unsatisfied with themselves . one consequence of that might be that they fall into depression . another consequence might be that they try to improve their knowledge . however , that is not easy because there are so many subject they would have to work on . a possible solution would be to finally specialize in one of the field they are intersted in . in conclusion , i think it is better to concentrate on one subject and to be good in it in order to live a happy and fullfilling life .
