education of student is very important so we have to be carefull . some people think understanding idea and concept are more important than learning fact . however , i disagree with that and i think not only student but also adult must develop themselves with fact . people must be realist ; this make people more successfull and powerfull . firstly , i think school should produce more realist people and since child had started primary school this education ha been started . realist people can be more successfull a we can see in history . for example , napalyon buenoparte , wa inteligent and realist . he ha seemed always realist since he born to now . as we can see three of his word ; a person had came to talk with napolyon when he wa going the war , and he asked ` why they always do war ! ' and he answered ` money , money , money ' . i think it is a very good example for a successfull realist person . on the other hand we can see in history failed people who were dreamer . many kominist are very good example for that . they life for idea and concept and they can not do anything for peace or any good thing for humanity . however , other people who were realist are all written in history book . as i can see it one picture from my sit when i am writing my essay , ataturk who is the founder of the turkish republic . he wa certainly realist because even ottoman empire 's dreamer behavior and force on all people , he behaved realist and established this modern country . he knew where turkey wa and where others were , and he tried to develope like other developed country such a europens and americans in conculusion , i think childeren must grow up with fact if they want to be a successfull person and because of that we must educate them in that way .
