most people like to travel . some of them are trying to travel by themselves . on the other hand , rest of them intend to follow a tour guide . both of them have each reasonable advantage . however , i do not think that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide . if i have a chance to travel , i will travel alone or with a few friend . firstly , i believe that traveling is to get my own expirence . initially , i know that following a tour guide is more convenience , but i think that purpose of traveling is not being convenience . expiriencing new world and new culture is goal of it . i had two exprience of travel . one of them wa travel to japan , and another wa travel to u.s. the travel to japan wa not to follow a guide . my friend and i made every plan and reservation . surely , it wa a little bit difficult but experience that we got at that time made u mentally strongly . on the other hand , travelling to u.s. wa fun and easy for a guide , but i did not have any special memory about that trip . secondly , one of meaning of travel is take some space from our regular life . if we travel alone or with just a few friend , we can do it . but , following a guide should not allow to do it . there are so many plan and event . sometimes those thing can make a travel funny , but often those can make it irritating . nobody want to spend money on meaningless thing . if a travelling is a way that make you escape your life and refresh , which one is more helpful ?
