academic education ha always been a debated issue because it deal with lot of purpose . one main point that is being more and more discussed is if it is better to acquire knowledge in many academic subject or to specialize in a specific subject . we will see that even if a specialized academic curriculum can be rewarded , having knowledge of many subject can help to be open-minded and can be useful in daily life and society . first , avoiding specialization at school or at university permit to develop curiosity and to have an opened mind . indeed , could you imagine what would be the consequence of only teaching biology to a ten-year-old child ? he would only focuse all his life on that subject . i believe that is the same for academic subject . we must learn a lot from others subject that the one we are going to work on all life . having class of history or economics can help you to remain interested in different subject . moreover , the more the knowledge is diverse the more it is easy to face real situation . only learning at university doe not always help to know how to behave in specific situation . by attending to a diverse range of course , this lead to a faster adaptation and understanding of the environment . for instance , a manager should have learnt different aspect of the economic business . if he only focus on acconting , he will not be able to understand the marketing team with which he will have to work . however , it is necessary at a time to be specialized in one subject . to take the example of a plummer , he need to be sure of he is doing to to work . if we did n't have to specialized , everybody should know how to produce a pen or how to repair a car . though i fully agree that sometimes it is relevant to specialize in a specific subject , i still believe that it is necessary to have broad knowledge of many academic subject because it permit to be curious and open-minded , to know how to behave in new environment and in daily life .
