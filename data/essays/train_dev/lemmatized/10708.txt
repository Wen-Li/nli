i agree that most advertisment make product seem much better that they really are . yes they do , by hiring big celebreties and well known atleths by showing something el and selling something el most company like to hire some well known person that they know the public like for their advert just to make money . because they know that when the public see the face their product will sale , so they will pay them a big sum , and sell something different to the mass . for example the clothing company they hire a big name to advertise there product , but they sell something different though the public do n't care becaue they wearing the cluth because of the face of the star on the cloth . i bought a kelvin clean jean , it 's a big name in clothing business and i bought because of the big name . but it did not last for me a i thought it wa going to last the first time i washed it the colour changed authomatically . the same with the cosmetic company they will tell you to try there product and your face will be a smooth a you want it to be . these are just market stratefies . they just want to sell there product . also the phone company they will make you to switch to there network it is the best on the long run you will come to realise it 's the same every where . and the worst is the credit card company they use there advertisment to lure you in and give a different service and you end up owning them for life . haven seen all these reason and example i think it is very clear that not all the advertiment is good because they seem much better than the service they will offer you . so i agree that most advertisment is much better than the product .
