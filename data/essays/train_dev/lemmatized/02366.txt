i agree that most advertisement make product seem much better than they really are . the purpose of the adverstisements is to convince people to buy the product in a shot time . in the modern world there are so many message trying to catch the attention of the people that reaching this goal is not easy . the advertisement ha to be really effective in order to being read and to drive the purchaising behavior . overstating the functionality of the product can be a mean to reach this goal . if we think to some advertisement and to the related product it 's easy to find the difference between the picture and the descriptin of the product and the product itself . that mean that we are aware of the `` overstating techinque '' used by the advertiser and that we do n't fully believe in the message that they convey . i never expect the kitchen 's cleaning soap to clean my kitchen a they do in the advertisement ! and i never expect the breakfast 's biscuit to have the perfect shape they are showing on every paper page an during every commercia ! we are all used to adopt a certain `` discount ratio '' while evaluating the advertisement message . the difficult think for advertiser is to balance the reality with the overstatement in their advertisement because if the message are too distant from the reality the risk is loosing the client after the first try of the product .
