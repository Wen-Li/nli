although not perfectly , i agree with that statement , because it is obviously that young people , of course including me , do not help our comunities . i think the biggest reason why is that the connection with each other became very weak . 30 or 40 year ago , when my parent were in our age , there were very strong connection with neighbor . sometimes they took care of their neighbor 's baby , or made the dinner and share with neighbor . they often helped each other , so it wa usual to help their comunities . however , now , there are many apartment house , and many people live in another city which they did not grow up . then , the connection is becoming weak and weak , and sometimes we do not know who is the neighbor . if we do not know the people in our comunity , probably we do not have the feeling to spend the time to help our comunity . in addition that , we have few time to help our comunity . we have school , part time job , working every day . and also the most of u leave home eary in the morning and come back home late in the night . in such a lifestyle , we have no time to help other people . but , on the other hand , there are some young people to have enough time to help their comunities . for example , the people from the family who live the same comunity sinch the generation of their parent or grandparent . such young people understand the comunities , so they can help them easily if they have something to do . in conclusion , i agree with that statement , but not perfectly . as i mentioned above , i know some people have enough time to help their comunities even if they are very busy . so , if they have the connection with their community , they can help their comunities and also , they would make the time to do that .
