throughtout high school , student learn several different academic subject , one which some do like or dislike . for a fact , it could be said that most student do not like all the academic class they must take in high school . however , after graduating for high school , there is a wide opportunity for student to enter a more specific area of study , where they will be able to choose to do something the really like , and not because it is a requirement . both part of learning , whether it is broad or specific , are both part of the process or learning . nevertheless , if i were to comment on whether having a broad knowledge of many academic subject is better than to specialize in one specific subjet i 'd say that being specialized in one specific subject is better because you know what you want and like to know , you can do what you want to do , and help others in what you know the best . being specialized in a specific subject doe not come without having the broad knowledge of many academic subject , but indeed , it is what lead a person into doing what they really want to do . as personal experience , in high school , many student hate either one or more subject that they rather not take probably because they do n't understand , or just dont like doing it . however , you do get a sense of what every academic subject involves , and you can get an idea of what you like and what not . knowing that , for example , you like math , you will go to college , to study something involving math , which besides being the area you like , will encourage you to work even seriously because now , it is the only thing you must work for . after going to college , you are already very practiced in the area you like and chose to study for the rest of your life . parting from there , knowing your area , you can find jods in several different thing that involves you area , and for the rest fo your life , do something that you will enjoy doing . not like in school , where you did n't enjoy passing some class , and you had bad grade in it , it would be like having good grade in a class that you like and understood . a person would just feel better doing something they truly love . once , you know do what you like to do , come the important part of specilizing in one specific subjet , the one of helping others in what you know best . specifically knowing , for example , about child disease , you could help so many people , who die endlessly because they do not have neither resource or anyone to help them . having a borad knowledge would also allow you to help , but not a profoundly a you could knowing specifically one subject . eventhough i believe that specializing in one specific subject is better than having a broad knowledge of many academic subject , i believe that we could n't specify in a subject we love without having the knowledge of many subject . if we would n't know what biology is , how can we dislike it , or how can we know if that is what we like . like i said in the beggining , both are a part of learning , it just that one choice , perhaps could be described a going further into achieving higher goal .
