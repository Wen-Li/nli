fact life in my opinion some student do n't agarr with each other because they are do n't understand the fact life i agree with this statement some family do n't think obout this way or do n't give the child any resbonsblity to understand the life some family give the boy or the gril all thing . this is not a good way to understand the life the fact life is hard not what the student see in the movie or in the t.v the fact life to learn and make wrong and you teach your selve and give your selve some push to this fact life . if any one understand what dose mean this wrold he/she can life good life . i thinke the t.v did this for the student 70 % for the student try find love and 10 % like dronk 20 % stduy hard . every one life in a dreem i think the man bad thing if you see or herd about some one doe n't have any gole in his life . i hope this life come easy for the poor people and for me and my child .
