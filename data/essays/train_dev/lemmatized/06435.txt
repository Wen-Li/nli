i agree that most advertisement make product seem much better than they really are . moreover , i am convinced that this is the main purpose of a commercial . the grade of attraction that can be caused by an advertisment is immensive and can be stated by the example of gas water in germanz . a lot of people drink it here , while other country like france , england or spain do not even offer it in restaurant . i am convinced that the reason for that is a series of very good commercial we have in germany , switzerland and austria . companies use their financial power to hire a lot of expert and provide the best and newest equipment to produce commercial , which content is often not even linked to the product itself . the example of `` jaegermeister '' , a really terrible german liquor show , how you can promote a product just by giving him a trend image . opponents might say that a reasonable consumer would n't be mislead after a while by such finesounding commercial and advertisement , but unfortunaltely it is not very easy to change a person drinking custom . if a certain acceptence is achieved once and the product is available and therefore present in any place , it will be hard to change the consumer behaviour , who consideres convinience a a important matter . my opinion is also stated by the example of cloth bought by youngster . they often spend great amonts of money on a t-shirt of a certain brand , although it doe not fit or is of bad quality . the last example illustrates the rudeness of such company by producing their advertisment . it is even worse , to adress those advertisment to child who are often more unsecure and therefore willing to spend many to be `` cool '' . i am very lucky that certain legal rule to prevent even greater damage are existing . the europian union incline to sharpen them slowly but determined although their opponent lobby is powerful . until standard will have enhanced recognizably we should read every advertisment with suspicion .
