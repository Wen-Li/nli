i totally agree withe statement because , due to following reason : 1. as the population increase , the usage of car is increased day by day and one day it will reach to peak level where there is no space to park or drive the car . 2. secondarily , a the pollution increase usage of car may be reduced and also avilability and price of the fuel ha also been raised which may lead to fewer car in use . 3. as the traffic increase public prefer to travel by public transport inspite of taking stress and strain to travel by car in the traffic . 4. due to increased production of variety of car year by year and increase in the price of the car , public may not afford to buy the car . 5. many people who would like to travel long distance they dont usually prefer travelling by car instead they take public transport system to travel . 6. there may be other reason which can be guessed of le car usage is , if the car are affordable to buy by the middle class family it may become a traffic problem a more public tend to buy the car instead . 7. nowadays , buying a car is easy , but due to higher growing fuel price . maintenance of the car ha become expensive . 8. due to higher usage of car there may be shortage of parking space in the office for the employee to park their car . 9. there may be higher risk of road accident . so , may be in twenty year there will be surely le usage of car a compared today .
