with in today 's busy and hard life many people suffer their life instead of enjoying it in my country becouse of economical and other kind of problem but i think i am the one of the luckiest who can enjoy a part of it . i do n't see the issue a an age matter but i take it a the ability or opportunuty to enjoy the life . although it 's meaning chance person to person , enjoying life mean being happy , loving someone and marry with her , having a healty baby and going to a concert or a movie for me . and i recon these thing are all about money at the begining and human effect come next . i mean if you do n't have enough money to do these thing then you may not experience their pleasure so you ca n't be satisfied . another point is the human effect which relates the issue most and it mean wish or want of a person to be happy in his or her life . for example if you have money and wish to go to outside for a dinner , then it is so simple for you to do this . otherwise if you have money but no wish or vice verse then you can not have a good night so i think lifestyle doe not depent on age . in adition to these two major point , i must state that your social enviroment ha also good or bad effect on your life . for example you may live in a place where there is no movie therefore you can not go to a movie even if you have maney and wish . in summary , i live my life a much a i can enjoy it and this depends on my opportunties but so many people may not take a lot of it 's good point in my country and i belive that enjoying life is all about your wish and ability to do so .
