i disagree the yong people do not give enough time to helping their community . i guess every people should respect and help each other . joining community is good way to learn any little society of the group . the young people should take communication in the community place a possible a they can . now , we have a many way to communicate with person who you are interested in . unfortunately , some younger generation doe not like to give enough time to helping their community . first , giving enough time to their community is the important for yong people . i understand that some yong people would like to be alone thermselfs and keep their own time . sometimes , it is good chance to think own proble just themselves , however , the person who joined the community may give a second opinion . also , in the young people community , they can meet your friend in the community . we do not alive without our community . in my experices , i found my best friend in my community when i wa 17years old . finally , young people should give to help their community . young people can learn any educational experience from their community . sometimes young people communies make some trouble but you should not be shy to join community .
