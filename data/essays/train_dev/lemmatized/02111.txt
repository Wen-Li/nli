i agree with this statement . i am 18 year old , so i can be said one of young people . actually i am the one who do not give enough time to helping one 's commnication . i moved when i am a elementary school student and i went to non-public school in my junior high and high school day . so i have not so many people in my city . neither do my parent . i live in an apartment house and have little relative with the resident . it is said that people live in an apartment house have little frendship nowadays , i think so too . and more my family including me buy food in derivary service , so i do n't know about my city 's shop . most of young people nowadays may be same a my lifestyle . especially if one doe not born and bred in the city where one life now , one have le relative to and pay le attention to their community . and if one 's parent is familiar to the city where they live , they tend to become le connection to their community . i also belive that there is another attractive place like standing shoppingmall in the place where they do not live . so people do not stay in their community and go anothe community . of course every young people thesedays do not live like that . some have the experience to join the festival , matsuri or some sport that wa held by community , and others have connection to community 's president or some person , therefore they know a lot about event held by community . however people like that is not so many . this is why i belive that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their community .
