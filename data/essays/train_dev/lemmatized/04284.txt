this is a controvertial topic about whether the number of car will reduce in twenty year . as far a i am concerned , there will be fewer car . my reason are listed a follows . first , we should take a glance at the opposite opinion . some people will deem that with the rapid economic growth ( especially in china ) , people will continue to buy their own car because it is a convenience to their life , they do not need to wait a long time and get into a crowded bus , which is commonly seen in china . however , these people seem to ignore several essential aspect that would lead to the reduce of the number of car . the important reason is that people 's awareness of protecting the environment is gradually increased . we all recognize the fact thatour environment is facing serious problem caused by human pollution , like global warming and water pollution , air pollution . and the government a well a the increasing number of people are taking effort to protect the environment . they can give up using of plastic bag , so they can also give up buying their own car . the equally important reason is that the oil price skyrockted in the last year and the price are going to increase in the future . it is just too expensive to afford a car to the majority of people because they have to use a lot of money to support their family , to pay for the education fee of their child , and to pay for the medical service . they will choose to use public transportation due to the higher and higher oil price . moreover , the government is taking great effort to build public transportation . they use a large number of money on developing more rail road , more bus to every corner of the contry . and also metro have been built to easing the heavy traffic in more and more big city . taking into account of all the aspect mentioned above , i am firmly convinced with the opinion that the number of car will reduce in twenty year .
