i most certainly agree with this statement , `` most advertisement make product seem much better than they really are '' . the two example of my experience and aspect of magazine worker will verify the truth of my position . a few day ago , my mother bouth a car cleaner which wa advertised on television . the advertisement wa too exaggerated . it said that every scratch can be eraised with that product . after my mother saw that advertisement , she bought one without hestitation because recently her car got a big scratch somehow . however , my mother and i found that it doe not work a it advertised . we knew that we were diceived and decided not to believe anything advertised but only the experience of the others . there is another example . when i read the magazine , i always want to buy something advertised no matter it is expensive or not . by people who always focusing on selling the product to consumer , many magazine are decorated with fancy word and exaggeration . we need to consider about that group of people . in that people respect , they do not make product but only thing they have to do is make advertisement great so that they need to draw people . their only purpose is to make people to buy that product which mean they make advertisement make product seem always nice and perfect . who woud show their shortcoming of product ? because of the example above , i believe that most advertisement make product seem much better than they relly are . every consumer have to be wise consumer which mean they need to compare the real product and the advertisement before they purchase . so if one would like to buy the product only seeing the advertisement , i would like to say the one , ` do not believe most advertisement but be wise and smart consumer ' .
