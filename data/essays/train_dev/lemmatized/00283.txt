i agree the idea that most advertisement make product seem much better than really are . let me talk about two reason . one reason is that product in magagine advertisement seem more beautiful than they really are . for example when the beautiful woman wore a dress in the magagine advertisement the dress seemed so beautihful because of the beauty of this woman . but when i wore the same dress the dress did not seem beautiful . because i am not beautiful . also the shape of the dress changed because i wa fat and the dress wa really tiny . i could not realize that the dress wa tiny because the beautiful woman in magagine wa really thick and beautiful body . second reason is that product in tv advertisement seem more useful than they really are . for example when the famous cook us the knife in tv advertisement this knife will seem more useful . because the famous cook can really can cook very well . but if i or my father buy this knife we will not use knife very well . because we do not like cooking and we hardly use the knife . therefore i think most advertisement make product seem much better than really are .
