refering to the statement i believe thet it 's very complex to find the real difference between the two of them . i have some important reason to think like that . i 'm also student on the univesity actually and my experience is that there are two kind of student . one that not use to go to class and try to study all the book during the week before . and second there is the student that always go to class and take note so that 's why when he ha the exam he do n't need to spent so much time inm front of the book . however , both of them use to pas the exam but using diferrent way . the method of study is a important a the way that you practice to memorice the idea or fact . from my point of view it 's more important for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact . in order to explain this i will give an example . - imagine a situation with a student learning a complex theme of antropology at university four year ago . it 's not equal if he had studied the theme by understanding the main idea instead of learning fact . be sure that he will remember perfectly if he had undestanded the idea during that class . i believe that fact are confusing according to my experience . in conclussion , the difference between learning and understanding really doe n't matter in my opinion , the important point is that with both of them the student is learning even fact or idea that he will use on the future maybe working or teaching other student . so depending on the study it would be better oin way or the other one the thing is to choose the right one .
