the question put forward by the issue is that , whether the succesful people try new thing and take risk than doing the already know one . the issue is very important becasue success only come when their is an effort and risk . i believe that sucessful people do new thing rather than doing what they already know . the first reason of my belief is that , success is the house of the people who take some risk in their life and people be successful when they have accomplished new thing in a better way . for instance , issac newton a great scientist the world ha ever known did not sit quite after his success in the gravitational theory . instead he moved in other field of physic which is newer to him and earned laurel in all the new field he ha taken . furthermore , doing the thing which are already know is not termed a discovery but it is development . and discovery are more appriciated than development . trying new thing turn u to be versatile genius consedering the success in the field a the next part . lastly , i believe by trying or exploring new thing can lead u new discovery or new thesis . for example , when galileo discovered pendulum , he explored to the newer feild of astronomy and discovered telescope and declared the previous thesis layed wa false by his new experiment . this show that exploring in new thing is greater and more advantageous than labouring on the same know one . ultimately , trying a new thing is more beneficial and appreciated than laying on the already known thing . iam on the side of trying newer thing because newer concept are always intresting than the known boring one and the search of newer way , thing or new idea is always rewarding . so i agree that sucsessful people try new thing and take risk for further success .
