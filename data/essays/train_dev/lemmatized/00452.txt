we all hope that we want to enjoy our life . then this question come to my mind , which enjoy life more , young people or older people ? i think young people enjoy life more than older people . there are three reason . first , young people have healthier body than older people do . second , they have longer time in rest of their life than the older people do . third , older people tend to say that the younger the better . first of all , young people have healthier and stronger body than older people do . they can continue to work longer , run faster , need shorter time to sleep , and so on than the old people do . that mean young peopel can enjoy what the old people can not do . for example , they can swim in the mornig , go out for lunch , go shopping , and have party with their friend . second , they have longer time remained in their life than the old people do . if you want to be a very good and famous doctor , it will take about ten year to attend medical school and get enough experience a a doctor . young people can plan and achieve this aime because they have time . however , old people may not beacuse they only have limited time in rest of their life . finally , i often hear old people say that the younger the better . i am still young and can only imagine how the life of old people . the old people , however , experienced life of young people already and say the younger the better comparing their life to the one when they were young . to conclude . i believe young people enjoy life more than old people . they have strong body to do anything they want while old people have limitation because of their health problem . also , young people have longer time to do anything . in addition , old people admit that the younger the better . i strongly believe that young people enjoy life more than old people . actually , i think , that mean young people have to challenge anything they want and have to enjoy their life to the max .
