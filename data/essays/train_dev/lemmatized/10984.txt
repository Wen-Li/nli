i agree with the opinion that it is more important for student to understand idea and concept than to learn fact . some people reccomend to know the fact , but i think tstudents should understand them first because of the improtance of knowing the basic information , the possibility to misunderstand the fact without basic knowledge , and getting ability to think about cause and effect . first of all , student usually lean from teacher with textbook because textbook have the important information for studnets . i understand that knowing fact is also somehow useful for student and they can learn other thing which are not indicated in textbook . however , it is more significant for student to learn subject from basic . secondly , i do n't think student can understand the fact without basic knowledge . not all fact have regular environment or situation like indication of textbook , so student may misunderstand the fact which is irregular . however , if student learn basic knowledge first , they could recognize what is regular fact and irregular fact . some fact require people to learn advenced knowledge to understand them , so it is more critical for student to study idea and concept first . finally , if student know the idea and concept , they could think the cause and the effect of fact when they face the fact which they have not learned previously . moreover , just knowing fact is not useful for them because fact are not always normal . students can not recognize fact accurately without the basic idea and concept . thus , i would like student to learn basic knowledge to understand fact . in conclusion , i believe that student should understand idea and concept first before learning fact . not only student but also adult can not understand fact without basic knowledge . if they do not have them , they would misunderstand the fact . this is not good for student . therefore i strongly reccomend student to study the basic idea and concept to recognize fact .
