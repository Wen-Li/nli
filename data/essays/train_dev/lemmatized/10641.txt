about fifty year ago , one the greatest president of the united states pointed out the main problem of modern society . john f. kennedy said , do not ask what the country can do for you , ask what you can do for the country . we live in a society that promotes individualism . individualism can be definied a way of projecting problem only through you own scope and to pay le attention at your environment . i think individualism is more and more developped and people tend to give le time to their community . this subject is the great battle between the ancient and the modern . according to the modern , people are more and more focused on their personal environment , that is to say their family , friend , work environment and themselves . in our modern society , this phenomenon reach young people even more that parent and grandparent . they used to be raised with a very high sense of value , focused on work and religion . even if each family , according to it history , need , wealth , had it own priority , these were the main value . and there wa a sense of commun work and commun need . young people who live in modern society tend to be more focused on themselves and to be more selfish . in developped country , they do not fear hunger , thirst , problem of wealth . i think that most of them are self centered . we must believe that this kind of attitude will change and that young people with give more time to help their community . on the one hand , there is always the role of religion . they can be used to make people understand the importance of giving , sharing and receiving . on the other hand , we can hope that intellectual and politician will raise these question in the future . not only is the idea of helping the community relevant , but it is also more and more important in a time of great incertainty .
