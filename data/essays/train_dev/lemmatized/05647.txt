it is well known that the amount of information is increasing exponentially and because the develpment of global and massive comunication technology such a internet , the avalaiblility of information is increasing too . that is the reason why traditional educational method must be reconsidered . indeed , it is virtually impossible to aboard knowledge procecess , with only memory-focus aproaches considering the human limitation , and the amount of information available . i think is better to try make the student to learn and understand idea and concept rather than try to make them learn a lot of fact . however i consider a necessary fact to give them enough skill for searching and handling information propertly . in addition , student should learn in their class how to correlate concept , fact , and idea in order to develope new conceps . that is the way knowledge and science grow up . the memory can fail some time ( i know that by my own experience ) , but the concept are always there to help . i think that a an example of what i am saying is the science symposium and meeting . the speaker just have like twenty minute or so to talk about their research project which had taken them several year in most of the case . so what they do ? they talk about the concept they studied and they developed . in conclude , i think that the student that have clear their concept can go on faster in learning precesses .
