today i 'm going to discus whether most advertisement make product seem much better than they really are or not . i agree with that statement because the company that make the advert often us many trick to make to product look better . for example a clothcleaning product . in the comercial they put a dirty shirt in the washingmashine , in the next moment they take a clean one out . how doe the customer know that it 's still the same shirt . he doe n't , to find out if it really work he ha to buy the product , and it often doe n't work a show in the advert . the customer is often flashed by an incredible design without spending much thought about the efficency of the product or if the product is really worth it money . it often happens that if you by cheap product , you have problem reading the handbook - if there is one at all - or when unwrapping the product it sometimes already fall apart . but in the comercial show on tv everything wa working fine . i made the experience that in the past more product held what wa promised in the advert and if not you could just return it . the customer here is king , a it is supposed to be . but now day more and more product are n't a good a presented in the comercial , and if you try to return the product you might have a hard time doing that . some people even offer a great deal , but you have to pay in advance , and in the end you do not even get a product . this happend in berlin , where a store offered two flatscreens for the price of one . on the delivery date the shop wa closed and the boss were gone with the money . i personally research on the internet before buying an expencive product what other people think about it or experienced with the product , and if there is a equal or even better product that is not so promoted like the other and therefore cheaper .
