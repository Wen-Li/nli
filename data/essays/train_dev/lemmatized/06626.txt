i think that most advertisements make products seem much better than they are . this is , of course , a kind of cheating to the customers on one hand . but on the other hand its just normal . it developed like this over the time , coursed by many reasons . i think there are two different issues about advertisement : touching and seeing . if people watch advertisement , for example in the television , the are just able to see the product , and not to touch it . as the touching af a product , and the developing personal feeling based on the texture of it , is very important for humans to get an opinion about a product , advertisement is alwas kind of cheating . .. well , in my opinion this is course enough not too watch advertisement , but many people still do . i state , that if people do not touch a product , they can not get a real opinion of it . the statement that most products look much better in advertisements is even more correct as many companies treat the advertised products very hard before using it . a good example fot this is the mc donalds burger . mc donalds is , truely , painting the burger they use in their advertisement . this painting makes the buerger look more jucy , more tasty . this behavior is what i really call cheating . the companies can not do anything about the fact that people can not touch their products in television . but they should not change the original view of the product to give people a wrong , but better selling view , of it . advertisement has always been the best way to introduce new products to the people . through the last centuries it apeared in many different kinds . starting with local advertisements in small newspapers or just on the street many years ago , the increasing development if tecnologie over the last years makes advertisement appear nearly everywhere in the world , at any time of a day . it is possible to find a big sign of coke advertisement in the middle of africa . through the tecnologie campanies from japan are able to advertise their products in germany as well as in india . my opinion to the advertisement of today is that nearly all products seem to be better than they really are , because the worldwide producing and selling companies are all able to use the new tecnologies for their advertisement . the new tecnologie like television , mobile phone , radio and so on makes the humans always avaliable and reachable for new information . and as the humans do neary all rely on the tecnologie , ( even if they are not aware of it ) its even more easy for companies to introduce and , in fact , fake their advertised products .
