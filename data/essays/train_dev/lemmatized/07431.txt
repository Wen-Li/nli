as the modern society is developing faster and faster , more and more better facility , interesting thing that did n't happen in the old year appear , our youth is absolutely served more confortable than those older people in such world . 3 aspect of reason or exemples can be shown to support my vote for the statement : young people enjoy life more than older people . for instance , my city ha just built an gorgeous play park where you can enjoy most excting and thrill play facility . i have been there 3 time with my parent . every time when i immersed myself into those attractive play event my parent just sat there to look at me `` flying up and down '' because they are a little bit of old for those play event , they may have some worry even a little fear toward them . as we all know , young people nowadays often prefer to do a lot of thing on computer such a shopping , reading and sometimes studying through the internet . on the other hand , older people more often have trouble dealing with these machine which can bring a lot of convinience to our work , study and life . as a result , older people can only solve problem all by themselves . but how can they keep up the fast pace of the modern world with their lower efficient ? they will have le time to enjoy the beautiful life . as far a i wa concern , young people are more adaptable to the quickly-changing world , they easily convert their thought of thing ; they are more likely to change their attitude towards life and the way of living . whenever newer and nicer thing appear , the young will be the first to take them , follow them and enjoy them while older people always have cold foot to new thing and always over thinking `` so-called '' risk of those thing . in conclusion , i raise both of my hand to agree with the statement : young people enjoy life more than older people do .
