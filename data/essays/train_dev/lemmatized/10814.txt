first of all , knowledge is like a diamond something very expensive and you are proud to have and without knowledge you 'll be out of the whole world , and no body ha doubt with this . beeing specialized in on e specific subject doe n't mean that you are going to ignore the other part of knowledge which may be sometimes more important to know . the advantage of beeing specialist in on part of the life sience is that you will concentrate on what you are doing and this will lead a person to be creative in his work and to live with an ambition that will lead him to fight to achive his desired goal in that field . now day the community need those specialist because of thier good experience and thought about what they are doing in thier major , for example , the home designer , film director , photographer , engineer and others all of these are specialist and imagine a community without them . even though the company , they are paying alot for those people who are talented in thier major to do thier job completed in an aacurate and efficient way knowledge about other thing is a must and life requires that must . so i agree that the person should cocentrate on his field first and then he should know some part of knowledge that he need , to improve his life and to be able to comunicate with other knowledge and to learn from them what they know . the community will never be improved or developed if there is no specialist , and culture will not be formed if there is no specialist where every person is doing his job to form a beautiful culture finally at the end .
