in this essay i am going to explain if i agree or disagree that in twenty year will be fewer car in use than there are today . first at all i think that nowadays there are really a lot of car , that are making really dirty and unhealthy the world . this is due to the low price of the car and the increasing salary and need of the society . our world just care about material thing and we are forgetting that in a few year maybe we will not be able to walk in the street becasue the sun will be really unhealty for our skin . so i think that is really difficult that the number of car decrease in twenty year , except that the state start to work today in this problem . i think we are really selfish because we are not thinking in our future generation . so i think that the best think to do now is start to work in this . the action that i would do to decrease the number of car would be the following one . first of all i would increase the public transportation , but i would also improve the condition of the bus and i would decrease the price of the public tranportation . secondly i would increase the tax of car due that they dirty really a lot the city and they also damage the envairoment . to conclude , i think that if the state start to work hard to try to decrease the number of car will be possible in twenty year that there will be fewer car than there are today , but i think that is really difficult to reach this objective , becasue until now really a little of people care of our nature , and if we want to decrease the number of car we will have to work really hard with the help ot the state .
