i agree with the statement that `` most advertisment product seem much better than they really are '' . for two main reason , first the main goal of advertisent is to sell and the seller would try to show their product the best they can . on the other hand advertisement campains can make the consumer think that owning the product can make them fell or be a certain way . as said in th introduction the main goal of advertisment is to sell , and make the likeable and atractive to the consumer . these may result in distortioning the real product , for example food product , to be able to transmit a flavor , which is a sensation , on visual image , the advertiser need to over show all the visual characteristis of a the product , this may result on a distortion of the real size and aparence of a food product . as a second argument the advertisement can make consumer understand that by adquiring the product they can fell or be a certain way , for example woman shampoo campains always show a prototipe of woman 's hair . the consumer may asume that the type of hair that the person on the advertisment ha would be the same a that she would adquire if she us the product . that doe not necesarily mean that the product seem much better than it is , just that the consumer is making assumption over the product but this is a direct consecuence of the advertisment . the wish of the producer to sell their product to te consumer may end up on a distortioning on the product by making them seem much better that they are , basicaly because of assumption of the consumer is drawn to by the visual image of the advertisment .
