living in a crowded city with an undeniable traffic problem is getting worse each day . being a part of this tarffic jam the car generally save our life to get from one place to another . it is really an easy way to get out from our house and use our car to transport . but remembering this ; just one person in a car going to his/her work make u crazy especially in the morning . in our daily life some of u use public transportation . there are many bus or other vehicle but besides most of the people use their own car to get to work or somewhere else . the car are getting more and more each day and this cause great problem . more car accident , more air pollution , more noise etc . the government work for this problem to make a solution and it is very useful . now a day people are learning to use public transportation . after all people should agree using underground it woud be helpfull to u . using an underground or a bus or getting to work with your own car but with some friend of yours , also would be a possible solution for the traffic jam . people will do these thing when they realise that this is usefull but this will take time unfortunately . i think that a the time pass the traffic is not going to be a problem because in twenty year there will be fewer car in use than there are today . in the beginning some people will not agree but after some time i think they will see the truth . living in a world without a traffic and a clear weather will be more enjoyable . people will slowly understand that using public transportation will make their life easier . so a the time pass maybe this will help u to communicate with each other in crowded place we will be living in a world all the people understanding each other .
