i fully agree with the statement for four reason . 1. if you have a broad knowledge of many subject you can improve your knowledge in these area constantly . if you are just good in one subject it will be rather hard to gain new knowledge in other area because you lack the basic understanding of the topic . 2.when you are looking for a job you can choose from a much larger variety of offer if you have an idea of more than one subject . given the example you are a manager and you know many subject very well . then you can draw conclusion , that could help you solving problem at work , with information from a different subject . cross-subject thinking is an important qualification for higher management position . not only because of your intelligence but aswell because you can do smalltalk , which becomes more and more important in business relation . 3. you are always an interesting man when you can have a `` chit chat ' about almost every topic . it raise your status in society if you have a basic knowledge of lot of topic . 4.your daily life can be made easier by using the knowledge to solve problem in whatever part of your life you want . you can use the knowledge like a toolbox for problem . to put it all in a nutshell having a broad knowledge of a variety of subject is a base to build on and learn more about particular topic . it open you the door to a lot of job and raise your status in society . the knowledge give you topic to smalltalk about and the use of the knowledge help you solving problem either in the job or just in daily life . i only see advantage in having a broad knowledge of many subject .
