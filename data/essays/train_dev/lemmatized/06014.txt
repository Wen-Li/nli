if you have a choice to travel around the country , will you go along by yourself or travel in a group ead by a tour guide ? as for me , i will take the second answer and i believe this the best way to use in the travel , for the following reason : first and fore most , traveling in a group and accompanied by a tour guide give me more knowledge and pleasure in my tour . compare to travelling alone , the tour guide may tell u more background information , story of the sighting and also introduces many local cultrual matter or traditional habit . these great information certainly enhences my trip and make me be knowledgalbe to where i have been visited . in addition , it is suah a good way to use my money and time wisely in the tour . travelling in a group will absolutely save my money and time . for instance , other group member and i share the same bus , we book the hotel with lower price and our schedule is highly planed before we go . thes significant part offer me a more economic travel than my travelling alone . last but not the least , it make me meeting a lot of new friend in my tour group and my travel is full of fun . it is benificial for travelling together with others rather than by oneself alone simply because i make friend with our group member and share the happiness with them . in a conclusion , travelling in a group and being led by a tour guide is the best way to experience and enjoy my tour .
