i do not agree with the statement that young people enjoy life more than older people do . i support my position on the following argument : i think that every stage in life ha a special feature that make it different . on the one hand , young people like to travel , spend time with friend hanging out , practicing sport and doing other activity proper to their age , which is perfectly good . it is the perfect stage of life to learn , experience and recognize the value that were transmited to u . it is also a period in which young people could enjoy the opportunity to demonstrate their affection and love to older people , knowing that some day they will also get older and in demand of affection and attention . in other word , it is a life period that always will be remembered , but that also ha to be spent with care and responsability . on the other hand , older people become more family oriented , traying to spend more time with their relative and the loved one . it is natural , their priority in life have changed , but it doe not mean that they do not enjoy life anymore , on the contrary , they enjoy life on their own way . even though it is true that older people become more and more dependant from relative and other people , it is also true that this is an efficient and human way for u to show them our appreciation for what they have done in their life . this is also a great chance for them to witness the love that their relative may show and feel . in sum , i believe that young people a well a older people are totally able to enjoy life in their own way and considering the characteristic of both different human stage . thus , i do not believe that young people enjoy life more than older people do .
