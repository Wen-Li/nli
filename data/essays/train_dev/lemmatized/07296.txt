successful the word by itself describes people who doe thing taking risk i strongly agree that successful people certainly must have done thing at risk rather than only doing what they already known i can support my statement with a couple of example for instance sunitha and kalpana chawla the great two indian would certainly not be noticed in the indian history a they have been the two only indian woman exploring into space if they had a thought of learning underneath and excelling in what they knew they might have certainly not been known to the world one can only excell in his knowledge by improving his own personal experience but exploring out with risk will certainly find a way to him for succes all successful people should or might have certainly taken risk at one point or the other in the journey of success without out which it certainly be immpossibble . trying for new thing will enable one self in discovering thing and bring him to the stage of success . trying new thing also make oneself unique in the world and certainly they would have pride and a meaningful life lived . successful come out primarily from the scientist experiment or invention . yes certainly the scientist without a risk would not have been successful with his work any individual to be successful should be dare enough to face the new aspect and try new thing then he would certainly not miss the step of success . one can not have a satisfaction in his so called success without implementing certain new thing if not that could only be for his self assesment . sucessful people like george bush and abdul kalam the president of america and india are known for there sucessful life they have tried upon new ammendments upon risk and could discover thing . every individual is not all perfect enough one can make themselves perfect by doing thing so certainly successful people try new thing and take risk rather than do what they already knew and always put their head high and taking risk will be the only aspect to be successful .
