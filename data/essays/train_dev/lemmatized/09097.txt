many people might have different point of view on this particular topic based on their personal experience or their social status . moreover , since the lifespan of human ha greatly extended compared to the past due to advanced health care system , it might be even difficult to classify between younger people and older people . however , if i narrow down the definition of young people to a stage of teenager i definetely support the idea that young people enjoy life more than older people do . first of all , young people doe not have any health concern while the older 's do . i often see a lot of old people visiting local hopital to check up thier health on a regular basis . on the other hand , young people , especially teenager are not feard with such thing . thus , they likely to experience new thing that they never had tried in their life , such a smoking , drinking with friend . those surely might be very interesting and exiciting for teenages because they might think or feel that they are approaching an unknown territory that they have never explored . in addition , unlike old people who ha health limitation , young people could definetely start any kind of sport that they are interested in . second of all , age of teenager is the stage when you do not have to seriouly concern about your future career path . while you are at school , you can try to taste variety of range of study and look for what subject attracts you the most . nobody would force you to take course that you dislike . in contrast , many old people might have put away their dream to be a scientist or a firefighter in order to have more stablilty in financial matter . from time to time , old people can not enjoy their hobby or stop them from traveling around the world because they have responsibility to support and raise their child . amoung many reason , those arguements i mentioned above are the one i believe the major difference between older people and young people . people 's taste and favor might vary from a certain stage of age to another . however , the sure thing is that the responsibilty and concern grow bigger a you get older . thus , limiting the old people from starting a new thing and this fact lead me to a conclusion that younger people have much more fun in their life and you should not waste such precious time .
