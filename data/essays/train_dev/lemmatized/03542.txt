i hardly remember any incident when some young elder member of the community had offered to help in anyway . the growing globalisation and ever-incresed competetion see to it that everyone becomes self-celtred and work for one 's own gain , thus reducing any chance of social service or social commitment . i totally agree that the youth are not sparing enough time helping to there community . if we check out any field , be it academic or non-academic , we see that there is an inceresing competetion . so , to survive in the world of competetion and to retain his place in this very tough world the youth are driven to focus on their career aspect and to continuously spend huge amount of time bettering their prospect for a better future . moreover , we constantly see a continual decipline in the moral and ethical standard in any community . and the people who are more into degraded moral and ethic are the youth . the degradation of moral value leves them so hollow that they can hardly think about community , let alone helping them . this moral degradition can be seen quit predominantly in any part of the world today . someone rightly said `` man is driven by desire '' . the `` desires '' of today 's youth have become so intense and so uncontrollable that they can harldy resists these desire , and moreover they are being driven by the not-so-good desire . describe to advance positively is alwas conducive to one personality . with never and newer technology arriving in this world , the youth are engagging themselves in taking advantage of these technology . for example , with newer viedio game in the market , the youth are driven to purchase them and spend most of their time in playing game . this culture of playing vedio game kill the time , so that individual can harldly think about the time to helping thei community . in conclusion , i believe that young people not giving enough time to helping thei community .
