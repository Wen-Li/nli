although some people prefer to say that the advertisement show what you got , i prefer to say that this might not be the case . in my opinion , the people that make those advertisement not only have a gap in the knowledge of about the characteristic of the product , but also they have a good knowledge about how to use secret message that make the product essay to sell . in the following essay , i will defend my opinion with pertinet reason and illustrative example . most of the people that meke advertisments for whatever product is on sell , they realy do n't know the characteristic about the product . if some company is seeling shampoo for example , they are not going to tell you the specific about that shampoo . even more , they wo n't show those characteristic that make the product cheap on the at . they prefer to show u only the good thing about that product . i believe , that this happen because the company want to make money a soon a they can , and they do n't pay attention on waht is realy important for costumer . they realy know how to sell the product , not because they studyied the product , like the shampoo i just said above , they realy know how to sell the product because they sometimes use secret message on their advertisement . for example , they show up on their advertisement nude woman , they use sex to sell , and a a result of that they sell more and more shampoo , because everybody want to look like that woman or that man . in the essay above , i have defended my choice with pertinent reason and example . as you can see , i rather buy my staff not paying attention at the advertisement , and i strongly recomend to get more knowledge about the staff that you are just going to buy .
