in 2006 we are living in the world of mass medium . i think it is not possible to escape from this situation . advertisements are directs product of this phenomenon , surely one of the most important and profitable part . today advertisement are not only used to sell product or promoting business but even to advertise politician during the election . it give u an idea of how big their effect could be . advertise to sell product is essential . many time we buy completely unuseful thing only because they appear in the television . the majority of people considers , probably not conscionsly , a good product what they have seen advertised , indipendently from quality . it ha happened also to me several time . advertisement tends to make product better than they are . some day ago , for example , i bought a very expensive profume only because it wa advertised by my favorite actor , without taste it before . at the end i have discovered it wa smelling very bed . i can add severel other example . a special case can be food . food in television appears very coloured and look very tasty , of course much nicer that the one cultivated by my grandparent in my house , but often the quality is really low . usually big company have the power to advertise their product massively . it is vital for their image and , above all , for their profit . let the product know can be better than produce well . it make money . to summarize , i think that advertisement ha a big impact on the image of product , despite their quality . consequentelly it depends on final customer be aware of this potential problem . it is impossible nowaday not to be influenced by the advertisement , but i whis people will be more quality oriented in the future .
