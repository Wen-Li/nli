i partially agree with the statement , learning is a process that ha different layer and dimension depending on subject and personal style . considering with the different area of learning in social science or mathematical science ; the lecturer should choose proper way to inform the student . for example ; if you study politicaly history on chronological base ; you will surely choose to learn fact first like who are the part and what are the outcome of this fact in order to get into the inner layer of the political situation . after the fact ; for giving proper meaning to that certain political event ; than you will get learn the concept and idea which is necessary for giving academic meaning to seperate subject . however ; if you study positive science like chemistry or phisics ; the priority can be changed and the learning direction will be moved to concept and idea first . the science is composing of replayed and recycling experiment that doe not include the coincidence . for exampie if you exprementig the in the biology lab , before starting the experiment , you shuld have to know what happens before and after the experimental process in order to get organized all the stage and get proper outcome . in addition , i think it depends on the subject whether to choose which proper method for student and therefore lecturer . different subject may requies different method for proper learning . you should even choose combine method of giving the fact and concept simoultanously . also personel style for learning may effect this process a well .
