i can not say if there will be fewer car in use in twenty year than there are today , because there are a lot of thing to take into account to have an opinion . on the one hand , there are more and more regulation about car in big city to avoid pollution and make inhabitant of town feel better . people want to be able to walk on the street without feeling oppressed by the car there are around them , the noise they create and they want also to smell other thing than petrol . in addition , nobody know whether there will be enough petrol in twenty year so that everybody can use one 's car a much a one us it today . if petrol becomes le and le available and , therefore , more and more expensive , people will have to find new solution to move from one place to another . i think it is totally possible because there are a lot of mean of transport which waste much le petrol than car . for exemple , people could take the train or the bus , or even their bike . the main problem is that they are used to driving their car at each time they need to go out from their home , so they do not think to take their bike instead , or to walk . when driving will have become too expensive for the majority of people , one will learn to live without one 's car , and people will probably enjoy it . on the other hand , the car industry is still growing and brand are developping new model which are more comfortable , better designed and posse all the new technology . they want people to keep buying their new car so i think that they are going to do their best to attract customer , especially if the trend confirms that people give up using their car .
