today , our communites and city suffer under a large variety of problem . often this problem are money based problem , but they are also suffering under the lack of activies of yopung people . i think the youth of today take le care about hepling their community . so , ask your self , why are our ccommunities so dirty , or why there are le socuial activity of young people in our city , and why it seemed so that nowadays youth is more selfish . when you take a look to some public playground , you will find them in very bad condition . they are so dirty that they can not be used by toddler or tiny tot . in most case thesis place are dirty because young people misuse this place for hanging around and distroy them . this is an evident , for mine , that they don not appreciate the communitie 's playground . so , they do n't help the communitie . also , the youth ha got le social activity . they do n't help older people or do other important social work in ther neighborhood . and , when they do n't to such important mentioned task , they scarce care about the need of a communitie . and finally , today youth ha become more selfish , the rest of society a well , but especially young people want to reap their benefit . they take all benfits and good from other they are able to get , but do n't want it to pay something back . for them , the communitie count much , often the communitie is indiffernt to them . also the do n't build up any identification with their home town . by and large , it seems to that every thing go down the drain . there are server problem in our society , and they are difficult to solve . but i am quit sure that we will mange this problem and that this will change .
