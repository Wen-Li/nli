first of all , i totally agree with the statement because in advertisement they make the product look shiny and in it perfect condition and the result we see on it are not real because it wa shown to u by actor not real consumer . based on my experience , i tried many anti-dandruff shampoo that i 've seen on television advertisement and they did n't work out . i followed the instruction on the bottle but i think it ha something to do with the product it self . i tried another product i didn 's see before on television and it worked out very well with me . i think what turn out to be good with you doe n't have to be with everyone else . for example , in car we see these powerful car that can go through any difficulty from climbing mountain to driving it in mud and on deep snow on the road or off the road while actually not all car are capable of doing such thing . they show u car going very fast and you think that it is safe to drive in such speed while it 's not . the most dangerous advertisement i see a aparent are the kid 's advertisement specially when they show some chocolate and candy and the kid in the advertisement is eating a many a he can without brushing and his teeth are perfect while in real life that is not true . but considering the people behind these advertisement , we find that they are company trying to make money out of their product so they have to make their product look the best way possible to convince the viewer to go and buy it . making advertisement is an industry now and the company ha the right make their product look perfect but i think the viewer also have the right to know whether this advertisement is real and the product is like what they see before they buy it .
