many study have shown that using of car have a strong impact on environment pollution . however , it can be understood in our everyday life that the number of car is rising . for example , some year ago it took fifteen minute to reach my office while now it take at least half an hour . even when we listen politician speaking about how to work the problem of car pollution out , noboby seems to take into consideration the possibility to reduce the number of car . they rather seems to put much weight on alternative solution , such a finding a new kind of essence or pushing people to use electric car . personally , i do not believe that this situation will change in the future . first of all , using a car is easier and more comfortable that use public transport . people do not have to deal with timetable or bus stop . they can decide on their own when and where to leave . secondly , city are becoming bigger and bigger . so , even if two person have to go to the same city they need to have two car . as a matter of fact , in milan , for example , it take at least one hour to go from one part of the city to another . finally , people need to move to more distant place for working , studing or meeting their friend . it is le stresfull to use a car than take a train , then a bus and a taxi . in conclusion , i do not believe that the number of car will decrease in the future . the only way to achieve that would be would be to forbid the using of car .
