everyone is looking forward to be successful person . in order to be successful you should have a lot of a good chacteristics . you sould be a competitive , an avid , intelegent , strong , wise and challenger person , also you should have the ability to learn any thing new even if you dont like it . moreover , you have to be a brave person , so you will not afraid from having risk . some successful people try new thing and take risk rather than only doing what they already know how to do well . in my opinion , i agree with the person who try new thing because of several thing . first of all , of course when you try something new you will increase your exprience and your knowledge . for example , one day my administratore asked me to prepare a presentation with power point program because he beleved that i know how to work well with that program , but i made a decision to take a risk by useing a new stronger and difficult program . finaly , i have done that presentation perfectily and successfully . one more example , when i face any hardware or software problem with my computer , i will not ask any person to help me. instead of that i will try to solve that problem myself . according to that , i will have a lot of experience in the computer field . at the last , a far a i am concidered , the life require from the people to learn new thing , to have risk , to increase their experience and their knowledge . otherwise we will not be able to survive in this life .
