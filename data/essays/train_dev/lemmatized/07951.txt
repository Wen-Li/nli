an idea , which can change our life , because if have idea we take decision for a situation . concepts are more about the situation , what is the situation , and how it occur . facts that are alreday existed or happened in the past . it is importent to student to understand idea and concept , in a way that if they understand the idea and concept they will make a decision . ideas come from the past experiance where the concept is from the study of situation or subject , by holding idea and concept we will make a good decision . for example , if a former having a coflict , that how to develop the prodution of craft , then he have some idea how to develop the production , and he have some past experiance that he faced , that mean he ha a concept on the craft , that which land is suitable for which craft , and what fertilizer he ha to use , so he can develop the craft production by using better idea . if we learn fact to solve situation , that fact are may not suitable for the situation and it might be failed . so , learning fact are useful , when we take support of the understanding the idea and concept . we can not separate the fact , idea and concept . thus , it is more importent to study the situation , make idea on that , and know the fact then solve the situation .
