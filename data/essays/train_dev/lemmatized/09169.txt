i agree with the fact that young people enjoy life more than older people do . our current society give more opportunity to young people than old people . thus , young people have more oportunities that they can find thing that they can enjoy . first , young people do more activity than older people . young people who living in society , they have to do a lot of thing . some people have to do work and some people have to s tudy for their future . also these are decided by their own opinion . young people can decide what they want to be and what they want to do . they can find happiness while they are doing something . i always thinking that i want to be a jouenalist . that is why i would like to researching people and reading a book . i really enjoy thing that i do and i am happy to study that i want to do . aometimes i saw people who doe not have to learn any more like my grandmother . my grand mother graduated from korea-university and right after graduation she went to china for learn cinese . however , she doe not study anymore and just stay at home . one day , when i visit her , she asked me that what i want to be and i told her i want to be a journalist . i remember she told me that do it hard wharever i do because she thought when she learn somthing that she want to wa her happiest time of the life . second , also , young people have more opportunity that they can get involve the group . in our society , people need to live with other people . if people live alone they can never be happy and never enjoy their life . i think young people have more opportunity that they can meet more people than older people . almost young people are belonging many kind on group , suchas class mate , church people , also whatever they do for their habit . old people might belonging group but according to research from the korean-broadcast that i remember said compare to young people group and old people group of book club , young people group have more activity like trip , meeting and discussion . these are the reason of why i agree with the sentence `` young people enjoy life more than older people do . '' because young people have more opportunity than old people , they can enjoy their life more than old people .
