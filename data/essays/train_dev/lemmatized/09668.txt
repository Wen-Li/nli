i disagree with the following statement because if we a student are to learn and understand idea and concept we need to learn the primary fact . without fact learning something won Â´ t be useless but it will be hard to understand . facts tell u about something real that happened or is happening now . fact or non-fiction talk mostly on the subject history and science . in my point of view why would we need idea if the fact have all the idea we need to write down . concepts like renaissance ( french for rebirth ) and atom are all history and science concept so the concept would be useless without the fact being laid in front of you . a student for example might know what an atom or proton is but would they know the complete definition or where the word originated from . he might also have an idea of the renaissance but he might not know the main idea of the renaissance like famous people like leonard da vinci or michaengalo or origination of the concept . the fact we read and write are all necessary for student to fully understand and idea or a concept . also a student might have trouble defining a certain concept on a history exam or test . he or she might pas with a 60 or 61 but what would have happened if he or she knew the fact and got a 70 or 80 . also a student may get an assignment about identifying the main idea without his or her textbook . he or she may not have read the page of his textbook and might not know a thing about the assignment and get a 0 or 50 . if he had studied the most important fact in his textbook he would have gotten a 90 or 100 . all the thing i am talking about explains the need to know fact in order for a student to understand the word idea and concept .
