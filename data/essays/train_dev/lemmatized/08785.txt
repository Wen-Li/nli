i totallay agree with the statement , that it is better , to have broad knowledge of many academic subject than to specialize in one subject . i did a professinal education a a medium designer and now i am studying medium science , political science and cultural science , and therefore i can tell from my own experience , that it is very important today , to have knowledge of a variety of topic . first of all , my study showed me more than once , that many development , they may be cultural or technical , are connected in some way . so , when you have knowlegde about different subject , you can develop a much better understanding concerning the whole situation . what is more is , that a broad education is very useful for later business life . today , job are not that restricted and limited anymore . almost every modern job applies an excellent general knowledge . during my eduacation , for example , i had to show creative skill on the one hand , and mathematical and technical skill on the other hand . studies also show , that few people would keep one job for their whole life . there is a certain tendency , that people will have two ore more job during their lifetime . my mother is a good a example for this development . first , she did an education a a nurse . when she became mother , she stayed at home for 10 year . now , back in business life , she work a an german teacher . all in all i think , i made clear , why i am convinced that a broad knowlege of various subject is necessary . the key word for the 21th century definetly is flexibility and i think , that university in particular should support that development by offering a huge variety of academic subject .
