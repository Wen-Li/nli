i 'm studying mathematics and computer science and i found it very much related field of studying . i 've some knowledge of mathematics and computer science because mathematics is the basis to computer science . i think knowing ( studying ) deep about one or two related major is better then having a shallow knowledge about a vatiaty of bounch of major . that is because of several reason i can mention some of them like any one know that the development in science is never ever stop and having new thing each day . so in order to a person to increase his knowledge in the major he is interested in will required from him to have an incrrideble ability because a a human beings it is impossible to have a constant knowledge that can be retrieved and reviewed in our brain . that wa one point another is due to our average age which will not let u to have a very good knowledge about cuple of science keeping in mind that when you want to finish your undergraduate study you spend about 22 to year of your age and if you want to complete your graduate study you need an extra 6 year which will be then 28 year of your life after that you need to show your ability in what you studied which required from your year and year of research . anther thing is that concentration is the most important factor in order to a person to be successful otherwise a a human being he will get lost and will not have a clear idea about what he is hopping to be . as a society we are a number of person and each one ha to dump a certain gap in order to be a good society and to acheive our qoals a one society whcih follows in acheiving our goal a a one person in a society .
