some people think that it is more important for student to understnad idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact . however , i believe student need to learn fact rather than idea amd concept . first of all , student can learn what they should do or should not do from fact . when they learn consequence of a certain fact , they will know that the fact should be done again or not . for example , if student learn about war , they will know that people should not fight each other again . since student wll learn that war cause so many death from the war which occured in the past , they would think that war are not acceptable . second , while ideas and concept can be very complicated and difficult to understand , fact are easy to understand . for instance , when student learn the concept of `` dilemma '' , they may not understand the meaning completely . however , if they learn example of `` dilemma '' , they would understand easily and deeply . finally , fact are related to real life . therefore , student can match their experience with the fact they have learnt . as a result , they can predict what will hapen next and prevent bad consequence . for example , there wa a huge earthquak in japan and a lot of people died becase furniture in the house hit them . if student learn about that , they can prevent it from happning again by attaching furniture to wall . in conclusion , fact provide student with more useful information than idea and concept doe .
