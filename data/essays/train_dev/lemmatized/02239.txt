the fact that most concept and idea lead to a fact make me agree with the previous statement . when i wa a child , most of the fact were explained to me a : `` that is the way it is '' . that is why i saw the world very big at that time . growing up through year to reach this level , knowing so many thing make me wondering about that saying . actually from my study in the university , i found that most the fact that were not explained by thier concept are strange thing . we usually start with idea and conceots to reach such fact that no one can say it is wrong or there is an adoubt about it . for our brain , the fact that we can not explin is not worth to think about . this thing is invalid for ginous pepole . an example of what i wrote so far , if we consider the earth with it circular shape came from the believe that we can cross the world from east to west . but know one can explain why the people in the sothern region of the earth do not feel that they up side down . this example show how idea and concept will yeild to fact and how fact sometimes can not be explained . finally , when the studet concentrate on the idea and concept he will learn the ability how to match the fact togather . on the other hand , if the student focus on the learning the fact he will learn the ability to memorize the event which is not a character of this generation good learning . a match between them will be better although i consisit that knowing idea are more useful than learning fact .
