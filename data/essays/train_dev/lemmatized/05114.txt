first of all , i totally disagree with the following statement . and the reason follow . one , by my personal experience , traveling by a tour guide is way more expensive than by on own . because the travel company which the guide is associated in always suggests expensive hotel with bad status and flight . in that case we might not able to chance to stay in nice hotel with cheap price and have no season discount on flight either . for example , one of my friend went germany from korea with a flight costed more than $ 1000 through the travel company , but i went same country following week , le than $ 850 with getting season descount on my own . one more thing is that guide always lead the traveler only to famous spot which are listed on the itiniery . in that case you wo n't get chance to visit some nice place that only few people know . i once had a chance to stay on a nice old castle in france . most of friend are jealous and are dying to visit their after saw the picture i took . two , traveling in a group may be safe sometimes . according to the 8 year of personal traveling experience , most travel accident occur in a group traveler . because when we travel in a group by a tour guide , people are always crowded and they are usually paying attention to the guide . and that cause accident such a robbery . one of my roommate once traveled spain in a group with a tour guide and the guide said pay attention because they were passing the important spot the guide stated . and he had paid attention . but while he were doing so a stranger cutted out his camera . three , if we travel alone we get a chance to make international friend . i still keep in contact with them and when they visit my country i guide them . finally , traveling in a gruop is not always good in many reason .
