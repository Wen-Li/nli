i agree with the statement . infact i believe that young people enjoy life more than older people because they find it more interesting , they still have to affront many life 's problem , they still have to feel every sensation , they still have to know how life could be horrible sometimes , they still have to know a lot of life-s part that old people already know . for example sometimes my mother tell me how i could affront a problem because she have already affronted a situation like mine and i love when she doe it . everyday young guy and girl feel that there is a big and awesome world in front of them which is waiting them . i love this sensation . i love have a lot of dream about my future , i like think that i can do what i want about my life because everything depends by me . i know that it 's not like this , there are a lot of problem that i will have to affront during my life , but i prefer to convince myself that with my force i 'll be able to arrive where i want to . old men and woman believe that their life is an habit ; for example , they already know what they will do next summer because they will do what they did last year and the year before . i want that my mother and my father understand that they are still young , they have to live their life a i uually do with mine . what they usually tell me about my life are important information for me to resolve my problem , but they have to enjoy their life . for example they could go away for two day without me and my brother or they could change habit and go out for dinner sometimes . when they talk about what they did when they where younger i can see how much they miss that period and i feel bad . .. maybe next christmas i could ask to the big man , a we call him to remember to my parent
