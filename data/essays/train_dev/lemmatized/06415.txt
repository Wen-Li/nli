i agree with the comment that the yonger people now a day do not give enough time for helping their community . this could be a result of many reason . helping the community is a part of every person duty . in improveing their community they would tend to improve their surroundings and their quality of living . for example , if there is a need for some good social worker for their community they would not have much of their intrest in such a kind of aspect because they are busy with their work tension . they would rather spend their time enjoying in some play groud or a film theater rather in doing some social work for their community . the younger generation now a day would prefer to stay out of halping their community to develop because they are intrested in some other aspect . they would le concentrated on halping their community because some ego feeling which their fellow collegues would never do . they are very busy with their academic career that they do not have much time left for helping community . it would not be the problem of the educational institution for having such a tight schedule of academic . but it would be the sheer intrest of the younger people to have the community . it would be their personnel intrest for helping the community . like wise there are very few younger people who would rather show some intrest in helping community . it would be the older people who would like to help more rather than the younger people because they have no work tension . it would be rather correct to say they have much le work tension rather than the younger people . so they would surely have some advantage over the younger people in helping their community . in conclusion , i would like to say that the younger people have very much le time for helping the community when compared to the older people . it would help the community grow faster if the younger people show some intrest in their community because they are much more energetic and enthusiastic then the older people .
