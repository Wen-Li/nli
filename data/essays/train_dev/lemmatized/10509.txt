due to the current level where science ha reached by mean of content and achievement , it is obvious that you need to specialize in one particular area rather than dealing with different field . in otherwords science ha all it resource from the academic study and subject and moving them to a next level by mean of continuing this progress for the commonwealth , we need to focus on one specific subject while being aware of the influence of the other related field a well . when we consider the politics a an academical subject , we can not separate it from sociology or related social science . therefore we should be aware of the sociology in order to study politics a a science or an academic subject , however in order to be succesful in the related academic subject , this line ha to be drawn very carefully by mean of knowing where to stop . if we take a look at the people who are specialized in their academic subject , it is very common to see the example of above model since all subject in certain limit are effecting each other , sometimes supplementing , sometimes resulting in contradiction . on the otherhand the definition of any academical title requires very deep knowledge which should make our way into having a broad knowledge of one specific academic subject which we are specialized rather than dealing with different subject . the professor in university realizing academical study is a good example to be considered at this point . but a discussed above we should not ignore the above model in term of having at least a basic information about how the other subject effect our study . history is also another factor to be considered in term of comparing the example . many sciencists had worked on particular academical subject in order to progress themselves and accomplish their responsibility against the humanity by inventing different device , offfering different thesis which are still lightning their follower . such a edison , einstein and many others are good example of this heritage . consequently the academical subject ha to be handled one by one or specifically in order to be more innovative and useful for the humanity . in my opinion , past is the best mirror supportting this approach .
