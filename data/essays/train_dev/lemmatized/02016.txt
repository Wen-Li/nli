ideas and concept are building block of learning and understanding fact . merely learning fact is not going to help . if student are stuffed with fact , then what is the difference between a student and a book . ideas come from interaction which are of different type . the importance of idea and concept is very much high . the important thing is that fact can be derived if concept are clear . facts can easily manipulated and tempered with . in other word fact are not that much reliable . but if student are loaded with correct concept and innovative idea incorrect fact can be corrected . facts only talk about a particular situation . they dont deal in general . again the underlining thing is that fact dont provide the wider picture which a student should look for . learning fact can sometimes affect the thought process in wrong direction a they may be manipulated . for eg. falling of apple a fact but the idea and concept is gravitational force . understanding gravitation helped the whole human race . had this been regarded a a fact only , many thing would not hane been possible . the above example explains how merely learning fact will not help student . innovative idea are the thing that have helped the humankind from the onset . ideas and concept are the breeding ground of fact . if student are armed with idea and concept developing fact is not going to pose any problem . what is required is a balanced approach towards this . students should be taught to generate idea and concept and should be encouraged to find fact .
