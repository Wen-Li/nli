the issue statement is youngpoeople are now day do not give enough time to helping their community . this is an important topic . i agree the given statement that young people did n't have enough time to help their community . because their are busy with their work and study . now a day we are seeing the competitive world how the ccompition is going on in every thing and especially in the study . people are unable to enable to tackle it . they even have no time to sleep . they are totally stressed from morning toevening with their busy schedule . to day young people doesnt have no enough time to eat and sleep . because we have to get up early in the morning and we have to think over our study from morning onwards . parents are forcing them to do several thing which they are not interested . either it may be in study are another thing . their are getting totally tensed that they are not fullfilling the parent goal . they are toatlly stressed form all of them . no time to think any body just they are doing therir work and finishing the fullfillnness of their parent . secondly , i want to say that young people are diverting their thinking in other way by seeing different thing likemovies which they want to be in that passion . they are smoking , bruzing and they are neglecting their health by this thing . andthey arenot concentration their study and behaving rudely with other . so where is the time to think other communitis to them . another more ican tell you that day by day the helping nature is decreasing in our world . it ha many reason . so , i think it may due to more population and jelsy in thepeople . we are seeing that we are not helping eachother especially in ourfamily when they are enable to solvetheir problem imean they are in any risk . finally i want to conclude that young have no enough time to think for helping their community . ultimately i feel that they are totally concentrating their future goal which they want to get succeed .
