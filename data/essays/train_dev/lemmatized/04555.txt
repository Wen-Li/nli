taking risk and trying the new thing are the most important key that are going to open the door of the success to u . success is matched with risk and the experiment . if there is no risk , there is no success . success is like a fish that a long a we try hard to catch it and take a risk of dropping in the sea and to try new method to accomplish , there is no way to miss it . i would like to express my opinion with one proverb in turkish that the people who are not brave enough to take a chance are going to stay the place where they are without moving on while the people who try many new thing by taking risk are going to reach the top of the success . without trying , there is no way to learn and it is not possible to find out if we are on the right track or not . for example , my father like to play safe rather than to take a risk . he is so afraid to fail . as a result of this , he ha been standing the same place where he is . he wa going to open a restaurant couple of year ago he wa almost done with the process but then he changed his mind and he did not put in a practice . because , he wa afraid to fail and go down . now , he ha been working for someone and he is not happy at all . if he had opened the restaurant at the time that he got a chance , now we may have been well-off . additionally , now he regret that he did not take the chance that wa offered to succeed . there is a saying that `` use it or lose it '' and he lost it . all in all , if there is no risk , there is no success . if we want to be called a a successful person and not to regret and not to say `` i wish '' later on in our life , we should try new thing and take risk without being afraid in order to accomplish .
