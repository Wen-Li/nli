i totally disagree with the statement , ` young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their community ' . we are , if the word community determines not a division on the bacis of ` cast , colour or creed ' . the new generation young people are more social consious than of those in the past . they broke open many barrier that older generation same age group lived in . the new ad in the tv would speak the extent of support even from their parent doe young people recieve for to participate in helping their community . in this case , the ad begin showing a distressed young guy sitting in a balcony watching at the street he live in . he is shocked to see the state of living he is in , with road filled with litter , nothing in place . he then get shocked to see a little boy searching for food near a bin . this little boy awakens to the plight of situation that can be altered . he invite his friend not for an outing a like any other weekend , for to clean up the street , not waiting for help from government . they also help the little boy with some food , they raise donation for to help the boy with education . parents are shown not restricting to the move of the boy . .. that could just be an ad , but it depicts the state of mind the new generation ha . we are feasable to bad , but if moulded , we can make the best out of worst . we are scheduling the time more perfect , devoting time for all . our generation is ` jack of all , and also master of all ' . gone are day when in education distinction is a very good grade . today , a grade is most common . this generation is balancing it time between work - play - study - and social work more perfect . many young people can be seen a volunteer in many social organisation . they do not care the risk involved . they are more swift , more easy grasping , more one for all than to all for one . highest are young people in number in organisation like red cross , blue cross and other volunatry organisation
