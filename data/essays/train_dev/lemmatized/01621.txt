when people go to university , sometimes they should choose between learn many subject and one subject . some people believe that specializing in one specific subject is useful for them . because they can study one subfect deeply , they can apply theit kmnoweldge to other situation . however , others agree that having broad konwledge is helpful , owing to various knowedge , they can communicate with no matter who . on the one hand , one group think that people can be more professional in one field when they study one specific subject deeply . supposing , one have knowledge in one subject , one could develope the subject better than who have le information . besides , knowledge that is focused on one subject could be applied to other subject . specifically , individual study chemistry , they can connect chemistry and biological . on ther other hand , another group claim that people can acquire a variety of topic when they learn numberous subject . for instance , individiuals do not know when they will meet others , and who they will meet . however , if they accumulate broad knowedge , they can not only converse easily about any topic , but also deal with the topic that a partner is interested in . to sum up , i stroghly support that having various knoweldge is better , since if i know many thing , i can talk about topic no matter what .
