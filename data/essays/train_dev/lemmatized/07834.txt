yes i undoubtedly agree with the statement that it is more important and recomendable for a student to understand the idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact . i support the statement because through real time experience i inferred that most of the people who learn fact a they are instead of taking the real meaning behind it are mostly vulnerable to take it for a wrong purpose . the fact we learn in our early stage of life help u throughout our life . we build ourselves and our character upon the concrete pillar of what we infer . so , it is essential for u to understand the fact instead of learning them . as the later may lead to serious consequence and wrong character building . for example , let get into the daily life . we learn in physic that according to newton third law of motion every action ha an equal and opposite reaction . this is a broad concept that could be applied in many case of our real life . lets consider the rocket on which we applied it to reach limit of our atmosphere and also further . but , when you consider it in case of a simple daily case of a pressure coocker . the steam build up when it is heated inside it and if you happen to open the lid without allowing the inner pressure to escape my removing the counter weight there is a high danger that the high pressurised steam may come bursting on to the one who open it causing seroius burn . this wa a case i say , that shocked me and after consulting my physic lecturer i came to know the reason behind it . had the person known the concept of the law of pressure and the newton third law of motion he would n't have done the mistake which sent him to hospital for more than a month . this severe could be the consequence of not knowing thing for what they are meant .
