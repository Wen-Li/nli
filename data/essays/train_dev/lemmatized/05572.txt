nowadays people are discussing that it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subject than to specialize in one specific subject . i think most people , including myself , do n't agree that claim . because it is superficial knowledge , does't help you for your job , you do take poor grade in the test which is related to your major . also i can count several disadvantage about the broad knowledge of many academic subject . although you learn a lot of knowledge . they are all superficial . for example , you are engineer and you took art class when you were in university . one day perhaps you will meet a painter and start to talk about artm . what will you say about art that attracts the painter . nothing , only you count the name of the artist . also this knowledge doe n't help you when you apply for a job or during your job . if you focus on your major more , you will be more succesful in your job . statics show that people specializing in one specific subject are more happy because they are more successful in their job . also successful work life mean that a good profit for you , because successful men earn a lot of money from their job . if you focus on your major 's lesson , you will be successful not only in your work life , but also in student life . that mean you are killing two bird with one stone . you will be more successful in your lesson because you can make relationship among the knowledge . taking everyting into consideration , i can clearly state that specializing in one specific subject is better . special person make specializing in their subject . thats my motto
