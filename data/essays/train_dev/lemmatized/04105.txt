going to school is a big issue in life . it can change it just to many diferent way . all this knowledge that you get in all this time make your life much different than those that never take the chance to go . that is way people who take the chance to do it , must have an open mind to understand idea , concept and obviusly to learn the fact of any information . when you are talking a topic let 's say child , you must learn about everything , food , game , sickness , parent etc . . so this is the idea , `` child '' , but you must learn about concept , like what is common in them , what is teoric , what is normal in their behaviur , how to treat them , how to talk to them , how to play with them , and when you find all this information and understand , it will be much easier to do everything with them , so this last part will be the facts . per example , to coach child skater you must know first how to skate , then how to teach childrens , and with all this information you must know how to apply your knowledge in child , and during this time you will find that every single kid is diferent and you have to treat everyone diferent . to sumarize this subject i must say that any student that is taking any class at school have to memorize , understand different idea , diferent concept and of course to learn fact , to have an open mind and in this way to learn in an overall way all information that you are receiving , this is the order in an normal and objective way to learn . so i must disagree to the autor of this statement because i must said that this 3 concept must be together in a learning process .
