what is the best way to learn ? to stay on the main idea and learn the fact or understand the idea , consepts and be able to demonstarate your idea ? learning the fact is not the answer all the time . it is known from all the research and technics that ha been used to teach to student that , giving the fact and trying to use this limited fact from that given information is never enough . is that what a student need ? a student should know why it happened like that , how did it happen ? what wa the cause to that ? what would happen in a different case ? they need to question these . this is how the door to their mind should be opened . school is not the place just to teach student , it is a place to let the student learn , to learn how to learn , to demonstarte the idea they have and to discus about other idea . this is the way how people communicate , find new idea , invent new product . this is how we became . i 've heard about a lot of student failing on their major work area just because that they have only the fact they have been thaught . whenever there wa any outstanding problem , that limited knowledge wa not enough for them . facts were not enough for them to find the solution . it is not questioning the education system , it 's about u . we need to know how to let the new generation go . improve theirselves . do better , not for u but for theirselves .
