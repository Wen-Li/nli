while a large number of student realize that understanding the idea and concept are the basis of a learning process , i tend to believe that learning fact is more important . first , the fact let the student know the implementation and design based on the abstract ieads and concept on the textbook . a student who conduct and manages a software development team may have deeper understanding over the area of software design and human resource management than the one who only learn from the book . for example , a designer may have more detailed and deepened comprehension of the internal core thinking , which is the most valuable part in his job , after he finish a design by researching and review a lot of book and article including concept proposed before . in addition , it make more sense for a student to learn the fact brought by his or her own hand-on experiment . when i wa a member in the web development team of our university website , i learned a lot from the practice of installing and configuring the web server and writing code for a web application , which is not fully stated on any book in the book store . this make my way more broad and easier to go to achieve expertise on the field of conputer science . lastly , learning fact is a higher level that just understanding the original idea and concept . the student who know how to put the principle into the daily work may show a stronger ability to master not only what to learn but also how to learn , that is to say , they are more likely to become a quick learner , an ability which is called for by many international business company such a microsoft , google and ibm . from all the discussion i mentioned above , we could safely draw a conclusion that learning fact take a more significant position that just understanding the idea and concept in the learning process .
