traveling in a group can be a lot of fun . normally those tour are well organized and you always have people around you . but visiting other place doe not have to be le fun . tours which you can do on your own might turn out to be more flexible . traveling in a group guided by someone always mean that you do not have to plan anything except maybe for planning the day when you will go to the traveling agency and it can be a lot cheaper when you compare it with travelling alone . also you could miss important sight if you do not go for the tour guide . but there are many thing that can make a journey without a tour guide and alone an unforgetable expierence . if you are alone you are administrating your own time and do not depende on other member of the group . you do not have to wait for them and you can leave out some sight that are not quite of your interrest . this can save you a lot of money . it is true that traveling in a group make it sure that you have people from the first day of your holiday which whom you can comunicate , but to say when you are traveling alone make you lonely is not true . there are many people traveling alone and they always find somebody to talk , play or simply to have fun with . being on you own make you flexible and independent . being in a group guided tour ha the advantage of letting you see all the famous sight and have a lower price maybe . in conclusion i want to say that i think it depends on the caracter of the person who travel . if you are open minden with a flexible carater and a long time of vacation day , week , month than you might prefer the alone tour but when you are a person who like to have his group , a high porcentage of culture influence and not missing any of this then you might stick with guided group tour .
