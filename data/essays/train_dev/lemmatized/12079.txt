in this topic , it point out that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide , in my opinion , i partily agree with the topic , travel by myself or travel in a small group without a guide is also good way although it is perfict to travel with a group led by a tour guide . first , travel in a group led by a tour guide is a good way . when we travel with someone else , we can communicate with them , and share what we have seen and the thought we have . another reason is that we can be safe when we go to a forest which ha wolf or other animal . a guide can tell u some detail we do n't know if we have little knowledge of the place where we go , and also , the guide can tell u which is more worthy playing while some are not so worthy . so the group travel with a guide can be a good way in travelling . nevertheless , sometimes we do not need to travel in a group , it may limt my choise . taking climb mountain a an example , when i go to the mountain by myself , i can climb a fast a i can , however , if i go with my mother or girlfriend , i must wait for her and go with her in order that she is not too tired , when time is limited , it is better to climb by myself . furthermore , tour guide is not always have benefit to my travel , maybe the guide tell you something that you are visiting , it will limit your imagination , such a what the stone look like , what the pool look like . and maybe the guide will led you to a hotel much more expensive than others so that he can take some backwards . so , when i go to travel , my choose depend on the situatin , maybe travel alone , maybe travel with a group ormay be travel with a group led by a tour guide , just choose the best way .
