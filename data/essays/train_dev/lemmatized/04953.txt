responsiblity play a big role in our life spicifically for older people . when an young child is having fun and he doe n't care about money , home and issue that happens for any person . young poeple think that they still have a good health but when they get older their health will start to go down . i agree with young people who want to have fun more than older people for couple reason . first of all , responsiblity a i mentioned in the beginning , make any person thinking about how to make his life more confident and never think about how to enjoy life except after finishing everything he wanted to do . for example in any family , the father always think about how to get money for his child , the mother look after the child and try to help her husband financially . if we look at the child , we can notice that they want to play everyday and have fun without thinking about anything . that wa a good example of showing the difference of how young and old people act . second reason , old people always start to take care of their health which absoultly go down a they get older . in the other hand , young people think about no resposibilty and no problem with their health , so why do n't they enjoy their life before anything happens in the future . for example , if someone who is 60 year old and he is retired from his job , he could have health problem refuse him to enjoy his life . another man who is 20 year old , who just finished his high school and he want to play sport and going out with his friend without any health problem thats if we ignore the exceptinals like the handicap . finally , i agree with young people to have fun with their life before they get older because they will have more responsibilties more than before . also , no body know about his health and how good it going to be . i hope everyone enjoys his life whether he is olde or young .
