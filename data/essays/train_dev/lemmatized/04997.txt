i do not agree with the statement that it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subject than to specialize in one specific subject . the main feature of academic study is that they are more specialized study made by professional researcher . these researcher have to be the one who could devote themselves to learn what the others do not know . all their study have to be based on this idea : to create , to produce , to invent and to discover . in order to achieve these , they have to be specialised in their specific subject . secondly , academic study are considered to be referrable . a lot of research , observation , study , conclusion , result and referring or relating to other study take place in the academic study . thie reliability is directly related with the way how scientific they are done . academic study are distinguished form the other profession at this point ; anybody may gather information about any subject , may have broad knowledge of many subject , but academic study are the deep study that are supposed to be referred to . unfortunately , today , there is a tendency that the academician do not like making such big effort to specialise in their subject and try to have broad knowledge on many field . most of today 's academician prefer to reproduce prior study or gather prior sudies , rather than producing original and totaly brand new one .
