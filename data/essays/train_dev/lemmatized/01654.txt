i agree with the presumption that in twenty year , there will be fewer car in use than there are today . there are various reason for this , having to do with the pollotion caused by car , the diminishing space in our city and the convinience of the public transport system . cars are fun and exiting to drive , they provide a fast and convenient way to get from place a to b. they are also getting more and more powerful with each passing day , with company coming out with 1000 bhp car . these car consume a lot of fuel and our resource are limited . it will not be long before we run out of natural oil reserve . also , due to the scarcity , the price of gas ha increased twofold over the past 10 year ( in india ) . for the common man , it is becoming infeasable to use a car everyday . he is going to have to find some other way to commute , the car is just not a viable option anymore . the other reason is that there is just not enough space in our city amymore , for every house to have a car is sheer waste of resuorces . there are so many people living n such a small space that there is no room to park the car , same is the case in market and road . the number of traffic jam and snarl is a clear indication of how there are too many car choking up the road , and people are waking up to this fact . many people have started car-pooling which is better a there is lesser wastage of resource like gas and space and also , lesser pollution . the third reason why i think that tere will be lesser number of car in 20 year is that the public transport system is catching up in a big way . with the introduction of the metro and clean cng bus , the majority of the public ha found a safe , cheap mode of transport , thereby questioning the necessity of car . there will always be car enthusiast who will never give up driving car , but for the majority of the public , these reason , and more are convincing factor to switch to other mode of transport and to economize , by car pooling and other way . in conclusion , i do agree with the sattefor the reason stated .
