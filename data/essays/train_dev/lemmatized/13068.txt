today car are considered very necessary for every travel we have to do during our life , but i strongly believe that the number of car will decrease in twenty year for several reason . the first reason for the decrease of car is that a the year go on the petrolium and consequently oil reserve will dramatically decrease and this will influence the cost of carburant , which will increase a lot , and so people will be not encouraged to buy a car knowing the fact that oil is so expensive . secondly , there is also an ambiental reason that make me think that the number of car will decrease , the fact that car pollute air and so are a risk for our health : for this reason i think that governements will not encourage the bought of new car by taxing them a lot . in addition to this , our city are not only polluted but also full of car which make moving in the city low : a a result of this situation i think that the mayor of the city will not approve an increase in the number of car in order to avoid that town will get full and full of car . i also think that in the future there will be a raise of different mean of transport such a train , bus , metro in order to decrease the pollution of the air , in fact it is demonstrated that train and metro are more echological than car ( and they are also more comfortable ) ; a a result of this increase of alternative mean of transport the use of car will be destined to decrease since the majority of population will travel with train or metro . an example of this decrease of car is provided by my own family , in fact i and my parent have decided not to buy a new car for my birthday because it cost a lot . for all these reason i think that the number of car will decrease .
