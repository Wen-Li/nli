i agree to this statement . to have the specialized in one specific subject is not bad , but only having specific knowledge doe not help people to have the wide view to the study . and that will not make improvement and spreading of the study . of corce there have to be some specifict subject but just study for one subject may not make him success with that study . broad knowledge of many academict subject may help or give hint to the specific subject . for example , some one who just study about ship engine but did not know how ship really voyage and relation with the engine and wind , wave . and also if the engine builder did not know the effect to people who work on the ship like how the engine shake effect to human , he can not improve to build new good engine . by knowing many academic subject wide view to the study can be improved an
