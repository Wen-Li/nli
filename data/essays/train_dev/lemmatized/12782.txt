in my opinion , for student it is more important understand the idea and concept than just learn the fact . the advantage of understand the idea and concept is that it is hard to forget , and easy to use . if i lean someting deeply and understand the idea , i would remember that forever . in additon , if i see something which is similar or different thing but contain the same concept , i can straigh understand it and use it . for example , i learned accounting when i wa in a first year senior high school studend , eventough i only did it for a year , but i fully understand all the concept . aferter i go to university , i restarted to study accounting , eventhough i learned that two year ago , but i still remember most of the thing . that help me save a lot of time , and have extra time to study other subject . on the other hand , if i just lean something without understanding it , it would be easier to lean and i do not have to spend a lot of time to undersand it . for instance , once i wa prepairing the history test , there wa not much time , so i just remember it without understander how did everything happen . at the time , i pas the test , but for the final exam , i have to study that again , because i can not remember anythins at all . in summary , i think student go to school for learning something to improve our life . futhermore , to extend our knowledge . we learn the idea and concept from school and put it into our daily life . that is the purpose of why we go to school . however , if we go to school and just learn all the fact for just pas the exam , then we completly missunderstand the purpose of eduaction .
