as far a i am concerned , i think young people enjoy life more than senior do . there are two reason to support this idea - health , and society . first , young people are passionate and healthy . since they are healthier than older peole , they can more travel or do activites than older people do . older people get easily tired and need the rest , because of that , it take much more time for senior to travel or do activites while healthy young people do much more activity . also there are many activites that require a good health such a sky diving , soccer , and so on . since these activity are difficult for old people , they can not do or enjoy these activity even though they really want to do those . so there are many limitation to older people . however , many young people with a great tenacity can enjoy aggresive activity and can do in a long period of time . the other reason that young people can enjoy life more than older people do is society . in society , there are many business making many entertainment . the problem is that their target are mostly young people , teenager or age of twenty to forty . the reason is young people usually make money , however old people usually retired from their job and became unemployed . for example , movie theater , or amsement park are usually noisy and are packed with a huge number of people which are the exact condition that many old people do not like . by time go by , many company emerges to the society and they produce many entertainment for young people , not old people . therefore , there are getting le thing to enjoy for old people . some people may think that older people and young people equally have chance to enjoy their life . however , due to the fact that young people are healthier and more make money and society doe not care for older people in entertaiments field , i think young people are likely to live in enjoyable life .
