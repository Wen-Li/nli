i believe that is more important to understand idea and concept . i think so because it is important to learn how to handle problem and not to know everything . the first reason is that in later time there is everytime the possibility to look a fact up in a book . so for example if do not know a special word you can look it up and it will take only some minute . so it is not very important to learn all the fact in school or in university . an other aspect is that in real life especially in work there are normally other problem a in university . so it is possible that you have learned all fact but can not solve the given problem . so you will not get your work done well . but if you understood the concept you are able to handle the situation and find a new solution . third the work in later job is so specialized that it is not possible to learn these fact in detail at university . for example in geology you can not learn everything you need for mining . the concept is the important point . it is also possible that a student will work after university in an other sector . it is today not unusual to get get a job for example in a bank if studied law before . in this case you do not need the special knowledge but structure how to work efficiently . finally university should give student the possibility to do research on new area of science . there will be no new project or e.g. a new medizin when only fact are important . through understanding the main idea , concept and structure student can reach new possibility and goal . so to conclude , of course , this doe not mean that fact should not be taught . but in the later life the structure and main idea will be more helpful . so it is more important for student to understands this then learning all the fact .
