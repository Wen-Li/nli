difference make a lot of opportunity . i clearly agree with the statement with a confidence . successful people often try their best a possible with riskes . if you are doing absolutely same thing with others , you lose the chance to success . even in the history , people got thier power and wealth by being `` stranger '' . first of all , successful people have great ability to make great deal . for example , you have a speacial ability about making computer , which are the gratest ever , you will earn a lot of money for it and you are going to be considered a a successful person . of course , since making computer cost money , you need to take risk to get money . you have possibility to lose your money . second of all , there are many worker who graduated from ordinaly university and got their job at company . let you think about you are one of them . most of worker have same skill a you do , and many people want to get their job at your company . if so , you may be fired your job and not to be succcesful . the problem of it is you do not try new thing . however , for example , oil cpmpanies get much money because they do different kind of job from others . there are not many job of oil but people get wealth by selling oil . then you see how important doing different is oneof the way to success . finally , in the history we learn , franklin d. roosevelt , a presidnt of the united states , did not follow the tradition of politics . people at that time used to think that a president should not do his job four time because of silent rule , not because of the constitution . but fdr wa elected four time . now many americans love him because of his successful job . he is reall famous not only for his job but also the breaking tradition . americans thought it is really cool . since fdr wa different from other president , he will never been forget a a successful president . in conclusion , successful people take risk for their opportunity . without it , it is hard to say that people can success . doing what poeple do is easy for u , but not for success . so i strongly believe that successful people do different thing and try their best to success .
