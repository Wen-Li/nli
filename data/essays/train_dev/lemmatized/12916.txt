personally , i totally agree with that we should have broad knowledge of many academic subject than to specialize in one specific subject . first of all , in fact , no matter closely or le closely , every subject is interrelated with each other . we need broad knowledge of many academic subject even we are majoring in a specific subject . if we focus on one thing , failing to posse a wide span of knowledge of related subject , we are even unable to be excellent in this given field . for example , if we study physic , of course , we need to pay much attention on our physic book and remember all the complex rule . but that is not all ! we need other kind of knowledge to help u doing the physic study . we need to know about computer , which will help u with our research ; we may need to know about english , in order to visit the foreign website to see the latest development in physic all over the world ; we may also need to know about lecturing , in order to spread our idea or new discovery . second , without the broad knowledge of many academic subject , we are unlikely to live an enjoyable life in today 's changing and integrited world . nowadays , the world ha become more and more mixed , no matter in geographical sense or in cultural and academical sense . we make friend with people from all over the world and we are no longer refrained within our little circle . our friend may be just specialized in totally different subject or field . it is just unrealistic if we remain only familiar with solely one kind of knowledge . so , in order to communicate with all kind of friend and to boost interpersonal relationship , we must broaden our scope of knowledge . only by doing this could it be possible for u to lead an enjoyable and rewarding life in today 's world . so , in a word , i think that it is high time we stressed on the importance of accumulating knowledge of many academic subject .
