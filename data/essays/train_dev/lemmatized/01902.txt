i agree with the statement because it is more important for student to understand idea and concept than it is to learn fact . first factor is the age at this age a student it is better to learn the concept and understand the idea because at this age we should learn about the concept which are first step for a student . at this age student can easily get the point of concept . for example take a student of 7th standared in that class teacher teach the basic of the subject so it is time for him learn the concept then fact . second is a the student grows older he can learn about the fact . any student how is getting older can learn from his past about the fact . for example consider 10 th standard student a he get older he realizes the fact in this world . so it is better for him concertrate on his study then knowing about the fact . third is it 's the time of student to improve his skill on the study because if he improves his skill in it then he is automitacially learns about the fact in it . for example consider a student how is studying 12th standard he learns from his past life the fact in it . a he growsup he know more about the fact so it is better for student to concentrate on understanding the idea and the concept . forth at the student age knowing about the fact can cause problem fro example it is not correct for primary student to know about sex in his childhood it tends to life of that student . finally i conclude that it is better for student to understand the idea and the concept then to learn fact at this age .
