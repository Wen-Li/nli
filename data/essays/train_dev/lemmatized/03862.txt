concerning the statement that successful people try new thing and take risk rather than only doing what they know how to do well , i agree to a cerain extend . while certain people can achieve a certain level of success by only drawing on old knowledge the majority of the people who have success , do so because of their willingness to break out try new strageties . the first part of my essay will give argument for this fact , while also providing example . the second part will draw the attention on the fact that experience and old strategy can still be usefull , while only partly . if one look back in time the most people that can retrospectively regarded a successfull have taken risk and tried now stregeties . the willingness to break out of fixed pattern of society and try new approach ha mostly resulted in success . this applies for various field , such a natural science , humanitarian scineces and especially the business world . to give an historical example , gutenberg invented printing a a mean to reproduce text in the 15th century . with this he risked the anger the clerus , who had a monopoly in this field . however , he wa successful and changed the way of publishing forever . also today we can find similar example , which can also be much simpler . for example the starbucks inventor had the simple idea to sell standadized coffee to go at various place with a brand name that stood for quality , a opposed to the classical behauvious of drinking a cup of coffee in a cafe . however trying out new thing is not sufficent to be successful . it is important to have draw on a certain knowledge and certain skill that exstist already . without those skill the development of a new idea can easily result in faluire . for example the building up of the starbucks empire , which wa founded on a new idea , would never have been possible without the knowledge of olod established economic principle and business knowledge . to conlude i want to draw aon the importance of the two element that are important when trying out new thing . it is important to use long established skill and knowledge in order to develop a new a idea and realize it a a porject . this approach is only logical because old knowledge and skill have once been new idea that people fought for . it therefore behoves u to use those old method to realize new and daring project .
