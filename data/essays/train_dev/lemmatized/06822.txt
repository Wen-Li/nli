i think in my opinion that successful people try thing and take risk rather than only doing what they know . i think that succesful people are the type of people who are not scared of anything and they are ready to take the risk without looking at the negative side of it . and if they look at it they try to solve or change these negative thing to positive thing . the succesful people are people who take the risk knowing that it might be wrong or it might also be right . they are people who study the risk they are taking from all side . they know what to do in the right time . these people try new thing and take the risk because they know what is correct and they know what to choose . the succesful people are ordinary people who were like u but the only difference between u and them , is that they have brave heart and are ready to take the risk without looking at the consequence . their are a ; ot of example in the world of people who took alot of risk and became famous and succesful . the most famous example of a succesful man in the world in my opinion is bill gates . i think so because when he and his friend invented the ` window program'they new that it wa a risk to invent it and sell it . but when he took the risk he wa on the right track , his money started increasing . he became the world richest man and the owner of one of the biggest company in the world . so i think that succesful people are ordinary people like u but the difference between u and them is that they are the first in taking the risk , without looking at what the resuly will be . i think that their a lot of people who can be like them . but the only problem is that they are not brave hearted like the succesful people .
