do i think that successful people try new thing and take risk rather than only doing what they already know how to do well ? as far a i am concerned , regarding my job ( i work a lawyer in a financial law firm in paris ) , i think that i have a pretty good understanding of that question . in my essay i am going to give you and to explain my opinion . in order to support this opinion , i will try to illustrate my point of view by personnal experience at work . the first point i would like to make is that , regarding my own experience , when you work in a law firm you can find the two opposite . some lawyer are the best in their speciality and do not want to practice in another department of law such a tax law , business law . .. and some others prefer to discover another type of law . though , they are strong advantage and disadvantage in both , i think that it is always more interesting to perform in different way . for this reason , regarding my personnality , i am rather in agreement with the subject statement . if you want to progress , in your work or in your life , you often have to test something new , even if it is more risky . moreover , when you make a mistake you have to draw conclusion , and therefore your experience can be use for positive thing . to conclude , if i step back , i realise that , in my job , i am always regarding the risk . on one hand i have to make sure that my client doe not run the slightest risk , but on the other hand i always have to test new thing in order to be more attractive . nonetheless , like i told you in my essay i have rather a personnality that conduct me to try new thing . i do really think that , if it is not toorisky and if we do not expose somebody else to a risk , to experience life is also taking many risk .
