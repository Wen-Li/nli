there are two different way for learning , one is understanding , and the other is learning fact . considering something in different aspect , learning to give own opinion , and thinking deeply for more realization are the reason for me to agree that it 's more important for student to realize idea than just learn the fact . considering something in different aspect is a very good advantage in understand idea because student can think the topic much broader . thus , they might try to see something in another way , and get some more reward by thinking in this way . as an example , when student face some question , they might discus it in many way . next , learning to give own opinion is another supporting point . because student understand the concept , they would give their view point to it , in stead of following the fact . for instance , after reading the text book , if teacher asked them to tell something behind the content , student would try to think the content again and give their own opinion . according to considering something in different aspect and learning to give own opinion , thinking deeply for more realization is the most important reason for supporting that understanding idea and concept is better than learning fact for student . when student think deeply , they might find out more interesting thing or discover something they do n't know before . for example , teacher would use this way to lead student to read literature , study science , and reaserch biology . considering in different way , learing to give personal point , and thinking deeply are three reason for me to argue that understanding is more important .
