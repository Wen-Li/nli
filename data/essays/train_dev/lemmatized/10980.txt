the student in the class room learn abaut idea and concept but is better for student learn fact , in my opinion is more important for student learn fact for many reason : first learn fact is important because the student learn doing the thing , because is more easy the student make and dont forget he or she did , for example do or paint a apple the student never forget the color and form the fruit . second the student need understand idea and concept but that is easy forget , for example the teacher prepare yor team and explain this , and the student if not study or review then he or she forget . in many case the student is lazy and arrive the home and forget your book in the room and begin to play them forgot the lesson . third is important learn fact because them learn of your own experience . for example if your theacher it 's theaching abaut the resource natural is better go out the camping and see tree , animal , river etc. theaching the importance them the student do n't forget that experience . the is necesary for student learn idea and concept but is better learn fact because is more easy remember that . she or he learn doing and do n't forget never that , also learn of your own experience .
