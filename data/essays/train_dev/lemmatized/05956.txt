i agree with the idea that it is essential for successful people to challenge new thing and difficulty rather than only doing what they repeat same thing which they know how to do . i have two reason for my idea : growth and gaining more knowledge . it might be quite difficult for people to succeed some challenge because all success is surrounded by dificulties . when we can deal with difficulty , we can succeed . for example , when i wa a high school student and i studied so hard every day beause i wanted to enter the famous university for my studying and for my future . at that time , it wa so hard for me to do both going to the high school and doing to the secondary school for more studying at night . i thought i might give up entering the high level of university many time . however , finally , i could pas the exam and entered the famous university which my parent and i also longed for . along side , i realized that there are always difficulty for the success . wnen we achieve the goal and challenge , we can grow ourselves a well a get the best result . moreover , there are many risk for challenge such a whether i can pas the exam or not . additinally , we need to gain more knowledge for the success . if the person want to be a doctor , he or she need to study harder than usual student which go to common university . to become a doctor , it is necesarry to study hard and gain the special knowledge beause they have a responsibility for all life of patient . therefore , they always face with taking risk a well a the success a a doctor . in conclusion , it is clear that successful people always try to challenge new thing , to grow themselves and seek for more difficulty . at the same time , they also take risk . it might seem to be hard , however , i think it is essential for people who want to succeed to challenge new thing and take risk .
