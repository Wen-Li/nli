as matter of fact , the issue whether the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide is a complex one . different person ha his own oppnions according to his background . as for me , i would like to agree that the best way to travel is travel alone , but not travel led by a tour guide . the following discussion will provide evidence to support my claim . first of all , traveler could have more flexible time to operate without a tour guide . because if travelor follow a tour guide , it mean he entered in a traveling plan made by a comany , it also mean that all the attraction , time , restaurent are scheduled and fixed . so , the traveler can not do anything just follow the schedule and lack a lot of fun . but if the travelor have a trip alone , it can easily change a plan . for example , if we find another attraction during a trip , we can easily stop to see it . if we like to chinese food , it is ok , we can enter a chinese restaurent instead of kfc , burger king and so on . do n't you think the example quoted above could reach the conclusion that travelors could more flexbily opperate time according to their likeness and dislikeness . secondly , traveler who take a trip by themself without a tour guid could exercise their ability in organizing , planning and preparation . if the traveler take the trip alone , it mean that he need book the hotel in advance , organize the route and so on . but if the traveler enter a group led by a tour guide , all he have to do is following to the guide . for example , i took a trip to washingtone dc this summer . at first , i have to book a hotel , and then prepare for the problem and plan for the travel . after all this done , i feel that my ability of planning is improving . that is great ! do n't you think ? thus , the example persuasively illustrate that travel alone help much in personal ability . admittedly , travel alone without a tour guid ha it 's own demerit . since traveler are usually familiar with the place that they are going to , it could cause a lot problem such a lost . however , the advantage of travel alone weight much than disvantages of that . so the it is more striking conclusion . to sum up , due to the discussion mentioned above , the reason which combined together could be more persuasive than any single one . it is more comfortable for u to claim that the best way to travel is travel alone .
