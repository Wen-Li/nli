it is often said that tour guide with many people is the best way to travel because it is cheap and safe . however i strongly disagree with this opinion . this is because that feeling satisfaction through the trip and spending time well . first of all , people have to be satisfied with their trip . people usaully want to see , hear , eat , and feel what they want and have wanted when they are travelling . however , in a group tour , people can not experience whatever they want because they have to follow their guide . for example , when i went to paris for trip alone i unwillingly took part in a guide tour one time to go to museam . because museam entrance fee is cheaper for group . unfortunately , i did not have satisfaction with the guide tour for museam , because there were so many people , so i could n't see all of them what i want to see and could n't get much information what i expected . in addition , traveling individaully is better at spending valuable time . time can not return or use again , so it is very important how to use time . however , in a group tour , it is easy to waste people 's valuable time . to demostrate , according to the research at harvard , individual trip spend time two time more effectively than grop tour . moreover according to this studying , people who travel individually is also more satisfied with their time consuming and whole traveling . in brief , the best way to travel is in a individaul , not in a group because making feel good during trip and well time consuming .
