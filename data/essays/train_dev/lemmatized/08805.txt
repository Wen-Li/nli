i disgree that successful peaple try new thing and take risk rather than only doing what they already know how to do . i think try new thing and take risk is so interesting . for instance , i usually speaking english . i want to study chinese and japanese . and i study other lauguage , i need the time . but time to past , try new thing is great . try new thing is creative . almost people is formal but successful peaple is creative and have a confidence . try new thing is somewhat dangerous but i do n't care . only doing what they already know how to is boring and life is not fun therefore my opinion is , to soccess our life have a confidence and new thing and take risk .
