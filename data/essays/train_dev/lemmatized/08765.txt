i agree that `` young people enjoy life more than older people do '' . i say this because of the following reason . 1. young one will be having a lot of time to have fun when compared to the older one . the older people will be busy in work and they will not be having that much free time which the young one get . even though it sound rude it is a fact . 2. the young one obviously will have le responsibility and work to do . but the older one will be having more responsibility and work to do . they have to maintain their house . do their work without rest inorder to survive with the family . here the young one dont feel this responsibility . they are free they can enjoy in their own way . it is obvious that a age increase responsibility increase and also the burden of work . 3. statistics say that young one are very energetic and enthusiastic and it obvious that there is adrenaline rush more when compared to the older one . but the older one are not that energetic and not that enthusiastic just to mention not in all case . there are also healthier old one who are enthuisiastiv and energetic but i mention on an average basis . 4. a older guy will be restricted mostly to office door , research lab , industry and other organisation 's . they spend a lot of time over there . but coming to the young one they enjoy leaning in school because the education is combined to entertainment to make edutainment . in college also the learning would be interesting make the student to say `` wow '' where a the older one say `` oh no '' with the burden of work . again i mention many of the old one enjoy their job and work they get involved . 5. kids enjoy their time in school they play , learn with nothing to feel responsible and they are the free bird they can do what they wish in proper sense . teens enjoy their time in college by learning , playing sport , having chat with friend , they make love with people around them . they have party , club activity and many more to enjoy . they have a lot of free time to develop their skill , involve in their subject of interest . they are free bird . in the case of older guy they can do this only on one condition `` if there is time '' . conclusion : ************** i do believe that anyone can enjoy their life at any age if and only if they have the heart to do so . i have written in favor of young one because i felt that it is happenning most in my society . one should have the heart to enjoy every moment . one should feel that life is beautiful . every moment is precious . life is precious gift .
