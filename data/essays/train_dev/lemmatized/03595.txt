to answer to this question , i think we have to begin explaining what we think about # many academic subject # and about # specific subject # . for example , doe # many academic subject # refers to science and econonic , or do we have to understand mathematic and physic , which are a part of science , or nuclear and light , which are a part of physic . the conclusion of this example is that there are different degree of specialization and that we must answer wich one is the best . if you have a passion in a specifict subject , you ought to specialize in it and to do only that . however , it is interresting to discover many different subject . besides , people dislike to do always the same thing . these thing depend of each person . but there is a thing we can not dennied . the more science knowledge increase in each subject , the more it is difficult to be good in a lot of these one , a the great scientist of the last century . today each job requires such a good qualification in a specific subject that it is impossible to be good enought in one another totaly different . in an other hand , in job like ingeeners , you often have to change the subject in which you work in , and this is i ; possible if you are to much specialized . anyway , in france you have to learn a lot of thing about different subject before being allowed to specialized . in france , the most specialized ingeeners work alone and the others together . because i want to work in a team , i will not be a specialed a them .
