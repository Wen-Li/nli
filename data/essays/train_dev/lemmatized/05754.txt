my point of view is , always oppose individuallity . cause been individual , is cosider to me a selfishness . by taking the statment a an example . the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide . from there , i learn two good point . firts , is been in a group everyone know each other and be there for each other , cause if you are in trouble while you with the group , it is more uneasy for that trouble to approach you . or if you are sick , it more safer to be aroud this group cause people know about your sickness or desease , and you feel more comfortable when you know someone . and the other part is , to led by a tour guide . this part explains to me , in group is a lot of individual whom think different way . for example a group of people 's going on a trip and part of them are adult and the other part young , you know that the young people will definetely not remain silence during the all trip . but the adult on their own if they stay quiet or having some serious conversation will be disturb by these young . so there will be no harmonie , so than it trouble . if there is not a tour guide , to put an agreement into this , to settle this cause we do not share the same idea , some people could think that is possible to talk a loud a they want , but other people do not . there suppose to be a leader who could settle thing down , someone who can discus thing in the right way . after all , this my point of view .
