i strongly disagree with the statement that there would be fewer car in use twenty year from now . `` necessity is the mother of invention '' , the necessity to travel faster , better ha lead to the invention of the motor car . ever since their invention car have been modified and upgraded gradually . what that wa considered a status symbol ha grown in to an essential requirement with time . cars have gradually revolutionised the mode of travel and thus lured people in to investing in buying car like never before . the number of car have increased dramatically due to the decrease in cost and the various offer that a company ha to offer to the buyer . the sense of competition among the many car manufacturer ha brought in a culture where people get to buy car at a very low rate or also buy in an instalment method thus increasing the number of customer . the incraese in population also lead to the increase in the number of customer buying car and also the industrial revolution and the increase in the per caput income coupled with the various offer given by the car company increase the number of car being brought by the common man . a sense of comfort and pride ha lead to the greater buying of car by the common man . initially , there were only a few company that manufactured car and the transport of the manufactured car also wa a tedious process and the whole thing wa a costly affair but with the advent of more and more car company and the easier mode of transport of manufactured car the number of car brought ha become higher and this number is increasing . at the initial stage there were only a few car to be seen but a time progressed there were many variety of car and the number of them alo increased tremendously . there is no reason why this number would decrease in the year to come a the population is always increasing so are the number of car being manufactured and sold .
