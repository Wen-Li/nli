i am completely agree with the idea that older people enjoy life le than the younger one do . actually i reached that idea a i grow up and a i thought about my early and middle childhood . because while considering my life most of the tome i notice that i wa enjoying life more than i do know because of several reason . to begin with , the younger you are the le responsibility you have , in my opinion that is the first reason behind the fact that a people get older they enjoy life le . for instance i am a collage student now and i have lot of task to be carried out . for instance , i have lot of exam to study , lot of homework to do , lost of money to earn for making my life and etc. however when i wa younger everything wa easier than the present . my parent were doing most of the tgings for me and lot of time i had to enjoy life . secondly , i think a people get older there is le thing that arouse excitement and enjoyment in people 's life . again when i have a look at my early year there wa much to discover , learn and evetually excite about . for instance ` which university i will be in the future ' wa one of the most important question that made my mind busy and kept me excited about the life . however a time passed i wa the at the university that i desired and worked hard for , however there wa nothing to be excited for anymore , everything wa so clear that i have n't thought about it again . i mean that a people discovered new thing very a few remain in the rest of the life and that cause people to enjoy life le . finally , i think a people get older their energy also decrease and that finally cause them to avoid some enjoyable activity . for instance the concert , the long trip and bunge jumping , beach party , rock climbing and so on , become some of the activity which the older people reluctatant to join because of their lack of energy .
