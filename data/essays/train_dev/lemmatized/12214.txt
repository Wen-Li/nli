i would definetly disagree with the statement . i would surely go for a specialize in specific subject because a the person who would be specialising in that subject , he would be probably gaining a lot of thing present deeper inside that subject , which will surely fill his zeal for the subject . a person should posse alot of interest for going in depth in subject knowledge . when ever he go deeper into a subject , first of all he will have a new experience , that is he will go into some other world , which he have n't even dreamt about it , that experience can only be felt and it is rather unexplainable , even if he try to explain about the experience that felt to the peoplearound him , they will never even try to understand him , which make him quite unique from others . secondly , the confidence level which will be present inside him towards the subject will definetly increse to a level which can be just imaginable , so he will definetly gain a confidence due to which he can listen to any kind of doubt which arrises between other people around him and he can even make a try to clear those doubt , by which he can handle almost any different situation given to him in his life . specializing in a subject denotes to the professional carrier due to which the employment oppurtunities may be high , he may just use the subject which he got by specialising , utilize it for the growth of the mankind . as the technology is being increased day by day , by utilising the latest technology a new form of property can be found out in any science oriented subject . even fame may also be added in the specialisation of the subject why because , by going deeper into the subject he will dicover the new thing , that have n't been thought of , so fame will surely make him to work more on the subject ( interest wise and financial wise ) . finally , a proverb is there which say that `` do n't sail in two boat '' , with this , i can say that when ever we specialize in a subject , it would definetly lead u to a prosperous carrier and total humanity will be surely gained by the knowledge which we acquired in a subject .
