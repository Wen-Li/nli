on yesterday newspaper i read about an article that talked about the knowledge in academic subject . that article contained an interview made to some people of my town ; lot of them believed that it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subject ; however some people thought that is better to specialize in a specific subject . the first one said that knowing thing from different field give you more chance to get a job . for example , in a company you would be able to cover various part and so you would become very important for your bos because he could use you for everything he need . in addition , in daily life you could be helpful to the others and sometimes you would n't need to call a specialized person to solve a matter because you are able to do it . the last thing , knowing a lot of different think make your brain use to work in different way . like i said before , a second group of people is not still convinced about this theory . at the interview time , they said that is better to specialize in a specific subject because this will bring you to know thing better than others . for example , you will be more competitive with your job , and you will be more sure to keep your work place because nobody will know the subject like you . moreover , we can say that some of very important job ( like the medical or the engineer ) require you to specialize just in that field to learn your job well , because that one are so difficult field . i 've read the article with interest but i have n't changed my idea about this topic . in my life i have always tried to go inside subject that belonged to different field ; however i know that somebody would n't be agree with me because think that i will never arrive anywhere with this mentality . i still think that it 's better to have knowledge of many academic topic because i believe that this street will bring me to be successful . behaving like this i 'm sure that i will not have regret in future .
