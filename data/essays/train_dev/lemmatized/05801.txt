my opinion is that , there will be le car in use than there are today , in twenty year later . i will explain these with three support reason . first of all , the new transport can be created . our life is rapidly improving by technology development . there will be a car which fly the sky , or immidiate moving vehicle from one place to another in one second . this new technology make people not to use a car because it will require le energy to operate and it will be convenient , and faster than today 's car . secondly , people use public transport rather than their own car . every year , people who are using public transport such a bus , train and subway is increasing . as the statistic , the reason why they take public vehicle are it take le money , le time and convenient . if they have own car , it cost much money to filling petrol , parking fee , tax , car insurance and fixing the car . as well a , the cost of petrol is rapidly increasing . also , there are terrible traffic jam every morning . this is a reason why people use public transport rather than own car . this will make le car than today in the futhure . lastly , people are thinking about environment . everybody know that car pollutes air . now a day , pollution is a big issue . this harm plant , animal and also human . so , people are trying to reduce the pollution . so , people try to use public transport . in conclusion , my opinion is that there will be fewer car in use than there are today because our technology make new vehicle , people prefer to use public transpopt and people are thinking about environment .
