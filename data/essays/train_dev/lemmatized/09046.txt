i really like to travel around the world . i can see a beautiful place taht i have ever seen and have a lot of valuable experience . there are many kind of style when we go traveling . i can not agree with the statement that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide for the following reason . to begin with , the way of traveling in a group led by a tour guide ha le time that we can spend free . most of these trip have very tight schedule . we have to see the famous place more quickly and we can not choose the gift for our friend or parent slowly . in my opinion , traveling should be more flexible and reluxing . in addition , the way of traveling in a group led by a tour guide ha little chance to happening . i think that happning is very important factor to enjoy trip . when i went to italy with my friend , i meet one italian chef in a bus by chance . we enjoyed talking and then we can eat italian food in his house . it wa very delicious . in conclusion , i disagree with the statement that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide .
