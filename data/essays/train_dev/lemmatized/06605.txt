recently , traveling is a good activity for each one 's vacation . each one want to have a great time traveling around the world to broaden his horizon . there are two choice of going traveling , in a group led by a tour guide or on your own way . if i were the one who have time to travel , i would choose the second one to enjoy my leisure time . there are a lot of reason that i choose to have a trip on my own way . although you do not agree with me , i would give you some explanation . first of all , it is a internet age that you can find any information on the web all around the world . everything is transparent that you can find out the price of hotel , plane , and so on . even the better suggestion you can ask for is easy to get on the internet . second , i would give you my bad experience of trip with a group led by a tour guide . the tour guide or the traveling agent make a look-liking beautiful plan for your vacation . that is just a crowd schedule that include almost every worthy traveling place to attract you . however , this is always a busy trip being unable to relax your good time if you join them . i can not question that the tour guide have plenty of knowledge about where you want to travel , but i can confirm that you never have a relaxing time following a big group of traveler . third and the last , it might take you some time to plan a journey rather than take a second to call the travel agent up . i will say it is worthy preparing your own journey . planning might be a hard thing but it is such an easy thing that you utilize the information on the internet well . after a hard-working plan , the real trip that you want will come true like a fairy tale . in addition , you will gain a lot of unforgetable memory and experience in the spontanous trip . the trip is easier than waht you thought before .
