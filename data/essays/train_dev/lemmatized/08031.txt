traveling in a group led by a tour guide is always my choice , if it 's possible . as i experenced both type , traveling with or without a tour guide . a tour guide ha it importance especially in new or dangerous place . much to said about the tour guide , simply he or she make many thing more easier and also responsible for manythings that may be time consuming or tiring . let 's begin from the first , when a traveler arrives there . many world place have no clear map or direction to get to the hotel . this make the traveler exposed to thief and fraud . if there is a tour guide , this problem doe n't exist . also arranging the ransportation to the place of interest with good price is always tiring and time consuming process . a tour guide ha the enough local experience to get the best for his or her group . the best time to visit a place or to see something unique always doe n't come by good luck but by good experience . local customes and tradition are usually hard to learn from book or magazine especially for people who come from totally different culture . a tour guide is very helpful in this point . some tourist found themselves involved in legal conflict or trouble with local resident because they simply do n't know the local habit or tradition . a tour guide will not expose his or her group to danger the stranger may not note easily . while stranger go around in popular market , they are a chance to some local seller to sell them false or unworthy article and this happens more frequentley . a tour guide can be the advisor about buying local good . there is also a human side for accompaning a local tour guide , he or she is a abridge for the two culture a he or she experience both from his or her natural living and job . a tour guide can explain manythings that seem unsual , strange , or hard to hard to expalin .
