i agree that successful people tend to have the attitude of trying new thing and taking on risk , because i believe this is essentially what defines successful people from ordinary people . more specifically , i agree because of the following reason : first , successful people take risk because they know that risk taking differentiates themselves from the rest of the herd . they realize that people are naturally risk-averse and tend to continue what they are doing . successful people take risk , not only because this very action differentiate themselves , but also because they know that there will be a learning experience offered through their risk taking . they know that even with failure , so long a they maintain the will and the energy to continue , they can come back stronger with the experience they will gain . second , successful people work on improving their weakness . whether it be a professional major league baseball player or a ceo of a mutli-billion company , successful people try new thing to improve their performance . they break their status quo and leap to the next level , because they can identify what they are good at and what they are not , and thereby work on the weak area with a new approach . third , successful people try new thing because they are curious and eager to learn . they also know that there are a ton of thing they do n't know out there in the world . further , their curiosity lead to the synergy of their knowledge base . for example , an engieer may better address his current issue in the long-term , if he gained more knowledge about business and other driver that may be causing his problem . in summary , i believe that successful people are willing to take risk and are eager to try new thing because of their natural characterstics of self-improvement and from the knowledge of the benefit of such action .
