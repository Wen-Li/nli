i believe that the is no easy answer to this question . one must consider positive and negative aspect of both form of learning . one the one hand , it is very important to learn and to know fact , espescially while dealing with complex problem . a lack of factual knowledge on a certain subject will render any student unable to properly discus it with others . when being faced with different fact within a conversation , one can not differentiate whether the information used by one 's counterpart is accurate or false . one could be overwhelmed with false information and tricked into believing the counterpart 's position , even if it doe not give an accurate picture of the topic . a student that ha no idea when abraham lincoln lived or served his presidency might be convinced by others that he fought for the right of african americans in the 1960 's instead of during the civil war . on the other hand , a mere learning of fact doe not reveal to a student the interconnection between them and how one fact might lead to another . a student that ha learned the name an inauguration date of all us president doe not necessarily know anything about their achievement and could therefore never enter an argument on which president best represented the middle class or fought for equal right . this is where the understanding of idea and concept becomes important . in conclusion , i would say that in order to fully grasp any subject and to be able to discus it with others one ha to find a balance between the learning of fact and the understanting of idea and concept . while some student may find it harder to learn fact they might compensate this with a great understanding of the underlying concept and vice versa . however , no student should ever completely neglect any of these two form of learning .
