i think there is not a moment in your life more pleasant than other , the whole life is a cicles of growing personally and intelectually , and one should enjoy every step in this cicle , so i disagree with the statement . people should enjoy every moment in their life , because every moment brings you different satisfaction and all of them are equally pleasant . as a child one enjoy a lot being in the kindergarden , and playing with the other child there isnt anything else more exiting than that . the same occurs a a student in highschool or at the university , meeting new people , sharing with them and all the thing around it are very exiting . by this point there arent a lot of responsabilities , and that is what make people think that being younger you enjoy life more . but responsabilities do n't take away the exitement in life . after the university you star working , most people get married , have child and with this come the responsabilites , but who said this wa n't pleasant . i still have no kid to take care of , but i really want to get married and have a lot of child , and i think i would continue enjoying life a i am right now a a young person . even work give great satisfaction , and i really enjoy working in thing i like . it is all just moment in your life , and each moment give a diferent kind of satisfaction . in an older age , satisfaction must come from people around you , and the achivements you have done in your life . i think it must be very pleasant to see what you have done in your life and share it with the people you love . in conclusion one must enjoy every moment of life , because every moment come with great satisfactionds
