i disagree with the statement . because i think that , do something we are known is more easlier to handle . successful people have done something that he good at , and this thing make him successful . use disney for example . every year , they will have new cartoon to show u . many people all over the world must watch them . becaus disney is good at creative cartoon . these cartoon make disney famous , successful and wonderful . disney also ha their own disneyland . it is a famous story that everyone know . however , if disney try to do something they have n't done before , such a they going to have a fashion store to selling some high fashion clothes . i think it may be not working . becaus they are not good at creative fashion thing , they ca n't use the same way to creative fashion from creative cartoon . may be they can success at the end . but i have no idea about the date they can do it . before they are success in the fashion are , they must lose many time and money . people can not know about why disney want to creative fashion . because all people just know their cartoon is fantastic . no one will belive that they can do it at the beganning . people will have some brand of fashion to buy clothes . becaus these brand are good at fashion . they will not try to creative cartoon . so , i think wherever sucessful people or noraml people . they just want to do their best thing of what they good at .
