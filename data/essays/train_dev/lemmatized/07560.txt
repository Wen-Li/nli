somebody who begin to study ha two possibility : he can on one hand choose to learn thing on different topic , and he can on the other hand choose to specialize directly on one subject . but what is the best choice ? the first possibility - learning a lot of detail on many subject - is quite interesting because it give people good general knowledge so that they can speak on many subject and discus with different people . in france , we can choose this way by entering `` science politique '' . this school permit people to be particularly well informed and to give their opinion on every subject . the second possibility - specializing on one specific subject - is also interesting because it give people the possibility to be very competent on their subject . if somebody told you his or her opinion on it , you can response with a lot of precision and impose , if you are right , your point of view . this possibility is provided by very specialized and professionnals school which give young student those precise knowledge . in fact , if you choose the first solution , you are not going to be able to speak seriously on one particular subject . you can just say different thing on it but not very precisely . at the opposite , if you choose the second solution , you would be competent only on one subject and quite ignorant on the others . the solution is to begin with studying different topic on litterature , science , technology , and language . this first period give the student the time to discover those different subject , to construct his own culture . it give also him or her the possibility to choice what he or she prefers . indeed , if you choose too soon , you can make more easily a mistake . when you have choosen , begin the second period during when you will work on the subject you choose so a to be competent on that one , but not without other knowledge on other subject . this is a balanced solution who permit u to work on a topic and , at the same time , not to be isolated in you knowledge .
