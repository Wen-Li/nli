nowadays there are so many car throughout the world . and people can see so many car when they walk on the street and it may find limited place for car park . in my opinion , i agree with that in twenty year it will be fewer car is use than today . first of all , generally speaking , people who drive car are make many pollution such a air pollution , soulnd pollution and so on . these pollution may affect people 's health and even get some serious disease . in additional , everyday on the highway there are so many car in the morning and those driver who are rush and want to keep time so they always overspeed and then may make accident . if there can make le car thus it is not only prvent the traffic jam , but also few accident in a day . however , sometimes it 's much easier than we act . if people want to make le car-user and make sure it really work ; here i provide some recommendation that may handle these problem . one of the solution is that people can people should use le by driving car and they can use some other public vehicle to replace to drive car . for example , mrt , bus etc . this will reduce lot of air pollution and it can be provide more car-park space for other driver and it can prevent people are polluted by the car . another solution is that the governemnt can also help people to perform this activity use different way such a make a new policy that limite people only can buy one car for every household and increase the tax of the care and licience per year . therefore , it will make le number of car and people and people who do not purchase too much car to spend the extra land for car-park . overall , there is lot of car around the world and people should make use le of car . therefore over twenty year it can prvent air and sound pollution , traffic jam and even accident .
