considering the academic period of the education there can be say alot of plot , idea and many other impression on specialize in one specific subject or is it better to have a variety of many academic subject . on answering that question , primarilly we have to deal with two major point in education which indicates u the position of our life and future outcomings . the first is our life condition . the latter one is about to the plan and feed back . if a person in academic wondered to make an extend to vary his knowledge , mostly he or she would have no any economical problem or any anxiety on his working condition . to explain that , they have already satisfied with their life style and they wonder to know much more knowledge . besides their motivation on learning varities have almost act them to doing that relentlessly . for me to become one pointed or one focused trainning programe make person much aware of life and in worklife . in work a life for instance , person must be well qualified on his or her matter . while dealing with the trouble in work sector , person must be elite on his or her section for being a qualified one . thats why , focusuing on one section would be more essential and vital for the person in a specific range . it is also crucial for me that a person must aware of his life standarts . chosing one section field may not help utterly to person . being aware of field and determined what to do are also other necessity . a great deal of time have to be spended on one section field . you have to ass your knowledge oftenly or you may fail in advancing information . holding both advantage and disadvantage focusing on one field is my indespensable selection .
