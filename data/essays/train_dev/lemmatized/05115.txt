i agree with the statement . i would rather say the advancement of civilization is the result of people who took risk . when i say taking risk it would mean not only doing thing or act personaly which could be dangerous , example going to the deep sea in search of new land but that would also mean going against established idea , which were wrong . had galileo and the earlier astronomer not challenged the idea of earth being flat we would never have known the fact . for going against the established beleifs , galileo and others had to face anger and punishment . had it not been the effort of clombus we would have never seen america . he failed more than one time , wa even improsined for failing to prove his theory , but in the end we owe him a lot . how is techonolgy advancing at such a great pace , we talk of nano technology today . it is because there are scientist who always challenge the established frontier . this requires taking lot of risk . failure would mean wasting resource that are so costly . and also involve persona stigma , but than they dare it and succeed . the story of scientist such a thomas alva edision , voltaaire are known to all . they were the people who tried out new thing , even at the cost of people doubting them . wright brother tried something new and brought a huge change in the world of transport , stevenson thought on a small issue and invented the steam engine . so the degree of risk might vary , but risk do result in some positive result . one thing i will like to add , the risk should not be blind , they should be calculated to some extent . this is applicable mostly for the purpose of trying out new business . infact all the people i have mentioned above had done some or the other study to be sure that they were not doing something that wa completely not required . bill gate the richest man today , ventured into an unkown area and we see the result today . but it is not always that successful people have tried new thing and they have succeeded . many example are there which tell that if you leave something which is your `` core compitency '' you may fail . so the idea of `` core competency '' is very relevent . so try new thing but keep in mind your core competency also .
