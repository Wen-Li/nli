one of the most important technological discovery in our day is car . when it wa developed and produced by henry ford in the early of twenteeth century , nobody considered this mean of transport essentially for his life like it is considered today and i think that it will be the same for a long time . cars are at the basis of modern human life and i think that nothing can substitute it because it is the best way of transport . each family ha got about two car and they are much used than the others way of transport because it is not only useful , but it also allow to go everywhere you like , nearer or faster . thus , each adult use his car to go to work or to go to a trip or someting similar . unfortunately , one of the worst consequenses of a massive car use is the great amount of pollution that each car give in environment . i 'll hope that , in twenty year , it will be possible to project car that permit to save the beauty of our planet . maybe , the autovehicles fume will be natural because of their natural source of power instead of oil . furthermore , car will have a lot of optionals that will make easier to drive for example computer car navigator or a lot of characteristic that will make car not only a simple mean of transport but also a thechnology that improve human life . in concluson , i think that it is impossible nowadays live without car and it will be the same in the future .
