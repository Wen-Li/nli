i agree that advertisement today really try to drag you in their product with fake picture . advertisements today have been a big influence to many people including teen adult and also child . the way advertisement work are simple . advertisements can be looked at like lie just that people do n't know it . most of advertisement today have been to promote a certain product or company . this type of business ha helped many people be succesful in their particular goal of reaching what they wanted through advertisement . advertisements have been used over many year to pull the audience into the product . this is the key to all advertisement . for example if it 's a advertisement on food the picture they show on the food is made just to attract the audience not to really show how the food is but to attract them . the certain plate could be just a banana but the picture could be edited so it look very good for the customer to buy it . many company have a section in their company focusing in advertising . they have these section so that they know what the audience weakness can be and how they can attract that audience into buying their product . another example of an advertisement can be some deoderant advertisement . axe ha a comercial where the man who us this product spray this product on his body . after he used this product the woman would be very attracted to him . this comercial promoted that it could either smell good or attract many woman . in conclusion i agree that advertisement make the product seem much better than they really are . all this is done just to make money . so next time watch out to what product are being advertised and know that it can be a lie .
