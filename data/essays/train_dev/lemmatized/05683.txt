some people say that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their community . i disagree with them and think that the community are the one who do not helping young people because thier are no job and thier is lotes of stress and persure on them . if you dont offer me a job who can i help you . ther are lotes of young people who could not find a job and they try so hard to find one but they could not . if they had the oppertonty they would be great worker and help thier community . the community are making lotes of stress on the young people . from the school and the exames to the colleg and more exames and after that hard work he can not find a job and ther is tax and the belle and the food and the loundry and lotes of stressful thing and they expect him to do more and more . in a conclusion i want to say that community say that young people do not help them . i say that community should help people and create more job .
