in the past in each scholl or university there wa not specific subject , but the student had a knowledge of many subject . today the number of course at university are increase because they would people specialized in one specific subject . in my opinion is better to have , in the first year of study , broad knowledge of generic material , than specialized in one specific subject . in this method student are increasing their culture in their material very rapidly with very strenght idea . another point of this system , are that could incresing new post of work and new type of work . to complete my opinion , i agree to spend part of study for stage , it is more important because it is between study and work . in summary today student can specialised in one specific subject , but the world of work remain too far , during this specialisation .
