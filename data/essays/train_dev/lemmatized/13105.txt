i would agree with this statement . i feel that young people nowadays are negligent towards their own community a a whole , a community that ha helped them become what they are . there are many place where we see this happening . young people are more career oriented now and tend to leave their home and community in pursuit of higher edcation and better job opportunity in foreign land . although they may get what they seek but their community are getting neglected . young people are adverse to becoming a part of the social community gathering and therefore are not exposed to the problem being faced by them . in my native city in north india i have seen that my community ha gone from bad to worse in term of their social standing and the economic condition . the community school that i studied in is now in a state of utter disarray . the older people are trying to do what they can but the onus is on the younger one to take on the responsibilty . local community welfare society for redressing the problem of people have increasingly seen decline in youth participation . the young people fail to identify with the problem of people they once lived with . these socities are for most of the time non-government affiliated organisation and are usually not profitable . this is why people shy away from them . they are against spending time on thing which are not a source of income . young people also feel that whatever time they get at home from the fast paced life they lead should be utilized in spending time with the family rather than worrying about their community . lucrative job in multinational company where there are tough working hour a opposed to just a 9 yo 5 job have only worsened this problem . attending party at night and being seen in high place have become more important because of peer pressure and forming profitable social circle . another reason for this to happen is that in many place there isnt a common forn for poeple to raise issue concerning them . even if they are talked about in very localised area they are mostly kept away from the reach of younger people based on the notion that their young and immature mind will not understand the problem or be able to provide solution . in most gathering in my native city young poeple are not allowed to express their opinion freely . this is more so because the old people running the system are against novel idea . this also give the young people a reason to stay away . until the people identify with the problem or face them first hand it is highly unlikely that they will ever start worrying about the betterment of their community . steps will need to be taken by both young and the old in developing more practical idea based on changing society and living standard .
