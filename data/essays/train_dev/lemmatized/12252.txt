most advertisement make product seem much better than they really are . most people will not doubt about it , while others think quite differently on the issuse of the advertisement do n't make product seem much better . personally , i stand on the side of the advertisement make product seem much better . there are three conspicuous concept a follows . firstly , this is because of the simple fact that the example you will meet in your life . many many time , when we see the advertisement in the tv or any where , the product in the advertisement are very perfect , excellent , so after receiving them , you are very disappointed . the real product are not like the pattern in the advertisement . secondly , we could cite another ordinary example of that the advertisement are also the business , they also want to get the money from the customer . so sometime , when they do the advertisement , they do n't worry about the quality of the product , and maybe they do n't understand the detail information about the product , they just focus on how do the advertisement , how to make the customer to trust what they said . thirdly , i may say that the advertiser are not the expert about the different area . so they just need to make the advertisement look better , and let the customer believe the product , let the producer get the maximum profit , this is the rule of the market . certainly , some advertisement also do the good job . they just tell the truth about the product to customer . and try not to give the wrong information to public . so some people believe that most advertisement do n't make product seem much better than they really are . of course , argument will be against my standpoint , many people might argue that my opinion also have some drawback , such a there are still some good advertisement . i might reply that most important thing are multifaceted , there are many alternative to choose from , each with uniqe advantanges and disadvantanges . i advocated my viewpoint because i think most advertisement make product seem much better than they really are . above all this point , i support to statement because it is better to know that the advertisement are also business , their main goal is also the profit , the money . so we should n't give the advertisement more belives .
