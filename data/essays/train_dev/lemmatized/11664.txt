people should help community because human being are the part of society . today , it is hard to find young people who help their community because they are busy doing their own thing . therefore , i agree young people do not give a lot of time to helping other community because they are busy for preparing the furture life and not be educated by adult about helping others . first , today 's life is hard to live doing work and studying hard . young people usually concern about their future for going to good school , doing well in school , having a part time job and getting a good job . our society focused on doing well in school and work rather than educating them to have to help others . for instance , when i wa in college , i wa asked to study english a a second language in order to have a good job . all day long , i stayed in the library and studied to get a good job . i even did n't have time to hang out with friend . i could not have time to think about others because life is tough in my side . secondly , adult like parent and teacher ask young people to work hard and study hard . they always pointed that life is hard and people should prepare in advance before they regret . when young people are attending class , they do not have enough time to think about others and teacher do not mention the point that people should help first rather than doing own thing . for example , i never met teacher who said about helping community are important of our life or showing voluneer work by themselves . my parent only worked and my teacher taught their class . in short , i strongly agree with the idea that young generation nowadays do not give time to helping their community because they only focus on preparing their future life and are not educated by adult about helping community .
