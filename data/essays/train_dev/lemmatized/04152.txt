in these day a lot of people especially old people claim young people do not heve enough time to helping their communuties . the old people around me are complaining the same problem . however , i do not share their idea . in my opinion young people try to give time to help the charity but they have n't got enough time because of the rush oh the twentieth century , young people heve a lot of work to do but not enough time to spent in this century . however they spent a lot of time to their community , for instance they are visiting their familiy in every celebration . if they have they gave it to the poof people . for example last night in a television show a lot of people gave money to a charity to plant tree and most of people who gave money to charity were young people . actually there wa n't any old people there , this an remarkable point , a lot of people say young people are guilty about this topic but may be old people are guilty there is an adage which come from hitits , in a hitit paper an old people wa complaining about young people . it show that complaining from young people ha never changed , the people living in twenty second century may be complain from ypung people too , however it doe n't mean young people are not gining enough time , in conclusion , the young people living in twentieth century give enough time to their comunity , even they have got a lot of job to do , we can see the from the television show or if we look at histoery we will see the same complainings , this is typicall thing so the old people ha to get r 'd of the'r complainings ,
