we live in an era where money is the most important thing for many people . the seller of the product and the industry do n't care about the quality of the product , they only want to make a lot of money fast . a good way to make a lot of money fast are good advertisement . they show pic of product or say thing about the product that are not real . but often this advertisement make seem product much better than they really are . a lot of food industry show pic of product that are complitely different from the real product . mcdonalds for example show on their advertisement not the product how they really are . you can see on their advertisement very big hamburger with fresh bread and lot of ketchup . but in real they are different , they are not so big and the bread is not so fresh . on the picture they are showing other hamburger that you become in the fast food . it 's only a fake . an other example are the cigarette advertisement . for example the marlboro advertisement . you can see a sane , handsome cowboy on a horse . it seems that marlboro cigarette are a good thing , but in reality they are leading to a lot of diseas . if think it should be a regolamentation about the advertisement . that you can not say thing about your product that do n't correspond to the reality , and that you can not show picture that make appear the product better than it is . if somebody show fake picture of the product they should pay a fee . i think the industry should better concentrate on the quality of the product . they should better use the money for increase the quality of the food and to make food that is better for our health .
