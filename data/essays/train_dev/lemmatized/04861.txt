i agree with young peole enjoy more than older people do . there are two reason why i agree with that statement . firstly , young people are healthier and younger than older people . for example , my grandmother love to travle around the world . however , she can not do right now because of her health . she used to tell me that she travel a lot . she found the joyness and purpose of bieng alive from meeting new people and learning otherthings that she could not experience before . i think if she wa healthier and younger like me . it would be better to enjoy her life . in my age , i can go anywhere i want to because i am heathy and young . i can actually enjoy my life doing whatever i want to . i think that health is big part of one of reason . secondly , there are many entertainment for younger people but not for adult i guess . in korea , where is my home country , there are many fun thing to do for young age such a clubbing , playing game , singing song in karayoke , taking sticker picture with friend , and dating with boyfriend or girlfriend . i am not saying that older people can not date each other . however , there are not that many thing for adult like old people . they might go to drink or watch movie very sometimes but that is not always fun and joyable . i think that there are more entertainment for younger age than older age . in conclusion , i agree with young people enjoy more than older people do . there are two reason that i mentioned before . for enjoing life , portion of health requires a lot and i think that is the most important opinion for this statement . another reason is that there are many entertaints for younger people rather than older people .
