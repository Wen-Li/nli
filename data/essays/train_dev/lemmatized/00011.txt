the statement `` in twenty year there will be fewer car in use than there are today '' ha been often said . most people say that they need a car to be flexible and have the controlle over their personal timetabel where they can decide where they want to be at any time . people need their car a their status symbole , to show how rich they are because their earn enough money to pay tax and these high gas prize . on the other hand you see how nature show the powerful human beeing that mother nature 's source are nearly empty and that there is no chance of producing gas in such a short time , like people like to have it . another reason , to have fewer driving car on the planet in twenty year , will be the , already excisting , high polution . when we get these high degree like we had it this summer , the people will start dying much earlier because of the unhealthy air they inhale . in my opinion , i hope that these leading people out their will open their eye to the importance , to support nature . i sometimes have the feeling that they do n't see the nature catastrophies out there , which are our fault , too . we throw our gas into the air with our car . and nature show u the revenche with heavy rain or other extrem weather condition . nevertheless i think , we need car . but , maybe , we will develope a source which everyone can use without loosing their power of the car . or find another way of traffic , which we do n't know yet .
