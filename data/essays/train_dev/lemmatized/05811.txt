there are several reason why i think that young people nowadays give enough time to help their community , most of them based in my own personal experience , that make me completely disagree with the statement setted . in first place , we have to distinguish between periodic help to the community and flunctuant help to the community . the first one is help of young people almost in a weekly basis and with a very high grade of compromise . the second one is help given when certain natural disaster such a tsunami or flooding arise . looking back throughout what i have been witnessing in this particular topic during the last 10 year , it is pretty clear for me that young people are involved in their community in a periodic basis . just a small example of this may be a program hold in my university which consists on young people living with old people who live alone and need help . of course there is an advantage for the young people from the program such a not having to pay a rent , but the really important thing of this program is that they are helping the community , helping the old people , helping their family and in general , helping society to become much more involucrated in the need of the community . there are also many example of non periodic help such a those of natural disaster . when that happens you always see plenty of young people moving to get food or clothes but not only in their own country , but also moving themselves to wherever the disaster ha occurred . an example of this is the tsunami held in asia a couple of year ago , again in my university , you could see every single student organization moving in order to get money , food , clothes or medicine . so , to sum up and a i have argued before , young people make lot of effort to help their community and they really give many of their free time to help others .
