it 's all about the way of learning , every teacher can learn his student but not everyone can put get understandable student could imagine what did he speak about . learning using fact are so important cause they are easier to be understood than idea & concept , because it 's more realistic for any human to understand fact that happened or seen , in chemistry lecture , student take some information about cheimcal reaction , it 's effect , color obtained , vapor & so on .. but they will never understand what the professor mean until they went to the laboratory , & do the experiment so they can see the idea & concept of their professor , then it 'll be easier to understand what did they took it is a fact for them , on the other hand , idea & concept took le time from the teacher to learn but maybe take more time from the student to memorize , it 's away from his thinking , it 'll be a kind of what called `` brain filling '' which make the student tired & easily forget it . but not all the study could be related with fact or we have fact with it , so idea & concept will be the major for those study , in astronomy it 's hard to see everything about those away planet or star from the earth but the idea & concept could work to explain thing it 's maybe impossible to have fact about but it 'll not be a clear a fact but it 'll do the work . as a chemist i think than study related to fact could be easier to understood & harder to be forgitten in contrast with the study depend on the idea & concept
