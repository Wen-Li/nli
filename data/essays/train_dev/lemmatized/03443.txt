students should rely in facts and not concepts after i graduated from high school , my physic teacher taught me all kind of concept for algorythms and formula . later , at the university , when i wa doing my internship , i look back and asked myself . why i did not learned more didactic and practical thing ? facts are the best teacher that a person could have in his life . concepts are good for the basic teaching but it is not useful in the real life . actions demostrate ten time more than a single concept . a good idea is the one that it is made a reality . for example , let 's imagine that i am an engineer and i only know the concept to operate a machine . can you imagine ? what am i going to do when i will be in front of my bos and tell him , `` i only know the concept . '' it is ridiculous , to learn something without a logical meaning . facts are the physical prove of a hypothesis or a project. a student can not learn just an idea , they need to know how to develop the concept . in particular when i wa working in a manufacturing industry , we had to give our client his product . we could not just tell him that we had the idea of what to do but not how to do it . thus , it is important to be awarness of what a student is learning becuase if he doe not , it is only an a waste of time . a student ha to consider the fact instead of the idea becuase it is the only way for the student to understand the purpose of a lesson . in particular , i enjoy taking class at secap because they give a few theorical class and the rest is useful practice which will help me in my career . it is clear , then that the idea are just a vague imaginary action that should be put into action . hence , student and myself have to rely on the fact of every lesson , for those are the one that really matter in our life and society . between an idea and action , there is a process to work on .
