i do n't know if be agree with this idea or not . i would like it . i hope is the result of a scienific research so to be suppored by statistic , sociology , psicology and university professor . the only idea i can use to approach this thing in a scientific way is to think abouth the force around this topic . there are 2 thing who confirme my hope : the traffic and the cost of petrol . from the other side ther are other 2 thing that destroy my hope , they are : the number of people how live in good economic condition , the economic car business thet in more than one country is supported by the central governament . starting from the traffic , in the biggest city in the world , from milano and roma to tokyo , london or new york the traffic problem is very very big . a possible solution is the growt of public transport . for example the underground ( or tube like in london is colled ) is prefered by a great number of people respect the car to move in the city . for the petrol cost , i think that is to long and to complicate for me to approach a solution . from the other side lukely ( with economic growt ) today more people can buy a car then 30 year ago , so is possible that more people buy the car . more than this , the car in some place ( in rapid growt in the last year ) are considered like a status simbol , a way to confirm the economic power of the family note : our focus abouth the use of the car and not abouth how many car will be buy .
