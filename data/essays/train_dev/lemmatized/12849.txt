we are living in an age of information , where the human knowledge of it surroundings ha boosted and continues to accelerate even more rapidly . one can tell that today an average high school student , with an average level of education , know better physic than newton . with so much information accumulated , the urge for the scientist to specialize in one area to contribute to that area get more and more significant . there are two major point related with this isue . first of all , a mentioned above , the accumulation of knowledge in a single area ha increased so much that it is impossible to have some discovery on top of it without having the grasp of all prior information . for instance , while most people still have difficulty understanding einstein and his relativity theory , scientist are introducing theory that even extend it , having given a lifetime of study in that subject only . specialization in a specific topic seems to be the only way of studying science professionally . secondly , one can say that it is required to have a broad knowledge of many field to be able to work on specific topic since scientific field are highly interconnected and interdependent . this is of course true to some extent . there are many general topic to cover until one ha the capacity of advancing to a specialized topic but that doe not stand against the fact that academic subject are now so complex that one can not afford distributing his effort among various subject . in fact , the current education system in most of the country in the world is so : an introductory undergraduate program covering all the required subject a a baseline , and then graduate study specializing in a specific subject with the purpose of academic research . in conclusion , whether to have broad knowledge of many academic subject or to specialize in one specific subject is an important question . while each one ha advantage over the other , it seems that specialization is nearly an obligation of modern science regarding it depth and complexity . specialization is inevitable and must be pursued by every academician , but also not ignoring the background knowledge of the prerequisite subject .
