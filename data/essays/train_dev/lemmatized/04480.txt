advertisements are really needed for product , but extravagant publicity is to be militated . i agree with the following statement that most advertisement make product seem much better than they are . firstly , advertiments should provide infomation that a product ha . i mean the quality of the product ( whether it ha reliability and garuntee ) . the advertisors using some showy label , packing etc. , should stop . because they charge even for the packing which are expensive , ordinary people cant buy those thing even they are daily house hold product which are necessary . secondly they use some celebrites for canvassing the product , they offer even some royalty from commodity sale percentage . thirdly , the advertisor attract the consumer , using graphic design and animation by showing them more fascinating than they really are . these kind of thing really going to work on child for and make there parent to buy for them . and dazziling sticker also make them more attracting . all these will definetly increase the cost of commodity so i finally conclude these kind of avertisements , imean , iagree with the quote that `` most adertisments make product seem much better than they really are .
