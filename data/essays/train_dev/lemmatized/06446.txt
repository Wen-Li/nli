i would like to begin my essay with prof. abert einstein ' s telling . he had said that understanding of a problem is the half of the solving . we can not analyze concept and idea without not knowing what we have on our hand . therefore , i think to understand idea and concept is more important than to learn fact . a greater number of people , on the world , are now judging each other without understanding each other 's idea and ideology . and they learn fact without an infrastructural information . this rival make them merciless . because they do n't know how they should react . for instance , we assume a man who help poor people without judging them getting them dressed , clear and satiated and assume his neighbour ha n't any idea what the man make . our man accept his home all kind of people olders , kid , woman and men . if firstly , his neighbour doesn ' t understand his idea and then call police to learn the fact , an inappropriate event occurs . but firstly , if he understands his idea . no problem occur . as our knowledge grows regarding various disease , we become better equipped with sense .
