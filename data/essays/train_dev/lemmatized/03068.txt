the issue at hand , is who doe enjoys life , young people or old people ?? this subject is an interesing one , because it challanges all age to enjoy life regardeless of their age . from my point of view , i believe that younger people enjoy life more than older one because they have all the capabiliities , health , and energy to enjoy life . the first reason i believe that younger people enjoy life more than older one is because they have the motivation towards life , and life without motivation is like a car without oil . for example a young person will work hard towards improving his job description , or his capability , and from my point of view this is an ejoying experience . wheras , an older age person doe not have the motivtion nor energy towards achieving any of his remaining goal . another reason i believe that young people enjoy life more is that they have the facility to face all srrounding problem and obstacle . obstacles that affect in daily life , obstacle challanges the younger peolple , and thus make life more enjoyable rather than depressing them . however , older people will be depressed while facing problem , and they might not be able to face such encouuntering problem . furthermore , young people are healthier than older one , so they can move easily , and enjoy all the entertainment in life , such a travelling , swimming , practice sport , ... ect . wheras older peope do not have the capability to enjoy entertainment in life . finally , for the mentioned point , i believe that younger people enjoy life more that older one , because they are the one who accelarates the life process , and they are the one who enjoy this .
