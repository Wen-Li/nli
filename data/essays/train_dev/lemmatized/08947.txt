some people think that we need to get new experience and even to take risk to be successful while others support that we should only do our best at our expertation without new experiencesand without risk . in my opinion , we have to obtain new experience and take risk via contributing to technological development by obtaining new perspective and through increasing our performance by improving our cognitive ability or thinking . firstly , to endeavor new thing can lead to new perspective . these perspective can contribute to new innovation by providing improvement in the previous innovation . for example , if an engineer try a new machine when doing his habitual job , he can contribute to the technological development and so to the humanbeing . it is inevitable to escape from taking risk to achieve such an aim . in other word , the engineer ha to work under the stress such a the lost of time and money . however , the possibility of the achievement or the possibility of the benefit of this new experince is worthful taking these risk . secondly , the performance of people can be higher and higher in time contributing cognitive capacity by unusual taks and under stress . thinking is an inevitable process for humanbeing and it can work better under new circumstance and especially under stress . coping with the difficulty created by new experinces can cause even higher stress and this stress can be resulted in even higher performence . otherwise , someone can think that there is no need for higher performance to complete his responsinilities/job . under the perspective mentioned above , i think we have to try the thing which we have never tried before and take risk continuously to be more anad more successful .
