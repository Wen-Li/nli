young and old people both enjoys life with their best they can do . young people have some problem too same a to for the older one . but here i think that the young one generally enjoy more that that of the old people . in my opinion , young think le about their future and the outcome of their deed . while in case of older people they generaly think about the outcome of their misdeed so what they do is carefully a compared to young people . most of the old people generally lost their purpose of living and wait for the death , indeed , some enjoys their life , regardless of the worry at home . in joint family generally old people get the respect but when thing come to the nuclear family , old one are neglected . but it is not in the case of the young one they are loved by the whole family member and most of their mistake are neglected . this carry them to go on enjoying more . appearence the the next thing in the context . obviously , the old people have lost their charming face , their well toned body and now they have lose skin with lot of raches and water is comong out of their mouth . they seems little ugly but young-ones are cute and lovable . this make them to be loved by most of the people and get support to do thing more and enjoy them . one of the most important thing old people generally sleep late night and wakeup early in the this distracts most of the people and me too . they wakeup and will do something , which generally disturbs others sleep and i love mornig sleep . and young people also enjoys it a lot . in this way i think that according to above based example young people enjoys more than old people .
