i agree with the statement for several reason and i will try to explain them through my personal experience . i 'm really convinced that it is more important for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact . while attending my university i had the chance to study many different matter and all of them equipped me with a multitudo of skill . most of the research i carried out for my university study were related to the international law which i am very passionate about . i took every single exam that could give me the chance to deepen my knowledge about international topic . thus , my study included element of international law , comparative law , european law . .. upon obtaining my degree in law , it ha been my goal to work in an internationa organisation and today i believe that those skill i learned at university will play sooner or later an important role in my working future . to tell the truth , my hard study from university ha already played an important role and this is the reason why i am positive that acquiring and understanding ides and concept before learning fact is important for student . if i had not studied the basic of international law at university , i would have not been able to pas the selection for an internship at the europea parliament . in fact , the student who wanted to apply for an internship whithin the european parliament had to demonstrate to know how this international organization work in theory . only the student who were able to pas the test would attend the internship . since i studied hard before applying for that position and i knew well the structure of the most important european institution , i managed to pas the selection . i went to bruxelles where i spent the most exciting time in my life thanks to my study done earlier at university . after the internship i also acquired pratical knowledge of the european parliament , which ha added something useful to my whole preparation . it is then important , in my opinion , for student to pay attention to idea and concept .
