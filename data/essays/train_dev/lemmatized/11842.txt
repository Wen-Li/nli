i think that in twenty year there will actually be fewer car than there are now . in this essay , i will explain the reason why i think this will happen . the main reason for my view is the increasing price of gas . we have seen that the petrolium price have gone through the roof recently . in the last three year , they have more than doubled . the fuel efficieny of car ha more or le been stagnant in the last couple of decade . it is reasonable to assume fuel efficiency will not be able to offset the rising price . at this rate , it will be prohibitively expensive to drive a car , and people will prefer public mode of transport such a bus and metro . another reason is that more and more people are becoming aware of the pollution caused by car . people are increasingly concerned about their environment , and are taking step to maintain it . in denmark for example , an increasing number of people are using bicycle rather than car . taking a cue , other europeans have started adopting these step . this trend is likely to spread well beyond europe , into america and other continent . cars make people lazy . as people become more health conscious , they will stop using car , and use more healthy way of transport such a cycling or biking . they may also prefer to walk if the distance is short . with the advance in aviation industry , it is becoming increasingly affordable to travel by air . if we can extrapolate this , travel by air may in fact become cheaper than travel by car in another twenty year . in that case people are highly likely to stop using car . in conclusion , it is more likely than not that there will be fewer car twenty year from now . this is supported by present condition a well a past experience .
