i would very much like to have the diclatony of supporting the argument or rejecting for my question . what make a person to agree this statement ? is it the pollution effect on which any person give to choose this question or is it the decrease in the car price that any person base his answer to agree this statement ? as far a i am concerned the statement is wrong and instead the number of car would increase owing to the decrease in car price . no body would disagree with me if i say that the number of car would comedown , instead i will say the reason why more number car would still be in use , which is because there is tremendous amount of competition among the car manufacturer . obviously to increase their sale they would come out with various offer a a festival gift . and also growing economy of the people allow them to buy a car which would automatically increase the no of car . to explain my answer i would quote an example of my city where no of car purchaser are getting increased and also a far a the latest data are concerned , each family in india would own car in the next twenty year and also i do not see any reason for the number of car to comedown in the next twenty year and also a the car provides you much comfort , no people would love to loose that option . so , that is why i would completely disagree with the statement mentioned above that `` in twenty year there will be fewer car in use than there are today '' . instead i would tell you that the no . of car in usage will be higher than there are now , considering fact that the company sell the car at a cheaper rate and also the increasing economy that would allow the people to buy a car and also the comfort that the car provides .
