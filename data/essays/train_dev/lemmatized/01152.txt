`` young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their community '' . i think that is not true and i will explain here why on my own experience . when i wa at the faculty , i wa the manager of a place inside the university that wa maintained only by volunteer student . it is a place where from 7:30 am to 6 pm student can come . they can rest , have something to eat during all day ( sandwich , snack food , croissant , pancake ... ) , play babyfoot or chess or other game . they can also read newspaper , listen to music they like or come for concert in the evening . the question is why is that helping our community . the aim of this place is not at all to make money and profit . people that manage this place where not paid , only student working to make food were paid . these young people are hired on the basis that they really need this money and that they ca n't get help from their parent . specially in my faculty ( faculty of science ) , it is very difficult to get a job in addition to going to the university because generally we got about 30 hour of course a week . these student working for u only work 6 hour a week so they can find time to do it . we organise also twice a month on thursday a concert generally organized by an another association where all the profit from the night are given to this association . for example , one of the association needed the money to buy some toy to distribute it to child that have to spend christmas at the hospital . all the benefit we do each year which is not much is automatically invested for local ' or for new material such a table , chair , light for the scene . so i think on my experience and on what i have seen is that young people still do their best to help others a much a they can .
