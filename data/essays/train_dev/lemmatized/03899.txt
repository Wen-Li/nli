in my opinion , it is better to have specialization in one specific subject rather than having a broader knowledge of many academic subject . i believe that a person should be a specialist rather than generalist . there 's an old saying , `` jack of all trade master of none . '' firstly , a person should not waste his time and money in acquiring knowledge which he wo n't require or use it in future . a person should not devote his time in learning unnecessary subject which he wo n't even imply in his specialization like literature and mathematics are two different field . none of the thing are common between them . also , a mathematics student would waste his time and energy in learning literature whereas he could use this time to do reserach in his prefered subject . this implies vice versa too . there is no practical implementation of mathematics in literature . we should avoid our time and energy spent on learning unnecessary subject . secondly , all the renowned people whether it is from literature or history or science are the people who have specialized in one subject . they are not the people who have studied everything . infact , they are the people who have devoted all their life in specializing a subject . they work day and night on their subject to come to certain conclusion which become the basis of our life . moreover there are lot of prize and recognition for the people who have specialized in one subject . there is no such recognition for the people who know lot of subject and are master of none . there is wealth , fame and recognition for the people who have dedicated their life to specialize and reserach in their particular field . these are the people who are highly appreciated and respected in our society . thirdly , most of the profession in today 's world requires a specialist . we have software programmer , scientist , engineer and etc . they all are the people who have mastered their field which is based on one subject . this show that a specialist can survive in any condition . he will always have job for earning his livelihood . he will alway have a preference over others . lastly , i will like to conclude that the greatest problem solver in any field are the one who are specialist in their subject , not the one who know everything .
