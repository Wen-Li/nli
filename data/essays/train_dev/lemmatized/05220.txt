concepts are generally defined a general idea whereas fact are linked with event that happened , thing which are le abstractive . so , saying that it is more important for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact is quite restrictive . it is clear to me that student need both . i think indeed that learning fact on which you can lay yourself to understand concept is essential . for a student in history for example , fact and date are the basis to think about a larger period . the concept of power for instance often need to be illustrated by behavior of king or president in europe for century . in this case , knowing accurate fact feed your thought . on the other hand , one could argue that for a student in philosophy , idea and concept are much more important than fact . or for a student in mathematics too . all this lead me to believe that fact sometimes can be put apart . yet , when you can help you with fact , i think concept are easier to understand . in scientific subject especially . likewise , in a physic course about gravity , showing an apple falling onto the floor is a good way to start the lesson . what i mean is that the application of the principle , under the shape of a fact ( the apple is attracted by the earth ) , is a well important a the general idea . yet , it is also interesting to think twice about the question : what is the most important for a student , to understand or to learn ? this is a complex issue . normally , a i said , learning should lead and help to the understanding . but why not only understand thing ? why not only applicate a pattern of thinking that you got when you understood one system ? because i think that people should make profit of their capacity to learn thing and then to make link with others in order to understand new thing that nobody taught them . as a conclusion , i would say that learning fact is a important a understanding idea and concept , even if it can depends on the subject ( history , philosophy , geography . .. ) . i think that they are complementary . understanding grammar rule and learning vocabulary are n't they both necessary to express oneself in a foreign language ?
