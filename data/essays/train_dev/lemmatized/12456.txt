the 21st century is the century of more technological developement than any century before could achieve and the century of unsufficient source . due to the population growth , on of the concern of the scientist and researcher is the transportation problem . one side of transportation problem is the number of car in the traffic . the traffic rush , the pollution and the gas are the problem of car use . the technological developement may be used to protect the planet and find new source of energy or use existing source more efficiently . therefore , we can argue that in twenty year , there will be fewer car in use than there are today : firstly , because there wo n't be enough gas for all the car in use and secondly , there will be new way of public transportation , like the millenium 's invention , the `` ginger '' , or cost-efficient flying object . on the other hand , technological prediction on the future were always been a source of inspiration for the scientist , but never been accurate . for exemple , according to 2001 : a space oddesey by arthur c.clark , we should have been living on other planet by now . or if prediction were true , jules verne 's novel would n't mostly be unrealized . therefore , we can state that , according to the growing number of car in use , in twenty year there will be even a lot more number of car on the road . in conclusion , we can say that the future depends on u . if in twenty year , we learn to be more proactive and begin to take initiative , people 's awareness of the damage and pollution of car could prevent the growing number of car in use . nevertheless , if we keep on persisting on individual gain and forgeting about the planet 's sake , there will be much more car riding on the road every day .
