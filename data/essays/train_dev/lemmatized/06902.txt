i agree that in next twenty year there will be fewer car in use than there are today . today fuel price hike and increasing pollution are major problem faced by the world . fuel price hike is one of the major reason that one may discontinue using car . every one can not afford to pay so much for fuel . one may get a car with the help of various facility provided by car company like finance , loan etc but cost of maintainance and overall running cost can be a major problem for a person . day by day every thing is becoming expensive and for one it might be unbearable . also pollution level in city are increasing , because of that global temperature is increasing at constant pace . as a solution to this problem goverments of all the country are now making public transport more stronger which give one better facilites and cheap transportation . '' local train '' running on electricity following local network with in the city may help commuter to travel to their desired destination consuming le time . the use of public transport may take some time to be adopted by mass , but it will be successful because it save time , money and enviroment if considered in broader sense . also the traffic on city road is increasing because of the craze among the people to buy car . but soon they will realize and will go for the better option that can be using public transport or even cycle to travel near by destination . today the number of new car rolling on road are incrasing at very fast rate , thus increasing traffic and fuel price because of increasing demand . with the passage of time one have to think seriously about his pocket and time . hence , because of so many constrains one may not use car . as on one realizes various problem in driving car within the city one may switch on to a better alternative to save money and time .
