i strongly agree with the statement that , most advertisement make product seem much better than they really are . advertisements are designed such that they aim our weakness . sometimes even if we know that buying that product is not going to help anyway , we will buy them hoping it will come in handy some day . that 's the weakness they are cahing . now-a-days there are channel just for buying stuff most of the company spend million of dollar to advertise their product . just by looking at the picture we can understand how important it is for them . now-a-days we see famous people advertising for different produts even for the product they are no way related to . then why are company using them ? because they know they are worth paying million just for 1 advertisement . there are people who use product just because there favorite actor or person is using it . i will give an example of how we can be fooled by the advertisement . one of my friend , recently relocated so she decided to buy all the necessary item for the home . she saw an advertisement about a blender in the tv from a well known company . next day she bought it and had to return it just after a week because suddenly it stopped working . so she exchanged it , but same thing happened again . she is so frustated . so i told her the brand i am using which may not be popular but work . adverisements are made to mesmorize audience and buy product . now the trend of anti-aging product is going on . we will see an actress who claim that this is the best product in the entire world but the very next minute we will see another famous person claiming the same for another brand . in reality there is nothing in the market anyone can get for 50 or 100 dollar that can drastically change our age . everyone know that , then why are people buying them ? they want to look good and young and company are cashing their weakness . on the whole , i would like to say that 99 % of product are over emphasised . most of them even do not perform the basic function . but that doe n't mean we should not use anything at all . buy product that satisfy our need rather than because an actor or a famous person is using it .
