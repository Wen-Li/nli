i do not agree . because the car is very convenient . why will be fewer car in twenty year ? in japan , exactly , only some people have the car today . but what do you think about the car in the united states of ammerica ? i think if you are in america , you have to use it . like big country of america need car . i think that no one found the train and so on . because that need a lot of money . who pay it ? i live in japan . and i do not have my car now . because i am a student . i do not go futher way . i do not have much money . i do not have a car licence . and japan is narrow country . so , i must not have it . but , i will have a car in my future . i need it . because it is easier than train to transfer . i use only train or bicycle everyday . but they are not convenient . not speedy . not easy way . it need much time . do you think so to ? car is the best . i think it . car can go somewhere . it doe not have demelit . if you want to say , something to demelit of using car , you arge it is costly or no space . .. and so on . car will develop in the future . and i think it will be made u feeling more convenient . and i suppose like a train will be disappear in the future . this is probably . i hope we
