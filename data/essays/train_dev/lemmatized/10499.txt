in my little community all the volounteers working and helping the others are mainly adult and old people . therefore , my experience give evidence to the statement that young peple nowadays do not give enough time to helping their community . there are many explainations for this to happen . today young people are involved in various activity : after having being to school , they have many homework and they are also involved in sport and other leisure activity . therefore , they have no time to be more involved in their community . often this happens because of their parent , which prefer their son to be working more for their individual future that for the future of the community a a whole . in my case , i have been always asked to spend more time learning language and playing sport rather than working a a volunteer for the community . another motivation for this low involvement in the community is the growing lack of interest from the society itself for young involved in social work . in particular , the school doe not provide stimulus to involve the student in this kind of project . in my high school , for example , only the 4 % of the student spent time helping their community . a good idea could be , in my opinion , the distribution of school credit for every hour of social work in the community of origin . furthermore the government doe not provide enough information on the matter : with the introduction of volunteer 's information point in the city and with the distribution of advertisments , the number of young people involved in the community can grow easily . to conclude , i believe that it is true that the young people is not involved enough in their community , and my personal experience provides a good example . the main cause of this are , in my opinion , the lack of time available to them and the lack of a correct information on the mutual benefit of an higher involvement . i think that mainly with the help of my school , i should find more time to help the community where i live , to improve it and to improve myself .
