eventhough some people agree that after twenty year there will be fewer car in use than there are today , ido n't share there opinion becuse of some spesific reason i have . first , world population is increasting rapedly and there is a need to use car nowaday , becuse of that i belive because we need car now how it could be in the future . second , new generation will have a driver licen to drive a car , but it doe n't mean that old generation will desapper they will mixed up and will be to crawded in the street . finally , i think the car will not desapper they will be more and more car than what we had today .
