the issue of whether young people enjoy life more than older people do is a controversial one . on the one hand , being young is attributed with enthusiasm and health which are both catalyst of enjoyment . on the other hand , the process of growing up undergoes many physical and mental change which might alter the enjoyment of life . i personally believe that a smaller age ha no influence on happiness due to many reason . first , let me define young and old . young is a person aged from 0-30 , while an older person is aged from 30 and more . according to my observation and to my personal experience , older people have the ability to enjoy their life better . one reason of my belief is that young people have not enough expertise in life to enjoy it the best . for instance , a 15 year old might feel frustrated because of peer pressure at school and he lack the cognitive mean and the maturity level to deal with his problem . a 35 year old man would know how to deal with his problem because he ha enough experience in life and he ha lived enough to pas through all kind of the problem that youngster suffer from . a second reason to my belief is that an older person have access to the mean of entertainment better than young person . an adult is allowed to a night club , is allowed to drink , to get married , to have child , etc. while the young 's enjoyement of life might be controlled by his parent , his age , his external environement . perhaps the most important reason to my belief is that adult are psychologically stable . their physical and mental change have already passed through all the intriguing stage that might cause frustration to youngster . for example a 40 year older would maybe already be settled in a house with child , a fixed job and a routinic life . in contrast , a younger person would have to worry about highschool grade , college , love , settlement , money and many other issue that are of no certainty to the person . in conclusion , i would certainly feel that a we go with time we might enjoy life better since we are about to have a more secure way of living , le uncertainty and of course no more physical and mental change to worry about .
