i definetly agree with this statement . most advertisement make product seem much bette than they really are . people who do those advetisement , just do their job , in fact they must make the product seem far better than it 's , becquse of the concurence . indeed , now in our society , firm ha to be the best , whatever the way they to be . there to much choice whatever is the product you wnt to buy , for instance , there very big of shampoo , when you go to the super maket you can even not know what to buy . and then advertisement ha a very importante role . an adevrtisement have to show that thr product that it 's presenting is the best one , and that you really need that one particulary . besides , people are very influencable by that , and that normal , if you don ' like an advertisement , you would not buy the product , because you will think it 's a bad one , even though in reality it 's much better than you think . well according to my own experience , advertisement really make product seem bettre , for example juste last week , i wa about to buy a new perfum , i wa thinking that it wa good , and the bottle wa very cute , and it wa a very famous perfum , but in spite of all , wanted to taste , so i did , and it wa simply a catastrophe . what we should remerber , it 's that the advertisement is just business , it 's people who want to make money , and a a result they do their best to present their product on the best way . in conclusion , you should always taste before to believe .
