i do not agree with the statement that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their community . i base my belief on a number of reason . first of all young person ' most important duty is to concentrate on school . they should be able to focus completely on their study rather then be concerned with what they can do for his community . if they failed in school they would later become a problem for their community because tehry would have to rely on public benefit in order to survive . likewise i believe young person should be able to spend some of histtheirs free time with ativities that are distractive from school and help to relax instead of investing that time into helping the community . to be successful they need opportunties to relax from their school work . so for example young people should be given time to do sport or other distractive activity instead of forcing them to invest their precious free time into community work . beyond that i think young people nowadays have certain duty at home , too . runing a family is not just the parent ' task but also requires the childrens ' help . thus they have another important duty to fulfil . also , happy family that do not rely on community support for example because it member are able to run their everyday life do not rely on the communty 's help . so young people give important time to their community a they help running their family . in the end i can not support the statement that young people do not give enough time to helping their community because they have other duty like school that need to be fulfilled in the first place . however , by helping at home and doing sport they contribute to a healthy community . this way they give precious time to helping their community .
