i agree about the passage that successful peole like try new thing and take risk oterwise the others just doing one thing what they already know how to do well . i traveled over 10 country by my self since i wa university student . before trying to go to the other country by my self , many people worry about some situation for dangerious and sickness . in addition to , i wa scared try new one because of the unfamillier . neverthless , after i try the new experience and take risk by my self , i got more confidenceand new knowledge . when i wa highschool student , i read the book about woman travel all over country by her self over 10 year . the author whose name is biya han overcome many risk and fight against the society 's prejudice . in early korea society wa so conservative , for the reason of that waman ca n't travel by themselves . besides in her age of 30 , travel by herself without marriage considered crazy idea . hoever she broke the rule , and she become successful traveler . i admired her , so i try to take risk and travel by myself . from the experience i got so many experinces for example . sllep in the street without money , walking 7 day by myself and meet many friend came from different country . after that experience , i got confidence and belive i can do everything . secondly , people can get many knowledge try new thing . i did n't know that make the fire , speaking english eventhough i could n't read the map before i traveling . i learn many valuable knowledge from the travel , so i decided the study more in america . if i did n't go to travel by myself i never know how important to learn new language and meet variety people .
