there are some people young people how do not give much important in helping their community , they preoccupied in their own world . they get enough time in doing all the other work and for helping for their community they will run away , and these are the people after sometimes are the one who will be living in the same community . they should be remembering only onething that if today they dont help their community , there will be a day where you need some help from them and on that day nobody will be their to help you . if we are not ready to help ourself no one will help a . when we are leaving in a common place and we have to learn to help eachother , by this we can leave without any trouble . if we leave like onday day will come were their wouldnt be any problem in the world . by this we could leave a aonecoplete family , this what we all need to do ateleast try to help eachother , and i think this happening for ex if we take globalisation is the medium through which we are comming to one place and all rich country are helping the poor country in a way they could this an example for their are people who are will to hep . we can not also say that young people are not helping their community their some young people who are creating awareness among different sector of people of the importants of helping one another . they are forming group and forming community for those who are in need of help . so this suggest that their are a section of young people who are willing to help other people and community , but the percentage of these people are le and we need to increase this habbit and make sure that everybody inculcates this practice .
