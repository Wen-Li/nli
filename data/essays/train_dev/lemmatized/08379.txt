the main objective of any educational system is to try to teach student concept and fact simultaneously . it is thought certain than people would become more complete if they could learn both from theory and experience . however if a choice should be made what part would be better ? i seems to me that it is more important to understand concept than to learn fact . indeed , idea and concept are very difficult to understand and requires specific teaching whereas fact can be learnt throught experience . furthermore it is not the role of a teacher to have a deep knowledge of general fact . besides the student need to know the theory in order to understand fact . ideas and concept are very vague topic which requires an intense learning program . indeed , an idea usually spread out from century , if not millenium , of questionnig and debate and thus a rather long time is needed to understand the basis of an idea . therefore , only people who have dedicated their entire life to a certain topic can be able to explain clearly the true meaning of a concept . consequently it is merely impossible to aprehend an idea just by witnessing a consequence it might have on a person or a thing . in the opposite , fact are easily understood by simple observation . thus , student might have a better comprehension of unknown fact than new concept . for instance , it is more difficult to learn from experience the idea of love than undertanding the reason of a car crash . therefore student should learn what is le easier to experience which in this case are idea and concept . secondly , a it ha been stated in the previous part , only qualified people are able to talk precisely of idea . those expert are refered in the educational system a teacher . a teacher is a person which ha a deep knowledge of a sepcific field of area . by studying and exchanging idea with collegues , teacher are able to gain expertise on idea and concept . however , the very concept of their expertise is that they do not rely on specific fact but ; ore on general idea . for that reason they are not qualified to share their experience with student . finally , understanding fact requires that previously the student ha been aware of the theory . a fact can only be fully understood when the underlying idea and concept are known . students should then concentrate on learning idea . besides the very principle of an idea is that it is therotical and need to be discussed within group such a classroom . life provides example but how could student possibly understand event without the necessary background ?
