i am agree with this statement because if a student understand idea and concept using analizing fact he can reach quickly the learn of the fact . i think these are two different way of compreantion but a student can choose the one he prefer . there are some people who prefer study from book and impress fact in their memory , other listen the lesson of the professor and understand the idea and the concept that can help him to reach fact studing just a little bit . for example if you study history , you can study the fact appened but if you do n't understand the reason which bring these fact you will find problem to collocated them in the progress of the story . on the contrary understandig the ides or the fact which support the way adopted , you will be able to reach the fact easier . i think that in some case understanding concept and idea must be related with exarcitation and sperimentation . for example you can study for a week math , you can make exercitation but if you do n't understand the reson of the operation that you made you do n't will be able to use it in a correct way . making exercitation student can learn how to proceed in a correct way and making wrong operation they will be able to understand the concept and don-t make the same error or mistake in the future . we can associate this process of exarcitation or sperimentation with the study of a foreign language ; the most pratically way to learn a language is to go studing in a country where this language is the national one . listening and talking with people is the easiest way to learn the language .
