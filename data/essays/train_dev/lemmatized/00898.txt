i agree to the statement according to my experience and to what i have seen in the past and present and can predict the future solely through my reasoning . the fact that car bring major pollution , are inefficient , and car need oil to be used are instrumental that i agree to the proposed statement . most importantly , car have significant detrimental effect to the natural environment around u , and therefore explains that , in the future there will be a decrease in the number of car . first of all , the exhaust created from car have polluted the air that we breath , sometimes stimulating disease to infant , child , adult and many other people . given that the natural environment is a resource that people all value and desire to protect , make it clear that car will be le used when people have seen or will see the dramatic and harmful effect car have on the earth 's atmosphere and to overall human health . on the other hand , car , in the first place , need oil to be accessed by a consumer , therefore car would be inefficient in the future . oil , currently is a very delicate and priceless resource currently at this time of the 21th millenium . since oil price are increasing at an alarming rate , people may not have access to oil or petroleum in the near future . therefore it is obvious that oil is not a natural resource that can be renewed fast enough to sustain it amount when human are ` over-exploiting ' it resource . as a result , it can be confirmed that at this rate of the consumption of natural gas or oil , how will we be sure that there would be enough resource for car to run , in the next 20 year ? lastly , from the experience that i have seen is that government are truly trying to decrease the number of car for critical reason . cars may be convienient to the individual that use it , but it ha numberous detrimental effect that government and the public have to deal with and clean up . therefore , every year government use a large percentage of their budget to pay up the car expense . expenses such a , pollution , car management , car accident and many more . because of such expense , government are reinforcing public transportation , such a railway , bus , and subway and is suggested a substitute for car because it is much for cost efficient a well a convienient for it user at the sametime . from my belief and opinion i agree to the specified statement , given that car create major pollution , are inefficient , and costly .
