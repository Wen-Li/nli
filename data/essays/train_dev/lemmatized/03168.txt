i disagree with the following statement that it is more important for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact because our world is packed with information to learn and to understand . also to get an idea of something like an animal we need fact and not idea . first main point is , that our world consists of information and anything is filled with information . facts are easier to learn . on the other hand , sometimes it is also an advantage to know the idea and concept behind a project or a war . to illustrate , i like to know the fact and not to imagine why and what the reason for the war wa . aditionally , the only thing people and i have to know are the fact . i take the war a an example . many people are talking about what the idea behind the war wa , but that is not interesting , just when it started and how many boat the americans had and when the d-day really wa . the idea behind all those thing i really dont want to know . facts can also learn me to learn . for example , i sit at home and have to learn french . although the language is difficult , i do not ask me the question how the language could have had such a evolution , i just learn it . fact by fact . the second main point why i disagree with the shown statement is , eventhought information and concept are good or helpful , i never learn everything right . to learn i need fact and not curio idea and silly answer . for example in school , all the teacher learn u fact and not idea . to know something about a flour or a lake , a ocean or an animal i and all the other people need the fact to understand the topic of what we are sudying . in conclusion , i think everyone need both like idea and concept and fact , but to step up in our life i need to learn and to learn you need fact . facts are the base for our knowledge . thats the reason why i disagree .
