in my honymoon my wife and i traveled by car to all italy we were able to stop in any place that we like ore we can move if we don n't like the place or if we were tired . i remember thast in florence the chappel wa close because the goberment wa repairing it so we have the oportunity to take the car and leave the city , also in the pissa we saw the pissa tower , that wa amassing , and then leave to the next city nevertheless we saw a group leaded by a tour guid that had to waith until the time schedule for that city wa finished to move on . whoever travelling with a group led by a tour guide did n't offer this benefit , in my opinion it give tow benefit , the first one is the explanation that the tour guide give , and the second one the rate that you have for travelling in a group . in some country there are not tour guide that can splain you the history of the place , some specific ditails about the construction , the way of leaving , recomendations in the food , and also recomendations in the price , all of this can be very helpfull when you travel by your sellf . alsoit is amassing the rate that you can find in the market if you travel in a group , the person that organise this kind of trip are always finding the best rate because they sell volume so the hotel give them the best rate to fill the hotel , also they arenge transportation and is cheaper travelling in a bus that in several car . for my family and i the best way of travelling is without a tour guide and by our self , because we prefere to spend mony renting a car in a foreing contry and have the oportunity to decide wheter we wanth to stay in a place or not , also if you travel to lage city you will find electronic tour guide that can easilly fastforware .
