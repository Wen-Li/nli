are there difference in enjoyment in life comaparing young people and those of whom are older at age ? well , i think that is a question that depends on a personality or different background in which the person came from . however , i do think that a more younger person will have the advantage in enjoying and having fun in life because they have le to worry about . when a person becomes older they are more aware and warned of personal and social problem , at school , friendship , grade and so on . what i thought wa the most difficult , while growing up to be a pre-teenager wa that i had to conform with others and i had to use the right choice of word . when you are little you have limited thought of how your word may affect others and how you accept difference , but when you grow up , you may be discriminated and segrigated because of your skin color and the clothes you wear , or the way you look . these problem cause you to worry more and be le out going . it can also cause you to be depressed and make you choose the wrong choice in life . at school , not just young adolecents but also college and university student have stress up on managing their time to complete and hand in their assignment in on time . with the growing stress , you can find yourself caught up on homework and writing essay , which prevents you from having free time to spend for your liking and enjoyment . when you become older you have to worry about mannaging your deadline at work , how you are going to pay the bill , conforming with your co-worker and more social problem along with personal stress . with all of these stress and `` things-to-do '' going on , i do n't think that you will be able to enjoy your life so much a well a a younger person with le stress and le work would .
