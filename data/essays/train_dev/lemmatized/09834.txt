i agree with this that young people nowadays do not have enough time to help their community . i agree with this because nowadays people are becoming or doing their work like machine to earn lot of money to enjoy later . they are not bothering about the communitie they are living around them . they doing a they like after passing through some age . i have a friend who is doing her job in mnc 's . nowadays she is earning a lot of money in the job. & now she is suffering with lonelyness & she thinkking about something bad . getting enough money make pople like in the better way , peacefully . we should have enough time to help others also i.e ; in the society there will the `` poor & the rich , good & the bad '' . we should transform some money to trust that will help the people . helping may not be financial it may be physically also . doing help physically help the people more energitic in their daily life . we should enjoy the life but it should be of some extend only . throwing lot of money in the pub & restraunts is not a good habit . it may spoil the health also . spearing sometime with the destitutes knowing their problem is agood habit . we mat noy solve them but we have chance of making them happy . the problem are get ridden by telling them to any body by the side of u . communitie mean `` group '' . it is not a single thing or single person . helping a person in a scocitey mean helping the world to build . mother teresa should be the role model to all he young people today . an intimation strats from one person but we should join the hand or take participation the in that field . like our freedom fight gandiji started the revoulution then amny of our indians joined there hand in that . i conclude this by giving an encourgement to the young people to take part in the communitie .
