the statement say to predict the future after twenty year about the position of the car . as per my veiw and my perceptoin are concerned and i would like contradict thestatement and i guess that there would be a increase in the number of car than at present . i would like to give the following veiws in order to support the issue and they are a follows firstly the peope are grewing richer and richer than are today and all the rich people feel it is a prestige to own a car and and it not a matter for them to own and maintain a car . in the metropolitan city it ha became a common source of travel . journey by car are more comfort than the public mean of transportation for local need . secondly i would like to emphasize on the incresase in the technological advance , there are many a car coming and some of them are a cheap which encourages even a normal person to own a car . thirdly the same increase in the tchnologocal invention lead to search for alternate fuel source which are ecofriendly and cheaper than present day fuel such a the gas and electric car which operate on battery source are also gaining importance a they donot pollute the environiment . we must consider a reason for decrease in the number of car which may be by imposing a ban on the car , but the government will not impose because the automobile industry would collapse many factory tend to close leading to unemployment and financial crisis may also occur leading to a disturbensce in the economy . some people may also loose their there lively hood like the cabdriver and so the government will not impose the ban . statisticaly , it wa also said that an increase in the number of car from the past year wa tremendrous and the growth will continue till after twenty year indicating the rapid increase in the number of car . in a nut shell i want to conclude that with all the above stated factor there might not be a decrease in the number of car in the coming twenty year .
