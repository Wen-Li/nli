advertising in the art of convincing customer to buy specific product . it is obvious that advertisement do not provide a complete information to the customer . that is not the original purpose , even if it provides sometimes useful information , and other way exist for customer to get information about the product they want to buy . for example , a lot of independent website compare all the model of the same product available in the market . but even if advertisments are not supposed to provide a complete information , they often describe some feature of the product . doing that , they can not lie about objective characteristic because it is not legal and the advertisement would be forbidden by the competent authority . then , how advertisement can lie to the customer ? the way to describe a product can be very subjective and it is obviously the case for advertisement . for example , if you present a car with very beautiful girl or boy driving it , you do n't lie but you give the illusion that the car is better than it would be with a normal driver . that is seduction . a advertising is seduction . when you are interested in someone and you have a date you do not wear every day 's clothes . you take more time to appear `` much better than [ you ] really are '' . that is seduction too and nobody seems to be against this kind of `` subjective lie '' . in my opinion , the statement `` most advertisement make product seem much better than they really are '' is true but that is not a problem because everybody know that advertisement are subjective . there is a game of seduction between company and customer . we have to know the rule and take part of the game . i think that the life would be le interesting without this kind of subjective communication , beyond technical description .
