in this morern , people are easily find the advertisement , they take place everywhere . peolpe can find the advertisement not only in the tv , but also in the newspaper . furthermore , people buy many thing because of the advertisement . the advertisement always look really good and make people want to spend money on them . in my opinion , i think that the most advertisement make product seem much better than they really are . the reason are the owner want to earn money , and the advertisement are decorated and exaggerated . first reason is because the owner want to earn mony from these commondities . for instance , if the asvertisements look really terrible , no one would desirable to buy them and spend their money on them . therefore , the owner wo n't get the money and welfare from them . secondly , most of the advertisement are decorated and exaggerated . for example , the ipod is really fasional these day . the advertisement of ipod allways say that it can contain over 1,000 song and wo n't out of battery at least 14 hour . however , after i spend my money that come from my salary of part time job , i wa really sad about that . my ipod ran out of battery before 8 hour , and it had no more space before i put in the three hundred and fifty-third song . therefore , i stronging believe that most advertisement make product seem much better than they really are for the following reason . the owner want to earn money and the advertisement are allways decorated and exaggerated .
