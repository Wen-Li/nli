in my opinion young people do not support their community a much a they should . i have several resons for this opinion . young people today are very much caring about their own free time and the activity they do . they do not see the community that is around them but only their own benefit . for example , a lot of young boy use skating rink to skateboard , however very few of them actually helped building the site so that the kid of the community can enjoy the rink . reason number two is rather obvious a well . doing volunteer work that is an unpayed job and at the first glance boring to do , is not very attractive to young people . they fail to see the bigger picture and are often not encouraged by parent of other respected person to help and give some of their time . i think that it is this lack of encouragement that cause such a low rate in volunteering activity of young people . at the same time i am assuming that young people also do n't see or get any incentive by engaging in the community . this problem can be solved by creating special programme that will spark the interest of young people . they need to be designed towards the need and ability of the youngster in oder to fully work out . the creativity of the youth need to be addressed in possible project or incentive . if they can get an opportunity to present their talent , say they like to spray gaffity and get the opportunity to spray a wall legally a a trade off for helping out at a nursing home , i think they are much more likely to consider helping out in the community than they would without this incentive . in my opinion young people would help more than they are doing now , if the job assigned and the incentive given are more suitable to their need today . the problem and idea i have stated could be a start .
