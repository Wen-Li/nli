i totally disagree the following statement that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their community . i disagree this because i am a young people who pay enough time to helping my communty . why am i so sure that young people give enough time to helping their communites ? first , i would like to say that in my university , there are numerous club of devoting . i am the one of these club member . we go to some retirement association to chat with old people . some of them have child , but their child are too busy to go to meet them . so we go there to acompany with them and to clean the enviroment . sometimes we go to meet childern who lost their parent . most of them are still very young , but do have enough love from family . so we become their brother or sister . we go there for teaching and giving them love . moreover , every student in my university must help for the community . this is the course we must take , if we do not serving , we will not graduate . although some student are relunctant to do this , but after they help the community , all of them are happy and willing to do the service by volunteer . finally , i do not disagree that some people say we do not give enough time to helping . because all of the member in my club like to do this service . actually , we do not think that we are helping people , we think that we learn a lot from them . all of my friend like to do this , and we think we are not giving . in fact , they are really give u a lot when we helping .
