if i had the chance to visit the part of the world that i have always wanted to , such a france or italy , i would definitely choose to be accompanied by only a couple of the people who share the same interest with me rather than a large group and i would not want to be accompained by a tour guide . therefore i disagree with the statement of `` the best wa to travel is in a group led by a tour guide '' . the main reason for that is travelling with a group brings about many problem such a time limitation . you would be required to stop at ceratin time since people in the group will have need such a food or refreshment and you would not be able to decide when you want to do the thing whenever you want to do them . secondly , every person in the group will definitely have different taste and every person in the group will want to visit different part of the region and they will want to spend different amount of time at every different location . for example , some people might want to visit the bar or club of france whereas the others might want to visit the palace and museum . this would lead to disagreement or unequal time spent at the visited location . another factor that led to my decision is that when a person travel with only a couple of people whom he know or alone , he ha the chance to choose the route that he is going to take and he can stop at various place for quick visit such a cafe or place on the way . however when travelling in a group led by a tour guide you would have a set and specific route to follow without any kind of flexibility and random quick stop at place that interest you would not be possible . in conclusion , according to me , travelling alone or with only a couple of friend who share the same interest with me , without a tour guide would be my preferred way of travelling because it would give me the opportunity to choose my own route , i would not have to stick with the time regulation of the group and i would visit the place i want to visit , whenever i want to visit them instead of that of the group .
