even at certain extent so called fact itself based upon the particular idea and concept behind it . basically the whole matter of this world depend on particular idea and concept of it existance or creation . here if we dont understand the idea or concept of particular thing then we take is a fact and we accept it a it is . so i would certainly cent percent agree to the statement that it is more important for student to understand idea or concept . because , if we want to understand the thing a a whole then we need to conceptualize that thing , we have to understand the content from the grass root level of that matter . then only we will be capable to solve the puzzle behind it and can explore the real eternal truth based upon the logical conceptualization and critical thinking . as for the example , if the student want to learn the math taught in his class then he need to understand the basic concept from the fundamental level itself . so that in future he can build his further study or professional career based upon that distinct concept of his subject . another reason i would like to project is that if the student accept the study matter or any thing a simply a it is explained without getting the rational or logic behind it then there are more chance for student to flunk in their exam , especially when they just mug up the thing a one of the fact or phenomenon . this kind of attitude towards study may endanger them in their future prospect whenb they go in thier professional life . thus , i would l ; ike to conclude that student should understand the idea and the concept rather than fact .
