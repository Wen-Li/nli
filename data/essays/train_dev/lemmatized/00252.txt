there are a lot of people all over the world to travel somewhre in a year . some people think that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide . however , i disagree with the thinking about traveling . i will write reason next paragraph . first , i want to go alone or my friend about my trip , because i da n't want to be led someone . i will buy guid book which we are going to go place . after that , we will be held meeting about traveling . on the other hand , if we would join a group , we will have to be led a tour guide , so we could not spend a great time . second , i do n't want to pay waste mony using a tour guide . a tour guide show around somewhre a a job . therefore , money of traveling is included their payment . if we would go traveling somewhere by ourselves , we only pay our traveling money . third , i want to look many place by myself . i want to find hotel , restaurant and so on also . it is comfortable to use travel company . however , i think that it will be good memory prefer traveling alone or only with my friend to in a group . thus , i do n't consider that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide . i have some reason about traveling . i do n't want to pay waste money , and i want to decide by myself .
