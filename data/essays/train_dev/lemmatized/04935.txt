i do n't think that only young people enjoy their life more than older people do . it 's depended on how someone 's mind is . actually , young people have many thing to enjoy more than olders have . but some of youngers can have boring life . even though a person is enough old , he can be more enjoyable than youngers . the mind is matter . i 'm actually one of people who think that the life is boring . i came to the usa with when i wa seventeen year old . everyone ha said to me that i wa too late to learn english perfectly because i wa almost adult in my country , south korea . and i thought i wa too late , too . i really have spent my two year meaninglessly , doing something like thinking of going back to korea . my common day were not enjoyable to me . but strangely , my mother is spending her life in the usa more enjoyably , and actively than in the korea . even though her english is not good that much , even worse than mine , she say that she thanks to have chance to move to america . before i heard it from mom , i thought that she had harder time than i did , because she wa pretty old to get into new society , which is difficult to non-english speaker . however , now she enjoys her life more than others . she enjoys to make foreign friend and mail them more than people who are younger than her . happiness is not at only youngers , it is given who know how to enjoy his or her own life .
