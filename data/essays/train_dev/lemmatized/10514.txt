i there wa n't twenty year a go , but i know that in that period there were fewer car in use than there are today . i think that there are many historical reason to explain the huge spread of the car in the last twenty year . starting thanks to henry ford and his way of production of car it wa possible to start to make car at minor cost and in a minor time . thaks to this starting improving the car ha became a common meand of trasportation . in fact , a production le expensive ha permitted to reduce the price to buy a car and always more people can have the possibility to buy it . a second historical reason that have caused a big speard of the car is the economy improve of the society . after the industrial revolution , the factory ha became the most common way to prodution . with the arrive of the factory most people start to work in a factory . during this period the society wa growed , the trade wa improve and therefore also the weaht of the people wa increase . thank to this better economic situation of the people it wa growed also the number of people that can buy a car . another element that during the history ha had effect on the spread of the sell of the car amoung people is the improving of the tecnology . chiefly in the last year , which the improving of the tecnology ha gone at a big level , always more car have made and more car have sail . in conclusion i want to underline that the car is a very common mean of trasportation , but nowadays there are too many people that use the car . in fact the use of the car cause much pollution at our environment . i know that tha car is the more easy maen of trasportation , but i know also that if all the people of the word use always the car , also for do few km , too many environment problem will born .
