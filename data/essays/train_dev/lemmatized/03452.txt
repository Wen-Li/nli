i strongly agree with the statement that the best way to travel is in a group with a person that can guide you in the place where you are going . i believe that this is important in order to know a place because i usually like to visit place with a good historical background . if i want to take advantage of the time while i am travelling , and this time is limited , i do not want to waste it , just trying to recognize what place are important in that city or location . for instance , if i go to italy , i would love to go to all the museum , and famous restaurant . i also would enjoy the opportunity to go to the beach in the mediterranean sea . normally , a tourist would need more than a month just to plan these activity . however , if you go with a tour guide , this person will make your life a lot of easier , because he or she already know where to go , at what time , what are the important part where a tourist should focus his attention . last year , my family went to dominican republic . we bought a all inclusive plan , but we did not have a guide . we were totally lost there , we did not know where to go . all the time people were taking advantage of u charging an incredible high amount of money for different service like taxi transportation , only because we do not have anybody that could give u advice or information about the usual fare for that kind of service . we had to pay $ 20 for buying a sunprotector . the most expensive sunprotector in my whole life . also , sharing your vacation with a group of friend is really wonderful . i would say that it could n't get better if you are travelling with the people you like and with somebody that already have a plan for you .
