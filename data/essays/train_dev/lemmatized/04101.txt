i agree with the statement that most advertisement make product seem much better than they really are . the reason that i agree with it are that they can change the color of product to look better and they hide the bad point of their product . first , when the company advertise their product , they always monitoring and editing the advertisement to make them nice . they also design the advertisement so that the product color and shape look better . however , if we see the good in store without fancy effect , they are le attractive than in advertisement . for example , in i-pod advertisement , they use fancy color to make it cool , but it is just computer graphic . second , the company know that what are the bad point of their product , so they hide it . in television , we ca n't figure out if they do n't show to u . we can do to the store and figure out that what is error of the product but still we can miss it . for example , some food restaurant put some chemical material , but they do n't tell the people that they put bad portion in food . they always say these are chuicy and jucy , not fatty or harmful . thus , many company make their good look great to make money . they want to hire the person like a advertisement designer in order to make their product fancy . they also want creative person to create new strateges of their business . we know that they want to make money , so we must think and choose carefully when we buy our product .
