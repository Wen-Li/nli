everyday we are forced to see all kind of advertisement , from television , from radio and even from our post letter . it give u million of information , and definately we are influenced by the advertisement more or le . however , i have to say that most advertisement make the product seem much better than they really are . from advertisement , people always see the good looking of the product . for example , the advertisement of the famous brand shampoo , let 's just call it p. we can see the beautiful long hair of many lady , shining and falling , it is easier for people believe that if we use the same product , we will have the same kind of hair . as a result , most of u can not have the same beautiful hair a the model . advertisements make the product seem much better than they really are , another reason is that the advertisement only show the good point of the product , they never let you know the bad side of it . for example , there is a advertisement about a vacume cleaner , in the advertisement , you are told that it is powerful , easy to handle , and you are even showed that how clean the room is after it is used , however , after you buy it at home , after you actually try it , you may find that it is too big to handle , and it take a large space to store . i have a similar experience last winter . after the first month of the winter season , i wa unhappy to find the the gas charge wa extramely higher than i expected , i noticed from the televison advertisement that there wa some kind of heater seemd very good , it wa powerful , good looking , and i went to the store and bought it at once . after one day of use , i had to return it to the store because it made a lot of noise . i wa not told about the noise peoblem from the advertisement . most advertisement definately make peoducts seem much better than they really are . that is the use of the advertisement . so better check carefully before you purchase something .
