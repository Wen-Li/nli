`` yes '' , i agree to statement which is given a `` in twenty year there will be fewer car in use than there are today '' . now-a-days people looking for such good company which will stay for long time , because now there are so many people are introducing such new model like `` accent '' , `` zen maruthy '' , and so many other car model name older and newer , also one company is modifying one company model and changing a little and releasing it again with their name . but only few company will stay for long time because they will not depend on other company model , public believe that company too . i feel how many year it go only the good product company stay for long time . those company stay for long time their success is in making the good in convincible manner . also they will use only perfect engine , look for better milage , comfortable steering and sitting arrangement with a.c. includnig in future in all type of car . if some car introducing with better milage ok , what about engine , if engine not much good then the car will not stay for long time and give so many problem in future . in the same way some car will have some other problem then the car will not stay for long time and give the trouble too in the future . only few company produce every thing perfectly and they stay for long itme in the future . by the above point with for and against i can strongly accept the statement `` after twenty year there will be fewer car i use than there are today '' .
