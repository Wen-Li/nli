i strongly agree with the statement , a i personally experiance the feeling . in life we need to enjoy every part , though it is related to money , adventure , drama etc . elders are always frightened a they always think of future than present . but youngster are dam bothered about future . for an example when i am in schooling i need to go for a tour but my parent are very scared to send me , but finally they sent me with more caution . after comming back , they have seen my video of my bangee jump in tour and started scoldind me though i safely came back . they are always more coutious in life and they never try for any adventure . i feel adventure is also part of enjoyment . spending money is economy for elder but for youngers money doesnt matter for enjoyment . when i started earning , i started spending for my own expenditure like resturants , outing with friend , enjoying weekend , but my parent dont like this a they want me to save money for my future . i feel that we need to enjoy when we have oppurtunity , a time never come back . we can earn money through out our life . youngsters like dressing in modern way a per there comfort whereas elder feel that young one need to maintain their tradition but i feel dressing in modern is not mean that we are loosing our tradition . finally i conclude that thinking of all these elder are loosing all enjoyment whereas young people are enjoying more than them .
