we might think that young people enjoy life more than older peole do because they want to experience thing , to discover thing and also because they have the energy and the strength to do it . but is this statement really true ? first of all , we will see that young people enjoy the life more than older people and why . then , in a second part , we will explain why , to some extend , older people know how to enjoy life maybe more than the young . first of all , it is a common idea that young people want to enjoy life a much a they can . why ? because they do not know yet the problem they will have to face during the following year . generally , they follow the famous carpe diem which advises people to live each moment with intensity , a if it wa the last day of one 's life . young people have the strong need to experience thing , to discover , to destroy the boundary of the parent , of the society . .. for example , they will go to party when the parent do not agree , or will take risk by travelling to country where they do not have any acquaintance , just to do it , because it is cool , a they say . .. but , even if they do not have the same physical fitness and strenght , older people also enjoy life , maybe more than the young . indeed , older people have lived , they saw what they needed to see , they lived what they had to live . thanks to their experience of life , they know the good thing that provide the real pleasure , the real happiness . they are able to compare and so , to know what really matter in life , the way they can enjoy life a much a possible . for instance , they will appreciate each little moment with their little chidren , with their friend . .. thus , they will enjoy life certainly more than young people . to conclude , i think that the statement which claim that young people enjoy life more than older people do is wrong . i totally disagree with it because i can not accept to think that i have already lived the best thing in my life . on the contrary , i think that the best moment in my life will come . to enjoy life , you do not have to do incredible thing . i think that to enjoy life , you just have to appreciate all the little good moment with the people you love . ..
