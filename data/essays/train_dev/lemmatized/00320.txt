in the last year , car ha became an useful mean of transportation , for example in order to travel or to go at work . moreover , car ha improved life 's people . i and my family have only one car but this mean come used several time . for example , i use car in order to go outdoor with my friend or in order to go at supermarket for shopping . in regard of statement that affirm that in twenty year there will be fewer car in use than there are today , i partially agree . i think that car , even today , is one of the most mean of transportation used and i think that this mean will be even in the future , even if much people prefer use alternative mean , like for example train or airplane in order to speed the travel . but , in the future , can happen that , if the price of petroleum increase very much , people will not use car in order to not spend much money . in conclusion , there are two different point of view in regard to the use of car . there are people that affirm that in the future there will be not more car respect to today ; instead , there are other people that think that car will continue to be used even in the future . as i saw earlier , i agree with the last point of view , but i think also that use of car will depend by what will be happen in the future in regard to economic element , in particular the price of petrolium .
