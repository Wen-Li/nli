in my opinion , successful people try new thing and take risk rather than only doing what they already know how to to well . i agree with this idea . because , successful people have good personality and they trust theirself . they are creative people who want to do new thing everytime . they want to take risk to create new thing . this is well known reality for them . everyone know this . this is also one of the chracteristic situation for these people . if a person want to be successful , he or she should very hard , he or she ha good personality and a a result of this he or she can be succesful . this is the best way to be a successful person . firstly , i want say that people do many thing in their life , always , they live traditionally . they have basic rule in their life . they do n't do new thing . but on the other hand , some people work very hard in their life . they have good personality and they are very creative for everything . this is the basic charecteristic for them . they get bored in normal life . they have best emotion to do new thing . so that they go from different way of life . i mean that they take o lot of risk while they are walking on this road . for instance , my best friend tom is ver successful life . i have known him a long time ago . when he ten year old , he did n't like to watch tv . he use to read everytime . after two five year , he went to america for best education . he wa saying that `` i should take risk my education , i should go america for my education . this is the best way in my life `` he toke risk . because he wa teenage and whe he went to america'he wa alone there . now after twenty year , he is assistance of a professor in the english class at a universtiy . he spent very much time to be a academic carreer . he tried different way to do it . and he ha taken some risk in conlusion , successfur people try new thing . this is basic charecter for them . an additionally , this is the well known reality .
