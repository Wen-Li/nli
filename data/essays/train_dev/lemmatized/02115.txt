travelling alone or with group will depends on one personality and travelling habit . i have more positive experience in travelling with group than travelling alone . so i like to travel with grouple led by a tour guide . travel with group is more stress free , organized , safe and le expensice . usually for group travelling , one will take care of the ticket booking , hotel reservation etc. group will decide when it time to start , which place is nice to stay . so i do n't need to worry about these thing and can enjoy the trip with out any stress . last year , i visited india with a group led by a guide and i felt my trip wa stress free . my group leader organized travelling and reservation and my tour guide take me to all the important place . guide will take the group and show everything that group need to see in that area . in this way , i do n't need to spend my whole evening planning for next day event . this is so time saving . this way , i can concentrate on other thing like enjoy my evening spa in the hotel spa room or meet new friend in the party etc . group travel is more safe . all way you have some one along with you and take care of you if needed . it is easy for you to recover from sickness since somebody is taking care of you . especially with long trip , if you are sick in the trip and you travel alone then it is very hard to recover from the sickness . since all the expences are shared among the group member , i will pay le money than i pay , if i travel alone . i strongly belive that travelling with group led by a tour guide will give more stress free trip in an organized fashion with le money and more safty .
