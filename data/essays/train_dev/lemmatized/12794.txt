science-fiction movie depict a future , where there are no car in the street because it is subsituted by teleportation . although it is mere fantasy and a funny expectation at the moment , some people think that car will vanish or their number will be reduced in twenty year . i do not agree with this statement partly because car have become a part of our daily life . more importantly they have become a part of our modern life . mobility is an important feature in today 's world since it offer escape from our daily routine , which is essential for refueling energy to ourselves to continue living . another reason is due to the market large corporation have at the present and they will not be willing to lose this market . the first aspect why car will not become unpopular in near future is due to their strong impact in our life . in this modern day , we do everything using car : we drop and get our child from school using car , we go out to entertain ourselves with our car . with the movement to the suburb , we need to go to the shopping mall and get our weekly need . other than that , family in suburb are usually isolated , and their only escape is gained through going out with their car . in city life , we have to use car too due to the fact that city ha a fast life and we have to adapt to it . another point regarding car is that they offer u an escape from the daily routine , which is something we need for continuing working . some might argue that we already spend time in car in our daily routine . however , a car and an open road is usually associated with freedom and escape . in today 's world , leaving our daily routine for a few day is considered a a way to feel ourselves comfortable and relaxed : we go on vacation using our car or go for a picnic at the weekend . as in seen in the movie thelma and louise , where two woman go away from their house for the weekend for a change since this is neccessary to go on living . the market car producer have at the moment is another aspect why car will not be outnumbered by other vehicle . since there is a big market for producer to sell their car to consumer , producer will find a way to keep car popular . to examplify , in the city - ankara where i have been living since i wa born , there have been a great increase in the number new of car in the traffic . this fact that i notice everydays show that car have not lost their popularity . on the contrary , more car have been sold in the last few year than in earlier time . this is partly because car producer are conforming to today 's need by changing the outlook of the car . in other word , they will not lose popularity , but the way they work will change . some people believe that there will be le car than there are today in twenty year . i do not agree with this statement because car have become a part of our daily modern life , and we do every little thing using them . additionally , car function a an escape from the daily routine of life to the people , who are exhausted in their daily life and in need of energy . moreover , car producer have a big market of consumer , which is something that producer will never want to lose .
