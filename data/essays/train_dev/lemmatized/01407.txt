the paasage read that it is the best to travel with conducted group tour led by a guide rather than travel alone . obviouslly , traveling in guided tour can be amusing and safer than single tour especially for those who do not have travel much and do not want take any risk in travelling . nevertheless , i have different idea to this . first , i believe travel ifself is a teacher of our life . as , during the travel , we get to see lot of differnt people and living enviornments we may have thinking back and forth of our life in the place we are living and to the people we are interacting about future and the past . thus , it can help grow our thought to more delegate and mature to which often group guided tour can not teach a we may spend much of our time with other people in the group and listen to guider all the way of travel . second , travelling alone can have more open chance of unique experience to which group guided tour may not have such a talking with native resident and experiencing unique culture and food to which most group tour miss a they tend to focus on what mass tourist like and hear in shallow . for me , while i travelled europe alone in the early 1990s , i got to experience all the newest unique thing which nobody did tell me before . it wa absolutely unforgettable experience i have until now . finally , a tour-guide led travel doe not require lot of information and toll we are travelling , even after travel , we become forgetting easily and do not know much about country we had been putting aside of more money it cost a group tour more focus on spendig the money . on the contrary , travel alone doe require lot of pre-information , studying , and planning ahead of travel . however once we are back , the outcome we have thourought travel can not be the same of group guided tour . as above , for me travel should not be necessary accompanied by group of people nor amusement should follow . just being alone can match great journey a being good traveller . so , i disagree to the sentenace of favoring guided group tour .
