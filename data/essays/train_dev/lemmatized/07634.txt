some people argue a if it were a general truth that understanding idea and concept is much more important than learning factor . but to be frank , i can not agree with them . there are numerous reason why i hold no confidence on them , and i would explore a few primary one here . to begin with , we can lean the idea and concept during studying factor . teachers will be able to teach the student the idea and concept by teaching a specific fact . let 's take look at a physic class . at the very beginning , the teacher give the class a specific problem , and ask them to solve it . the student might not be able to solve it , so the teacher could tell the some conceptional suggestion that could help to solve this problem and encourage them to think it again . and this time , the student might know how to solve the actual problem and also learn the basic concept . further more , why do we learn the idea and concept ? for practical work , of course . so , why do n't we learn something that is more practical ? learning fact will lead u to work directly , and it would not waste a lot of time studying the boring theory or concept , and this would save much more time . last but not least , studying fact will sometimes be more useful than studying concept . for example , imagine we are learning how to repair the bike . from the book , we may just know how to solve the general problem . but when we face a special problem , an intergrating problem that noise from all over the bike , for example , what could we do ? we might feel complicated to solve this kind of problem . to sum up , learning fact can help u save a lot of time and because of the purpose of learning is for work , studyng fat might sometimes be more useful when we work than studying idea and concept . taking into account of all these factor , we may reach the conclusion that it is advisable to learn fact rather than to understand the idea and concept .
