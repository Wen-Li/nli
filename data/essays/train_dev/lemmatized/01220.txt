enjoyment is an obscure term . it is very relative in it meaning and varies from person to person . but the final denoument of an enjoyment is joy , happiness , a time to forget our worry and to be cheerful and optimistic . so a young guy possibly enjoys more in the company of his girlfriend than he doe that at home . or an old man enjoys more with his grandchild than in exploring new restaurents and taste . the reason to write prceeding line is to construe that the term enjoyment doe n't lessens with age but it redefines it meaning with age . and that is why i disagree with what is implied in the issue - enjoying life decline with age . for , most of the people who would be in consensus with this topic , will have a portrait of an old man in their mind , who 's very feeble and is on verge of collapse and for the young the 'll possibly think of a nocturnal creature who never leaf a chance to party . but if we think in a different direction , and imagine that oldie are not always feeble . the great politician ruling our country , the businessmen , entreprenuers , critic , film director , novelist and every person who 's having a very promnent place either in corporate world or society , very rarely we find a stint of young in them . dont these people enjoy their life ? dont they enjoy their life by giving a complete devotion to their work and benefiting million of others - including youth . at the end of the day , to make earnest decision we need to rely on older one , we need to seek their openion without which our work wont progrss . and dont they enjoy giving their valuable openion to u ? this mean that enjoyment can not be restricted only to regular partygoer and for the one having a great friend circle . one can derive enjoyment from his work , from his decision , by spending time in company of those whom we love , by sporting , by entertainment . and any of these term are not restricted by age . the only thing required is inclination towards doing thing from which one derives pleasure . and thus i conclude a negative assertion towards the author topic .
