i am desagree with the sentence that the best way to travel is in agroup led by a tour guide because i have travel without a tour guide and i have have so beautiful experience i mean it `` ve been so cool . of course i have travel with a guide tour too but when this happen the guide tour is always under presion of the time and you need to follow him all time and if you want to stop some time you ca n't and i do n't know but i do n't like to have tour guide . in other hand when i travel without tour guide i can stop wherever i want and i can do wherever i want , and if i do not know what place are the famouses of the city i can ask to the people who live in that place or i can go to a library and look in the internet the direction and then get a map and then i am ready to go wherever i want thus it is so funny because if i get lost i need to ask how to return and at the same time that i know the city i know more people . i know that it is a risk , because for example my friend an i are going to travel next weekend to quertaro to visit some friend well they are member of my church , but i never have been there and no body that know how to arrrive to the city want to come with u , so we decided to take the risk and we only have the map , the car and money , well i want to tell you that some time i feel afear to get lost or something like that but something inside of my is telling my `` you can do whatever you want '' ( and i know that voice is good , and . .. he is going to care me ) . so we decided that we will travel without tour guide . in conclution despite is too risky travel without tour guide it is better because is too funny and you can learn of your mistake .
