i do n't agree with that statement . it 's better to have a specialized knowledge about one subject . i think you can be really good on one or two subject but if you want to have a very good knowledge for many subject you have lot of work to do and in my opinion it 's just not possible to be perfect in many subject . there are not many genius in this world and if you are not one of them you shoul be satisfied when you know very much about one subject . i 'm a specialist in history and german literature but if you want to know something about biology you have to ask someone else . today there are no `` universal genius '' anymore . hundrets of year ago there were some guy who knew very much about totally different subject . but today it 's too complex , to many information to know - that it 's quiet impossible . i want to study journalism and the student counsellor told me that it | s better to specialize on one subject than just study general communication . of course it | s very good to have a good knowledge about what \ s going on in this world but the magazine like it when you are a specialist in politic or maybe history . i also think that it would be easier to find a job when you are specialized on one subject . if you are very good in speech you could become a teacher or a translater . if you are really brilliant in math , physic , geography , history and religion it would be hard to find a job where you can improve all your knowledge . this theoretical knowledge is worthless if you are not able to work in the praxis . my mainpoint is that it would be to much work to do when you want to have knowledge in all academic subject , especially for me . ..
