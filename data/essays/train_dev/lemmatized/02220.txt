the question if it is more important for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact ha been discussed already quite often . in my opinion it is of greater importance for student to understand idea and concept . the main reason for studying , espacially if seen from a humanistic perspective , is to learn how to think freely , put question and understand the concept of a subject . although fact might be crucial in professional life , every single job will probably require the knowledge of special different fact . for example a businesswoman will work in a consulting company while the her former study collegue will work in a bank . it is just impossible to include all fact which are needed in a curriculum of a career . therefore it is unavoidable that every newcomer ha to get into the demand of a job individually and often start learning from scratch . as i have seen e.g. in my history class you will very likely forget some fact but you will never forget the broad idea , for example the reason for a war or for the rise of the nazis . this is much more important to know than to remember every date or the exact sequence of some engish king . this lead me to my next point . when you study the idea of a subject you also learn the ability of how to do research and where to find fact . therefore i think it is not fundamental to know every fact but rather to know where you can find the fact . several people go a far a stating that it is actually not important at all what kind of content you learn at university , but that you learn how to do research , how to write paper , how to solve academic problem and how to work without being told every single step like in school . but this is definitly only true for the humanity and not for profession like doctor or physician . to summarize , i prefer studying concept and idea because i think it will help me to develop more important and sustainable skill than just fact .
