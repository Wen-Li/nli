to study several academic subject in the university is not bad at all . her , the student will learn and discover many fact and information about many thing in the life . now thay may learn about thing that they never though about which-in my opinion-will add to thier knowledge alot . there are many study done recently to know if other subject being taken by the student outside their specialized area may upgrade their general scors in the exam and improve their understanding in the general scinces . it wa found that those student who took several subject outside their specialized area they do better in their final exam . however , we should not be very opitimistic about this . there are still many academic research belive the opposit . some of them think-from their experince - that taking subject from outside the specialized area bring undesired effect . it wa reported that some student who took subject that are directly related to their sepciliaty are not giveing enough attention to their major course and actualy they are not concentrating and , therfore , they waste their time and above all extra subject add nothinhg to their knowledge . moreover , some academic principle are currently revising this issue in the university and trying to come to a sort of strategy whether to keep the door open for any student to take broaden his/her knowledge or put some restriction on it . in my opinion , if the student take what ewver subject outside his/her speciality this wo n't bring bad at any how . in fact this will increase the the general information about many thing in the life . in conclusion - and based on my own experince - student should be always encouraged to take subject from in and outside their area of speciality , but i also feel that more study should be conducted to know the exact effect of taking many subject on the final perfomance and knowledge of the student .
