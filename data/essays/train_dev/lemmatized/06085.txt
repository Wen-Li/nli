although some may believe young people nowadays give plenty of time helping out their community , i believe they do not . there are two main reason : their attitude and lack of time . first of all , young people nowadays do not have the attitude or motivation to help out their community a they believe it ha no benefit on them . these young people believe they do not need to help out their community a they believe other people will do it instead of them or it simply a waste of time . i believe they do not understand the moral of helping the community in need . furthermore , young people nowadays are a lot lazier than they used to be and so they lack the motive a they consider helping the community will be '' work '' , and a we all know , young people tend to dislike work a it is not enjoyable . this motive is probably influenced from school work which is more of a requirement rather than a choice . secondly , the fact the world is becoming more competitive and also a lot more interesting , youngster are becoming more involved in other activity and their study rather than contributing towards their community . these young people may have objective such a going to the best university or simply enjoying life by relaxing , and in my personal experience , i have never come across a young individual who actually want to give their time to help their community . as a result , a young people prefer to spend their time in a different way , there are very little that feel they should help out their community . in conclusion , a young people are not tempted to help the community a it is not enjoyable and the fact they have better , perhaps more important thing that must be done , young people nowadays do not give enough time nor effort to helping their community .
