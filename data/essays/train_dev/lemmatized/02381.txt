a broad knowledge of many academic subject is surely useful and to a certain point also necessary . however , i do not think it is better than a specialization to a certain field . i think a mixture of both point is the best way . in other word , a trade-off between broad and specialized knowledge is necessary nowadays . the basis of a broad knowledge is already made in school . all the child become the same eduction and have to pas the same test . by doing so , the student are prepared for different future scenario in life and they also become an overall picture about the world . for example , the student at school do not only learn math and language , but also biology , chemistry , histroy etc . . thus they get a good understanding about the relation in their environment . consequently , a broad knowledge is very important and also necessary . on the other hand , the information input increase with the age . hence , after a certain stage in life a human being is not able to gain all available information . additionally , each job requires specialized knowledge . consequently , a person ha to choose which information is more important and useful for his future life . for example , after school a student ha to decided what he want to do with his life and he ha to answer several question . what kind of job i want to do ? what are my main interest ? to sum up , i think that it is import to have both , broad and specialized knowledge . the broad one to get a overall picture of the world and to understand it important relation . the specialized knowledge is necessary and not le important .
