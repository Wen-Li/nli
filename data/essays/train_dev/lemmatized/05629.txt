i 'm of the opinion that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their community . firstly , the activity most of the youngster do are chatting on phone , surfing information , hanging out with friend , going out for movie , restaurant and the list go on . they do not even give enough time for their study too . the activity they do will not fetch them anything worthful . their psychology can be understood easily . all of them think in the same way . they like to play game and want to enjoy their teenage life by not taking any responsibility . instead of spending time on watching movie one can utilise the same for a good cause . students in primary school are made to participate in such program so that they will follow the same later on . for example many of the school in my city participated in a program called `` janmabhoomi '' a program meant for keeping the city clean and green . but these activity are not followed later by most of the student . they become reluctant towards doing these activity . secondly , they do not show active participation in community activity like keeping it clean and green , improving the existing condition of the society and working for the welfare of the community . they are the one who can improve the standard of living of the community . i think every teenager should take the responsibility of helping their community . in sum , i would like to reiterate myself that youngster should give out time to helping their community .
