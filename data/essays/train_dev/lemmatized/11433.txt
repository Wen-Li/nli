for our grandmother it wa the flyer , for our parent it wa the television and for u it is almost everywhere we exist . advertisements are covering more and more space in our life ; billboard , internet , building or even people can be holder for advertisement . yet , the question is whether or not we are being treated candidly about the product the advertisement represents . indeed , we are often equivocated by ad in the sense that flawed or deficient quality of a product can be well concealed whereas the supreme quality are underscored perfectly in an ad thanks to the extreme communication skill of advertiser . one could present a computer program which ha the ability to perform a specific task , say converting one file to another , and he may never mention how slow it performs it duty . from my experience , i could show the test center in which i am taking toefl a a paradigm for this situation . it is quite a well known and respectable company . when one enters through it door , he is dazzled by the ad everywhere claiming how superior the company is . yet , their computer have shown a lot of malfunction before the test . nonetheless , too much of cynicism is not correct . one could present many situation similar to mine , but that doe n't necessarily mean that we are always misled by ad . in conclusion , i believe that ad do make product seem much better but some product can be really better . therefore it is better to keep a piece of optimism inside .
