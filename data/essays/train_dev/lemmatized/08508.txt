i agree with the statement that it 's better to have a broad knowledge of many academic subject than to specialize in one specific subject . when we look around u , we can easily see that people we define a `` successful '' are generally the one who have and eclectic knowledge on subject . as a high school senior who is in the process of apllying to college , i 've realized the importance of being a well-rounded person even . colleges do n't just want kid who have great sat verbal score ; you have to get a high score on the math section of the test a well . if you want to guarantee your spot in the admission , you better be ready to take a shot on the sat subject test . the people who earn the most money , according to some survey , are bio-medical enginners . have you ever thought why ? they not specialize on medical subject but also are expert on engineering . or even doctor . it 's not enough for them to specialize on biology , or anatomy ; they have to learn a wide range of subject of they want to become successful in their profession . also if you have a wider knowledge on thing , you can have more option to choose from in your life . the human brain never fails to amaze me . i 've experienced that a you put more knowledge into your brain , it just start wanting to absorb more and more knowledge . it never get enough . even if one belief that specializing in one specific subject is better , they should start by trying to gain a broad knowlede on thing , because it will make it easier for their brain to understand . everything happening in this world is related to another somehow . it is hard to specialize in physic , for example , if you do n't have much of a knowledge in mathematics ; which make me start to think that it is `` necessary '' to have a broad knowledge of many subject `` even if '' you want to specialize in one subject .
