i disagree with the statement . i traveled around canada by myself . it wa a bus travel for a month . it wa a great experience for me . i had a lot of chance to talk local people . i could go whereever i wanted to go . at the begining of the trip , i wa nervouse about travering alone . because i had never traveled alone even in japan and i did not have much information about city where i would go . of course , i did not have any friend there . however , after a few day i became not feel lonly at all . i met and talked a lot of people . i wa not alon at all . i had to ask people where i wa on a map or how to get a hotel which i would stay the night . and also many people talked me where i would go or where i am from . eveyone who i talked were very kind to me . some of them drove me around their home town for me . they were real tour guide . they knew very well about their home town and i could tast their real life style . i remember nice people more than beautiful building . a town look more beautiful when people who live there are nice . at a famouse spot , usually there are some tour which provied by local government or an organisation . they are good enough to get the information about the spot . when we travel with a group , we tend to talk the member of the group all the trip and we do not have time to talk with local people , which miss wonderful part of a trip . when we travel alone , we have to take a responsivirity for everything by ourselves , so we become more careful . of couse , we have to make sure not to go around at night , to have our passport all the time and so on . from my experience , i think that we can feel a town more close , when we travel alone . so i disagree with the statement .
