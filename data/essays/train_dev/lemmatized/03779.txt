i disagree with the statement that `` in twenty years there will a fewer cars in use than there are today '' i strongly belive that the number of car that are used will definetly increase but not decrease in any sence . i support my argument by using the following idea the no of cart that are being used is incresing day by day & it will continue to increse in the future also because the nessity of the car is more , nower day the temparature is incresing day by day and travelling on two wheeler involves more risk when compared to thecars . many people can afford to buy a car nower day with the improvement of bank loan and many other factor . the usage of car in next twenty will not decrease because even if the natural resourses are getting exhausted people will find out an altrnative over come the problem like developing the solar car which run by using the solar energy . even if the natural resource get exhausted it will definetlu not happen in the next twenty year . nower day the battery runned car are invented , research and development is being made to improve the technology and after twenty year it definetly improoved a lot . it really hard to immagine the world with out car , since they are really important to people in many way . it hard travell on a two wheeler when compared to the car . in the comming twenty year there will a decrease in the two wheeler but in the four wheeler like the car . some car can be driven using natural gas there fore there is no problem that the petrol or the diesel will get exhausted and the car will stop working . the technology used in the car is also developing day by day there fore more sophisticated , more comfortable , more economic , le fuel consuming car will be developed which make life more easy . i sum , the number of car used will definetly increase due the improved technology & need of the people . acoording to the statistic from a decade the the usage of the car ha been increasing and not decreasing , the proof is just take a look at the road in the city . the growth rate in usage of car will increase but not not decrease .
