the question is being asked if the idea and concept are more important for the student than learning fact . this is very important issue about the education because the student have to know every thing about the life and the world from their school and teacher and their educational book , i think the education is kind of curiosity that ha to give the student all what they need . in my opinion , that the school a well a the parent have to give the student the opportunity to learn every thing in this world by it fact and the idea and the concept , because some time if you do n't have any information about the real fact you ca n't get to any point of the concept that you looking for . for instance what wa thinking about the earth that is revolve around the sun . if this issue is not able to be learn at school , no one can imagine how thing can revolve around each other by gravity . additionally , teaching fact to the student let them ask more question about that issue may lead them to understant and may lead them to figure out more concept in the entire world , like if the student been taught that , not just because you see the entire scene in front of you flat that mean the earth is flat . the earth is round not flat . and what you just seen is according the angle of your scene . so these fact will be in the mind of the student and will never forget it period , and the student will think with similar issue that make that idea or concept in the bottom of their mind and heart . in conclusion , i mentioned point that seem to be important to the student to understand idea and concept a well a the learn the fact in order to know every thing about the world that we live in
