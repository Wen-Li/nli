for an estudent , it 's important to learn fact and also to undestand idea and concept . but , i totaly agree with the statement that is more important to student to understand the concept , than is for the to learn the fact . i think this way , mainly because by understanting the concept and idea , you are really getting the basis of knowlege ( you can go to the deep of it ) . it 's the only way to go to the bottom on the issue . if you just learn a memorize the fact ( and leave the undestanding of concept behind ) , you wo n't be able to innovate . i think fact are the starting point . by revising and questioning those fact and working based on them , knowing their cause and effect is the key . the only way to do this , is by the understanting of the idea and concept that lead to those fact . in other word , if you just learn the fact and do n't know where the came from , you wo n't be a complete all-arround student , just memorizing machine . the great human mind over the course of history , have been well knowned for understanding the idea they worked on . albert einstein once said : `` you realy do n't know something , until you 're able to explaining it to your grandmother ... '' , meaning that the only way teach something in a way anyone can follow , is putting it in simple form . the way to achive this , is by dominating the concept and idea well ( knowing where they come from , so you can put it in different word ) . try to picture einstin explaning to his grandmother one of his teories , just giving her the fact . .. in resume , undestanding the idea and concept ( what they really mean , where they come from , ect . ) is by far more important tha just learning the fact . facts are important , but no
