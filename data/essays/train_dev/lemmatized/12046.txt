as we know every community wa builded by their people . people such old person or young person work together to make great nation and provide good life . in my opinion , i dont agree with the following statement `` young people nowdays do not give enough time to helping thier community '' . becouse the most important role in creating any powerful nation is her young people . becouse they have the powerful and young mind to keep developing it . nation that give the hand and support for it young people we found it aproud of it acheviments . young people are participate in different side of coumminty . they work in teaching , engineering , medicene , and hand craft to provide the good environment of raising new generation of young people . these new generation will continue carrying the future of the nation and it development . as we see today , in lebanon were the war is killing all people and destroying building . young people stand thier to help their nation in hospital and in place war arrive to it . and to share them their pain and fear . while other young people are standing to defend their land from this war and it result . young people give their life for the community and the nation should be the example and the leader for all young people around the world . finaly , nation and community are measured by thier young people and their achivements . more powerful young people , more powerful nation it is an easy eqaution have just two variable . and the young people who raised on old people hand continue to carry the message for all generation come after .
