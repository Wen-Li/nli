i totally agree with the given statement `` it is more important for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact '' . facts are there to remain , but the knowledge would create direction for a new creation or new development and a new mindset . as a student is young and ha lot of capability to think , he ha to capability to invent . inventions happen where there is complete knowledge and understanding of what you are thinking of . once the student understands the idea and concept , he start visualizing them . the understanding of one idea or concept would lead to understanding many more concept , because everyting is so inter related . the idea would give the student a direction in which he can think and develop better idea . he ha the authority over the subject and ozzes with confidence and make him a wise person . if i were to compare two people who have read a particular theory and one of them , say person ` a ' ha thouroughly understood the whole concept and person ` b ' ha not understood the theory at all but ha mugged the whole theory , then the person ` b ' according to me is no le than a computer , know everything but ha no knowledge whatsover a to what he ha read . and person ` a ' is human , the most intelligent animal . person ` b ' can not put into utilization what he ha read , just like how a computer can do nothing on itself , because he ha not understood anything whereas , since person ` a ' ha understood the concept he can research and develop in that area . facts are important but understanding the idea and concept is most important .
