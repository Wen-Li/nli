the car , actually , are one of most important issue in my country . one part of the population think that reduction is impossible . nevertheless , it will be necessary to reduce the traffic because of the pollution , traffic accident and the rise of the gas . however it will be realistic if only public transport is improved . pollution is a enormous probleme on earth . we know exactly that car have got a big responsibility . car accident cause plenty of death and hurt . alcohol and speed are principally involved . the price of the gas ha been edging up for a long time . it certainely will continu . however , the regulation will be effective only if public transport is improved . we have to provide to the population an effective subway , railroad , reliable and not too expensive . this represent a challenge . but in regard of the pollution , accident and the price , this will be very attractive only if public transport is improved .
