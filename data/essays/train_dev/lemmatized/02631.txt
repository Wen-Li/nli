in my opinion , in twenty year , it is more likely to find a larger number of car on road than we see today . cars which were a luxury a few decade back , have become more of a necessity today . as more and more job oppurtuniies are being made available to the people , standard of living are definitely on a rise . this is the case , specially in the developing nation , a the economy are growing . with more money , more number of people would be able to afford car and thus , be using them . also , most of the family which are financially well off , have more than one car for the family . typically , each member of the family owns a car of his own , a soon a he or she can drive one . this trend seems to be catching up , lately . moreover , with the rise in population , we need more and more land to live on . this ha resulted in reclaiming area , which were not in use before . thus city a becoming bigger and bigger , with their suburb getting densly populated . as people prefer to stay in the suburb , for reason like , cheaper resourses , more area etc. , most of the major office are still found in the main city . this requires , people to commute long distance . travelling by public transport is not an idea a lot of people consider , when they have a car at home . thus , the use of car is increasing further . with advanced technology , many car company are coming with cheaper and more affordable model of car . such car , since they need lesser maintanance , have contributed to the increased number of car that we see on the road today . atleast for the next decade or two , this seems to be a possible trend . also , traffic problem have been often associated with the increase in the number of car on the road . to avoid this , many company have also come up with two-seater model . these car which are small , make manoevering in the crowded street a little easier . in the year to come , we can definitely expect to see a lot more of these car , flooding the street . thus , in the next twenty year , the number of car in use , are most likely be higher than what it is today . it is a bad news , considering the fuel shortage that is expected in the very near future and not to forget the pollution that so much traffic would eventually cause . we need to be prepared to handle it or the governement need introduce law to control it effect , before it too late .
