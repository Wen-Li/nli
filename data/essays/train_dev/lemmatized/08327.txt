i do not agree with the statement that there will be fewer car in use in twenty year than there are today . there are several reason for thinking so . globally speaking , the transportation medium is not changing for a long period of time . we have car , airplane , bicycle , motorcycle , train ( above an under ground ) , ship for providing different mean of transport . cars are the vehicle that are commonly used for private transportation . they provide people privacy during their journey everywhere and privacy is something that man want to have especially during transport . also there are other social criterias that force the usage of car . the first thing to mention is that it give it owner a social state . owning a car mean a higher standard against the one that ca n't afford a car . so it 's in fact a sign of wealth in most of the world . the use of the car is not directly related to the purpose , - transportation - there are many other factor . one of the biggest factor is the car manufacturer . car manufacturing play a big role in the macro-economy . if the manufacturer are still making car , then someone should be there to buy and use it . but if the manufacturer can find a different way of gaining money , like manufacturing sci-fi vehicle that can be used instead of car then the number of the car that are going to be used in the future will be fewer that the amount we use today . one other reason that we will not be able to help ourselves using car is that there is still huge amount of resource around the world . most of the car today are running with gas , and the earth still ha n't run out of it yet . maybe in the future when the gas resource will dry and new kind of energy will be used in different type of wehicles . to summarize , there should be certain fact in order to predict that the usage of car will fade out in twenty year . but we do n't have those fact now .
