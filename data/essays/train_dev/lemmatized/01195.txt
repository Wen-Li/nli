i think that trying new thing and taking risk is not necessarily of condition to be successfull but that it is a condition to get out of mass . i think people doing good work should be recognised for it and have success in their carrer even if ther do n't do anything new . i know a small shop where the man repair show and bag . the man is doing very good work at a very reasonable price . it is nothing special but the quality of it < s wor is known in the town and he always have client . however , the man is neither very rich or very famous . if this is the kind of success one target , then i think the person must absolutely try new thing and take risk to distinguish from the other people . among the people we remember the more are the inventor and discoverer . they often try a lot of thing before doing the iinvention that made the famous .
