i would say , that society definitly need to have a broden academic knowledge a much a possible in different subject . let 's take an architect a an example , to make my point . an architect should know a little bit of literatur , art and biology , in order to create a better housing schema . because , he doe not build for himself , or for other architect , he builts for people with totally different interest , and living way . in the other hand , i think that people should also specialize in only one topic , but only after they get a global view of the world 's chance and opportunity . what i think what the best method could be , is when you get an overview of the possibility of the academic ( and no academic ) subject , and after that , you can decide what fit you better , so in the future , you can not only improve your skill to the maximum , but a well be happy . in the spezialsation you get deeper knowledge , so your skill will potentially grow . let 's get back to the example of the architect , he ca n't definitly make the whole buildin by his own , so after he search for the quality of the surroundings , research about the urban spatial situation , and get a good solution to plan , he would need , architect that are specialized in sort of thing , like construction , fassade , context , enviorement , etc. architect , which profundize , in those program . but they could never work toghether , when they did n't have an overview of the situation . in my opinion , a doctor , or a music teacher , that doe n't know something about geography , or bussiness admistration , is not able to respond to our actual world , which is a global world , where you have to act promptly with grat idea to big problem an conflict , that are everywhere . finally , if a persone just get inside a box without looking forward in order to broaden his horizon , is a person that doe n't have dream .
