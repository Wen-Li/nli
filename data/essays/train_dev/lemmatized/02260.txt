young people could be the most encouraged member of a community but not all are the same kind of person . i grew up in a small town with approximately 36000 inhabitant . i attended a youth club that wa leaded by the church . we did a lot of thing for our community . first , we meet to discus problem in our city . every wendsday there is a discussing round about current problem , e.g. about vandalism in our old town . moreover we organize party and event where we collecte money for different program to help other people . it is a very good feeling to have fun on a party and at the same time helping others . we also make trip to help underpreviledged people to renew their house . these are some example of our community work and i hope that they show why i am disagreeing with the statement . but i also know that such a community work is not generell . i think especially in big city it is a great problem that young people do not spend enough time to helping their community . but i think this is quite normal . they are not a closely connected to their community a i am . i suppose that they even do not have the chance to be directly involved . there are to many problem in big city that hardly can be solved by youth . but i also believe that many young people are not interested in their community because they only think about their own wish and problem . they are not able to connect these two thing . i mean own problem and community problem . i think they often stand closely together . i would summarize that this is a difficult problem which is not easy to solve but i think that not all young people are lazy like it is maintained from many adult . youth club event help elder people
