since i came to the united sttes , i 've been surprised how impact the us commercial . sometimes they make me laugh and shocked . also , i 've doubted the exaggerated information . in my view , there are a lot of advertisement that doe have a lot of propaganda for the following reason . first of all , there are business competition in order to survive company . because of a balance between demand and supply , company have to make the catchy and striking advertisement for public . the milk that i used to drink is the good example here . i refered the milk because of containing the healthy organic gredients . however , inspector of the government just recently found out that there had been no organic material in the milk . there are a lot of kind of milk , healthy one or cheaper one , local , or soy milk . most people decide what to buy by checking a package because they can not distinguishs the best one for them . as a result , the package are the all about the material themselves . secondly , people have changed new tendency all the time . therefore , company need to fix in order to adjust the changed the fashion . for example , these day , people start to care about healthy food . companies pull the customer or comsumers in the company ' business . however , some company can not change , so they put a fake information , such a 100 percent of nature . as you can see , there are some reasones that business convey extra information to the buyer . the goverment need to check company in order to protect safe and reliable advertisemants for the consumer .
