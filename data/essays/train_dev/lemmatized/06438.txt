young people think that they can enjoy their life more than the older one , but in my opinion i think older people can enjoy their life even more if they want to . sometimes you see a 100 old man or a woman that can talk like a 20 year old man . this is related to the feeling and to the mind . for example , if a 20 year old man always nagging about his life and always complaining about life and problem and never stop a moment to think and ask himself : is life really worth it ?? am i really sick or thats just in my mind ? he will always feel sick if thats what wa in his mind . accepting your life a it is is a treature and most people these day do n't have it ! there is a question that how can the older men enjoy their life ? to answer this question we should ask ourselfs first what are the pleasure in life ?? i mean it depends on each person . some people think of party and calaberating all day long . others find pleasure in their food . what can he eat on the next meal ? traveling is a pleasure for some people . they travel all around the world to discover more place and meet new people . others just find their pleasure sitting home watching tv all day . so , back to our question : what can be the pleasure of an old man ? you ca n't say really it depends on his personality , but maybe in my opinion he just love to sit home with his family doing many stuff that we see it a silly stuff but it really mater for him , like drinking tea with his son and discussing some thing . finally , you can be young in your heart no matter what your age is .
