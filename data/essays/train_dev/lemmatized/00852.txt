historically , people have aquired knowledge in a broad general way while they are young and are growing up , and that knowledge usually narrow down to something more specific when high school end and college begin . some people think it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subject while other people believe that one should specialize in one specific subject . in my view , attaining knowledge of various academic subject make for a more disperse and unfocused way of life . firstly , learning about many thing is something that come naturally in life . as we live our every day experience we learn different thing , but in contrast , what we choose to follow a a career should be the unique subject that interest u the most to a point of dedicating a great part of our life to it . during our academic year where we learn about a trade or a specific way something is done which we will then apply in real life to better our way of living , get the thing we want for ourselves or create new system for the future in the society we live in , we should strictly stick to one subject with it adjacent issue and not to many academic subject that would make u loose focus and in the end not relate to anything at all . secondly , learning about only one subject will make u waist a lot le energy , thus making u advance at a quicker pace towards our goal and not making u loose interest on the way . moreover , there are very few people in history who have dedicated their life to many thing , like for example leonardo da vinci , who wa an overall inventor , artist , investigator and doctor , but we can also say that he wa really a eye-opener in a time where people needed to know and discover many thing about the world they lived in . nowadays , with the internet and what ha become a visual era where the sens are constantly bombarded with information about our environment and the world we live in , the more important it is that we stey focused on one thing at a time instead of many . in conclusion , i think it is much better to specialize in one specific academic subject than many different one because it make one concentrate more on what is personally important and therefore let one view what is around in a different and better way .
