the issue is a complex and though provocking issue that merit a closer look . some people believe that in the future there will be le car in use than they are today , whreas others oppose this oppinion and support that there will be more car than today . the latter position is certainly the stronger of the two and would be expected in detail . first and foremost , the poor country will develop themselves . for instance , they will create road , will sophicate themselves . because the population will earn more money and the development of this country , the population will use car . for example i went in marocco and it is very amazing to see how the development of the country ha influenced the number of car in the country . besides being important for the development of the poor country , it is also important for the pollution . we all know that car are not good for the nature because they polluate it . but , a new oil wa dicovered and will le poluate than the older . two day ago , the french government annouced that we will use it soon and that it will be le expensive than the older . so it will be very good because you will not be a real danger for the nature and you will spend le money by driving . the position i support is the best because the car will stay usefull and the public transport will not be like the car . for example if you want to give a present to someone , you just have to put it in the case of your car whereas , if you would use public transport , you would have to bring it everywhere during all the day and to walk with it , it is not very usefull . after examing the above example , it is obvious that this indeed the stronger position . when we took into account the next development of the poor country , the new oil and the usefullness of the car , it is clear that we must agree with the following statement : in twenty year there will be more car in use than there are today .
