some people belive that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide . others belive the best way to travel is on your own . both opinion have it adventages and disadventages actually . i agree with the second opinion . to me , traveling on your own is much better . first of all , when you travel on your own , you are free to go wherever you like . you can design your own tour according to your liking and interest . you can manage your time better . that will give you the opportunity to spend more time on the place you like better . another benefit to traveling on your own is that you can manage your spending according to your budget . in a group , the place you will visit are determined by the tour guide , and unfortunately , you can not change it . traveling in a group led by a tour guide cost a certain amount of money , which probably would cost you le if you plan it yourself . you should follow the tour guide and go the restaurant the guide determines a opposed to getting your own food . for example , my husband and i planned an `` interrail '' trip in europe couple year ago . it wa all on our own . we planned in advance where , when , how , for how long we would go . it wa more fun to explore the place on our own since we hand the chance to interact with local people in their regular daily life . we made friend too . as a result , i strongly support the idea of travaling on your own . you have more freedom , you interact with people and you make friend .
