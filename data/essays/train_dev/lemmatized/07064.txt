travelling ha become part of our living such a eating , drinking , exercising etc . . but why do people travel a lot nowadays ? firsfthe reason why people are willing to travel is to be open to other culture and tradition , they can also meet other people from a different ethnic background or religion in order to exchange new idea and form opinion from all that or simply take a short period of time to relax and that is called ` vacation ' . in fact , when we decide to travel , we usually need someone to lead u otherwise we 'll get lost and be deceived , moreover we might also find it really tiring and fruitless since everything is new to u we need some time to get accustomed to that new country . on the one hand , we can buy guiding book and map and on the other hand we can hire a tour guide . which one of the above mean is effective ? in my opinion , a tour guide is necessary because he can be really helpful by making u visiting the most interesting spot or the famous one and it 's easier of course a we wo n't to rent a car or look for taxi everytime we need to visit a new place . moreover , he 'll be well acquainted to his native country and tell u additional thing that sometimes are n't revealed in book and we can ask him all the question we would like to ask whereas by using a book , we do n't get really satisfied with the result and it doe n't all that huge amount of information given by that guide . another interesting point is the reason why people prefer travelling by group instead of travelling alone is because they just want to enjoy their time and leave some souvenir of that trip . at last , according to my experience , i would suggest that the best way of travelling would be in group and guided by a tour .
