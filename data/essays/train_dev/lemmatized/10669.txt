i agree that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their community . there are three reason in my opinion which led to the situation . first , there are too many amusing activity to do . new high-tech toy and recreation are being introduced to the teenager and keeping them stick on those thing . big company us strong advertisement and free trail to make sure the potential consumer will not do anything else but spending time on the product . moreover , interacting with friend take most of young people 's time . all of these activity occupied every minute of them . second , the education from young people 's parent doe not give them the idea . to live in a competetive world , child are taught to learn knowledge a much a they can and give attention to other thing a le a they can . cram school is always the first and only choice for young people to hang around . they are told to keep their hand from thing that are helpless to their grade . due to this twisted concept , young people are not interested in community activity . third , the medium broadcast negative example which stop young people from taking action . people refuse to give time helping their community because of bad news . a crazy person might hurt an unexperienced teenager while asking for help . teenagers can be in trouble because their lack of experience on helping the community . above all , it is true that young people do not give enough time to helping their community . by observing those who live around , we can find out that young people will help if the negative condition are removed . creating a nice and friendly environment for teenager to open their mind will be the best way to let them give more time on community activity .
