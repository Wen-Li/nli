i do agree with that statment because an advertisement is all about baying a product what ever it is , so the advertiser ha to show the positve aspect about the product and hide the negative aspect of it ending with an advertisement about a product that is much better than the product it self , not to mention that the advertiser is get his pay check when the advertisment is really good and help a lot selling that product . first , the advertisor 's job is to help the murchent who is selling that product to enhance his selling rate and one of the method to do that is to show the people all the positive and hide all the negative of that product for example , when advertising for a car , the advertisor show the people who is that car beautiful and smooth looking and on the other hand she/he would hide a fact such a that car is a high gas consuming one . another thing is that the advertisor ha the motive to cheat and try to make a great advertisment out of any product even if it wa not , because when the process of advertising function very well the advertisment bussiness will flourish and the advertiser will be able to ask for higher price . a a result of what ha been said i think that the whole idea of advertising plus all the element that interfear with the advertisment business end up having an advertisment of a product that is really more than fair for that product .
