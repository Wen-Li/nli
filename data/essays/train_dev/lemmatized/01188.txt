i agree with this statement . successful always come from trying and taking risk . people in the world all knew that if you want to become successful , you got to try . you may learn a great experience while you are trying new thing . there might have something that you were afraid of and never want to try at all . however by an accident you got to do this thing and you actually did it , this will give you encourae and you will feel very proud of yourself . this is how successful work . those people ca n't become successful is because they do n't want to try , everythings just stay the same , always do the thing that they already know how to do well . new thing always let you grow up , if people rather stay the same they wo n't grow at all . i wa a very good example that rather try new thing instead of do thing that i already know how to do well . when i wa young , i do n't know how to ride bicycle , and i wa afraid of it . however i keep telling myself that `` if you wo n't try , you will never knew how to ride a bicycle . '' and at first it wa very horrible , i always fall down and get hurt . although i wa not very good , i still try the new thing and i knew that i could become better and better . because of this thought and persverience , in the end i know how to ride a bicycle . form my example we can see the different between try new thing and stay the same . we always afraid new thing taht we did not know about it . but think about it , if you try the new thing you will learn a new experience and you might like it after you try , so do n't just stay the same , try new thing .
