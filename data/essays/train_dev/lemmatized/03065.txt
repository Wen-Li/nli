i do not think that there will be fewer car in use than there are today . there are two main reason to support my oppinions . when people thnk about future of the car , many of they might be think about the oil problem . actually oil price is geeting higher and higher in thesis day and some analysits say that all the oil we have now will be gone next 50 year . but we can not ignore about ability of the new technology . not only japanse car company but also all of the world company are fascinating to creat new car which is not depend on oil enagy . soura car and car running by the power of hydrogion . and aols new enagy is realized now . for example in brazil they get the enagy from the plant . other reason is that we are so depend on car life . weuse car every day . we ca n't live without car . especially united states , country is too learge so that other trnsportation is not be devepoed enough . in jaapan people are also depend on car life . to tell the truth , leg of human are car . so we will never be able to say good bay to the car . i think it 's sad thing that we are so depend on car life . but i also think we can creat much better car to u and to the environment after twenty year . so that i think there will be not fewer car in use than there are today . i think it can be increased .
