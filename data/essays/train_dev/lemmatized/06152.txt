in our world , advertisement are maybe everywhere , and therefore our life are strongly influenced by this form of communication . i think that very often advertisement try to present a product in such a way that it seems better than it really is . this can be done in many way . for example , last year i had to change my car and i saw the commercial of a very cheap and beautiful car at the tv : i suddenly falled in love with it . when i saw this car in my city , i discovered that the appealing of the real car wa very different from the appealing of the car in the commercial , and obiously i changed my opinion about this product . the * real * car wa tiny , and not very pretty . sometimes , commercial triy to ameliorate a product by other method : for example , the advertisement of an expensive product could not speak about the price of this product . or the commercial of an experimental product , could not metion that ( important ! ) fact : in my country , a few year ago , it ha been a case of this type , concerning the sell of a diet drink which were not completely tested . i guess that the strategy of commercial that try to ameliorate a product is logical , in a strictly economical sense . in fact , the purpose of the advertisement is to push a person to buy some product . but , since i am a person , i think that this strategy is cynical and sometimes sordid . i guess that if commericials were made honestly and carefully , then they could become a very useful and quick way to learn about new product . advertisements could be , in this case , a source of information for every person , because they 're everywhere and they 're easy to understand . but if a person know that very often advertisement make a product much better than it really is , then this person could not consider commercial a a source of nice and simple information . this person will be diffident , and - a an intelligent person - he/she will not be too much influenced by commercial .
