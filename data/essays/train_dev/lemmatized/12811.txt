i agree with this statement that most advertisement make product seem much better that they really are . we can see many product advertisement like this statement . for example when i watched tv commercial of sandwitch or humbergare , the commercial really make me hungry and i want to eat that product becouse it look very dericious and many vegitables and meet . but if i go to the store i 'll see very different sandwitch or humbergare , those product look more poor than tv commercial . i have disappointed it many time . in concludion , there are many advertisement . some people said that advertisement is very important role for selling . they update advertisement many time for few term . if you want to sell some product a lot and want people to have interest you will make advertisement look good . i can understand this system for selling ; advertisement make product should seem more better than they really are . but i think that they should sell more simillar product to advertisement .
