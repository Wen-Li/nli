i disagree that statment that most advertisement make product seem much better than they really are for several reason . first , when we buy something in the store , we almost read the advertisement about that we are going to buy . then we decide if we should buy or not . if the advertisement about that we are going to buy is good for u , we may buy that . wether we buy something or not is depends on advertisement , so they should not tell a lie . second , if advertisement use the information that seem much better than they really are , and consumer buy and use that stuff , it can be harmful for consumer . for example , if advertisement say that this meal doe n't include fat at all although it really include much fat , those who buy that and have regurally can get fat . it is not good for health . finally , if most advertisement make product seem much better than they really are , consumer ca n't believe them and buy anything . it is serious problem . for human can live safety and confortable , advertisement should be honest , i think . for these reason , i think most advertisement should not make produsts seem much better than they really are .
