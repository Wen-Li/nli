i agree with the statment that young poeple enjoy life more than older people do . i have some reason to support my opinion . first , young poeple is more energetic in any kind of activity than older people . second , young poeple ha more chance to study many subject , for example in university or private school . third , young people can make many friend and have many ecperiences in and out of the country . young poeple is more energetic in many activity than old people . in general , old people ha a lot of money to spend compared with young poeple especially those still studing in high school or university . although old people might be able to get pension for sending money , they are too old to go out and do some activity in community . or simply , they are too busy to take care the family or house . young poeple is very active in many kind of activity . they join a tennis club , go to language school and do some volunteer work . if young people do n't have money , they normally earn money from part-time job . young poeple ha more chance to study many subject , for example in university or private school . in japan , when you want to study in university , you have age limitation to be university student . it is also said that when you are young , it is more chance to remembrer and study well . young people can make many friend and have many experience in and out of country . young people ha more good access to meet many people . you can go to abroad , you can have good experience . but when you get old , you tend to be stay home and watch tv whole day . from above reason , i agree with the satement that young poeple enjoy life more than old people do .
