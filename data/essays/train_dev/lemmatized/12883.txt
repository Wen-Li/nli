what is advertisement ? you developed a great product ( in your opinion ) and you want to promote it . that is the basic fact of advertisement . a good marketing specialist would do it aida-style . aida is a process in marketing . it includes the following step : attention - interest - desire - action . the first point is getting your attention . therefor he must do something special like a big presentation or something else like a campaign ( e . on did something like that . it wa everywhere in the medium and no one knew it ) . if he got the attention , the interest must be build up . the following step is : advertisement . in advertisement he want to show u that product from it best side . he count up all positive skill and gimmick . he show anything in the product that is better than other product and so on . the next phase is building a desire for your product . best example for something like that is apple , who made a fashion brand out of ipod . in the last step it is up to you : you have to buy the product . sounds good so far . the problem is that there is not only one company and one product , there an almost uncountable amount of company and product and anyone want to sell their product . in some market , where there is a hard competition , there is more promise made that can kept . this lead to a bad image , because if you buy an expensive product and it is working for only a few week , you are not a happy customer . if the number of unhappy customer grows , you will be soon a unhappy company . a few year ago advertising played not the role a it doe today . the company realized that their image depends from their product . they invest very much to make their product the best on the market , so that they can show u , that it is the best product .
