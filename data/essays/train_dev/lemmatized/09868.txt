broad view of all the acedamic subject give you an overview of all subject . it help the person decide which subject he is really interested in . it help him in choosing his career . however for higher study one should always specialize in one subject . i believe that specialization in a specific field is better than to have broad knowledge of many acedemic subject . firstly specializing in a particuar subject give you an in-depth understanding of the subject . it help in understanding of the finer detail . careers can be built in that particular subject of interest . like doctor do master in a particular field eg : cardiology , pathology etc . then they can treat patient having particular disorder like the cardiologist treating heart patient . they can concentrate on one thing and really become a pro at that . this help both the patient and doctor . secondly specializing give an in-depth knowledge ofthe subject . one can reasearch an a particularly interesting topic and probably invent something in it . it give an added edge to the person . moreover it develops the person 's interest into it . like after learning about networking it really increased my interest in the different type of protocol of networking etc . if given a chance i would really like to work in that field . i feel that it is necessary to have many subject at the beginning during the undergraduate year where one is not sure about his or her own interest . learning all subject would help one decide their subject of interest in which they would like to have a career . however once decided it is better to do specialization in one particular subject of interest . thus it is necessary to do aspecialization in one subject of interest .
