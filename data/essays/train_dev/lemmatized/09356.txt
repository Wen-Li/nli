although there are more and more tour agency today and more and more people are willing to be guided in a travel , i prefer to travel by myself , not in a group . the first thing i should consider when travelling in a group is that i can not arrange all the thing by myself . that is , when travelling in a group , i should follow the certain routine and the certein time table . i will be asked to follow the schedule step by step . this make me feel that i 'm a little baby who can not control itself . but when travelling by myself . i make my own plan according to my own taste . i do n't need to rush in hour from one place to another . there is a good chance that i can make my own decision . second , more and more tour guide have some business relationship with the merchant in some certain area . that is , the guide will instigate the visitor to buy the product in the local area . and the guide will get some benefit a well a the merchant if the visitor buy the product because the guide and the merchant have some contract . the guide ' behavior can really mislead some visitor today . it is more likely for the tourist to make some unwise choice and to buy some product unneccessary when led by a guide . when travelling alone , i can make more intelligent choice when deciding which to buy and which not to buy . at last , travelling alone is a good experience for me . and i always have a desire to travel alone around this world , just like many youth . when travelling alone , i will schedule all the thing by myself , from making a travel plan to booking the ticket . i think it is a necessary process in one 's life to grow up . in fact , although i 'm still seventeen , i have already traveled alone to many different province in my country , even to hong kong . each time i finished these trip , i feel that i 'm more mature than before and i have gained more experience . my parent also think that if a person can not do something individually , he or she will not be an adult . in my opinion , travelling alone is a process for me to gain experience . so , i would rather to travel alone , not travelling in a group by a tour guide because i 'm that kind of person who is very independent .
