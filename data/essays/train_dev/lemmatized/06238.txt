there are a lot of problem which the great amount of car cause nowadays : traffic jam , pollution , etc . hopefully , some say that in twenty year there will be fewer car in use than there are now . of course , there are others who maintain even after more than twenty year , car are not going to decrease . in my opinion , there will be fewer car in twenty year in that due to rapidly growing technology , there will be some device which are going to replace car . firstly , a you know , there are many airplane which produce le pollution than car per person . they become more and more comfortable to take and cheaper . people are going to use flight rahter than taking their own car sooner or later . this will , at last , reduces the number of car . for the second thing , oil and gas which car need to work , are decreasing in quantity . accordingly , they are really expensive now and never stop increasing . technologists and scientist , somehow , need to develop other vehicle which just need natural resource . those vehicle will replace car and bring the earth back to the clean condition . above all , the goverments all over the world need to make a strict bill which eventually reduces car to reduce pollution . if they do n't , this world are going to be covered only by air pollution . following survey done recently , it is said that many country require their citizen to take public transportation , not their car . in summary , i believe people who use car are going to decrease steadily for various reason . there will be great vehicle with making almost no pollution soon because people in the world including technology expert and scientist , are concerned about the pollution , and they are doing thier best to make better and cleaner vehicle . as flight are getting cheaper , many people start to use them instead of using car .
