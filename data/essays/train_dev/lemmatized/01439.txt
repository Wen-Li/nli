it 's a difficult question , but i disagree the idea of traveling in a group led by a tour guide . there are two reason that i disagree with this idea . first reason is about money . if i go to england by the package tour , i would have to pay a lot of money . maybe i will need pay 200,000 yen at least in case of staying london in three day . someone think that paying a lot of money for trip is nutural , because we buy the safty at the same time . however , i 'm a student now and i ca n't earn a lot of money , so i will go on a trip by myself . in feburary , i went to england with my friend . i bought bording pas by myself and l also booked the hotel by internet by my self . it 's easy for me to make a contract . second reason is about the time . if i go on a trip led by a tour guide , i would be able to go to some famous place of sightseeing . however , i must keep the time . i heard that there is n't enough time to enjoy looking at the famous place . it mean that i have to hurry to do something , but i do n't need to hurry if i go on a trip by myself . i can enjoy looking the tourist attraction , looking around the shop , eating something until my stomach filled . for these reason , i disagree with the idea of traveling with a lot of peple led by tour guide .
