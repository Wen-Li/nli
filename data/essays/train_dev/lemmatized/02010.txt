people often can not come to the agreement even in the trivial issue that it is better or not to have broad knowledge of many subject . it is a little bit haste to say having broad knowledge have more benefit , and vice versa . with the rapid development of academic subject , the increasing number of subject are difficult to understand deeply . however , people 's ability is limited and no time to study in many subject . face to the problem , you can not only use one specific subject to solve them . you have to teach yourself and learn from other people in many academic subject . it also could broaden you horizon and accumulate all kind of knowledge to deal with these problem . another benifit is give you many chance to challege yourself and dig up your real interest . furter-more , beacuse of the intension to broaden your knowledge of many academic subject , you will ask others more and have more harmonious relationship . but the problem may be more and more difficult , thus one people could not deal with alone . that need someone have a deep understanding in one specific subjet . without the ability , the problem could face to but could not to solve it . therefore , the saying that it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subject than to specialize in one specific subject is mainly depand on the circumstance . according to my current situation , i prefer to study broad academic subject . thus i could monmunicate a lot to other people and broaden my horizon . when i found my real interest of subject , i will pay much time on the specific subject , due to the interest is the best teacher , and then i will have the deep understanding of the specific subject . thus i think it is suitable for me .
