why ha gandhi been so famous all around the world ? not only wa he aware of the indian poverty and he could just have analysed the situation and published his work , but his fate wa more , he ha to claim for more equqlity on the planet stage and he took risk for that . in fact everybody is able to learn from others like teacher but only people who then follow their own way and prove to be original , which assumes taking risk , become successful people . that is called ambition . why have those famous people wnted to do more than stay on their knowledge ? intelligence , innovation , power . first , many famous people have proved their willingness to go much deeper in the field they are interessted in . for instance einstein wa a very bad student but fond of physic . thank to that passion he started sudying specific subject related to that and discovered relativity . his theory wa first denied in his obstination , he took risk and nowaday everyone is working on the basis of it work . intelligence make people focus on their interest and take risk to argue their point of view , which lead them to success . then , innovation which mean risk is part of a process that make someone be famous . look at bill gates , how he ha improve people s life with microsoft ? this is one of the ugest innovation we have ever experience . but this is the first step . in order not to be forgotten , on really should continue to innovate . otherwise , the famous peolple die suddenly . finnally , what lead people to become famous id their attraction to power . for example nicolas sarckosy , canditate for presidency in frence doesn t hide his which of power . that value encourage people to take risk .
