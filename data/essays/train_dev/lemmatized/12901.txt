if i have to decide whether i agree or disagree with the the claim that understanding idea and concept is more important than learning the fact for student , i would disagree this claim . students need to have concrete fknowledge of fact to be an educated intellectual . i would like to give an example about learning a forein language . when people learn a foreign language , it is important to understand it grammar , how the word are integrated , and it pragmatic , how people use the target language to achieve their goal . however , even if you understand the grammar and the pragmatic which could be considered a idea and concept of a language , it doe not assure you are able to speak the target language . you might be able to be a very successful scholar of the language , but you might not be able to speak the language at all . in order to speak a language , you have to memorize vocabulary and idiom and learn sentence and dialogue which could be considered a a process of learning fact . if we educated all student to become a scholar , the approach focusing more on understanding idea and concept would be effective , but student will take different carreers . educators should provide opportunity for them to learn enough knowledge to survive the real world . moreover , in order to understand idea and concept deeply , concrete knowledge of fact is inevitable . therefore , i strongly believe that student need focus on learning fact , not just understading idea and concept . it is not only for student to prepare the time when they get out of school , but also it will help student to undersatnd idea and concpets more profound ly than when they do not have enough knowledge about those .
