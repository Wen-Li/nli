let me introduce first . i am from japan and have grown up there . i totally agreed with that yong people recently do not give enough time to helping their community . the some reason why young people doe not are that in japanese society , there are more interest , such a playing video game and interuption like busy for studying . or the young people tend to not have any interest to others . most of elderly people said `` a long time ago of young people have sufficient time for helping their community . '' however , time is always changing , therefore , youth doe not want to help or not like their community at all . even if their parent may be not care of those community , so they might not to push their son or daughter going to community . on the other hand , because japanese are studying so harder than playing , and some of youth ha to focus on studying instead of helping the community , so they do not have time to go community . not only japanese study so hard , but also doe asian study very hard if we compare between asia and north america . americans may have enough time to helping their community because i saw young americans by using my eye . also , i heard from my friend who are americans that japanese are studying hard than americans . it mean that japanese do not have time to helping their community . in japan , there are one of the worst boom for young people . we called the boom : `` hikikomori phenominon . '' young japanese ( young adult too ! ) tends to stay at their house , especirooms , and spend time there in a whole day . it mean that they do not have any interest outside of the world . they never work for job , go to school , and never going out . in conclusion , the reason why in recent year young people do not have time to spend are changing period , busy for studying , and bad phenominon .
