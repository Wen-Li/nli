i agree with statement that young people enjoy life more than old people . the term of youth is believed a the beautiful time in our life this theory itself proof that young do enjoy a lot more than old . enjoyment can be considered a the invisible sibling of zeal . energy generates from the enthusiasm towards one life . a young people will be healthy they will be active and energitic resulting in interest towards enjoying the life . generally they follow in the logic that ` get busy in living or get busy in dying ' . young people never satisfies with their existing capability they enjoy in achieving intermediate goal . that too , a the young never feel their responsibilties , out of their ignorance they enjoy with their freinds and by their own style of enjoying their life . as the old people feel very responsible they come under pressure and will be vexed with their life and never think in a positive way . they try to complicate their problem unknowingly a they are annoyed . young people think with a great flexibilty and they feel very free with out any mental tension a they take every thing in a positive way . a they come across so many field and new advancments in those respective field , they enjoy in learning them and in spreading their knowledge . as there are so many innovation in the field of technology they try to capitalise the advantage of those gadget and device and get entertained themselves . enjoyment can be defined mathematically a ( goodhealth + zeal + energy + optimism ) . these four thing can be considered a the variable . where these feature are in bundle in the young people . by the above discussiuon we can clearly visualize that young people enjoy more than old people which is an uncontaricted truth .
