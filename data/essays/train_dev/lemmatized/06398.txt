i will totaly disagree with statement , in twenty year there will be more car in use than there are today . because car are the main source of travelling to the people rather than bus and aeroplane . it is very easily avilable to the people in the future generation because it is reducing it price . in olden day the available of car will be only to people who born with yhe silver spoon . as the need of car is increaseing the price of the car is comeing down and now it more easily available to the comman people . the car manufatures came with different tecnology and design depending upon the usage and the requriment of the peopleand they developed some 1000 model of car since it came to the market and with latest tecnology of using fuel le and getting mailage more . there are many unit inthis car manufacture some of them are ford , suzuiki , toyoto , maruthi , tata hundai , hondaand lot more . they are design according to our reqiurements . and there number will increase in future also . and now ther doing experiment to introduce non - fuel car in the market it will bring great change in the development of car . though i accept that there are some advantage there are disadvantage the fuel used in car release the corbon dioxide in the nature which will cause health hazard so the measure are taking to prevent . and to invent nonuse if fuel car and they travel with help of eletricity which is very benificial . and another one is accident done by the car , accident will go with each and every vehicle it all depends on how great you drive them . as the depand is increaseing usage of car also increase rather than bike which more source of accident . car will increase in future 20 year
