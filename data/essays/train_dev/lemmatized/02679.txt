i am absolutely certain that advertisement make product seem much better than they really are . in fact , it is the motivation of the people who are creating the advertisement to influence the people and create a perfect image of a certain product . i will give two reason and example to underline my opinion . the first point i would like to make is about tv spot and their style of influence . by making a nice spot it is possible to present a certain product in the way the producer want to . some time ago , for example , i saw an advertisement about a tooth paste with a whitening effect . in the spot a beautiful woman , titled a the wife of a dentist , told me about her experience with this tooth paste . i could see her wonderful white teeth and wa very impressed . next day i bought this tooth paste and hoped to get more white teeth a soon a possible . unfortunately , yet my teeth have not change into a more white colour and i guess i wa influenced by this spot , which made the tooth paste better than it actually is . secondly , i would like to refer to prospect about hotel . to present a product nicely , photo can be sufficient , too . i suppose , almost everybody once ha read such a prospect and wa impressed about all the nice photo . on the photo , every lobby is modern and friendly , the swimming pool seem to be very big and the room are with balcony , plant , nice sofa and chair . however , these photo mostly only show the best part of the hotel . of course , they do not present a complete impression , including the more unrepresentative part . thus , these prospect create an impression of the hotel which present them better than they really are . as a conclusion i would like to underline that advertisement are not forced to show the truth . it is obvious , that the producer of advertisement take this chance to influence the people impression of certain product .
