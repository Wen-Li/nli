first , i must say i completely agree with the statment . it is quite relevant in the education of a country , and about it and it consequence a huge controversia ha been opened at the spannish university . i think everyone accepts that understanding the concept and far more important , being able to get to the fact by yourself using that concept you 've learned at class , is what university should use for . in other word , they should teach you how to use your capability . in the professional area , what you will need to do is apply what you have learned into completely different case . you will never find the same specification of the problem you got when you were studying . you could pas your exam , but you wo n't be prepared for the real world , you will feel completely naked when you 'll find your first problem . in my case , that i 'm an engineer , it is completely useless to know how to resolve a specific problem . what i need to know is how to face it , what step i should take and then work throught it to get it done . each time i 'll need a different technique to resolve it , but i should always take the same step , analyze , decide best option between a brunch of possibility and finally use it . then , what is the problem ? why do n't teacher work that way ? basically because it is much more complicated to teach concept and actitudes that fact . the fact is written and it doe n't change . they just need to read their ` magic ' teacher 's book and copy it . someone else did the investigation before . instead , to teach concept , first you have to understand it properly , investigate , you need to get involved in the classroom . all this mean complete dedication and a huge preparation . and what is more important , i think you need to love what you are teaching . another aspect i think a lot of teacher are just there because they did n't have the opportunity to develop their career in their real area .
