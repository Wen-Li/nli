i agree with this statement . as improvement or development of technology , every house ha their own television and radio . and also internet used a a good way of advertising some product . but since the purpose of advertising is selling the product what the company made , when they advertise one product , they overly exaggerate that product . when i wa in elementary school , i wa walking on the road . i saw one person advertising a fan . what i heard wa they are selling fan only that day with 50 percent discount . and he kept saying that it never break and he used that fan for last few year . but when i bought that fan it broke in a week . and one another day i way watching television . and when i watched one commercial which wa advertising diet food . and they were saying that , `` if you eat this diet food for a month you will be like one of the hollywood stars. '' and after few week i saw one article in the internet which wa talking about that diet food doe n't work well . people do n't buy product which doe n't look or seems good . every day people want better and better product . so the company automatically try to show their product is better than other company 's product . in the advertisement they always talking about the good thing of their product they never say that the bad thing of their product . so people might think that the product is really good so they should buy it . advertisement is a important bussiness . it 's a only way to company introduce it 's good to everybody . but since there are so many company are in this world . they stated competing each other and try to exaggerate their product than the other company 's product . so i think the product seems much better than they really are is because of that 's the way to survive in this world .
