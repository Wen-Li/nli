there are two way of learning nowadays ; either student learn in book and understand some idea , or they learn thanks to work experience and special fact which is more important and relevant for me . personnally , with my student formation , i have had the chance to experience both . in an engineering school , you attend theoretical course during a part of the year and then you have to perform an internship to go to the next level . the theoretical course explain the idea and concept used in different company and the internship give the possibility to work on special fact , which put together make your own experience . at first i would say that the experience in a company , with some problem or special fact you have to face , is more relevant that some course . but after reflection , i would say that we need both . it is not possible to learn and be able to face problem if we just attented some course in class for a few year . the real experience are essential to learn the best way and get the best skill . one can use all the theoretical course we have had during the student formation and then make everything in practise on a real case . learning just by studying special fact is also not complete enough because it doe not give the necessary skill to face other problem . the skill used to explain or solve some fact are only for that fact in particuliar but they are different with other problem . and it is impossible to study all the fact that can possibly exist . that is why the idea and concept learned in theoretical course are important . so i think there ha to be a balance between what is learned in theoretical course and the experience lived outside the universe of school . they are both needed to have a great formation and great idea , but they can not work seperately . each student ha to take idea and skill thanks to his teacher but also with his own experience which give more human value than theoretical one .
