i personally agree with the topic that nowadays young people donot give enough time to helping their community . students in the present day modernised world are attracted to more of thing like disco and pub rather than social activity . to make my opinion stronger i would like to take a personel experience . on the eve of the independence day some of our college friend decided to do some thing good on that day . as a part of it we decide to constuct a compound wall for a tribal school . we sent request to different college in need of volunteer . but on that we were shocked to see that vrey few people turned out for that event . one more reason why stuudents cant make to such event is that the world ha become so competetive that student dont even get time to relax for one complete day . for example my friend who are persueing thier graduate course also aim for other exam like cat , sat etc . also they need to maintain their grade in thier regular graduetion course . so it difficult for them to spend some time for the extracurricular activity . thus howmuch interest they have it not possible for student like them . finally the advent of internet in the 20th century revolutionised thing very much . it ha made world into a global village . anyone can access anything in this world by just sitting at their home . this made young people from moving out of their place . thus making them lazy . hence seldom young people spare enough time to helping thier community . thus from my personal experience i think that young people nowadays donot give enough time to helping thier community .
