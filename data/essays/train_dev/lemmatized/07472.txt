recently , it seems that youong people do not give enough time to helping their community . unfortunatelly , i can not help agree it . including me , most of young people do not feel storong relationship with their community . in my experience , there are two reason which make me think that way . first , an athletic festival is hold in the comunity where i live annually , i think taking part in something community event mean helping it . i have taken part in it just once . but in fact , i could not find any young people there . i reckon the reason why young people do not join that festival is that young people prefer to spend a time with their friend than family or their community . i also guess that some young people think to contribute or help their community is kind of waste of time . second , especially reacently , young such a university student tend to live themselves . actually , most of my friend live apart from their family . it mean that it is no longer possible to help thier community . in fact they can help the community where they live now . but they might feel like to do it because it not their home town . so may feel that they are stranger there more or le . as far a i know , it is clear that young people do not help their community much . including me , the value of connection with their community getting le stronger among young generation . i think this problem shoud be considered more seriously . otherwise , the community which is active with young people
