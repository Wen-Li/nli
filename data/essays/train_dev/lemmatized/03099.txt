it is absolutely true that most of the advertisement make product seem much better than they reallly are . but how this happens ? that is not an easy is question to answer , but i think this is also the only question to make in order to understand why advertisement have this particular effect . i believe that the main strategy used by market analyst is simply to influence people by touching their weakness . everyone of u for example , or at least most of u , want to be accepted by society ( our group of friend or our collegues ) . it is un unconscious process but it is like that , and we can do nothing against it . as a consequence of this process we tend to buy the product that we feel could change in a better way the conception that the other have of u ; any object that could improve of our social image is certainly to be bought . i will try to make an example . if i know that david beckam shave with a particular aftershave i might think that by using that specific product i will achieve the same social approval he ha . that is why most advertisement use famous people to sponsorize a product : because we unconsciously want to be like them . any way , the question is whether there is a solution to this kind of problem , it is in fact a problem the one we are talking about , because linked to a weakness of modern social community . i simply think that , considered that we can not change the entire costume of our society , the starting point is being aware of this fact . this way of reasoning will make u more critic on advertisments , whose product will seem no more a attractive a we thought they were before .
