the question whether it is better to have a broad knowledge of many academic subject rather than to be specialized in one subject is a very interesting question because a good education is one of the most important thing in our life . from my point of view , it is preferable to be specialized in one subject than having a broad knowledge in many academic subject . i am on this opinion because of a few reason . first of all , i think you have to be focussed on one specific subject in our society . if you are not good in your subject you would not earn much money . so you have to be very good in some kind of thing to get in a high position in a company . for example you have to be good in managing to get a job a a leading manager in a big company . so the more specific your knowledge the more money you will earn . furthermore , i think that you should have one specific subject that you are keen in or which is your desire . to my mind , that is a natural thing . every person ha a desire in something . some people like doing mathematics , whereas other people like doing biological research or like doing sport . so every student ha a subject that he like and that he is fascinated about . therefore you should concentrate and focus on this specific subject . lastly , what job will you enter if you have a broad knowledge of many academic subject but you have not got any detailled knowledge ? what company is going to hire a student who ha not got any specialized education ? what job title would be the best for this situation ? therefore , it is better to have a specific education . to sum up , because of the mentioned aspect i think it is better to have one specific subject where you are an expert in rather than to have a broad knowledge of many subject .
