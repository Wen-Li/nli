in my view young people are enjoying life more than the old people . a perfect example to support my view would be me [ young ] when compared to my father [ old ] . i have no responsibility to take care of . so i have more time to fish out , hang out with friend and participate in social activity . on the other hand , my father ha lot of responsibility . he ha his time devoted to certain activity . he is so occupied with this that he doe not get any time to enjoy his life . i also believe that attitude is another factor which can support my view . young people have possitive or open kind of attitude . while the old people have reserved kind of attitude . yound people think that here is lot to enjoy in life . old people just think opposite to this . another reason to support my view would be spending factor . i normally spend more than my father . my father prefers to save instead . by spending i am able to try our new thing , party , going place etc and enjoy life . technology advancement is also one of the reason . today technology ha lot to offer . it make life interesting . i watch movie , take joy ride , play computer game . this facility were not available in the earlier day . the very meaning of life ha changed with the generation .
