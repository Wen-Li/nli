in my opinion , in education , in order to fully understand and deeply explore an issue , it is more important to understand idea and concept than it is to learn fact . to begin with , learning fact , although important , is not sufficent for a student to develop a complete understanding of the subject . it is not possible to evaluate the fact without grasping the underlying idea . the knowledge of the fact without knowing what caused them and why is hard to be considered whole . secondly , without understanding the idea and the concept , the student will fail to apply the knowledge he or she ha gained to changing fact . as long a the main idea is understood , the student will not struggle even if he or she face a problem with different fact . lastly , the fact learned a a student can be easily forgotten following the end of the education . however , if one understands the key idea and concept , these will guide him or her to recall the information he/she gained during education . exploring idea and concept will enable one to develop a strong notion of the subject studied , which is what make one a successful professional . in conclusion , a a lawyer who always ha to be guided by main idea and concept in the face of unique fact of each event , i believe that , for a student , understading idea and concept is the most important part of the education .
