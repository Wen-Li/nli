i disagree with the statement that young people enjoy life more than older people do and there are three main reason why i think so . first of all , there are more task given to young people than to old people . for example , young people have to study in order to go to school and get a good mark at class . they also have to work to make money or to be experienced enough to get a better job . sometimes they are too busy to do something they really want . but older people have done all the task given to them . all they have to do is to receive a reward and appreciation for their hard work and achievement . secondly , old people are wise enough to realize what plea them . in other word , they enjoy their life whereas young people often get stressed out from living . old people have more experience and clue about what life and they know how to behave when they face a challenge . probably the reason why young people think they are struggling through their life is that they have le experience than older people and panic whenver they find their life difficult . old people know how to enjoy their life , hoping young people will soon realize what they figured out when they were young . thirdly , and more importantly maybe , old people are richier than young people . they have worked hard and have earned money a a result . they can spend money on whatever they want . they can buy a fancy car , they can make a beautiful garden , and they can even give their money to their child if they want to . everyone want to enjoy life and the only difference is the way of enjoying life . people can not assume that old people can not enjoy life only because they are old and boring . obviously , there are many thing for young people to learn from older people . they need to learn how to work hard , how to achieve their goal , and how to enjoy life . however , most of these question will be answered completely a they actually get aged .
