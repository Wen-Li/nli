korean parent , who ha traditionally shown huge intersts on childern 's education , seem to be competing to send their chidren to most munber of private academy . i should admit that childern should accumulate a lot of knowlege to understand the world , or the lead a successful life in the futer . however , i believe that more emphasis should be put on understanding the idea and concept . first of all , compulsion of acquiring lot of knowledge will make the student lose the interest on the subject they 're studying . when a student is force to go to several privite academy by his mom 's wish like one of my student , she wo n't have chance to consider what i want to know the most . as a matter of a fact , the student spents lot of time studying english , math and science but all she wish about the academy is to quit them . moreover , just gaining more knowlede beyond the student 's understanding is not efficient at all . for example , another student of the academy where i teach , should take 3 coursed every day . of course , it is not by his will but by his mom 's wish . in spite of the amount of time he spends at the academy , he fails to show decent understanding for any of the class . because he take too much , he is having a hard time understanding the lesson . undoubtedly , having a lot of knowledge is very useful and important . however , i believe the study process should follow the step neede to be efficient . students should have chance to learn about what it is like . for that they should understand the field .
