nowadays a lot ha been said about the role of the advertisement in the current society . some marketing practicationers have defended the idea that marketing and , in particular , advertisement keep playing a neutral role in the modern society by only promoting the feature of a product . on the contrary , among academic and most of the public opinion , this claim ha completely been rejected . in my opinion this second position best highlight what the actual situation really is : products are overpushed through the advertisment channel by mistelling what they really value for the final customer . ever more commercial promise customer greater benefit from their product misleading the real want and need of them . modern advertisment are able to manipulate the customer will and often convince him/her to buy product not really wanted . it may also happen that the feature illustrated by the commercial are really disappointing to the customer when this experience the product . furthermore , by lying to the customer through advertisment , the firm can really harm the final consumer . this is the case of those kind of product that cause accident to the user . these product tend to overestimate the capacity of certain feature exposing the cutomer to danger . since , i think , this issue is tremendously current , more attention should be given to it . it involves ethical problem which must not be avoided . only through a new conception of advertisement , i would call it an ethical advertisement , thing can get better for people .
