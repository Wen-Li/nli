i do n't agree the idea that it is more important for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact . from my point of view , understanding the idea and concept and learning the fact have equal importance because at first without fact idea and concept ca n't be understood . let me explain this with a personal experience , i 'm studying textile engineering at university , in all class our lecturer tell u the fact about textile material and the fact about how they are produced . and then we argue on how we can improve the material quality and production technique and in the end of the lesson lecturer give his/her idea about them . by this way we learn the fact about the material and production technique and understands the idea and concept about improving them even we can create our own idea . but if we do n't clearly know what the feature of the textile material are and how it 's produced we can neither understand the idea of the lecturer about improving them nor create our own idea . secondly , if you both know the fact and understand the idea and concept about a certain topic then you totaly know the topic . for example in an art class if some example of drawing of leonardo da vinci are shown and the date of them are given , it 's good you have seen how leonardo da vinci 's painting look like . but what about the idea behind these drawing ? if the lecturer tell you his/her opinion about what he might think while making these drawing or encourages you to imagine leonardo 's mood while making these drawing then you can have a total knowledge about leonardo da vinci 's art . in conclusion in order to gain the exact knowledge of a certain topic at first student should learn fact and then understand idea and concept . education system should be organized according to this logic from primary school to university in order to raise well educated and intellectual student .
