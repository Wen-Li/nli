knowlegde it 's a basic concept in our life ; since we are judged by our lever of knowledge . there are many opinion on what we should have a a north . i think tha we should specialize in one specific subject . i am a political science student . plato or aristotle would say that a person must have a specfict field of specialization because no one could be an expert on two or more subject . at least , that wa what a learn on my classic political thought theory class . i think that if you have a broad knowledge of many academis subjetcs you are not going to be good , or excellent at any of those . a person can not be capable of being an expert on different topic or field . if he or she want to be good at something he or she must choose a specific field . i support my opinion because a person might have specific concern so he/shecan conduct specific research on specific topic . a person might never have a lot of concern on different topic because it will be too abstract on everything . a concentration on different topic will get the researcher confunsed on what they should follow . a professionalt must folow just a direction . he or she must specialized in her or his field in order to be excellent on that field . that is my phylosophy .
