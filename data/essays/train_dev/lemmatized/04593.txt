in my opnion , this statement is true . it is because most young people spend their time not helping their community but theirselves . for example , some people have to work for their life , other people have to study for passing the school-entrance-test . you may think , however , many people belong to clube or volunter-activity . of couse , some people take part in some activity , but the number of them is decresing than the number of them in old year . this fact show u that young people today do not give much time to participate activity . so , it is true that young people today do not give much time to helping their community than young people did at the old day !
