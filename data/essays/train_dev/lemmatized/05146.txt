i totally agree with the statment that state `` most advertisments make product seem much better than they really are '' . in order to begin my essay and to build it on example from real life , we have to understand what is the role of television , radio , newspaper , etc , they all want to collect profit , a they are all considered to be profitable institution . by making product seem much better than they really appear in advertisments in different kind of medium , they are actually encouraging the consumer ( people ) to buy from that product . to support my idea , let take an example of something that people face in real life . nescaffe , yes it is a delecious hot drink , in most advertisments they say that it make the person to relax from the daily problem and obsticles facing him , but indeed , it is a drink that contains caffeine , and caffeine is a substance that make people to be more offensive or active . another example , which is widely spread especially in the united states of america , is the advertisments of the `` take away '' restaurant or those who deliver jung food a macdonald and berger king . food is nice there , yes this is a fact , but what is also considered to be a fact , is that eating too much of the jung food ha an enormus effect on the human health , a it increase the chance for diabetus , increase the risk of having high blood preasure and increase the chance of developing atheroscloroses , especially for aged people . another significant example , is advirtising for alcohol drink a beer , the advertisments are made in order to attract people to a certain commodity . by making the advertisment , they are not taking into consideration that there might be underaged people or teenager that are watching the advertisment . what is known about teenager from both sex , is that they are passing a period of time where they are curious to try and experience everything . and from here , it is obvious that advertisments not only make thing appear much better than they really are , but they control the human mind a well a the human desire . all in all , i agree one hundred persent with the statement where most advertisments make product look much better than they really are . in this essay i focused on dealing with the topic by giving eaxmples from real life , and example that are important for the people to be aware of especially in our century .
