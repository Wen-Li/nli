i would rather agree with having a broad knowledge of many academic subject . why ? because sometimes some field are complimentary . you ca n't study a science field or an economic subject without knowing what is next to it . let 's take an exemple : molecular biology . to be a molecular biologist you have to deal with interaction of molecule within the cell , so you do have to know about the cell . also you have to know about physic to be able to interact with the cell without breaking the cell wall or to harm the organites within the cell . then also you have to know a bit of chemestry to know at least how the molecule you are working with might interact with some others particle . and molecular biology might work along with medical field too , specially cancerology and treating genetics disease . also , i think that in everyday life you ca n't just talk about one field . to me having a conversation implies that you have knowledge about someting more than the area you work in . it mean also an exchange of opinons , and if you keep on saying the same stuff to everyone , you would soon be out of speech . you would bore people . and also who might talk to you ? your work collegues might not want to discus of work after work . nor would your friend if you keep on saying the same thing . nevertheless knowing about several field doe not mean you kave to know everything about each field . you just can not , you will keep being a specialist in your own field but having a knowledge about other domain , not necesserely related to yours , for exemple you can know italian and work a an acountant . so you would be given better job opportunity , and probably allowed to go to italy . you have to exceed expectation , and k
