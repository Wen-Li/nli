method of studying is always different from student to student . many people hold their perspective to undestand idea and concept while other prefer to learn fact . i too beileve that it is more important for student to understand concept and idea than to learn fact . the reason , i think this way is because understanding idea and concept clearity increase the creativity of student and it give better knowledge for further growth . concept clearity and clear idea provide better foundation for future education of student . one reason , i believe that concept clearity and clear idea give better foundation to a student is because if we understand idea and concept then we never forget the subject . take my own example , when i wa student i always preferred to concept clearity . i still remember the concept of newton 's laws ; because my physic teacher of grade 10 had my concept clear about this subject . therefore it is always better to clear the concept and idea so that we will never forget the same . another reason , i believe that concept clearity and understanding idea is important is that it increase the creativity of student . when we understand the concept of any theory then we feel more innovative to discover some more thing . in fact every scientific discovery wa started from fifferent idea . for example , when adison had understand the concept of electron and atom then only he could concluded that electron can be used to flow electricity . this is how understanding concept about atom lead to the discovery of electricty . all these are not to say that to learn fact are all use le . facts are related to generally past which is also important . but advantage of learning fact can not surpass the advantage of clearing concept and understanding idea . in short , in this scientific world , student with capability of learning idea and with clear concept ha better future than those who learn fact only
