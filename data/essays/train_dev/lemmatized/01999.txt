some student learn only fact , while others are able to understand the idea and the concept that derive from those fact . according to me , that i am a student and so i 'm really concerned about this , only learning a fact without learning something from it it 's unuseful , a student are n't memory machine but they have also emotion and some fact can touch them . for example , if i have to follow a lesson , which speaks about the progressive movement , obviously i will learn all the fact that had derived from this movement and i will be interested in learning it , but only this will not satisfy me . in fact i think that it will be more useful and more interesting if i can go inside this movement and understand which are the reason why this movement wa created , what wa the background of that period , what wa the most important thing that pushed people who belonged to this movement to act in that way . .. otherwise , i do n't learn nothing that can help me to improve myself , a i 've only learned a series of fact without having understood them . another reason is that , if student are taken inside the fact , they will be more involved and so they can appasionate to it and will follow every lesson paying more attention . for this reason , i think that seeing film which speak about a particular event , is a thing which can help student to learn this event , a film do n't describe only a fact , but allow u to share the emotion of every character who is involved in the event . in conclusion , i think that only learning a fact is a void learning a it doe n't help people to improve themselves , so i will ever try , everytime that i will approach to learn something , to understand idea and concept at the basis .
