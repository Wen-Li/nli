it is commonsense to argue that young people enjoy life more than older people do . nevertheless , in a society in which growing up adult is becoming increasingly difficult , there are many reason to question the above view . in other word , in today , world , older people are well placed to enjoy life more than young people do . to start with , young people often have to struggle to get on in their carrier . consequently , rather than enjoyng their free time , they are prone to use their free time to improve their working skill or to work extra hour , to demonstrate that they are good worker . in constrast , older people , who have already achieved their professional success , may enjoy more leisure time than they did in their past . another reason that may explain why younger people do not enjoy life that much is that they are still in search for their sentimental equilibrium . young people are more vulnerable to love than older people are and this , in turn , may destabilize them . for instance , when a young fall in love with someboody and the relationship break up , his/her reaction is much more magnified a compared to an old man/woman reaction . indeed , old people , who are are more experienced in sentimental affair , react to sentimental failure with a touch of philosophical detachment ! the discussion led so far is not meant to imply that old people have not problem . they face severe issue such a living alone or getting used to their retirement from previously held activity . despite the potential severity of these problem , however , i think that the problem that young people face are greater than the one old people do . struggling to get a rewarding job or creating a family are two of the biggest challenge human being go through their life . having already passed through them , old people have a clear comparative adavantage .
