i agree that most advertisement make a product seem much better than they really are . these day the advertising ha become so popular that some people even have this belief that they can not sell a product at all with out advertising it on television or radio or wall poster . the first and the foremost thing in most of the advertising industry is presenting something bigger better or unrealistic than the usual product . these day there are advertisement for everything from a mole hill to a mountain . and thee day with the advancement in medium ( radio , television , internet ) the advertising ha become so easy and so effective that it is delivered to each and every person and who encounter that adverisement tends to buy that product . they are so impresive . even if we go to a gas station there is a discount , for clothes , for medicine ,,,,, for every thing there is some bonus ( so called ) to the customer , which is just , in my opinion is , another startegy to improve their business and get profit . the other day i wa walking on a street and i see that on the other side of a road there is this man beging with a note in his hand `` need food '' and wen i looked at him and tried to walk away he had taken out another note with '' need booze '' and asking me to give him some money for what ever note i liked for . he really advertising more than his need or showing something to others which isnt true . he ha money bu it just that he doesnt want to work at all . here is another incident , i saw this advertisement in the news paper stating that there is a store wide discount with a note on the front of the shop `` out of business store closing after 15 day '' and i went there . i liked some shoe and bought them . after a month when i go to buy something else in the same street i see the shop is still there . and i talked to one of my friend , who is in to marketing , told me that these are some kind of business tactic they play . the most important thing is that the company who advertise should recognise that the people dont mind the advertising , if it really genune . i i have seen many advertisement in the news paper and television stating that loose weight and witha picture of before the treatment and after the treatment ( picture taken sideways ) . and some wid before and after treatment for hair implant or regenration . they say it is really successfull in most patient and if you go to them stating that it ha not been successful for me they blame you . they tell you that you are not the one who ha done the excersise properly or didnt take the medication regularly . i also agree that there is some genune advertising but we can hardly get to see that these day . due to these advertising strategy , over a period of time , people will realise that it of no use to fall in the trap of those advertisement . and im sure the advertiser will come up with some other solution for it , after all they will have to sell their product and we will have to buy product . i guess it will just go on . .. , ... and may be in future they might advertise it genunely ( the way it is ) , but a of now my option is that i agree that most of the advertisments make product seem much better than they really are .
