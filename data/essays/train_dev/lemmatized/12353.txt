nowadays , risk is a part of our everyday life . while some peolple are more likely to take risk , other are just ready to practice what they already know . but , i noticed that people who try new thing and take risk are most successful . in fact , risk is a component of success . usually , there is `` no success without risk '' . people who take risk are always innovating and thinking about new project and new strategy of success . for example , if my field of study is biology , i have more knowlegde and experience in biology than in any other field . but i decide to invest my money in a coffe shop , which is purely business . that is a huge risk because , obviously i do n't have any specific knowlegde and experience on how to run a coffe shop . now , because i want my business to succeed , i will hire a specialist in coffee business to guide me and help me run my business . by working day after day with the specialist , i will learn how to run the business by myself . however , taking risk can turn into a bad decision sometimes . for example , i can take a risk and not succeed right away . but the failure is a good experience because i 'm learning from it and the next step will surely be better . in conclusion , i think that taking risk is a good decision in most of situation . by taking risk , we innovate , anticipate and we are more likely to move forward in our life .
