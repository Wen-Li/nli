i can say that i agree with the statement . nowadays , young people spend too much time for themself . in fact , they stay a lot of time in own house to play with the video game or to watch the television and rarely to study something . first of all , i believe that the tecnology and all the thing around it have contribuited to damage the personality of the youth . in the past , a boy or a girl had to help their family in the field or in home because their family obligated them to do something of useful . the boy improved very quickly their skill and they grown faster than the modern boy . the girl learnd how to cook and how to repair the clothes of their parent because it wa a necessity . the modern young people have the possibility to get every thing that they want because their parent do not oppose resistant over all request . in fact , i believe that the new parent are too much flexible and permissive . they should be more strict to allow to understand to their son what thing are important and what are not . so , nowadays , the young people are more material than in the past so they do not mind if the society around them is going to fall down in a big depression . for example , i saw a lot of people do not interest of the news or the newspaper a little thing that push a person to think about the real world . finally , the modern young people are too much influenced to the society . they see their friend behave in a particular way and understand that they can get some thing in that way . they do not spend time to help their community becouse the modern community offer all thing that a young need . therefore , a boy or a girl doe not look for something of interesting to do . i think that it is the main reason in the decline of the youth .
