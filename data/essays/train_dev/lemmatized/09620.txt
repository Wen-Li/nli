i absolutely agree that ` most advertisement make product seem much better that they really are . ' i confront the bundle of advertisement on the tv , radio , bus , and even along the wall and on the road . the food in the advertisement loosks more eligible , so i feel that i have to eat that . how about the facial cosmetic ? its effect is significant so that i ca n't resist to try it . the advertisement of diet is incredible . it show even the picture of the ` before ' and ` after ' using their product . is it real ? i do n't think so . the answer is clear if you use those product . i tried food , cosmetic , and ` incredible ' diet drug . nothing is like the advertisement . i mean that the food doe n't taste great for me to make a smile , and the cosmetic that i chose among the advertisement did n't give my face enough moisture . as for the drug for diet , it really did not lost my weight . far from my experience , the people around me and my neighbor gave the similar experience to me . there is no big change such a the advertisement . even the surface of the package is n't like the content in the view of color or shape . how shame on them ! i 'm so sensitive consumer to try the weight of the purchase on the scale . it did n't match exactly . i showed the case of exaggerated advertisement based on my own experience . in order consumer ' to make a right decision , it is important to show the way the product are a well a to deliver the consumer ' report to the public .
