i don ' t think young people enjoy life more than old people . i tnink that they prefer to live their life in different way . infact youn people love leisure time , love play togheter , they have to know the word and make new experience . for example the summer holiday are the week of the year more attended in which they don ' t have to think to school and where the only think that they can do is to play every day or to go to the sea . in my case , i am 22 year old , i enjoy life not only because i can stay with my friend an go to dance or to the pub , i also love life because i have a lot of opportunity , i need to know more think that i can , i need to realise myselves . i want a good work and a good career , i want to marry and a family . old people enjoy life not le than young people , but i think that they have already left this important moment of their life and they prefer to stay togheter in quite and not busy place . an example is my grandmother . she is 78 year old . she like to stay home to watch tv or to read lot of book . she like to cook and to fill her leisure time with her friend to speak . on holiday she like to stay every day on the sun , she prefer to go out for a walking to look the landscape or to eat the ice cream . i think that youngh people and old people enjoy life , but they have different interest and different way experience of the life . if young people need to realise themselves , old people need to live the rest of their life to know more that they know . i can define them the expert of life .
