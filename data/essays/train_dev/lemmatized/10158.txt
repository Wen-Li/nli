i do agree to the statement that it is better to know many thing briefly rather than knowing only few thing in detail . there are so many different academic subject that hardly no one is able to have a deep knowleadge of all of them at the same time . knowing a bit of many subject is more worth because it make you look at thing more widely . also i think it is more worth because you become open minded . you do not only focus on few thing but consider many different aspect you have learned about . another argument to underline my opinion is that you have better conversation with people by knowing many thing briefly . on the one hand it is great to have a deep knowleadge of something and of cause it is also very impressing . however on the other hand i think a that kind of person you can only have a good conversation with specialist like you . you are not able to see thing in a big picture . to my mind having a brief knowleadge about many academic subject is more worth it . to give an example imagine you are having a conversation in a train or another public place with a person you have just met . the chance that this person ha the same knowleadge and same interest you do so you have somehing to talk about is very low . but if you have lot to talk about because you know a lot , doe not matter if it is just a basic knowleadge or not , the conversation would be very good . to sum up it is just more worth and helpful in life to have a brief knowleadge about academic subject because the chance you find somebody you can talk to is very high . also very important is that you experience a lot and become open minded which to my mind you can only become if you have a wide knowleadge .
