i agree with the statement because people who take risk and i f try new thing ha more chance catch the success rather than the other people who life with the thing that they already know . expanding the limit and discover new area is so important . if person ha a tentance to take risk will realise that it is worthed to take risk although there is a chance to fail . successful people who try new thing are more unbeatble and stronger than the others . they have more reason to live and taking risk make them exited and ambitious . when they reach their goal they become a person who is happy to live and who feel alive . after exploring new thing it becomes an addiction and they want more new thing and more risk . if i would give an example from an artist , for to be successful he \ she need to learn new thing and follow the improvement around his world . those exploratons and experimentation open a new world of creativity . artist should be open to the whole universe after that he can create an uniqe work of art . they should take risk to discover his limit and to develop his ability and skill . for example there is an performance artist on stage and he need to be brawe enough to prfor his show he should take risk without thinking what doe the auidience thiks or reacts . he should try new thing on stage with combining his exprience and knowledge . think that he tried and had good reaction from auidience or they did n't like the show . his benefit here is this ; he discovered his limit next time he will be more exprienced than before . those are the essential step for to be a succesful person . you need to try new thing and take risk and expand your limit for to feel alive and happy .
