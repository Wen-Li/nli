although it is important to gain knowledge of many basic fact , i think that it is really better to acquire understanding of concept and idea which are given in lecture and class . there are three reason why i agree with this statement . the first point i have to mention is that you can look up every fact which you want to know about in book or the internet . in addition , this process doe not take a lot of time . for example , when you are asking about a special date , you can use a history book or an internet site which deal with historical date . second , it is very helpful for your future profession when you have understand the concept and idea which are often used in the professional life . when a special problem occurs you have to solve it using your abilitites you have learned during your studying time . think of an instance in mathematics . when you try to solve an equation to finish the calculation which are very important for your company it is absolutely necessary that you have understand the concept of solving such equation in order to avoid mistake . to continue , there is still another reason for my opinion . when you are confident with the underlying principle of any topic you are , a a result , enabled to unterstand and , probably , to solve new problem . imagine the case of a special problem which only emerges in your section . this problem ha to be solved but no known way of approaching this problem is appropriate . so your combination ability are very important . you have now to combine concept and idea you have already learned and the new . consequently , when you have acquired a great variety of principle to solve problem you will probably be prepared well in creating own , new idea and concept . in summary , from my perspective , it is better for student to gain knowledge of many concept to be successful in their future professional life .
