exellent statement : why ? because i think that this phrase is the question that lot of u ask to oneself . for me is difficult analyze it , but i will try to explain my idea . immagine in your mind this : on the right hand you have young people , i have supposed that young could be until fouty year old , on the opposite hand you have old people . my idea is that for the fist part of people is simpler find something to do ( in general ) to enjoy their life than for the second part . the reason are that when you are young ( i always suppose ) you have much energy to dicover something new , for example new sport , new interest , new passion or new work to do . all these reason were used by old people when they were young and this for me can be another reason because the old people enjoy their life le then young . if i could get in old people mind i think that i would start to look me around and i would think : `` i have worked all life , i have studied all life and now i am pretty tired '' . with my mind is difficult think that in the future i will spend all my time to do nothing , maybe because i will not be able to what i would like to do , but this because i am young , because i want to discover new part of wolrd that i have not seen again , because i love sport and i think that i could not live without it , because i want to increase my knoledge and because i have to start to work . for all these reason i understand the old people that they cannnot what they do , i think that it wolud be difficult to organize the life when you are old . however , i think that it is possible , because i have a personal example : my grandfather ; for him every morning is a new day to discover .
