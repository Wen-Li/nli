i agree with the following statement . there are some young people who would volunteer to work for his or her community , but the number of young people who would not give enough time to helping their community is increasing faster . the first reason that more young people would not help for the community is that there are many way to spend your spare time . you can play game , play sport , watch television , or do whatever you want to . quite a number of people especially like to play computer game , and watch television . a few month ago , i have read an article about this problem . it showed that the percentage of watching television and playing game ha increased after the law of working 5 day a week ha been put into the reality . so , instead of wasting time on game and television , we should try to help our community . second of all , we have to study hard for our future . nowadays , there are hardly any job that you can get . in order to survive in this cruel society , you have to study , study , and study and graduate collage with a degree . then , it would be easier for you to get a job . the pressure of studying doe not give you any free time to helping your community . there should be some change in the curriculum of teaching and studying . furthermore , many thing have changed from past . it also made people to change . hundreds of year ago , our ancestor would have helped each other out when they are put in a hard situation . but these day , people think only about themselves , instead of working a a group , a friend . this is an improtant thing that we should learn from our ancestor . young people have strong power and intelligent brain . but they are using it on thing that are not important . helping community will out our community to grow to be a better place to live .
