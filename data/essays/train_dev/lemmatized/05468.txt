`` knowledge is ocean '' - is a popular saying . this knowledge is accquired by reading many book , watching various news etc . and there are many more way in which this knowledge is accquired . i opine that having knowledge on one specalised subject is better than to have knowledge on the various academic subject . it is because , it is our specalised subject in which we are much intrested and carry on our own research work in future . if we arnt having a proper grip in the subject it is impossible to go further in our research . thus it is better to have complete grip over the subject . if we take our academic subject their may be many and different subject like mathematics , science , social , english etc . but if it is an specalization it contains only one subject in depth . for example : take if a person 's specalization is english . it need lot of grammar , sentence construction , tense and much more . if u need to carry on with the subject it is necessary to go into the depth of the subject where the knowledge on the other subject may dosent work . if the person is much intrested to carry out his research work in his own specalization then it is necessary that he should have complete knwledge about it . even when we take many item during dinner doent fill our stomach , but one item which we like a lot make our belly full . instead of joing for differnt subject . it is better to have a quite good knowledge on one subject . having knowledge on differnt subject dosent go in vain , but having complete knowledge on one make you gain a , lot no matter what is your specialization . though how much knowledge we accuire in the subject it is drop in the ocean insted of making it uncomplete with having knowledge over different subject it is better to make it a complete full drop with knowledge in one specalized subject .
