while some people disagree with the stement becauseof global pollution problem , but i personaly disagree to the statement , there are two reason for that : peace and high technology . first , i think young peopke enjoy peace . for exmaple , i am in japan and my father suffered pacific war but i do not suffer any war . another example , u.s.a. people dead people in iraq war is much smaller than vitnam war . acoording the survey , iraq war dead of u.s. number are thousand of people , by contrast in vitnam war ten of thousand of people dead . for these reason , i feel that young people more enjoy peace than old people . second , young people enjoy high technology . for example , young people enjoy intenet but old people could do not it when they were young . moreover it is hard for old people to adapt them . for example , sending email is easy for me . but for my mother 60 year , she ask me every time when she send email . in another example , thank to air taranpo it is easy for travel today . in japan , in1970 travel to europe cost 700,000 yen . but now it cost 7,000 yen . for these reason , i feel that young people more enjoy high technology than old people . in conclusion , i think what stetement describe is right . since young people can enjoy the peace , and thank to high technology young people can enjoy new world .
