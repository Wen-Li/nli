if we take a look around the world , we will realize that the most successful people have always been at the edge of tecnology and have accomplish their goal by taking risk and trying out new thing . it is necessary just to read any successful man 's biography to understand what this mean . we all need to learn how to do thing the best way we can and i think sometimes it can be quite scary to go into an unknown field , because there is a big chance we might fail . but failure is always a possibility and is present through our whole life and we have to learn to deal with it , because if we all stick to what we do and do n't try out new thing , then the world would stop growing and developing and we would be inmerse in a place where there is no innovation . for instance , in bussiness , the best way to be successful is to come out with some product that nobody else ha , that make you unique . but most of the time , there is a big chance people wo n't like it . that 's why even if you do marketing study , there 's always a risk factor that involves making decissions based on what you believe in without knowing the result . and in spite of how difficult it look , it is necessary to keep going and make it happen , just to see how it turn out to be . in conclusion , the key to success is to innovate and take risk , this is the only way we will be able to build a better world , not only getting money , but also helping society , because in my opinion , success is not only defined by how rich you are , but by how much you have done for the world we live in .
