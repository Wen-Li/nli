nowadays , more and more people prefer to travel when they have holiday . is the best way to travel in a group led by a tour guide ? different people have different answer . as far a i am concerned , i totally disagree with the statement . travelling in a group ha three main negative function : rigid , expensive and boring . first , travelling in a group is not flexible . people going out for trip is for relax . however , travelling in a group sometimes make people feel more stress . people are busy during the workday . of course they do not wish a busy a usual when they are on holiday . there is a rigid timetable in a group . nobody will wait you if you sleep late or you want to stay in a place longer . if people go to travel alone , they can change their timeable anytime and do not need to waste time on these place where they do not like . in addition , travelling in a group is very expensive . travelling with a tour guide need to pay some more money to the guide 's instruction . it is a extra payment . people should save these money so that they can go to more place . guides usually take visitor to some special store for shopping . actually , the good in these shop are much expensive than nomal shop and most of them are old-fashion or have something broken . people want to use more money to make the trip more colorful . however , they can not get a equal service a they pay . finally , travelling in a group take off almost half fun of a trip . according to the recent research , people have more fun when they search the information of the place they will visit than visiting itself . people collect information from newpaper , tv program and internet and when they go to the place , they feel familar and more interesting . if travelling with a tour guide , there is no need to search the information because the guide will tell you everything about the place . all in all , takin into consideration i have discussed , travelling in a group is not the best way to travel . not only can not the timetable be changed , but also it is a waste of money and take off the interesting of searching a well .
