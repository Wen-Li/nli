in my opinion most of the young people enjoy life more than older people do . most young people are free in thinking and do not worry about their future a much a older people . they just live their life a it come and enjoy every minute , while playing with other kid . older people , on the other hand , mostly worry much about their future or the future of their kid and it is hard for them not to think of the future and the dangerous site of what their action . they worry so much about a point that they can not just enjoy life and the stuff they do . because of their background and the bad thing that might have happened in their past , they see new situation from an different ankle , and avoid them , instead of improving new thing and new way of life . there are many problem , such a money , job , or the comment of other people , that young people do not care about , because someone else ( mostly their parent ) worry for them . living in a society doe envolve a lot of difficulty , that young poeple when there is someone they like , they play together , even if there are different barrier like a different language . i think young people are more open to new thing and new people , which is an important fact of enjoying life . but not everyone is the same . there are older people who do not fear any situation and enjoy their life to an high age , just like young child , are open to every new step in their life and to every new person . they do not miss any opportunity of exploring something new , wether it is skydiving , traveling to a new country far away , or playing a new sport with their grandchild . but `` enjoying life '' ha a lot of different site and the variety of the word ` joy ' is differs from person to person . some people enjoy life by having a family and live a quiet life at their farm in the middle of nowhere . others like to live a `` starlife '' in hollywood or any other big city . even other people enjoy their life , risking their life everyday , by exploring any new extremsport . some people need a lot of money to enjoy their life , others do not . so the question is very difficult to answer . but from my point of view and my young background , i think that most young people enjoy their life more than older people , just because of the fact that they are more open and do not worry about their future a much a older people do .
