the statement given is that the young people in the modern society are not showing interest in helping the community . yes i agree with the statement mentioned due to many reason . one of the reason is that the student now-a-days are showing lot of interest in the enjoyment itself . they spend most of the time with their freinds and go to pub or some other place and spend time . now-a-days the culture is like this and even their parent are not showing interest in guiding the child . the young student prefer to spend most of their time in playing game . this is a great enjoyment for them . the other reason is that the people now-a-days became very competitive and the only aim for them is to reach the higher position and earn more money . so , in order to achieve this they are working more and more hour and they are not at all looking to help the social organisation . for example , i can consider my freind a he got wa recruited in social community office . here service should be done to old people and the child who lost their parent but the pay will be little le . he done the job for two month without willingness and gave up ultimately . he do n't have interest in sevice and he need more money . i think this is a good example for the above explanation . one more reason is that the mindset of the young people will be somewhat selfishness and always compare with the neighbouring people . what those people did , they want to do the samething and seek higher position . they wont bother about the society and the people who need some help from them .
