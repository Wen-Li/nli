i strongly agree with that statement . in thesedays there is a lot of car . the number of car on street is increasing and we can say each family ha at least one car . but after twenty year i think and i hope that there will be fewer car than now . because twenty year , it might be a short time , but now the speed of develop of science became very fast a well , and i am sure that in our future we will able to do most thing of our life and our work at home without moving . so we will not need the car a so many time a now . thanks to especially internet now we can do many thing at home . for example we can order some product which we want to buy directly using the e-commerce site , or we can send a letter using e-mail without going out for post office . personally i do n't like driving a car . i get stressed easily when i must park my car because of absence of free place or when there is a crazy traffic . in future i believe that there will be new type of transport such a the `` segway '' which is small , easy and very comfortable . it need just the electricity to make it work . so with introduce of these new transport invention i think we will need le the car . but i do n't think there will be much fewer car than now , i immagine that just a bit fewer . because twenty year is enough to make a change a i wrote at the begining , but i must say at the same time it 's not so long period . i will see after twenty year whether my opinion will be right .
