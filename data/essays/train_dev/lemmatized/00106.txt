i agree with that statemant . i believe that human 's mind control and power . strong mind can make do something difficult from the person . successful people always have a positive mind and strong mind . it is very important to people . so , they are not afraid adventure . it make try new thing to successful people . successful people know how to can be success . for example , i heard one story . it is story who a rich person . the rich man belive that he is going to die 50 year old . and he decided to spend his all money untill his death . the rich man wa ca n't stop his spend money . when his age becam 50 year old . he wa still alive . but he already became poor person . suddenly the rich man became homeless . he realized about his past day . and he started again work at 50 year old . when he wa 70 year old , we wa rich man again . he 's real life is started from 50 year old . when i heard that story , i so suprised . however , that story make me realized that successful is depend on person 's mind . and who once expirenced to success know how to do well . as such reason , i support that successful people try new thing and take risk rather than only doing wtat they already know how to do well .
