succes mean to invent new thing , which can be done by experiment and taking risk . it 's not only restricted to succesful people rather than to all people who are failure too . as succes come only by experincing opposite result . it will be new experience if we take risk and invent new thing . this boost our confidence and give a new experience . i agree that succesful people try new thing rather than doing what they already knew . firstly succesful people try new thing because a already they tasted succes in their life this give confidence to work more by taking risk . scientists are good example for taking risk and trying new thing . if scientist doe n't try news thing then we wont be able to access the invention which they made like pencillin , steam engine by james watt , aeroplane by wright brother and so on . secondly people try new thing in which they get new experience . if a person is doing a know work for a past few year this not only make him boring but also loss his interest in that work . while experimenting new thing we can get more knowledge in the subject which give u soul satisfaction . today we recognise scientist by their work , but we do n't recognise a daily worker in a factory . experiments are done by taking risk like astromer who take high risk while travelling other planet or solar system , in between they may loose their life 's by having collision with other planet or by some technical problem . best example for this is the well know astrnomer kalpana chawla , who did a various experiment by taking risk . her experiment to land in space gave huge information of which a common people is not familiar with . an intellectual person is well recognised by his work . a person is seen by his achievement which he had contributed to society hence , i totally agree that succesful people try new try thing and take risk to invent new thing for social well being .
