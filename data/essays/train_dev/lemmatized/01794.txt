in the recent year , i 've travelled a lot around the world and learned about many different nation . i 've travelled mainly to the united states , europe and around the continent where i live , south america . many time you get lost or bored beacuase you are in a new place and with people you dont even know . so , i agree that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide . tour guide are generally very experienced people and often know a lot about the place you are visiting . they know very well , and have studied the different place you are visiting , and also , they will answer any question you would like to know . for example , i went once to a guided tour with some university friend to sao paulo , brazil . this experience wa amazing because in only six day i could learn a lot and maybe more of the history of the city than some native brazilian citizen . many people think travelling with a tour guide is too expensive , but the experience is worth of it . if you travel with a large group of people , you can divide the cost of the tour guide and you 'll definetely enjoy your trip . also , when you travel with a large group of friend , you will have remarkable and unforgettable experience of it . finally , i agree that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide because tour guide are very experienced people , you also enjoy the trip a lot with the group of people you are travellng with , and this way of travelling is not so expensive . i 've done this a lot of time and it ha worked out . what you can learn from a tour guide and the moment with your friend are memorable .
