we live in a world which is permanently changing for new technology is increasing everyday a the progrees of industry . but i will explain why i do n't think there will be fewer car in use than there are today despite that . i take an example ; if you look at the mobile phone ten year ago the first mobile wa very big , nowadays they tend to be smaller and smaller with much more option than before , but in ten year i think there wo n't be any mobile left for we will have tiny mobile stick in our jaw like it exists already in japan . on the contrary car exist since much long time than mobile phone and they are still here . the only which changed is that tey can go faster , that they have much more option like gps or abs and we feel more secure in it , itwenty year ther will be more car than now maybe because new one are going to be constructed . it is the type of car which change not the existence of the car itself contrary to the mobile moreover the presence of car doe not depend on time but more on the culture of each country . in london for example everybody is travelling by bus and there is nearly no car in the center of the town except taxi . and in holland everybody is biking whereas in the center of paris the street are crowded with car . in twenty year i think that nothing will have changed . to conclude the only reason which could provoke a reduction of the number of car would be that the government prohibits it use because of the pollution for example .
