nowadays , people are taught many thing including their own special subject . i think because people have strong desire of knowing everythings and the social want let them study various thing . however i stongly disagree with this statement . because it is not only wasting time and but also it make people get tired to study more about the subjest in which they specialize . let me give an example of my case . i specialized in classical music for bachelor course . during my college time , i had to take the lecture about not only music but also about social science lecture . the practice time wa lacked during this period . because my lecture schedule finished every 6 o'clock every weekday . i think that the musician can create the art when they well practiced and took enough rest . however i had to spend a time to study about thing what i do not really need for my music subject while i had to sit front of piano or go bed . in addition , i could waste not only time , but the energy in which i need to focus on my study wich i specialized . if i took too much time on studing other subjet that i think needle for pas the grade , i should easily get tired . moreover it make to not be emphazised on my specialized work . in conculusion , if people keep concetrate on what they specialized , the world get peacefull and they will thank to each other for helping them about they do not know .
