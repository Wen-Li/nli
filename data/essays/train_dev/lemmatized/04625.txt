some people think that the youth nowadays are not intersted in heiping their communitis . however , i stongly disagree with that opinion , for the following reason . first , a lot of young people including collegeate student and secondary school student are forced to help others by their school . most of the publich school have a regulation about the obligatory volunteer hour and they encouge student to experience to help people who are in need . in my case , to graduate both secondary school and university i had to do the obligatory volunteer . this is not a good case because there 's no my will but it can be helpful to experience and can give some motivation to student . to meet the need of the school curriculum , i had to do volunteer work for local community when i wa a secondary school student . even though it wa obligatory experience , i could take part in community program and i came to be interested in local problem and other people who are in need . moreover , these day a increaing number of young people would like to participate in volunteer work . they paricipate in their community problem by joining some organization such a extra-curricular club in campus or non-governmental organization . through the organization , i have been able to be a mentor to a young criminal who ha been under the probation by ministry of justice . when i wanted to join that program , i wa surprise by seeing a lot of university student who applied for this organization to be a volunteer work . nowadays , a lot of organization set up and they are managed by lot of volunteer worker . we need to keep watching their behavior . even though , they could start the volunteer work to meet the school need , it can be lasted because of their strong will .
