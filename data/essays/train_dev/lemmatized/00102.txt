i agree , i belive in a saying that state `` high risk equal high return '' . from eralier course i have taken in school i learned that one should place their egg in different basket , which mean that investment should be invested in different new idea instead of concentrating on one sort of new business or idea . one can never grow and develope if they keep on preforming what they already know how to do well , inorder for somone to grow and develope they must try new thing , take chance , and make mistake . for example , when a baby first learns how to crawl and becomes very good at it , the baby is never gana crawl for the rest of his life so the baby will take the risk of walking , even tough the baby will fall several time , the baby will try again and again that 's where not being afraid to make mistake come in . the baby can not run unless it can walk , this point emphasis the imnportance of taking risk to achive great success . there are a lot of example one can speak about , for example . for example , bill gates a well recognized business man in the united states started off with a business idea in college , and instead of continuing his study he took his idea and put it into action , he now is the owner of an internationally recognized computer software company microsoft . microsoft is always taking risk and introducing new idea and trying new thing in the market causing microsoft to still grow and strive in the market . trying new thing is never a risk i belive , how can somone have potentail to grow and strive in today economy if one is not willing to take initative and try new thing . failling should never hold someone back from succeding in something but it should be a lesson to learn from to do well next time one try again .
