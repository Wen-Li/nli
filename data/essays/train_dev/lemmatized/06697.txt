i agree with partly , in twenty year there will be fewer car in use . using car past twenty year increase rapidly . now these twenty year car are not in use because of obsolence and out of fassion . it could be true in developed country because of their living standard are high a compare to the developing country . they are prefer to by new one with more up graded technology and new fassions . in developing country like india car use after their life wa expried . these could happen only the economical condition . in developed country like usa their car do not meet their requirement they simply go for another one , which they have provided . india like country most of the car are in use after the twenty year . here the people living condition are low a compare to the developed country . because of the economical condition not allow to change their vehicle . now the it boom ha to give a scope to change their attitude towards their purchasing . in india after it revloution and mnc 's people earning power ha increased . computer professional are looking only to purchage new technology car . it 's lead use of car is increase . in developed country like usa is not big problem to maintain a car , even student are using car . their get car cheaply a compare to in india . fuel avialablity are is there . there is few disadvantage a well a advantage to use car . today every one use car and making fuel consumtion . after some year there will a problem to face to lack of fuel . we can not give better world to our future generation . now already exit the lacking in oil resource . my suggestion to my view point is to make better life with effect environment . using more car will produce more pollution , please avoid the over pollution a possible a .
