well i would agree on that statement in some occasion or education level in life , for example at school , but would usually disagree with it when it come to studying in a university . a student having general knowledge would have many basic information in many subject , which seems to me a an advantage , but not all the information a a student specialized in a certain major or subject . having broad knowledge in an academic is realy benificial i life and may help , but i would preffer to have a specialized major because it will , or i think it would , offer more job for me to choose than that of a person with general knowledge and i would or can specialize in that subject more implies i could gain the master and then the doctorate degree more easilly . some people other than me would judge me a inccorect and would assign that having general knowledge might improve my life more than that of a specialized one , but nowadays people tend to get specialized or would rather have a major than having onformation on various subhjects that might have a negative impulse towards how that individual is beeing taught . looking at people in many country having many major might make a variaty and help people do what or learn what they want instead of having to learn information he/she doe not want to or have difficulty in and do not want to complete with
