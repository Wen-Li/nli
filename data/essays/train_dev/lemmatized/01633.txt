people are doing thing in different way and they learn new thing and face the consequence from that thing . different people are doing in different manner . successful people try new thing and take risk . some people are doing what they know and how to do well . these people are not taking any advice from other people . those people are not fairly success in their career . but successful people are always trying new thing and take risk from that and get well on that . for example successful people are always trying the new thing and take risk from that experience and from that experience they will try again and finally they succeed on that . some time these people are trying new thing and risk are more from that . these risk are some time giving the negative result and will give the negative consequence also . but these consequence will give the good lesson for doing again that experiment . they know the where it is the mistake and where it is correct for getting the good result . i agree with this statement successful people try new thing and take risk rather than only doing what they already know how to do well . for example i have seen one of my professor he wa doing always the new crossing in different crop . he always try to do that which character are crossed with character and how it improve the yield parameter in that crop . he always try this crossing and face some of the risk in that crossing programme and finally his release the varities of rice . from this onwards i thought successful people are always trying new thing and face the riska and finally they get on well that experiment .
