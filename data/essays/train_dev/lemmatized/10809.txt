this question are very difficult , i mean that now are different the style of life that in the past . for this are false a credential that now the young people not give enought time to helping their comunity . for my experience in the past the young people ha le time to think at the community why at the age of 14 ear the child grow up in a man , he are forced to do to work , he are forced to help his family and he ha not many time for the community . now the society are completly different the child go to school so mutch that the past , and he ha a different mean . i speak for the personal experience i 'm going to the social group an i help the childrens to make a home work and to have a great space et time to play with a friend . for me are really special to help a childrens in her formation and i like to continue in my work for few year . are really too , that now is very difficult to reclute a child , normally are in her house with a video game and the grandparent . after this with a friend 's group i 'm going , in a little part now , with a exame and the university i have le time to spend whit her , in a meeting and convetion that speak about book , theatre , and cinema . this too in a minor part increase the aspect of integration with a community . but are rare to have other person and other friend that make the same way that i cross , now the style of live think at the individual person and to grow up your personality , in difficult to see lot of person that help other . .. but not all word are the same . in the end i dont have a great answer i ha describe my situation but are very difficult comparize the same aspect in different sociology and culture era .
