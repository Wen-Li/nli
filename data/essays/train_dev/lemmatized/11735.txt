i think that a person who want to be someone ha always to make important decision and take risk doing choises . he ha to start from what he know , but he ha to try something new to be satisfied and to achieve a great success : this is what make the difference bettween normal people e succesful people . in the past much people had taken risk and thanks to them now we can turn of the light , write on our computer , take a plane or drive a car : if the world look only at the past and people live without try to discover something new , the future will never come . a person 's success dipends on the ability of looking at the future and understanding what the future hide ; if there 's no one who want to do somenthing new and everybody continue to do what we already know , there will be no success and no innovation and the world will never change . even if i agree with the statment , i think also that the present is important too and is unusefull try to do something new without know how to do well what we just know . i think also that is important take risk to achieve success without damaging anyone : so it 's important that everyone tryes and take risk using coscience .
