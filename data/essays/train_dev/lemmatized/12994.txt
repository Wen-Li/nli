as many specialist stress it , the countless number of car in north-american and european country is likely to stabilize and might even begin to whittle down in he next twenty year , because of environmental and energetical issue that make the use of car much more expensive than what it used to be when nobody wa interested in those problem . there are city , such a london or paris , which create new law so that it becomes very expensive and unpractical to drive in town centre . i believe that the united state will soon change some of it habit and take similar measure . on the one hand , i disagree with this point of view a many research scientist are on the verge of major scientific breakthrough that should enable mankind to switch to environment respectful technique such a all-electrical car or hydrogen energy . the ever growing interest for sustainable development may deal with these issue in western country . on the other hand , i am much more pessimistic about poor country , especially fast-developing nation like china or india where people are beginning to have access to car . even though the high price of crude oil are partly a consequence of the instablity in the middle-east , we must no forget that china is another reason a it use of petroleum is rocketing . there are hundred of milllions of chinese people who will probably be rich enough soon and buy a car . but all the new energy technology figured out by scientist are going to be far too expensive for those people to use in the next twenty year so that they will probably buy regular car and participate in the plight . even though science is the solution to the rocketing number of car , i believe that the development of many asian , south-american and african country is likely to paricipate in this issue . the opposite evolution will need much more than twenty year to be achieved .
