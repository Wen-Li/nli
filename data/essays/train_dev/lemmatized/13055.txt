in every country we go , there is a large number of car , but this figure will decrease in the future . i think that in twenty year , there will be fewer car in use than there are today . nowadays there are so many car in the world that we will be forced to abandon them in the future . there are certain factor that i want to point out that will favour this decrease . first of all , i think that it will be imposible for everyone to have a car . the car price but specially the petrol price will go up steadily in the future : the fuel is going up and up everyday , but it will get worse a they become scarce . petrol price are expensive now but they will be impossible to pay for a large number of people . the pollution will be another factor that will decrease the number the car in our street . we all have to be aware of the danger of the pollution that car produce . the car smoke is one of the key factor of pollution in many country . in is important to bear in mind that we are damaging the planet and soon this damamge will become irreversible . also , in a more practical approach , traffic will act a deterrent for many car buyer in large city . in the future , it will be impossible to drive in the city and more and more people will use the public transport . although there are many citizen using the public transport , it seems that figure will increase every year . regarding the public transport , citizen should put more pressure on government so they create an effective public transport network . in my opinion , if this objective is accomplished , people would rely in the public transport and would abandon the need of the car . in conclusion , i think that in twenty year there will be le car in our street than there are today . i think that we will need to consider these point in order to use or not use our car .
