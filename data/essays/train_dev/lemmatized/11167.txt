i do not agree nor disagree with the statement . traveling with a group led by a toure guide is intresting , the tour guied will stat information about the place we are visiting , so we can get knowledge on the place . also he is an expert with the famous place which attract visitores from different country , so we can denifit from his expierience . furthermoe , we will guarantee that we did not miss anyplace with in the tour . the beautiful part in traveling with group is we can share information about different cltuers from people all over the world . i like to learn about culture it is very intresting to find that some beleives that are forbbiden in some culture are allowed in others , therefore when people visit other country will knoe how to react with some people . for example certain word are allowed to be used in me country but not allowed in other contries , so when i visit that other country i would say a wored that would cause a big trouble for me on the other hand , when traveling in a group the individual will be tied up with the group , sometimes we need to spend some family time to explore the country weare visiting and try some restaurant , spend more time in a musiem and buy some sevoniers . in my opinion i will try both traveling ina group led by a tour guide or travel alon with my family , because each one of them ha it own experience and adventure that we can keep wonderfull memorise in our mindes , i would like in some day to visit all the lovley place that i heard from people . each individual ha a different point of view , and every person will make the right selection for themselves to enjoy what they can to make good time la
