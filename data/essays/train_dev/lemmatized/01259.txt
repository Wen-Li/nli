i agree that most advertisments make product seem much better than they really are . i sometimes buy the fashine magazine . when i read it , i have seen many advertisments . first of all , it is about the diet food . some people which tried it and sucsseeded the diet wa intervewed . many of them said that `` to be on diet is easy because it helped very much '' . other people said `` it is very delicious . i recommend it , so please try it once '' . the advertisments have also the picture before the person who try to use the diet food and after the person who tried to do it . i think i ca n't belive it . to be on diet is very difficult . i also think it is not good taste . few year ago , i attracted this advertisments , so i tried the diet food . it is written `` if you eat this , you can lose 3kg for one month '' . i trusted it , and i countine to do it , but i could n't lose my weight . the diet food say it is delicious , but it is not delisious . it taste the robber . second , it is the cell phone . when i buy the cell phone , i see the advertisments . it is reason why i can compare the many cell phone at once easilly . a lot of advertisments show how easy to use the cell phone . it also say a lot of function . in conclusion , i think a lot of advertisments make their product look better than ther really are .
