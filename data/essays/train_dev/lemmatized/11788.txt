there have always been varying opinons on the importance of learning fact or in contrast the understanding of idea while studying . in my opinion the way a student should handle his stdudying depends first very much on the relevant field of study . for example studying history requires the knowledge of certain historical data . these are fact tha have to be learned , they can not be derived frim the understanding of a concept . so there is an importance for the student to learn them . on the other hand studying economics , the are a lot of model and idea the student have to understand in order to be sucessful . those can no be learned . . but can the student of history gain success in his studying only by learning fact ? no he can not . he also ha to understand for example the strutures of ancient society . and can the student of economy be a good econimist just by understanding many of the econimic model and idea ? again no . there is also the need to combine this understanding with certain fact or formulars that simply have yo be learned . another important fact is also the type of person one student is . some people can keep fact they have read in their mind easily , but it hard for them to understand concept behind . others have diffculties in remembering fact , but are likely to draw right conclusion from concept they have understood once . so it can not be said that simply learning fact , or understanding idea is the key to sucessful studying . the solution should be a sensible mixture of the two extreme . depending on what the aim of studying is and also depending on what one 's preference and talent are .
