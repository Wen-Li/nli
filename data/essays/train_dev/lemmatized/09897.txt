although many advertisement try to make some product seem better , i do not agree with that they are succesfull . because the advertisement can not hide the reality . also people investigate the product with all detail before buying them . it is not very easy to make a product seem much better than they really are . so it may cause some problem which customer complain about . some advertisement may illustrate that their pruducts have awesome result . however , the truth can not be covered forever . if you buy something which promise a good result , you may be disappointed . because you want to see the the result which they offer in their advertisement . when you see the reality which is opposite , you will not suggest this product and it will cause to decrease the number of customer which may want to try it . also many people investigate the product before buying . they read the comment which are about the product and they want to see some formal certificate which guarantee claim of product . so they do not believe easily to advertisement . after they finish their searchings about the product , they pay money for the product . the advertisement are used for informing people about new product and technology . if advertisement do not reflect the reality , it can cause some problem . it can decrease the reputation of product . so the company get difficulty to increase their profit . i believe that most people agree with me . since life get harder and more expensive , people think second time before buying . so the advertisement can not be very efficient if they try to make the product much better .
