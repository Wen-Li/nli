i do n't agree that poeple saying to unbderstand the concept and idea is important that they learn form the fact . idea and concept are the major factor of learning , but not the overall . the reason i saying that is idea and concept are just a text or a sentenes . they were not alive . the main point of learning is learing how to live . there is a millian fo situation will happen in our life which the concept ca n't tell . let say a subject we widly studying - econ . there is a lot of concept in the economic text book , is n't it ? altough the student can memorize it , but could they recognize it ? i do n't think so , beause i have been this situation before . student can always memorize the concept when they are studying teh course . they could do really well in teh exam . however , could they answer you again at the next semestor ? maybe they would , but it would not happen at three semestor after . learning is about our whole life , but not for a moment only . we learn someting when we are young , then it would be a weapon for u to fight the hard time we have in the future . how about learning the fact or learning in the real life ? imagine how do you learn to walk ? i think is walking , right ? however , what is the reason we could memorize to walk for the whole life ? because we did walking every singlt day . well , let say an example to make more sense . compare with two man who are on the same age . one man have work about business for five year . the other one is just start his business but he did finish teh whole university business course . well , who do you think is the man could handle a hard-time ? the first man , for sure . becasue he got experience and the `` real '' ability . people wil say a good knowledge migh help a lot . yes , they are right . nevertheless , learning fact equal learning the way we use the concept and idea . that is the formula to be a succesful man .
