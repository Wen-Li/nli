advertisement is an assencial way to introduce product to the customer and to increase the usuage of the product so all producer advertice their product . they try to show their product a it is the best one among the others in the same class . so i believe that the advertisement make product seem much better than they really are because an advertisement do mention to good part of the product only rather than being objective and advertisement do not show the exact result reached by the product . first of all an advertisement mention the good part of the product only rather than being objective . producer want to show his product a it wa excelent , do not have any weaknes or do not have any harm . for excample there exist cosmetic advertisement on tv 's every day . advertisement indicate how a woman beautified by the hair dye , how attractive she becomes . but advertisement never mention the harm of the hair dye which cause cancer in long term usuage . so woman use this product without being aware of it harm , they form a better image for the hair dye in their mind than it is in real . secondly advertisement do not show the exact result that the product advertised result . they show the result which the pruduct must reach but not the result reached in real . for example let investigate an advertisement of a chemical , used for cleaning the dish . in advertisement , the dish washed by that chemical seem realy clean and they shine and it is also announced that chemical is cheaper than the others . when you by the pruduct and start to use , you faced with the result that your dish are not such clean . this mean you are missleaded . again the image of the product in customer mind is better than it is in real . as we see from the example and experiment in our daily life most advertisement make product seem much better than they really are .
