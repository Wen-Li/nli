we always heard that the young people are too lazy , that they spend too much time im front of their computer screen , chatting or playing video gamesand that they always refuse to work at home a i think those who said these word must have a look to all the activity the young people do to help the community before having such a this opinion . the first thing we should notice is that the youth is the synonym of art , creativity and imagination . most of the teenager are interested in urban art , music or at least cinema . when they go outside to the cinema or to a concert , they are directly involved in the artistic life . a lot of teenager play a music instrument , sing or play theater . it 's an efficient way to devellop art , to improve the artistic production . for instance , wall graffittis were considered few decade ago such a a teenager 's occupation without any artistic value . however , they are considered nowadays like real artistic painting of this original urban art . rqp music music wa considered also a a '' bad '' music but it becomes nowadays a real art . in fact , we can see that the young people helped their community to improve their qrtistic skill and to create new one . in other word , they do n't lose their time whem they are listening to their own type of music or when they are drawing their specific draw . besides , we can add that the young help the society to improve it organization because they are the first one 's who react when something wrong happen . if the government take decision which go against the citizen , youth will be the first one who will be on strike to defend all the citizen right and the value that they believe in . for instance , when the french governement took a decision which made worker ' situation more impredictable , the young student went out in the street to demonstraste that this law went again their value . this example show that the young take time to defend the right of the community whem they see that the society is in danger . finally , we can see that young people denfnd their right and devellop the artistic activity . they are not a lazy a is generally said .
