i agree with that it is more important for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact . students should understand the idea and concept , so they can know the answer . and if the student dind n't do that , they will have no choice to do taht again . students understand idea and concept can develop their knowledge . during they thinking for the reason , they can know how to answer it . for example , the teacher let the student to do their homework , only write the reasn . so a lot will copy theirclassmates ' homework . that is unuseful . but if theteacher to tell the student to write down how they answer those question , so the student must do that by themselves , that will give the student a lot of hep . students can know that how to answer the question . for example , when the student understand the idea and concept , that mean they also can know the way to answer those question . that can give them a lot of help for their future . the student always know the thing from understand something , that can make them to know that thing clearly . for example , it like that people can learn thing from doing that . that can make them to know that more easier and clearly . let the student to understand the idea and concept are also can make them to know a lot of thing about the life . for example , to understand the idea can make them know that it is life . in their life , they must still find the way to answer all the qwuestion . they must use the different way to answer the different question . no body can help them expect themselves . the student ca n't learn fact expect they understand the idea and concept . if they did n't understand the idea and concept , they would n't learn the right fact , they will not understand the fact , so when that time , they will have the wrong thinging for the fact . so that is important for the student to understand idea and concept . they can study how to have their life and can know more knowledge from that .
