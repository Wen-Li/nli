sometimes the slogan of travel agency , mall , public instituations state something like : `` enjoy your life because you are young ! '' but what doe this say . are only young people enjoy their life and the younger do not ? the young generation always try to enjoy life a much a it can be . means their daily life is planned . and this plan are made to enjoy the life . this can start with sleeping long , travel to different city , shopping and having party . the young people enjoy this . zoung people know what thez can get out of their life and how to enjoy it . but what about the older peole . don t they enjoy their life a well ? well at least the older people i know enjoy their life a well . the life of the older sometimes appears to the younger generation a not that much excited , funny and just great . they just enjoy other thing about what the younger generation would think of is boring and lame . for example going for a walk in the forest or playing card is just fun for them . when younger people see older one who are meeting e.g. in a cafe the younger one are thinking that it would be boring to hang out there . but the older one do not see it like this . they enjoy their time together and appreciate the company of the others . it can be said that it really depends on your personallity if you enjoy your life or not . sometimes young and older people say that do not have pleasant life . it too stressfull and absolute no fun at all . they think that their life in not enjoyable . it can happen that younng people say they wish to be old to have time to enjoy their life and the other way round . to sum up it can be said that it is not a fact of age to enjoy life . it just your on attitute towards life ! so , enjoy it !!!!
