i agree to the opinion of need for having broad knowledge of many acadeic subject . reasons are a below . first , we usually experiece lot of situation and meet so many people everyday for whole life . to resolve problem from them and answer many question , we need know various subject regarding respective case . in case of me , i am responsible for purchasing departsments in company . i should buy so many item used for various purpose . i must learn about equipment , energy , electricity , and so on . for each product purcahsed , i need specific information and study without stopping . second , one who have only studied the specfic subject can not think with creativity . academic subject have somthing in common , but also difference . they can be exchanged between each other and improve themselves and invent new one . for example , medical category meet music and can make new academic territory that make patient better with musical instrument or music . finally , the one with broad knowledge can enjoy his life . he can choose job and plan for life freely because he ha basic competive skill for various category . he have more possibility for his life than others . if one had many academic background , he could quit his current job and experience new work for life . ii did not take much time for changing because of his preparance . now , i dream new world for future . for that , i restarted my study and try to broad my knowledge for various subject . it need my effort and time , but deserve it .
