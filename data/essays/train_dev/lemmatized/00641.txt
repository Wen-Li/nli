i completely agree with the statement you have made . the company make big investment either on research and development or their worker and they think that it is their right to gain economical benefit out of this by mean of advertisement . first of all , there are many brand in the market that sell product in the same area of interest . as a consequence of this , the firm need to diversify their product among others and they make use of the advertisement . although a product of one firm is n't good enough and well qualified , one may be astonished to watch this advertisement trailer on a television and make a decision to buy that product even if he/she doe not need it . secondly , in order to persuade the customer that they have the best product presented in the market , these firm invest much money on the production of an ad . they work with professional when developing the movie , hire famous people and celebrity that are appreciated and loved so that these celebrity make the people believe that the product they are presenting ha cutting edge quality and reasonable price . these people also aim the child and the youth who are easily get affected and have great influence on their parent when they are making a purchase decision . these company have a great knowledge in human psychology so they are trying to do their best to persuade the customer and make their product sold . they also arrange some campaings that would attract the people . next , after your purchase you may see that the product you have bought is not a good a it wa seen on television . some firm are trustable and some are not and a a result of this you might feel disappointed . as a result , company try to sell their product and make money and the thing that a customer should do is to buy from a trustable company and prefer it product ,
