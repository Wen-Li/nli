according to statement , which say that `` in twenty year there will be fewer car in use than there are today . i disagree with this statement because car is the basic mean of travel , no matter how many wheel they are , there can be two . three , four wheeled car . the car are the basic mean of transportation , travel , for certian emergency and to many more thing and i think so in the coming year we can say that their can be more sophisticated car , because the science and technology ha been improving day-by-day . before driving a car one should know the signal and precaution so that their can be no harm to the person . we can get many developed car like there can be many thing like reducing the size of the car and giving more spacious car and comfort for the passenger to seat . may be in the coming year we can get car that are automatic like we do not need to have `` key '' to it can be started by and simple button . in the coming year , the company can make the car which are more conveneint for parking and the type of colour and the difference in the quality . now-a-days , because of increase in the car we can see many traffic jam and which cause to different type of pollution like sound , smoke . these cause can be very hazardious to the human being and even can kill a man . so science may find way to make these solved . in the coming year we can see that the company can change the fuel used by the car and the technology can discover many useful gas which ha many advantage and can save the uncontrolled level of pollution to a decreased level . so i think that car can improve better way and can make the life of the human in a good way
