according to me what i believe is specialization in one specific subjest . while doing specialization on one specific subject we will be knowing deep subject contained in it . and it is very easy to understand when deeling with one subject rather with many . if we want to have broad knowledge of many academic , it will have a great complication while doing that . but if we study one specific subject there wont be such difficulty . having a knowledge and broad knowledge will make a difference . so having knowledge it mean general awareness on many academic is possible and compulsory . for example if we take child , i mean from 4 to 14 year they will be learning about many subject but not broadly . and when we take arround 15 to 17 age group student they are restricted to study only on few subject and when we take 17 to 21 age grouped student that is undergraduation study will restrict the student to choose only one subject . and in graduation level they are asked to choose only one branch in that subject studied in the under graduation level . this is all because our education system is designed in such a fashion . they are decorated based on the experince the educated people and scholers ha on the education system . well i think scholers will not go wrong . finally i would like to convay that specialization on one specific subject will give more command and authority on that suject rather than to have broad knowledge of many academic which will ultimately lead to confusion and le command , authority and grip on many subject .
