in our society , education is a main issue . on the one hand , people think that the education should promote a broad knowledge of many academic subject . on the other hand , people think that society need more specialist . however i believe that we should specialize in one specific subject . one reason for my belief is that we are all generalist . we have all a knowledge on everything . this knowledge is more or le accurate , it depends on the person . for example , when i have an headache , i never go to the doctor , i only take an aspirin . i have a whole knowledge on medicine care . another reason for my belief is that the society need to increase it knowledge . specialist are the only people who are able to entertain to the development of the society . others copy what they have learn form the specialist . for instance when i am ill i need the doctor , for his advice . but after , when i have the same ill i just need to take the medicine drug . finally , specialist are the actor of the development of the society . with their sharp knowledge in only one field , they are the only people who are at the border between what ha been discovered and what ha not yet been discovered , in this field . to illustrate a researcher in developement of a product for a firm . he ha no concrete idea of what he will create because there are nothing similar uim society . but he is sure that is new product had never exist before . this product represent a new thing to add in the human culture . society have a lot of generalist , but few specialist . because society need more specialist and because i prefer to be useful for the society , i would rather to be a specialist .
