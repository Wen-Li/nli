i agree with the statement that most advertisement make product seem much better than they really are . i will explain why i think so in following passage . first , advertiser think what to do to sell more product everytime . advertisements are one of the way to sell product . when the advertiser make advertisement , which advertisement is able to attract hart of consumuer product seem very good or not so much ? exactly prior one is able to get hart of the consumer . second , consumer might hesitate to buy product if the product seem worse than advertisement which they saw . but first of all , advertiser have to meke consumer feel to buy product . if the consumer do n't think to buy the product , they wo n't buy anything abslutoly . also , if advertisement are not able to attract consumer 's hart , the consumer wo n't think to buy product on the advertisement . so advertiser have to attract the hart of the consumer first of all . in conclution , advertiser want to sell much more product . to do so , they have to attract hart of consumer . it is needed by advertiser to make product seem much better than they really are on advertisement . i agree with the statement that most advertisement make product seem much better than they really are .
