the choice and the preference between a broad knoledge of many acedemic subject and a deep knoledge of a specific subject represents a classical topic to which it is difficult to give an answer and that involves , particularly , people who have to image , think and/or implement an ideal educational model . according to the human nature and considering how spread and various it is , i think that a knoledge of many topic could be more coherent and offer a better level of satisfaction and benefit to everyone . focusing on many subject , people have the opportunity to discover aspect of the world that otherwise they will never know . moreover , i think that a preference for a spread academic knoledge is also useful to develop complete and reasonable judgement about thing that , coherently with the technical and scientific progress , are becoming more and more complex . on the contrary , a specialized knowledge of one specific subject ha certainly some advantage : for example , it allows to become an expert for some question and probably to know some detail about a discipline that no one know . but the risk is also that this knowledge is too much isolated , without sufficient contact with other type of knoledge , sometimes and potential helpful also in academic field of interest . on the basis of my consideration , but also considering the global movement toward an academic activity with a network frame , i support the opinion that a broad knowledge of many academic subject is probably more interesting and powerful .
