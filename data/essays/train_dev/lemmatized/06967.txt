some people believe that the number of the car will decrease , while others do not think so . in my opinion , the total amount of the car will diminish largely because the people gradually realize that too many car will cause serious problem . the first reason for my viewpoint lie in the fact that nowadays more and more importance and attention have been attached to the problem cause by car . for example , the car caused the serious environmental problem like the air and water pollution . moreover , the car cause too much noise which largely affect our sleeping and study . in addition , the increasing car have used a relativley high rate of the precious oil on which our quotidian life and industry development depend . these detrimental problem brought about by the car , if not handled in time properly , will lead to a series of severe consequence . luckly , we have seen a lot of endeavor and effort to solve the problem of car by both the government and public . for instance , the government ha offered enough financial support for a lot of scientist to invent new vechiles . what 's more , the medium like the newspaper are trying their best to call for the public and the student to ride the bus to go to work . these effort may be effective to decrease importance of the car and reduce the total amount of the car in the future . of course , we should not ignore or underestimate the difficulty involved in the reducing the number of car . the car is one of the most effective and convinent way of trip . many people want to purchase a car because they want to work or go anywhere anytime . they will not be restricted by many outside factor . they may think the car a the status of the themselves in the society and do not take into account the car in a pratical way . all in all , the issue about the car is the a complex one that need the analysis on the case-by-case basis , accordingly all three reason mentioned above intertwine to form a whole organic becoming more persuasive that any of them . in the final analysis , though the danger of car call more attention increasingly , it is also important for u to change the feeling of the car in the public ' mind to reduce the nuymbers of the car .
