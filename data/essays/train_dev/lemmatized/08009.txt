i am in the agreement with the statement that young people enjoy life more than older eople do . when young , every individual ha the energy , zeal , passion and strength to enjoy the life . its the exuberance of youth that always motivates one towars more colorful side of life and thats what lack in the older people . in the age of teen , every individual ha a desire to experience the life to the fullest . he aim high to achieve his goal . he study hard to get into a good university . after getting enrolled , he plan well and again study hard with great perseverance to get a good score and finally a degree that will provide him the platform to move further ahead in life . after he get a satisfactory job or start some business , he want to settle in life with a loving and caring spouse . taking responsibility and standing by them give him the immense pleasure of being successful . so he is always in process of making life better . when he is 30 to 35 , he plan for his kid , their schooling , their upbringing in a better environment . and a the time pass he becomes weak and old , not strong enough to take care of his family . rather he becomes dependent on his child for his small need . surrounded with health troublems , he rarely get anytime for enjoyment . but not neglecting those special exceptional case that justifies the quote `` your age is what you feel '' . a well planned and organised life can definitely expircate the weekness of oldage . neglecting the negative aspect of oldage , if one loks towards the postive facade , it the oldage that make the life complete . older people do enjoy life with their grandkids , friend , betterhalves , livelyness of the garden in which they stroll and many more .
