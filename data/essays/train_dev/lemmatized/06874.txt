i am agree the most advertisement make product seem much better that tehy really are for following two reason , the most of advertisement make their product look better then they are , the advertisement hired good looking and body to deceive the specially people , first of all , most of advetisements make their product look so fine . for example , mc donald always show the people eat energiclly food in the moring and it will provide the nutrition in a day . but they did n't say how fat per chicken , if you eat two meal in the morning , how much weight you will gain . moreover , the nike company they hired the sport star to do exercise and show it on tv , but it is not to demostrate if we wear the specially product , we will become expert in this area . second , most of advertisement , they always foucus the distinguished gruop of people and show the grest idea in it . for instance , in my country , they have an organization for fat people , they made a special plan for each person and promise it will sucessfully to lose your weight in a month . they hired the model who have good looking and body and claimed if you take this plan , you will have good sheap like them . however , it always not exactly to follow the plan they made , so they sued each other . in summary , most of advertisments make product seem much better than they really are is the ture . the orgainzation , nike company and mc donald are just the few example that i meation it .
