yes , i agree that the author primafacy recommendation is militating . successful people try new thing and take risk rather than only doing what they know already how to do well . firstly , successful people try to do new thing and they want to innovate some thing for others . for instance i admire dr.adul kalam ajad . he is one of the great , scintilllating and dynamic strongconsistancy person in india . he is one of the successful person . actually he wa a techer in a school . but his anxiety and strong determination make him now a president of india . though he is a successful person but he dont want to do what he already known . he wa great scientist in india . secondly , the other example is nelson mandela . he is a great leader in south africa . he had imprisoned for twenty year . even though his experience made him a his dream strong and deterministic . at finally he can achieved the independence of his country . so he is my one of the great leader . at present he is working a a president position of u.n.o.even he is also a great succeessful person . but he never think that only doing what they alredy know how to well . thirdly , gandhiji is god for india country . by his only his effort made now india is on at present position . his slogan is peace for all thing all over the world . he is also a great succeessful person thst ever known . so according to my view succeessful make people and think innovatively . so try to think positive dont think negative . go ahead and for u r dream . jai hind .
