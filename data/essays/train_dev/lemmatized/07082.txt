i agree with the statement that is the best way to travel is in a group led by tour guide , but not always , a for the statement , there are advantage and disadvantage . starting with the advantage , going with a group of people and a tour guide will prevent you from being lost , or even being stolen . also it is much more fun to go with a group , like a group of friend or mate from a certain class . as a matter of fact , staying alone will also increase the danger for an individual because he might get stolen or robbed . but there are also certain disadvantage for a tour with a group with a tour guide , althought it will be fun , it might be much expensive than touring individually , but also any person will just feel dependent on the tour guide , or even if he ha a certain job to go by himself he will face trouble and how to start like booking a hotel , renting a car , going to a resturant , also he wo n't be able to discover something new , like he wo n't be able to make friend , nor he will be able to talk to anyone except if he wa alone or with a partner , in my opinion , i would prefer to go for the first time with a group and a tour guide , and then when i will be familiar with the place i think i would try to go alone and figure everything by myself because it will taste differently . in addition to going alone , going with a group of friend is really exciting , a i had tried it once when we went with my friend to europe for vacation , althought we had n't a tour guide but it wa fun exploring thing alone and trying them , and looking at the fine place , and by asking you can reach any place you want to reach .
