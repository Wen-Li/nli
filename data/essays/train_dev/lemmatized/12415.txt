people is talking about controversials thing or topic . one of these topic is if the next twenty year will be fewer car or not . some people support the idea that there are going to be le car and othres have reason to think that the number of car will go down . on one hand those who support the idea that it will be fewer car in the future , they think that oil is not going to be a cheap a today . so if people have to pay more it will be not so used . they also think that oil is not going to be there for ever . lastly the public transport is getting more popular than the car , that in big city is slower on the other hand , the people that support that the number of car is going to increase or at least by the same . firstly because is the main way to move and people is used to it , and changing that is dificult . they also think that car company will change oil for other energy , that it will be cheaper an cleaner . lastly they think that car industry is too strong to stop it . i support the idea that it will be fewer car in the future . firstly because of the oil the car need . not only because of the price also i think that people is reallising that car consume too much oil , what is bad for the air that we breath . secondly i think that publis transportatio is getting better ( at least in madrid , spain ) , so some time is faster than the car , and sure that is cheaper than driving .
