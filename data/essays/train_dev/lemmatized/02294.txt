that young people enjoy life more than older people is certainly a highly unqualified statement . one can almost never make such broad and sweeping generalization . having said that , however , i do believe that younger people on average tend to have an easier time enjoying life than older people do . i epmhasize the word `` on average '' , since there clearly are example of vivacious , joyful elder that are much happier than glum , dejected teenager . therefore , being old doe not necessarily mean being incapable of enjoying life , whereas being young doe not guarantee happiness . however , i have reason to believe that being young make it easier to enjoy life . the first and most obvious explanation for this is health . younger people are bound to be healthier than older one : their immune system tend to be stronger , the time that it take for younger people to recover from wound and disease is shorter and their motoric ability are stronger . young people can therefore engage in a variety of activity that they characterize a fun , whereas the elderly are prevented by their aformentioned disadvantes from doing so . take my grandmother ; she used to be an active hiker . she would stop at nothing , and even conquered one of the highest mountain in europe , the mont blanc . however , with increasing age ( she is 76 now ) her bone and joint would no longer support any such activity : she decided , therefore , to abandon hiking . of course , this did not plunge her into a depression ; nonetheless , it represented a sacrifice and deprived her of one source of pleasure . i can not overemphasize , however , the risk of jumping to conclusion based on this example ; the statement `` young people enjoy life more than older people do '' still remains unqualified . to come back to my grandmother : with her resourcefulness , she managed to find source other than hiking that give her enourmous pleasure . she found out , for instance , that she loved playing backgammon and even joined a club . she rediscovered her love of reading , an activity that she ha n't pursued intensively due to her many distraction . one could say that she a just a happy now , at age 76 , a she wa when she wa still young . it is clear from these example that one happiness ultimatley depends oneself , rather than on one 's age . nonetheless , old age doe impose restriction that require one to be resourceful and vivacious if one seek to retain happiness . not everyone can muster these thing . my conclusion is , therefore , that young age doe make it easier to enjoy one 's life even though one 's individual character is the ultimate factor .
