the choise between giving more importance to the understending of the idea or to pay more attention in the learning of fact regarding student 's preparation is a point hightly discussed inside school and university by teacher and director . it is true that to learn fact is the basement for whatever kind of knowledge in every field . student need to study fact ; in this way they can face and compare the difference between the notion they learned . this is a starting point in the building of the cultural background of each person . otherwise understanding idea offer a real and a pratical way to cheack if student get completely the concept they are learning that is definitly important a well . to provide a deep understanding of concept and idea allows student to grow up inside , to judge the world , the past event and the current affair in a very open minded way . it help them to developp thei personality and their way of thinking . my personal opinion on this topic is to do n't proivilege one system to an other . i definitly think that they are both essential in the ppreparation of a student and that they should be used in a very balanced way . the importance of learnig fact is something that ca n't be doubted from muy point of view but it is also true that in many case student that just lern notion without understanding the real concept and idea that came from these notion are not able to connect this concept to the real world and to use them to grow up . they remains simple machine full of important notion that are not only able to live their life in a producive way but also to use thenotions they learned to improve their life .
