ever consider that what the world will look like if there is no expert on medicine , computer sciece and engeers ? why would a company hire someone if he or she just have a general knowledge or without certain special skill ? can you imagine the rapid development of morden sciecen and technology whithout specialized knowledge ? i really believe that people should have sbjects in specialized field . firstly , mordern society need a proper distribution of worker group that have special skill and serve a special purpurses . in fact it is the expert from differen area that give u the life facility . if all the people have a general knowledge in our society , there will be specialized madical service , convenient trasport system . secondly , it will be very helpful for people to get a job if he have been trained in special area . certain company deal with certain issue concerned with our life . if you have a very deep and specialized skill , you are more likely to be heired by a company . on the other hand , if all the people have the same trainning with the same background knowledge , it is hard to say that company will benefit from their stuff ' comman performance . finally , the constant accumulation of knowledge of certain specialty need the constant effort that expert have to contribute . every single acdemic specialty need new improvement of it own . if every one have the same background , it is hard to believe that science will be going on . in fact , knowladge of special field brings a much deep understanding of certain area . however , people should , in some distance , have a general information about what the whole world is like . a general knowledge will cast some idea to special area . for example , biologist get the concept of computing the huge information presentede by thousand of billion of dna code . and also , a broader interesting about the world will give people a more freer and opener mind . but if we caculate the whole advantage of speicial subject , i would claim that special training should be obtained , only for the benefit of the society and ourselves .
