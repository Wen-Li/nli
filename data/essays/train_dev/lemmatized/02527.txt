advertisements usually make product seem much better than they really are . when a person walk down the street or is walking around in a mall , they are able to see all kind of flyer that exageratet the best characteristic of the product they are advertising making them look better than what they are . from my personal experience i can say that this is true . once when i wa around twelve a company called me to see if i wanted to do a comercial for a new cookie that wa going to be sold in panama . since i wa a kid and they were going to pay me , i said that i would do it , no problem . when i got to the place , they handed me a script , i wa suppose to eat the cookie , and it didnt matter if it wa good or bad but i had to pretend that i liked it anyway . i went to work with other kid that were going to make that cookie look good . when we started filming , instead of handing u regular cooky out of the box they were special cooky , these were taken appart and they had been added double fudge , so they lookked better , and they were made presentable by some guy who wa fixing the vanilla fudge inside the cookie with a knive . instead of u using normal cooky from the package , they had to make special cooky that looked better than what they reallt tasted , because i can surely say that the cooky looked good but they didnt really taste that good . not only this happens with food but also with toy . for example the hot wheel comercial for kid look great . on tv you would think the car are able to do flip and land back on track and keep going no problem , but once you buy that item , the thing fall appart . the wheel of the car start falling , it jump out of the track to never land on it againa , and to put the track together is almost a hard a trying to build a rubiks cube . in conclusioin items in advertisement always look better than what they really are , so people can sell them . this is a selling technique , but you have to be careful , because you can exaggerate what an item doe , but you can make it up . therefore , to be able to sell something , in the advertisement it ha to look better than what it really is , and that is what people usually do , and based from my experience i think that is exactly what go on .
