since the middle of the 20th century , car have become a significant part of the daily life of human . consequently , most of the people are not able to imagine a life without a car . in my following essay , i would like to introduce to you my point of few on whether the use of car in the early future will decrease or not . in the first place , we should have an in-depth view of the main function of car . like everybody can guess , it is transportation . a car help u to reach place , where we want to go in a pretty short time . for me personally , that mean to be independent from others . the possibility to drive wherever i want to drive and which way i want to take give me some sort of freedom . on the other hand , i can drive to the university , without needing to take public transportation , which signalizes once again dependency for me . besides of that , we should not forget , that there are also enthusiastic driver among u , who never leave their car unwatched . for these kind of people , a car represents a hobby , in which they like to invest all of their free time . the last , but i think most important fact is , that research is working on finding out alternative energy source . examples , which are already in use , are electronical or solar drive , which do not need the `` classical '' petrolium . through these and upcoming future invention , car driving will become much cheaper , which will have the consequence , that more and more people will decide to drive car . maybe petrolium and gas will get more expensive , but in maybe le then 20 year , there will be created cheaper alternative energy source for car .
