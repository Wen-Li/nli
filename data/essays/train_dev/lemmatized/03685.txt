i strongly agree with the statement `` it is important for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact . '' students are required to understand idea and concept . the main reason for this is the idea are going to increase the way they think and the concept help them to implement their taughts . the lecturer should teach student for getting idea for new thing from there childhood . they should give some question and tell them to implement their taughts . such that their brain get more idea when they see or come to know about a perticular point . suppose for an example let u take a topic in mathemetics , there are many way to solve one perticular problem . here come picture of idea the , student think in many different way to solve a perticular problem any how , these can be implemented only by concept but not fact . and puzzle con be solved by implementing different idea . suppose a puzzle ha many way then only idea can help him to find the right way . facts are that which have already taken place . facts can be learned by there own . one can gather fact from newspaper , magizines and many other place . facts are implemented earlier , before fact idea and concept are developed , with these development of idea and repeatly occuring of the same thing they were recorded a fact . some fact may help the student but with out concept these fact may not be understood clearly . facts are those they are already implemented . these can be read and know about them and can implement only up to a certain level . but , when an idea is striked it can be implemented by their own knowledge using concept . for example , scientist would read fact and keep in mind but they implement or invent new thing by their own idea and the concept they had learned . finally , we can conclude that fact are developed from the implementation of idea and concept .
