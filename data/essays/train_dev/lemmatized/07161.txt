specialisation and having a broad knowledge of many different subject are both equally important . both specialisation and general knowledge should co exist together for a society to evolve specialists are the people who study deeply about a specific subject . they try to gain a much knowledge of the subject a possible . specialists are needed where the surface knowledge about the subject is not enough . for example if a patient is having a skin problem , initialy a general practioner will try to find a cure , but if the problem is too deep then a skin specialist come into the picture . so a specialist is needed whenever a problem is too specific . but a specialist ha a danger of getting isolated in his own work and miss the big picture having a broad knowledge help a person to see the big picture . it help a person to see the co relation between different thing . the problem is viewed from every angle and also in corelation to other thing . a generalist is needed to see in which direction the society is moving . he is needed to address the bigger problem of the society . thus both general knowledge and specialistion are needed and should complement each other for a society to function successfully
