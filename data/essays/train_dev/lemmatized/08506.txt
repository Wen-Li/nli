i agree with that the statement `` most advertisement make product seem much better than they really are '' for reason . the first reason is because most of many company are tring to make a good advertisement to sell most of their product , and that mean they have to give a good offer for their product , so they show some view and how their product are more benefical than others . for example , if there is a advertisement about a company and it offer have cheaper payment than others and thier offer include a big size on the advertisement on the contrast of the fact , most of the people would start buying their product , so because of this way they gain alot of costomers . the second reason is that because most of people have unsatisfy reputation about their product so it is logicaly to give a good reputation by advertisement . for example , if a big percent of people have gotten a bad reputation because of a mistake that ha done by one of their emplyee in the past , their employee woud try to change this bad reputation by a good servies and an advertisement which change this bad reputation .
