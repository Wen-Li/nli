as my opinion , learning fact is more important than understanding concept . there are some reason . first , the fact can make people have deep impression . everyone will have a deep impression when he meet the difficulty . as you solve the problem , you will undersdtand more about the idea or concept you learned . solving the difficulty is also the energy for learning . you will be confident after you solve it . second , the idea we learned in school are conceptional . they are the conclusion after experment or research . they are the base of knowledge . after school , you will have basic knowledge to face the fact you will happen in the future . although idea are the parment element in your study , you have to face any difficulty in your career . third , faceing difficulty and solving them will make you more completely . you have lot of experience that you will have a high position in the company . the experience will promote you to have a higher level . when i graduated from school , i found a job in bicycle industry . at the begining , i faced a lot of problem that i do n't know what to do . so , i tried to ask my coworker and found solution in the text book . after my co-worker ' help , i finally solve the problem . after that , i enjoyed faceing problem no matter how tough that is . by this kind of experience , i discover that i learn a lot and more mature . that made me more satisfied about my work . the company also gave a promotion and looked forward to another improvment .
