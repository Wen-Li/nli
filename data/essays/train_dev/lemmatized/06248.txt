in my point of view i would agree that in twenty year from now there will be fewer car in use than today . lack of non renewable fuel , stress on ecofriendly environment and new technology will perhaps reduce the usage of car in the future . the fuel which most of the car in today world use is the derivates of crude oil like petrol , diesel , gas etc. these are considered a the non-renewable source of energy that they can not be recycled . once consumed they are lost for ever . keeping in view the current demand of this fuel usage , and the shortage of resource of supply , the production of oil will reduce rapidly . the price will be increased abnormally which doe not fit the budget of most car owner . hence they have to shift to other mean of public transport such a railroad or bus . the present soceity around u is slowly gaining the `` eco '' feel . issues like global warming and the greenhouse effect are increasing the public awareness and thereby le pollution free environment is in continous demand . hence people of the future will be forced to use eco friendly mean of transport . technology development is an unending process . every decade witness newer technological development that benefit the people and society . the usage of electricity and other eco friendly fuel in mean of transport is slowly picking up . may be advanced version of the present day car will come into use . these new transporter may gain popularity a they comply with the above two reason of non pollution and also oil and gas free . finally a the time advance many more change can be witnessed which serf in reducing pollution a well a ensure better comfort and efficiency . who know ? the traditional `` car '' that ha become a part and parcel of today life may be owned by a few and may also decorate the platform of a many museum !
