yes , i completely agree with the statement `` youngpeople enjoy life more than older people do '' . we live our life to our fullest when we are young , leaving behind the worry and the intricasies of old age . so i feel that young people enjoy life more due to their being more energitic , with young mind fresh from college , with lot of idea that are trying to creep out . `` old is gold '' is a popular saying the some people advocate . they think that older people are more experienced and know the way of the world better that the younger blood . but i feel that a younger blood ha lot of energy to offer and can work for a cause with a greater intensity than a older indivisual can . like , a project to be completed with a deadline . a younger person can work late night and will finish the project no matter what come in his way . he will work harder to make a place for him in this world . the older people have mind that are worn out , by age , by time . whereas a younger mind have lot of idea to offer . these are fresh brain , that have come right from college , filled with all sort of new tool and the virgour to put those tool to action . and also there is no burden of a family to support . a younger person ha more time to finish a job at hand than his older counterpart a he ha to spend time with his wife , his chilldren , his home ... , this list can go endless . above all the dating of girl , give you so , divine a feeling that hardly can be expressed by word . we can date a lot of girl , enjoy party , go to different club , chill out and do whatever we like . there is none to stop u or brooding over u to get home quickly , a your son is getting late to go to his soccer practice or your daughter ha to go to beauty parlour . i feel that this world is meant for the younger generation , and they have to live life to the fullest in this period only .
