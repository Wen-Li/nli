i totally disagree with the statement that `` in twenty year there will be fewer car in use than there are today . '' i strongly feel that this statement is being made by a novice person who actually do n't refers to the weekly report and tabloid a published by the bussiness sector regularly . now a day a car signifies much more thing than to be a mere vehicle to carry out the routine transportation . it ha become an indespensible commodity like television and telephone . as compared to the primitive era , now a day people keep more than one car at their disposal marked seperately for their well defined purpose . because of the rapid expansion in bussiness sector , the increasing distance do n't actually matter any more for the working class . there are majority of people who are working at the company located at quite a large distance . in that case , they prefer taking their private vehicle such a car , for commuting . it make them feel more comfortable and save their time a well . as recently being concluded through a survey , most of the people feel that owing a car is always a better deal than owing a two wheeler a the former is more safe and secure . according to few , car are always faster than any other two wheeler and comfortable also . one can drive them in almost any climatic condition . they are also le subjected to the unconditional accident such a slippage and skidding . it also help them to avoid irritating pollution on the way . some people also considers car a their status symbol . the larger the car , the higher recoginition they can manage to beg in the society . in my own society i could see that there were merely 20 car five year back . but now the situation ha come up to the extent that the parking place can be seen always flooding , with car of almost all type being parked all over . the recent boom in the manufacturing sector ha blessed u with the advancement of the technology . the spare part are now available at much cheaper rate than ever . the car manufacturing company are also devising many way to produce economical car which can be afforded by almost every sector of the society . such car consumes le fuel and are specially desingned keeping in mind the general ergonomics for people driving every day . with all such effort in place , i really do n't feel that the number of car in use will going to decline in the year to come . rather we would be able to see some really sophisticated and le resource intensive model on the road in the coming year . last but not the least , i feel that the statement is simply based on the subjective knowledge and lack the pragmatic approach considerably .
