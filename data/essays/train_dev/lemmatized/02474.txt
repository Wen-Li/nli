there are many reason why people tend to think that younger people enjoy life more than older people . the two following main element can be considered : young people are more carefree and have le responsabilities and young people enjoy a better health which enables them to do engage in more physical activity . with the content of this essay i intend to refute these two statement and explain why i belive older people can enjoy life just a much or even more than younger people . first of all , it is believed that younger people are a lot more carefree and have le responsabilites than older people . i believe that this statement is offset by the fact that younger people are subject to mental convention and a lack of knowledge that doe not make it possible for them to have complete freedom . the classical example is that of an average high school in which there are the popular people , the people that want to be popular and the people who are different from everyone else . in this typical high school setting teenager are tortured because they are made to believe that if they do not pose certain physical , monetary of personality attribute they will never be popular and therefore , they will never be happy . when people become adult and gain more inteligence , they realize that what they were worrying and stressing about is completely irrelevant in term of achieving happiness . this mean that with that inteligence older people actually have freedom of mind , not to mention financial freedom which is considerably easier to obtain a an adult than a a student or young adult . furthermore , it is believed that younger people are able to enjoy life more because they have better physical health . these day with all the medical and technological advance older people are not only able to considerably increase their life expectancy , but to enjoy a better quality of life . for example in the united states the life expectancy of a normal male in the 1950 's wa around 50 year old . nowadays the life expectancy of a normal male is around 75 year . on the other hand people can actually enjoy a better quality of life because of what is known about the bennefits of a healthy diet , moderate excercising and keeping away from excesive behavior in the use of alcohol , tabacco , etc . with the combination of these factor health and age should not have to be an issue in weather a person is able to enjoy his life or not . to finish the essay i woud like to summarize that i believe that freedom of mind , the gained inteligence and experience that come with time , financial freedom and the medical advancement that are being achieved everyday are all factor that make it possible for older people to enjoy life just a much or even more than younger people .
