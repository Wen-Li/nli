as a matter of fact , the issue of whether successful people try new thing and take risker rather than only doing what they already know how to do well is a complex ahd controversial topic . different people hold different view due to their distinct background and experience . but for my perspective , i think the people attend to success is not only due to their trying new thing and taking risk but also some other insistant . however , it 's a key to succeed . if i must to choose one , i will coose the fomer statement . in the following discussion , i would like to give some evidence to support my point of view and give other example the refute cursory opinion . first of all , the arguement can be presented to develop my position is that successful people need different idea of invention to bulid new thing . why i say that ? according to the current rich man , about two third of them earn their fame from the new technological product . a good example may be found in the case that the most weathy person is rich based on his courage to take risk for investing new technology . under this circumstance , it is quite obvious that the curious enterprise is nescessary for successful poople . in addition , there is another reason for me to choose the former statement . the reason is not far to seek that speed of investing is more improtant thing than past . for the realistic example , our family decided to sell cooky near our home , but there had another cookie shop to open earlier than u . losing the advantage of the opening time , we were failed to invest the shop and lost money . consequently , considering the strong reason and example that successful people need the ambition to try new thing , which sometimes intertwine a organic whole and become more persuasive , we may safely arrive at the conclusion that i supprot the former statement .
