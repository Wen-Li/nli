in the course of our lifetime , most of people get education . i agree with that satement . to understand idea and concept are more important than it is for them to learn fact . first , to understand idea and concept leave long time to mind . second , to understand make student find fact themselves . these reason developing this essay . frist , to understand idea and concept leave long time to student mind or brain . that mean , just learn fact are not going to leave temporaty to student . because they know about fact thus they are not try to find fact . for example , i have been read the article which is about student 's studying behavior . it tell about when student solve the threir math problem , some student can see the answer sheet , however others ca n't . the result is to solve the math problem without the answer sheet student keep try to understand find the answer and to understand . second , to understand idea and concept make student find fact thenselves . if before they knew about the fact of problem , they do not want to get proof of the problem . it make student lazy . if always student get fact easily , they can not adoped with to understand idea . for example , here is one student , who know fact but doe not know how to ~ ? or why ? that student can not develop own ability . in conculusion , the best way is to understand idea and concept and than find or learn fact . and the fastest way is to learn fact . however , student have to learning whatever also they have to keep trying own their work . therefore more important for atudents to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact .
