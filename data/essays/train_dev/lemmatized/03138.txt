this statment illustrate the advertising policy issue whitch i personally agree with . first , in our society of `` mass consommation '' , the economy is ruled by the profit implying that all measure are good to increase benefit . thus it is always a relevent manner to make seem a product better than he really is by a `` lyar '' advertisement . for example , mc donnald always showes on adevertisement above the cashier better than they really are in their box when they are serviced . secondly , the successfull of a product is to attract costumer . whatesoever is the product , it advertissement have to appear better than the product is . beasides , if the advertissement on the product is a `` flop '' , the company who ha lauched this one might lost a lot of money . futhermore profit 's policy that governs company 's behaviour imply to make a product seem much better than it really is . finally this behaviour ha for result to create a fake image of the product in the customer mind . thus creating a legal frame work on advertissement should prevent this kind of lying advertissements and protected , in the same time , custumers .
