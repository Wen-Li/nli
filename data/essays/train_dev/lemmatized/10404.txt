i agree with the only first part of the statement which say that `` successful people try new thing and take risk '' because this is the precondition for achievement in both business and personal life . however , i disagree with the rest of the statement which emphasizes that the successful people do not simply do what they already know how to do well . in my opinion , these people can become successful by the help of the thing that are already familiar with them . now i would like to mention the basic idea behind my contention . first of all , trying new thing and taking risk require a high level of self confidence and this is one of the most significant characteristic that many successful people posse . self-confidence enables them to apply new method or take new decision in their both professional and business life . moreover , being open to new development or idea widens the people 's perception regarding the issue or concept and so this brings the success . furthermore , to take risk may at the same time lead to increase in chance for invention . in other word , it can be accepted a a way to be an inventor of something . on the other hand , all of these can not be possible without using the old knowledge . that is to say , a person can be more self-confident if he or she really trust his or her own knowledge , experience and ability which had gained before . most of the time , by relying on their already acquired skill , they are able to become successful . in addition to this , the experience gathered from previous task provides remarkable clue about the nature of the risk . by already predicting the result of the risk , many successful peopl decide to take a certain risk . in other word , while they take the risk and try new thing , they also guarantee themselves . this generally becomes apparent in the case of the businessmen working for many year and knowing the inside of the business issue .
