the knowledge is something extremely important in our job , mostly in mine . i 'm a marine biologist and of course in all the scientific matter is useful to have knowledge on different field . so at first glance i would respond saying that it 's better to gather information and knowledge a much a we can in a widespreadly manner . but we have to do it in the right way , due to the fact that too much time spent on gathering information could be time wasted . to give a good example that can back me up i want to talk about my personal experience . i 'm actually working on sound produced by dolphin . this particular field research is not completely based on exclusively biological knowledge . in fact i firstly had to understand some physical law about sound wave and how they propagate in the water . once i have been trained about these information i started to work on signal . ashes to ash i have been remained focused on the bioacustic of dolphin , so it could seem that i have been stuck on a specific subject . but it 's not like that . indeed most of the time the acoustical behaviour of an animal can not been explained just with the simply studying of bioacustic and physic , but it have to be put together with ethological studyes that most of the time are based on several different field of knowledge . thus i really think that it 's better to open our mind and study at 360 degree . but a i already mentioned we have to stay focused on what we are really searching for . the field of human knowledge is huge and sometimes even a good researcher can get lost in it vastity . this is the reason why most of the time i have to work with engineer and technician that have the skill to use computer program that can easily help u to analyze the signal that we recorded from dolphin . in a kind of way we both are important for each other , because , even if we seem to be specialized in doing something in particular , we help each other and we try to understand what is the job of the other . i think this is the best methode to share and gain knowledge of different subject . after all these year of working in this team i have gained knowledge on software and technical tool , and hydrophones . but i think that i could n't take all these information just working on my own , or at least it would required me a lot of time . so for these reason i really believe that it 's important to have a broad knowledge on different subject , instead of being focused on just one , because sometime the answer that we are searching for , we can easily find it in a field that can seems not related to our purpose . to give another example , once the engineer i 'm working with founded a vocalization very strange . the signal wa totally different from others and he did n't know how to expalin . then he came to me and for me it wa easy to explain . the signal wa emitted by a calf and certainly it wa different from the other member of the herd . but this is something that a biologist know , not an engineer . but know he know how to recognize this signal , because he had broad his knowledge .
