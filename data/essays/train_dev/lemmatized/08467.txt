i agree with this statement . successful people really know about themselves . they know what they really good at , so they do n't try for new thing that taking them into the risk . it is very different between successful people and unsuccessful people . successful people work hard on their certain thing . for example , if a person is an expert in graphic design , that person should work hard on something that relates to graphic design . that is easy way to succeed . this is because a person know almost everything about graphic design . however if that person work in electric company , do you know what will happened ? a person will fail with that job . this is because that person only know about graphic design , not electric matter . it is very risky that a person doe n't know nothing about new thing . so successful people do n't try new thing that cause risk . how about unsucessful people . whenever they suceed something , they fell they can do whatever they want . so they try to start new job that they do n't really know about it . that is very risky . however , unsucessful people do n't realize until they are failing with that job . it is too late ! they must realize before starting new job . whnever they realize , they have a lot of money to recompense and sometimes those people are going to suicide . that is very fool thing to do . the life is very precious and people should n't waste it . no one forgives those people even the god . now we know how different between successful people and unsuccessful people . they are same human but they are so different in inside of their mind . so to be successful . do n't try new thing and work hard on whatever you are expert in .
