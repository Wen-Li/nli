in fact , i do not agree that most advertisement make product seem much better than they really are . what is the reason to support my point ? in the point of the company , the purpose of advertisement is to promote their product . of course they will advertise their product perfect to attract more customer to purchase them . only in that way , they could gain more benifit to their company . so here come the trickness . instead of telling the weakness of thier product to the customer , the company just repeat the goodness of them . after all , the expence of the advertisement and marketing is extremely high . for instance , the cost of advertisement in tv is charged per second . in order to reach the best profit , absolutely they must make the product the best . therefore , it would not hard to understand that why product seem so wonderful in the advertisement . in other way , customer chose what they are going to buy by the introduction of advertisement . as what we mention about the company 's concern , it is a huge difference between what customer need and what company want ! so what is the best way for both customer and company ? it would be better if customer could check the detailed more deeply before buying the product and the company should tell u more during theadvitisement
