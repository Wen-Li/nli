today , many advertisement are in the world . therefore , i agrree that most advertisement make product seem better than they really are . i have two reason . first , advertisement are cheaper than real product . it is because they are not real . in addition , they are easily to make them . if i could not buy real product because of money , i could buy advertisement product . in china and korea have a lot of them . therefore , many visitor to asia think that they can buy many of them with low cost . second , they look like similar to real product because they mimic real product . for example , when i have a advertisement product , nobody notice . paticular , young people in japan want real brand good , but they are very expensive , so japanese young people buy mimiced product . they do not care about using them , and they thik only visual . for these reason , i think that it is good that most advertisement make product seem much better than they really are .
