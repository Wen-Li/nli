in my opinion , young people can enjoy life more than older people because of three main reason which are health , willingness for living faster and more enjoyable and having le responsibility for in life . to begin with , it is a biological fact that a the human becomes older his/her health problem increase directly . as a result of this fact older people have many and different kind of health problem and these problem prevent people to live in a comfortable way . for example , if a person is a lung cancer , he/she can not enjoy the life because there is a big problem in his/her health . on the other hand , young people genarally do not have health problem so that they can do whatever they want . secondly , young people have the willingness for living faster and more enjoyable because they have independent and new idea about life . for instance , they may want to go to himalaya mountain for camping and there is nothing to prevent them for going . however old people do not want such a hard thing because they usually have no energy for that activity and want to stay at home . finally , young people have le responsibility in life . in other word they are living more independent from other people . they do not have child or wife to look after or usually their only job is school and they can make lot of plan after school for holiday . these situation make young people more free and they have many different and creative plan for life . in conclusion , for living more enjoyable and different life , being a young person ha a great importance because young people genarally have no health problem , they have a willing to live faster and more enjoyable than old people and they have le responsibility in life and for their environment .
