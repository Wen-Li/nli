peopel can not live without joy . both young and old people look for somethig good for theri life . i am getting old . i want to say older people can enjoy theirl life like young people do , however , it is difficult for older people to enjoy like youg people do . health situation are very differencet between young and oler people . most young people do not worry about their health , but many older people have chronic disease . for example , some people might have back pain . the pain limit their daily actibity and make them be unhappy . older people 's rest of time is not long . they already lived many year , and they know that they can not make a big dream like they had when they were very young . today 's their dream might be very real and small . young people have a abandant time , so they can have big dream about their future . everybody wish haveing enjoy life . however when people get old , ther health situation is not good . moreover , they can not have big dream . thsu , i think young people can enjoy thier life more than older people do . but even though havign health problem or not having big dream , older people can find good life .
