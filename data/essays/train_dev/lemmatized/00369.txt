i am not sure wether adolescent or older people are the happier one since i am myself in my early twenty . on the one hand , young people seem to be much more energetic and are certainly physically more vital and attractive . therefore they spend more time for social purpose , for instance going to party , which could lead to the assumption that they are enjoying life more . but a older people usually already found their match , this aspect of going out at night is not relevant to them . after a divorce it is likely to observe that they change their nightlife behaviour again and become more active again because they need a substitute for their former partner , which implies that the age is not solely responsible for the intensity someone life with . additionally to this argument , older one probably do not enjoy life le than young , they only have other interest that are perhaps le observable . may be they value more passive activity like reading book and being intellectual more than during their childhood , which doe not imply that they are le satisfied with their life . another point that would support the thesis is that child are relatively sorrowless . as they grow up they start think about problem increasingly . i this tendency continues , older people are concerned about a lot of issue that an adolescent would never think of . for example , a twenty year is certainly not dealing with the problem of near death or the challenge of raising a child . on the other hand , this could be a reason for older people to enjoy life more actively and intensively , since they feel that they will not life forever . summarized , i can not give a clear statement that i am a hundred percent sure of . in my opinion , every part of our life offer opportunity and challenge u with it own problem . it is up to each individual how it deal with it and how it perceives the advantage and disadvantage of the distinct live phase in order to become a happy human being .
