i quite agree with the idea which say that young people enjoy life more than older people do . young people are more active . they enjoy going out with friend and touring different place all over the world . they like to go sight seeing and accompanying person of the other sex , so a young man enjoys going out with a young woman . they love doing that . they are eager to get married , to have baby and to make a family and to spend life watching those little child growing up . young people have too many future project and plan . they have their own aim , hope and goal which they wish to accomplish one day in the future . they work day and nightto accomplish them . they enjoy the time seeing them while they are being accomplished one after the other . they can have too many plan for their future and career . they have another piont of view towards it . they see it in a different way . to them , it is full of entertainment , love , hope and plan . it is beauty , nature , smile and laugh . it is business and winning . meanwhile , older people know that their aim , goal and hope are too short in time because they have acvcomplished them or part of them . they have already had family and child . they have fewer ( or no ) future plan for a career . some of them have got bored with the toture that life ha caused . some others may be crippled or facing some kind of disease . they have become le activethan young people . in addition , some of the older people 's child may have left them face life and it difficulty and torture without any aid . in some civilized country , those old people are being taken care in special house or institution . they are being taken care of by their own child and grand child in many other country . those who are being taken care of enjoy life more than those who are left without any aid or help but they do not enjoy it a much a young people . finally , i conclude that young people really anjoy life more than older people . they see it from another point of view .
