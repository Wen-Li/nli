how general or specializied study should be is an issue that still trigers the education community wordwide . to a certain extent , i tend to agree with people who think that a broad knowledge of many academic subject will help student reacting better when facing new environment and challenge . first of all , today 's challenge increase in complexity and involve various skill and knowledge to resolve them . for instance , terrorist threat create challenge for free movment of person . as a lawyer , i can not advise the without an ethical dimension . having general knowledge on topic such a law , security policy and even philosophy , will help me dealing with the problem a a whole . second , i personaly think that having general knowledge will allow me to be quicker and flexible when dealing with new issue . it is a common place to say that general knowledge will help someone acquire specialized knowledge through experience . it will help him t turn to new subject with ease , while a spealized student must encounter difficulty in learning to work on other topic . these consideration should however be balanced . since today 's challenge are getting more complex , professional are asked to have strong knowledge in their specific field of expertise . all in all , the best education is probably the one complementing general knowledge learned in school with specialized knowledge learned during professional life .
