i think that those person that try new thing and take risk their have more success than those thaty only doing what they already know how to do well . one the many reason is that people that try new thing in their live is because their are looking at how to be altruist and how to be success . for instance , if i want to be a competitive person sending car , i need to have many idea in order to create new model and new type , more strongs , more sures , cheaper and nicer . i have to try many risk during the elaboration the this car , i have to risk much money in employer that they be more preparated and i must give them all the necesities that the government 's law requirs . if i want to be altruist , i need to take risk even though i get scare . one person who doe not like to be altruist and success doe not try any thing because he or she ha scare and always they will be people comfortables and aphatics . by the way those person who try take risk their will recognize in many place of the world . other instance is that if someone ha a factory of shoe and ha many competers , he or she need to try new techiques and new method to make new type in order to compete with others factory . but these factory which doe not try compete with other factory , may be they are going to disappear easily and their model are going to be unusual , unlike , and ugli . for this reason you need to be compettitive person if you want to be success and if want to be someone in your live to beer famous and be recognized whe you get death
