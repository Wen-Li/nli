people may quickly get wrong when they say that specialzing in one specific subject is better than to have knowledge of many subject . to some extent being specialized would be beneficial to the person . however it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subject . becouse with the development in science and technology it is revealed that every field is somewhat connectted to other one , and it is now the time for the most qualifed canditate to find a position to pursue a good career . fistly , each day we hear something new about science and technology and most of the time we are suprised to see how differennt field are linked together . to illustrate , medical science began to cooperate with computer science and they are using these technology to learn more about human and trying to find treatment technology for various health related issue . a medical doctor should also have at leat a minor degree or broad knowledge in computer science for example . secondly , dramaticly growing population brings a problem to the front . more competition is now waiting for u . therefore we should equip ourselves with whatever we could find . there could be also majoring in different area . consequently , we become more attractive to the employer since we achive more with le effort and we could have a much broader view of perspektif when looking into problem . for example an engineer with a double major in economics or business administration could do a job almost two people can do and also can be able to think thoroghly with engineering aspect and with the say economical aspect of the problem . a whole understading to the problem could be achibev by acquiring more and more knowledge about different thing . to sum up , in the search of exellence and success one ha to consider equiping himself with more and more knowledge and therefore experience to overcome the competition . becouse we now know that every field is linked to each other and we sould have something in our mind when considering problem solution .
