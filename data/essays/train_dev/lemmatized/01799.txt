let 's imagine and create a person who is successful in his firm who is in mid thirty . who is already become a ceo . he can keep doing what he is at best or he can try to find another area to seek success . definetely seeking the success in another field would be a dissappointment . but it is better for him to find out what is there ? the unknown is always attractive and if he achieve it great for him and the humanity . taking the risk rather than only doing what you do is basically not fun at all . and if you are already good at it . what is it to lose ? if you could not . come back . the door will always be open to a man or woman who is successful in a job . this process will effect the person 's creativity . it give the chance that if he or could make that miracle in another situation . it is a challenge and a contest . for instance our ceo in a company realizes that he always wanted to be a politician since he wa a kid . he could give it a try and try to get in the election of next year . it is a contest , not a beuty contest . a contest which he will find his inner strength and get to know himself finally , who know ? but not trying at all is the real sin of all time . because living with `` if 's '' is a great overwhelming thing for a human being . in addition to that , if a person can achieve the second dream it will not be just for him or her . it is gonna effect the others eventually and it will be a benefit for eveyone . consequenty , successful people definitely try to achieve more and more in new field and job . doing what they already know how to well will not be plus for human kind . it is a big mistake of all time .
