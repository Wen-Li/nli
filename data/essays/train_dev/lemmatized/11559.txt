knowledge , is the ammount of stuff we know . many people just study one specific subject while others get more information . by specializing in one subject you will know many thing but only in that subject . if you know allot of knowledge you can have a better conversation with someone . i think that by knowing more thing about the world and what is around you , poeple have a better image of how you are and you can have a better conversation . there are many way how to get more knowledge . for example , you start reading many book of many different topic and learn by yourself at your home . also , you can go study more thing like study one subject but you can go further and study other stuff that in some way they are linked together with the first thing you studied . in my opinion i think that having allot of knowlege about many thing is a really importarnt thing to have in your life . even a you are growing up you should watch show that have education and read book that have important information . while trying to have a conversation with a person who only know something about one specific subject you will have an interesting conversation only if you talk about the subject that person know . in the other hand , if you try to have a conversation with someone who know many stuff about the thing that is around u you will have a very enjoying conversation . i really think knowing something about only one subject it not good at all . learning is not really expensive if you know how to do it ( like reading book ) and it is not a crime or bad for you to know many thing . everyone should read everyday and if possible study for many year .
