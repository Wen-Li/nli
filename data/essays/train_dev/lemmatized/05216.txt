i disagree to the statement that young people enjoy their life more , a the older people were also young at some point of their life and hence they have gone through what a younger generation is going through , but time play an important role in the enjoyment of life and also what an individual ha the image of enjoyment of life in his mind . firstly , it is correct that young generation is enjoying the life more than the older at that time but a the time pass the young generation ha to enter the older generation and that same young generation now again take some pleasure in enjoying life in older age also thus if we calculate the enjoyment by comparing the older person to young one then we will find that older one ha enjoyed more on the scale of time . secondly , every person ha it own defination of enjoyment in life , some might feel like their are enjoying life if the go for long drive or spend time in travelling and exploring the huge world , while some might feel that they are enjoying thier life by just chilling around their loved one and spending time in chatting , emailing playing game etc. now this type of enjyoment are not defined for some particular age any one can get this enjoyment at anytime of thier life . thus the older and younger genration can enjoy to the same type of enjoyment . thirdly , every person ha his own set of thinking of enjoyment and a the young generation is unaware of enjoyment he is going to get in his future life , he is more excited and ready to enjoy the life at every part of his life , which wa the same feeling that an old generation ha gone through . moreover now all the enjoyment that a young genration doe are aslo tried and enjoyed by the older people , thus they have present life of enjoyment in old age and also had the enjoyment during thier young age , but the current younger genration ca n't go back in time and enjoy the moment that the older generation ha experienced , but will have some different experience of enjoyment of life for their coming younger generation . also , even if the young generation is young and can do many thing that older ca n't but there are some thing that younger genration doe not have is the experience of the enjoyment which had been to the older generation , for young generation the enjoyment ha just begin but for the older one it is coming to it end and thus they have far more enjoyed than the current younger generation . thus altogether the younger generation also enjoyes the life but the enjoyment that he ha experienced ha also been experieced by the older genration and the defination of enjoyment change from person to person .
