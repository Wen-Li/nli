i disagree with the opinion that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their community because i know a lot of young people do help their community . i have friend who are engaged in the group of comedian . they are all from 20 to around 30 year old . whereas they perform at theater to make money , they also perform for child and elderly people at daycare center . they say that they just really like to see the audience laughing . i know a group which is called `` guardian angels . '' the group is consisted of about 50 young people . the member of the group patroll around downtown and if they find someone who need help , they help or advise him/her . for example , when they find girl who are under 18 or younger after midnight in the street , they convinced them to go home earlier . another example is that a young woman help her community develop their sight-seeing industry . she work at a travel agency in her small town . because she wanted to make her town well-known , she decided to appeal her town . she planned to have a festival and carried it out . people in the town cooperated with her and brought a lot of food , craft and suvenirs to the festival . as a result , a lot of people came to visit her town and the town ha improved their sight-seeing industry . thus , a lot of young people are assosiated with their community and contribute to them . they simply enjoy helping their community .
