`` the risk is my game '' said james bond in a movie and i think bond is successful . the importance to improve myself is connected with trying new thing and taking risk . i believe that successful people are the one who try new thing and do n't complain about wrong choice . instead of doing always the same thing , trying a new one is risky : you do n't know what is going to happend , where you are going to be . but this make people smarter and more intelligent . in a completely new situation , a person could improves himself and this make a better people . i personally prefer to choice new thing : for example at the restaurant . it could be a stupid example , but it is fondamental . at the restaurant people is divided in two category : the gambler and the `` abituee ' '' . the gamblers always try new plate , new food and that excite them . the feeling for a new flavor , new taste make the choice both unaspected and exciting . of course there is the problem : `` what if the taste is not so good ? '' . but once you have choiced a new plate , you have to own the risk . the `` abituee '' are the opposite of the gamblers : when they go to restaurant , they already know what they are going to take . they do not experience new thing and so they will not improve themself : they are too closed-minded to understand the thrilling of a possibility . the gambler have much more possibility to find the perfect plate for the perfect dinner . only with the experiment on new food , people could understand what they like and what they do n't like . i think this example , because it is strictly connected with life . successful people are successful , because they have risked and maybe they tried so new many thing that , now , they know what is the best for them .
