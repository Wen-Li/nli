the word knowledge is a verry big word , it ha a lost of importance in aour daily life , and we are eforsing it since we start learning . knowledge is soetihing everybody have , in a diferent way but they got . it is very usfull to have a little bit of knowledge of everything . for my personal opinion it depends on what you want to focuse , because if you are good in one material . you shouk dedicate yourselve to that , but it is not bad to know a little bit of everything . what you rather to have a conversation with a person that for example only talk to you about history , everything you talk with him will always tell you somthin of history or talk to a person that coul talk to you about everythin , what ever you ask him he will response you . people that will like to concentrate in one academy subject , it will be easier to them , the good think is that they will know it eveything a il be an exelent profesional . and knowledge could take ypu to become crazy just like einstein he wa soo brilliant that turn up crazy . knowledge is the key for succces . and of corse you have to belve in your self and it could be one or a million of subject , you could have the best teacher of the world and if you do not cooperate you will be knowone .
