the issue at hand to understanding the idea and concept are more important than to learn fact . this issue is important because it is related to the student 's life . i belive that the understanded idea and concept are the better option because it is useful in their furestudies , they look more confident in their subject and they can do well in the exames . first , understand idea and concept are more important fir student is more preferable because student further study is important . for example if the studen intrested to do the medicine if he doe n't undestand the concept and idea of biology they ca n't studt medical school . understan idea and concept . i think it is superior than learn fact . addionally , it is more important for student understand idea and concept is a better because when they look in the class is more confident in that subject . for instance , if i understand the concept of subject i can learn more subject and intrested to concentate more concept . based on student to understand idea and concept are the better than the to learn fact . finally , i feel understand idea and concept is right one because we can write on the exam well . such a when i take the chemistry test concept are very useful in the test . after finshing exxam i thougt if i do n't understand the concept i could n't write thw exam ultimately my choice is correct
