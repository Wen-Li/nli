i disagree that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their community from the following three reason ; ( 1 ) they have enough time , ( 2 ) they have little intention to do , ( 3 ) their community do n't expect young people to do , first , i believe they have enough time to helping their community . because they have a lot of time to play and go anywhere with their friend . according to a certain survey , young people use 60percent of their private time with their friend , 20 percent with family , 15percent with collegues of their company and 5percent with their community . second , they have little intention to helping their community . they are little interested with staying with their community . one of the biggest reason is that they should follow their traditional customes . they are bothersome to young people . most young people want to stay with their friend using modern equipment , such a tv game . in addition , besides helping their community , young generation have a lot of chance and place to be involved and help other community and wider world , such a other country and city and community . third , their community also do n't expect young people to envolve into the event . because it is difficult both side to communicate well , teach something and stay together . sometimes to helping the community might be botherd and harmful to their community . in my case , a i did n't know how to do , i could n't help any thing to my community in the past . as a result , i did n't want to be involved into their event a much a possible . from the above reason , i do n't strongly agree that young generation recent day do not give satisfactory time to helping and be involved into heir community .
