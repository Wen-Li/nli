fewer car due to increased use of public transportation i fully agree with the given statement that the number of car will reduce within the next twenty year . firstly , a lot of people will not be able to afford gas anymore . by virtue of the exploitation of natural resource such a petroleum the price of those product will increase even more than it already did . a car will become something like luxury for many people . this cause a natural decline of the number of car on the street . besides , the world population will raise enormously . in twenty year will propably have almost ten billion people living all over the globe . as a result , traffic will increase . not only in city but also in remote area because you need more space for all the people . traffic jam and more accident will occur more often especially in city . in order to avoid this chaos many people will have to use public transportation like bus or subway . another reason for my opinion that there will be fewer car in use is the lack of parking space in big city . every huge town in the world a a problem with providing enough room for the car . in manhattan the car have to be stacked and in san francisco the price for a parking lot in downtown are hardly affordable to keep the people from parking there . in addition to this , state government will have to pas law which will restrict traffic . due to overpopulation and enviromental pollution owing to heavier traffic , the number of car allowed on the street at the same time will have to be regulated to stop further destruction of the planet . last but not least , we will have new technology concerning public transportation . i am pretty sure we will have faster train , new invention to travel and the price will decrease . a reason for lower price is that more people will use public transportation out of the reason i mentioned and explained above . .
