well i certainly agree with the following statement `` it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subject than to specialize in one specific subject '' well , i feel that it is always important to have a good knowledge about all different subject . well for example taken in the medical history , say a doctor from a medicine field , is only specilazed in only one subject or say only one field . and for suppose he is a speacilist in heart disease , and if a patient come in for a treatment in different part of the body he will not be or he is not in a position to give him the medicine for that disease . and the patient might think that he ha got no knowledge and moreover he might not turn to him again . and if he ha a knowledge about many academic subject he will be able to give a medicine for that . well what i feel is that a person is said to be complete person if he ha a good knowledge about all the thing . so i feel that it is better to have the broad knowledge of many academic subject . well , if we are into only one specific subject i say we will endup nowhere , wherein we donot have the knowledge about other thing . and this might propably mean that our knowledge in limited . well for example in the software field if we are good in only one basic software and now a day our information and technology is changing day by day , so here we need to have some knowledge about other software'stooor we will be in a situation where we will end up nowhere , not knowing what to do next . so here we can say that if we have some knowledge about many academic subject we can survive .
