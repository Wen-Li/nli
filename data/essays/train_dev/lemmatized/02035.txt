in the past , scientist used to specialize in a specific subject and keep going deeper and deeper in this subject . nowadays many scientist try to learn more than one subject . for example , biologests try to learn more physic and chemistry . i totally agree with this . science ha many branch and these branch may interact with each other very often . if a chemist wanted to make a new midicine he ha to know something in biology . otherwise , he will not be able to make this midicine . the same thing go with physic and biology . by studying more than one subject and trying to apply one subject in another one , scientist can make big devolopments in different field of science . new branch of science ha been discovered by combining to or more branch of scinece together . biochemistry is an example of those new branch . biochemistry is giving a big contribution in the frield of midicine . moreover , making new midical device and artificial organ need knowledge in biology and physic together . specializing in on subject only will , definitly , narrow the contribution of the scientist to the society . contributing a much a they can to the society is the scientist goal . thef can have better chance of reaching their goal if the combined the knowledge of different field of science . i also think that a scientist can speacialize in one subject and he can also learn something from the other branch of science . if this scientist worked with another scientist who ha another field of speciality , they together can make larger contribution to the scociety . working in group and uniting the knowledge is very helpful in devoloping the different feilds of science .
