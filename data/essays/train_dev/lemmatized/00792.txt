i do not think that in twenty year there will be fewer car in use than there are today for two main reason . first , if we look at the actual trend , more and more car are in use . i think that in twenty year a lot of people that can not afford to buy a car today will be able to do so . underdevelopped country are a case in point . they have been excluded from the car market for a very long time because they were no potential buyer . but now , many country go from rag to rich and are able to buy car . china or india , for example , will be major potential buyer in twenty year . tata , an indian car brand , is on the rise with incredible growth rate . the same go for poor people in developped country . cars are getting cheaper , and i believe that this trend will continue . today it is possible to have a new family car at $ 5000 . logan renault is a good example . and what about in twenty year ? maybe the starting price of a car will be under $ 1000 . then much more people , such a student , will be able to buy car . but it is true that , at the same time , runing car is becoming very expensive . this brings me to my second point . on the face of it , the price of oil is rocketing which make car expensive to use . but on closer inspection , car use le and le oil . i hope than in twenty year few car will still work on oil . cars will use other form of energy such a vegetable oil and why not water . technology in this field go very fast and many change can occur within twenty year . all in all , i think car company are still on a thriving market and therefore , there is little chance that in twenty year thre will be fewer car in use than there are today .
