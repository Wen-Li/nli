i disagree to the statement that state successful people try new thing and take risk rather than only doing what they already know hot wo do well for three reason . first , successful people prefer to train their skill and knowledge even though they already know how to do well . although they have good skill and knowledge , they may not try to take the new thing and take risk because they know that changing their mind often can worse their ability . by taking the new skill and risk , they can improve their knowledge and become more confident ; however , if they doing so , they may also take the risk to dwindle their ability that wa aquired well because they should concentrate on only the new thing to improve . second , successful people want to utilize their knowlede and skill in the future . the successful people , who have the great knowledge and interesting in the particular thing , dreaming to work in the future that requiring their ability . compared with the normal people , the successful peolpe have been enthusiastic about the only what they want to improve and what they intresting in while normal people have intresting in a variety of thing , for example , tennis , pianno , karate , etc . finally , competing with others are the most important reason that the successful people prefer to continueing to take the risk and training their skill that they already know well . by having the rivel , successful people trying to defeat each others . when the rivel defeat other rivel , then the other rivel try to defeat the rivel and work harder ; however , if one of them change their risk to take , then he/she will recognize it a rivel admit losing . in the conclusion , successful people tend to do not take the new skill and risk because they have rivel , desire to utilize their skill and knowledge , and want to improve them . in my opinion , taking the new skill or risk is not bad , however , if they really want to improve their skill , they should not try to learn any other new thing ,
