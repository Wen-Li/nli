the question say that in twenty year there will be fewer car in use than now . i agree with this affermation and i consider the pollution the main cause . in our day there is more pollution than in the past that is caused by industralization . for this reason the ozono whole grows up day for day and with it the ultraviolet light that are nocive fot our health . to resolve this issue , we must decrement air pollution and the car with other mean of trasports , for exemple train , are the main cause . if we wont clean air we must use other mean of travel that respect the environment such a bycycle . another way to reduce pollution is the minor use of train and expecially car that can be use by le people than train and for this reason are le efficients than other mean and more noumerose . for this reason i think that this great number of car , must be decremented if we wont resolve the problem of pollution . in many city the car can be used only for few day at week , this is an important thing that bring me to believe that in the future i will can use only train or other mean a train that can be transported more than one parson for time . only in this way we will can have a clean air , a clean environment , a clean sea but not only because only in this way we will be more healty and so expecially le ill because many sick are caused by pollution of car train and so on . by
