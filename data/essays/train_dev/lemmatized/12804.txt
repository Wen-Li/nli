i agree with the statement made a it is clear that people have come to understand that there have been several attempt made to reduce global pollution . the use of vehiciles ha put the world on red alert a we are destroying our atmosphere day by day with emission of harmful gas and intoxicant . we are all aware of the amount of harm we are doing to our atmosphere because most citizen would rather go from destination a to b with their privately own car without acknowledging what we are doing to the earth itself . governments worldwide and national organization have been concerned with the issue of pollution and how it is going to affect in the near future . several organization have acknowledged this issue and are implementing rule restricting the use of private vehicle . there are alternative way other than using car , which are mainly used for transportation and rarely for recrational activity . one option is that all car , that are owned privately , are destroyed and all citizen and inhabitant of a certain area restrict themselves to public transport such a bus . this will be of great benefit to both society and the atomshere around u . first of all it would reduce our financial problem like car payment , petroleum , service and so on . another suggestion is that the make train , also known a metro 's to be used more often which consume electricity rather than petrol . governments have stated that there would be a great drop in the number of car purchased and the numbered currently owned , and not to include the rate of gas emission would drop to around forty five percent in the coming year if people abide by this rule and follow it .
