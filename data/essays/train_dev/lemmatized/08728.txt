if we are taking about the whole world , in my oppinion there will be at least a many car a today . it is a possibility that in modern country , we will use the car le and le with the pas of the year . we live in growing city , every day a higher pertentage of the population life in city . and every one that live in a big city can tell you the unusefull and expensive bussines is to have a car . is much more eficent to take the public transportation system or even a motorbike , or even a bike . any of this solution is cheaper and faster than moving thoughout the city by car . in addition we have the problem of the petroleum . we are aproaching to the famous peak oil . some day in the close future we could not attend all the energetic demand of the world just with oil . so oil and fuel will enhance his prize , and having a car will be more and more expensive every day . so not every one will be wealth enough to have a car and use it a today . but in the other hand there are a lot of high populated contries , developing country . is reasonable to suppose that many people of these contries will be rich enough to pay for a car and it manteinance . also , it is important to be aware that having a car , is one of the most tipical of symbol of wealth and social success , and for the people of these contries , to become a car owner will be surelly prioritary . so although in europe and the usa , we will probably have le car , in china , india or brasil the number or car will certently increase a lot in the next few decade . so this is the reason i do not agree the statement above .
