in our world are a lot of product and every day more product are created . they are very big difference between them . in my opinion most product could be been better a they are and the advertisments show u . there are a lot of product , which are really good , like different kind of water . on the other hand , there are a lot of product , which could be been better like jean . i think that in the past the jean had a better quality then now . for this there are some reason . my first reason is that people buy cheaper jean in lower quality and the big firm like lewis had to get also cheaper price , but on the other hand i think that the new design had change the quality . there we can see the problem of the advertisments . they show u , the need of a new style , but they do not speak about lower quality . it decrease of cause of chemical , which are need for the producing . an example are jean in white color , because they were produced in blue and then the color is destroid . an other example is perhaps that advertisments always have the best shower gel . i think that it wa good for a log time , but every new product is a lot of better then the one before . i can not belive that it is possible to create every few month an other one , which is better than the one before . furthermore they show u think , which make the product better , but it wa always insite . i think that most product are good , but not so good , a advertisments show u . on the other site it is there job to show u that we have to spend money for new think . normally that is a good way , because the firm have to spend money for there research and research is a very fundamental thing in our world .
