i disagree with this opinion . i think , in twenty year there will be more car in use than there are today . i have some reason to think about that . first , some company of car are now inventing new car , like hibrid car , electric car something like that . actually we can see that kind of car on the road sometimes . we also interested in car that are good for enviromental . car industry will change the their way to sell the car to customer . of course thought of customer for environment of earth will change in this few year . second , i think that puclic translation is not convinient at country side . for me , i am living in country side , i can not ride on the bus or train when i want . it is difference between the big city like tokyo and small city . so people who live in country side , they are using their own car now . i also use my own car . number of car in country side more increased than before . but the other hand , now gasoline is so expensive . if this situation will continue , number of car may will dicrease . i imagined that reason . but , i think if cost of gasoline is expeinsive , bus company will change the time schedule not to move out . that is why , people will have to use their own car . japanese company like honda , toyota is famous in many other country . if they invent the new car that not to use the gasoline so much or something , it will spread up all over the world , and then many people will be able to think about enviroment of earth even if using the car . it is very good for u . we should accept that kind of project . that is why i disagree with this opinion .
