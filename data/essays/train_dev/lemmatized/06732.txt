first of all , there ha to be a definition of `` young '' and `` old '' . a twenty-year old person will consider himself a being `` old '' when he compare his age to that of a newborn . on the other hand , a 70 year-old person will think of the 20 year old person a being `` young '' . i assume that the statement on the left think of people in their twenites or thirty a `` young people '' and that senior at the age of around 60 are referred to a `` old people '' . i believe that it is impossible to make a `` yes '' or `` no '' decision on that question . of course , the general idea of `` enjoying life '' is that of having party , drinking alcohol , making new friend and not having any concern about the future . all of these activity are much more typical of younger people than of older people . younger people simply do n't spend too much time thinking about the future , they `` live for the moment '' . in that regard , the statement on the left is right . once people have grown , they tend to take on more responsibility and duty in their life . older people have to supply some financial income , maybe not only for themselves , but also for their family . they have to take care of their social life which seems a lot more complicated than in the younger day , and they might also have growing concern about their health . all of these factor do n't really make it `` fun '' to be older . on the other hand , being old also mean being wiser . when you 've reached a certain age , you are able to define the true value of life . and generally , these value are not party , alcohol or superficial friendship . the true value are much more intimate . they are in thing like having one best friend , being rewarded at work or just being loved by your partner or your kid . having a loving wife for example can be the best `` fun '' you 'll ever have in your life , although people normally would n't call it `` fun '' , but `` fullfillment '' instead . but this detail would lead to another discussion about the definition of `` fun '' . my conclusion is , that - just a life doe - the definition of `` enjoying life '' change during the year of a lifetime .
