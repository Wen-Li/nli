some people may believe that there will be more car in use in futhre , but i disagree . i ca n't imagine that there have enough space and street can be used for more car . first because the traffic jam are more and more common in nowadays . so many car in our country can not be used efficently because there are lot of traffic jam in every street at early moning 7:00-9:00 , and afternoot 5:30-7:00 . in work hour , i only need to spent 20 minute to get school from my appartment , but it 's taken nearly 90minutes in rush hour . it 's a waste of time . a lot of friend of mine told me that , they would not going to buy any car because ther is n't enough road can be use for solve the traffic problem . second , there are more and more pollution made by car . when i wa 6 , i could always see lot of star in every evening sky . but i can not see them recently , becanse the pollution are to heavy to cover the sky . the smoke that seeked by the car are making a lot of pullutions in the air . and it 's seemed so harmful to our heathy . third , the price of the oil incressed a lot , that made many people did n't want to buy a car . i alwanys saw so many car only parked in the parking space that are did n't drive in . and when i asked a owner why he did n't drive his car , he told me that , that the money he must spent on oil when he drive his car for 2 year can buy another car . that seems like we must spend a much or more mony we buy the car to buy the oil . taken the above reason into account , i think in twenty year there will be fewer car in use than today . not only more car mean more space will be taken , also mean few pollution and lot bebefits for our heathy .
