i agree that it is more important for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact . it is quite easier for student to learn fact than to understand idea and concept . hypothetically speaking , student learn some theory or phenomenon in a certain academic field and they have to take a test about it . here is a student who just memorize the fact which a teacher explained in the classroom . this student doe not try to understand the main idea and concept about it at all , but belief that he or she know everything that the teacher explained for test . the other student try to understand the main idea and concept for the test , but he or she doe not memorize the whole note . as for the result of the test , the first student and second one can have the same grade or the first student who memorizes the fact can have a higher grade than the other ; i think it depends on the question which the teacher askes for the test . no matter what grade two student get for the test . no matter who get higher grade . the important matter is that the first student who learns fact can not apply what he or she learns for other relevant academic field and also when the student go to a college for the advanced education , he or she will have trouble with having own thought and idea related with what he or she learns . it is the reason that the student doe not know how to understand the main idea and concept and also doe not know how to think about them to make them a own thought and idea . the student can eat the apple when someone give to him directly , but if it is not , he or she can not eat it because he or she doe not know how to pick . on the other hand , the other student who keep studying a trying to understand idea and concept can develop the concept that he or she learned before while studying at college because he or she know how to make the idea and concept a own and how to think and apply them for the further or relevant academic field . this student know how to pick up the apple now , so he or she doe not need to wait for someone who give . whenever he or she want to eat it , the student take the apple from the tree and eat it . consequently , when student really want to learn something for their own , they have to understand idea and concept first .
