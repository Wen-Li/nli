i would have to say it is more important to understand idea , i will explain to you why . first of all we have the memory problem . most of the school around the world and also most of the university want their student to learn fact and concept , and every student is capable of doing so in an affective way , however this is just temporary knowledge , those concept and fact will be erased from their brain probably right after the test , if not , they wil be there for jsut a little longer but not enought . on the other hand , when a student understands the idea he doe not have to memorice anything , because he us he logic to infer thing . that is the kind of knowledge that will remain with him for a longer amount of time . second , we have the learning and applying factor . when a student memorice or learn fact , is perfectly able to approve the test and gradute , but when this student turn into a proffesional , a doctor for example , if the only thing he did in college wa learning by heart avery little concept and fact , when he get to the real life a a proffesional , he wo n't be able to give a diagnosis a good a someone that actually understood instead of learn . why ? because not every case , and every problem ( not just in medicine but in any other major ) is exactly the same a the one before , and most of them are not exactly the same a the one we saw on the text book or the one we learned by heart . so the student , now proffesional , that undestood the material will not tight himself to the definition he learned but he will take into account all possible explanation while the one that just memoriced will see the problem within a fence . finally , it is cientifically proved that understand concept help the knowledge to prevail with time . i 'm not saying memoricing is bad , i 'm just saying that it should n't be the only thing to take into account when you are training a future professional , because at the end , the most important thing is not the knowledge you have or how many text book you learned by heart when you were in college , but the way you use all that knowledge .
