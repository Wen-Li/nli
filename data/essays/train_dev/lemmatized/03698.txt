i agree with the staement that , most advertisement make prodcuts seem much better than they really are . i feel that most of the advertisement either in electronic or in print or any other medium is nowadays , concentrate more on look rather than the usability or feature of the product . for example a clothing company try to spend a lot on the model and presnetation rather than the comfort while wearing it product . creating the hype and fuss is the only motive of such advertisement , although public may not like the product at all after few us of it , e.g. a big multistarrer movie might be opened with a big lavish event , but after few day of show only , public come to know whether it 's a hit or a flop . this is one case where extra hype is created for a product by advertisement . in other case , the side effect of the product are tried to make hidden behind the attractive advertisement . for example , aerated drink , cosmetic etc , which are not good for health . in few case , cosmetic have been proved very dangerous , when used frequently . cases have been found that after using cosmetic from a reputed company , the customer have generated allergic and skin problem due to toxic material present in it . although the advertisemnt doesnt mention any appropriate frequency of usage , it effect is visible after long usage only . in such case it is all upto the public which ha to find out the consequence after sometime . another example is alcoholic dink and tobacco product , which are pretty much dangerous to health are advertised in such a way that it appeal to the mass population . as we can see , in most of the advertisement , which come out newadays focus more on packaging and making the product more attractive , rather than projecting there attribute related to general use .
