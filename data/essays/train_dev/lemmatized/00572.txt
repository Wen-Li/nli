the question being raised is if i agree or not to the idea that advertisement make a great impact in product . this is an important issue to consider because advertisement is part of our daily life . today if you want to sale any product you most think in how to advertise it . i totally agree that a good advertisement in front of your store help your business to attract more people . in order to have this product sale you most develop a good strategy , and follow some rule . first of all , to sale product you need good avertisement and a good strategy . that definitly will attract other people to your business , and it will help you to give a presentation of your product . for example , if i have a store that sale house ornament , it is necesary to have all kind of neon sings that make allusion of the product on sale . other way is to bring some ornament outside the store and let people who pas by stop and take a close look . this is an strategy that every one can practice . furthermore , to sale product and make then look bettter than they realy are , you do not have be unthrusful . instead , you just have to follow some rule that are applicable to every business , small or large . the first thing is to put the nicest product at the entrance of the store . this way people will be attracted to the rest of the product . i remember one time i wa tried to make a garage sale . at that time what i did wa just to follow the old rule . my neighboords started to came , and at the end of the day every thing wa sold . after all , i agree with the statement that advertisement make product seem more attracted . even though some people believe they do not needed to sale a product , i would never have good resolt in my little business experience if i did not used a plan and follow some rule .
