in my opinion the enjoymanet of young people are more than thats for older people , because young people dont have a lot of ressponsibilities during the youth period such a that upon older people which include home loan , tax , bill . .. etc . also youth always appear interested in party and week end journies done by their friend , on other hand old people prefer stability , comfort and money saving . the youth always like traveling and changing it life routine which he assume a killing factor for his social relation that spent a lot of time producing them . while the older people prefer routine and reacts against change of their life style what ever it wa . according to the long experince of older people , their are more many thing in life than enjoy , for example health , security which appears meanless for the youth . those they have attendance to keep in track for much more time to benefit from each second of the life . finally , according to the prementioned factor , older people have le enjoy than young people , and thats clear from the saying ( eat to live or live to eat ) which best illustrate the difference between this two kind of human being .
