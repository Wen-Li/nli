i agree with the statement completely . these day , there are various kind of advertisement in the world . it is truth that those advertisement make a product seem the best one in the world . there could be sveral method of advertising the product , such a using beutiful model and using the time pressure . first of all , in america , there are a ton of advertisement on television . i think amerians are used to watching those advertisement without any opinion ; in other word , even though the product which are showing on tv look good for them , people who are whatching it do not believe easily . however , i had experiance about that . when i came to amerian . every advertisement were very attrative in my mind , when i saw one scean for advertising pant with a wonderful model , i really wanted to have the pant becuase i thought i would looked like the model when i worn the pant . however , my thought wa completely wrong . when i tried on it , it looked like much fatter than wering the other pant . through this experience , i realized that most advertisement exagerate their product with particular object . in addition , most advertisement show for very short time on tv . short time make people not think carefully ; in other word , when we watch the advertisement , we have to quickly judge whether the product is appropriate or not . it also easy to misunderstand about the product , so we could remember the product would be much better than they really are . although most advertisement exagerate their product , it is difficult to avoid the situation . i think we have to know how to distinguish between the true and worng aspect when we buy some product by advertisement .
