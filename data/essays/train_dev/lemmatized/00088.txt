recently , there is a heat debate on whether there will be fewer car in use than there are today in twenty year . some people hold the believe that the number of car that we will use definitely will not decrease in light of the more competitive world that we will live in . they argue that car are indispensable for our daily life if we want to be high efficient . however , a for me , it is no doubt that there will be fewer car in use than there are today in the next twenty year . i uphold the opinion for the following reason . first of all , i think that people 's awareness on protecting the environment is improving . through the mass medium , we can see the negative impact brought about by our inappropriate treatment to the environment , for example , excessive car emission , which ha a profound impact on the envrionment by polluting the air . i am convinced that people will gradually cultivate the sense of promoting the environment a long a they see the scence that animal are dying out due to the poisioning fume . secondly , with the progress of the scientific technology , i firmly believe that new mean of transportation will be invented to replace the car that we are currently using . owing to the fact that you can never predict what thing might come into being , a tool that is emission-free and envrionment-friendly may be tapped in the next few second . from that moment , the number of car in use will sharply decrease . thirdly , in view of economic perspective , there have been already too many car in use currently . according to a survey conducted by the statistic bureau of shanghai , there will be only 1.2 % of the whole population who want to purchase car in the next 5 year , which mean the demand for car almost achieves a saturation . people do not need car any longer . instead , they may long for having a plane for themselves . up to a point , though some people insist that the there should be more car in use than ther are today in the next twenty year , i consider the number of car to be used will experience a decrease due to the improving awareness of people , new tool that might be brought by scientific technology and the shrinking car demand .
