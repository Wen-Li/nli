i would like to start by stating an old idiom ` nothing succeeds like success` ! which implies that if one suceeds in one field he is more likely to succeed in other field also . and i think it 's true and successful people do have better chance in in succeeding in new field . firstly switching to any fild requires finance and fund at disposal . and if one ha succeeded in a particular field he would definitely be having saving or earning to take risk . and even if they loose they have cushion behind them a they can again go back to the field in which their name ha already been establishjed . and to add to this when one ha earned fame or goodwill in one field they can easily utilize that goodwill in other type of field too . we have many example of well known actor switching to modelling and endorsing commercial brand . the most important factor according to me is confidence . success brings confidence togeather with it and is the main factor that encourages the person to take risk and succeed . moreover a successful person is having experience which he can very well utilize to gain and reducing the probability of failiure . this is true that one should not gamble in a field he is having le knowledge of but also one should not be adverse to risk , a risk and success are directly related . one who is taking risk may or may not succeed , but one who doe not try and take risk can never succeed . and it quite obvious that a sucessful person can take risk with much le fear . in the end i would like to conclude by saying ` risk is not everyman 's game ' and a'a successful person is the one who trys new things rather than sticking to one !
