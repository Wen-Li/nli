at first glance , we may think that speacilazing in one subject is good for u a we can concentrate all our time and energy on just one subject . but having this kind of strategy might prevent u from to complete our necessary improvement . firstly , all kind of science have complex structure that no specific subject can be thought to be completely independent from other academic subject . having no knowledge about other academic subject is something that will always limit u during our study . for instance , a computer scientist like me may never need information about science like physic or chemistry during university study . but if on one day , i need to create a software for a company that produce chemical product , i will need asistance from other people for everything that is related to chemistry . from the project i have made for the industry , i realized that having some knowledge about every topic really help . in fact , a computer engineer can not be seen a a real engineer , if he doe not even have basic concept of general engineering principle . he will always will be incomplete and in need of help from other people . in addition , a far a i learned from the software industry , having broad knowledge of many subject is something that seperates you from other people in the same area and make you chosen instead of others . if we really want to be good in our job , this can not be succeeded by just concentrating on one subject . another fact is that there are so many interesting academic subject in the science . we may be happy if we can have spend some time on some other subject and improve ourselves . it is not a good thing to limit ourselves to just one subject all the time a there might be lot of topic that might be interesting for u . in conclusion , i agree with the statement that it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subject . as we have time and resource to get knowledge about many academic subject during our university study , we should try to get familiar with the highest number of academic subject and we should not limit ourselves to just one top .
