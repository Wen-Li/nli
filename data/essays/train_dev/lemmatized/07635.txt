if we look at the past evolution of the number of car in use on the planet , we easily realise that developmemt of car is strictly linked to the economic global developmemt . that is why , it would be logical and easily understandable that the number of car in use will keep on raising these next twenty year , since it seems obvious that the world economic developmemt will continue . indead , more and more country will be developed and , inside these country and the one whose economy is allready well developed , more and more people will be able to afford car . basically , the economic developmemt , which is the natural trend of every country , lead to an increase of living standard and purchasing power among population . basically , in twenty year , more people will be able to buy car . moreover , the economic developmemt increase the need in transportation , because it brings local economy on a larger and more global scale , a the globalization movement show . the more a country is developing , the more it population and it economy need tranportation mean , such a car . but , many concern about car are today expressed . can we keep on ignoring them , letting number of car increasing withe economic developmemt ? cars are indead in the middle of several present debate . pollution is today a significant concern , a well a declining of oil reserve . it seems that people become more and more aware that they can not continue buying and using car a they do . there is already a trend in reducing number of car in use , illustrated by the common use of car , for instance , for people who want to go in the same place . furthermore , some government try to encourage people to use other transportation mean a airplane or train , which pollute le , by reducing the price of these ticket . but there is also an other reason for asserting that the number of car in use will decrease these next 20 year : the econmy is more and more immaterial , a the developmemt of the internet prof . we wo n't use car a much a today since we wont't need anymore to move for some action or activity . so if the population will le need car , their number per family for example will probably declining . to sum up , i am convinced that the number of car in use will decreasing , because we will have to adapt to new comstraints and also to a new life style .
