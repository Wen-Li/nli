i disagree the statement that in twenty year there will be fewer car in use than there are today . i will prove it in several example below . there is a large amount of car now and so many car company produce the car for busness . if there will be fewer car used in twenty year , the car company will encounter the disaster that thousand of car work will lose the jop . what the society can suffer the million of work who lose the jop walking into government hall to fight . secondly the many famous company such a ford will bankrupt , in economical aspect , if so many big company bankrupt , the wealth the company make for the society will deline . this may cause the product to rise their amount that many low payment worker can not aford to buy the daliy product . more people will suffer the pain . on the oher hand company will resarch the technology to decrease the pollution of car instead of desdroying them . in the scientific aspect , scientist will satisfy the deman of envionment pollution by changing the gas we use to something like electrical battery or product which produce no pollution . though it is a hard work for the company and scientist to do , we believe the car without pollution will make the dream come true in a few year later and car are not decreasing , and even more people will buy the new scientifical car to drive . despite the many car company existing , the large number of worker can keep the jop and economy will rise becuse the worker who get jop buy good . at the same time other industry will rise due to the demanding of car element such like , iron . the society benefit the car and will not let the car decrease .
