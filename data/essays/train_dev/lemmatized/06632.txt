based on my experience i disagree with the statement . from my point of view organized tour trip are more expensive , they lack of flexibility in order to arrange unexpected activity , and they loose the emotion of travelling to a different country and discover the real life and culture , two aspect you can not find out in the touristic scheduled tour . i have travelled twice with an organized tour guide . in both ocassions the trip cost me much more than if i had organized it by myself . it is true that you can get very good group discount , however the hotel they take you are more expensive than the one you can find by yourself for example in a guide book like ` lonely planet ' , through internet or friend reference . the lack of flexibily in a tour guide is another reason that made me organize the trip by myself . organizing the trip by yourself , you can customized your route , visiting only those place you are really interested in , without having to visit every single place the guide belief a interesting . finally and for me the most important reason , it is the discovery of the country 's culture . normally , the tour guide trip follows a route which take the tourist to the most touristic place in the country , place plenty of foreigner and few local people . travelling alone , you can can decide to visit totally unknown place for foreigner where you can speak in a natural way with the local , learning how the really live in a dailybasis . as i mentioned before my experienced made me organized trip by myself instead of hiring tour guide trip . my economy , the flexibility of customize my route and my interest for other culture made me choose these trip a the best way to seize and enjoy a trip abroad
