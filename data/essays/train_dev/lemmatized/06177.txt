i agree with the statement that `` in twenty year there will be fewer car in use than there are today '' . i agree with this becoz nowadays we can see car in every one house , there are so many method to bye a car , like banking is giving u loan to bye a car & the showroom are also been adviticing that we can bye a car in instalment process which mean that we can pay in 3 or 4 term , not only the instalment process but also they are giving finance to u and we can pay interst very month till the lone is completed . these many method are there to bye a car who will not show intrest on bying a car . in the early day , if we the cash in hand then only we can bye a car , due to this only the upper class people , 20 percent of upper midile calss people & the government servent how are in high possition are using the car in those day . however , the time being chaning all the thing also changed . the population also incresing day to day , people are very busy is their work , there is no time at all . along with this traving in bus or train is more difficult for them to go there job or school or collage on time . so , they are using there own car to travel , by this they can save a lot of time , they can travel when ever thay want to go , and in the weekend they can go out along with the famil ymembers and they enjoy . the company are providing u different model of car using different fules , some of them are desels and some of them are petrol and some of them are domostic gas . so the people can bye which will most sutable for there required . so finally , there are esay way to bye a car with out money in hand and they save a time in avioding traving in bus and train and they can enjoy with there familoy member while going outin the weekend . by all these reason i can say that in twenty year there will be fewer car in use than there are today .
