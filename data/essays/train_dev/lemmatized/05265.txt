i agree and disagree with the statement `` young people enjoy life more than older people do . '' i think whether or not this statement is true depends on age group and on culture and society . in japan where student compete with each other for entering good high school and college , they need to spend so much time on studying for high school and college entrance exam and they do not have time to enjoy thier life . however once they anter college they can spend their time on whatever they like to do . they earn money by working part time and spend the money to travel around the world or to do some sport or to have party . after student graduate from their collesges and start working , they again lose time to enjoy their life . corporate worker in japan are expected to work very hard and for many hour a day by their company . marrige and having child reduce their free time further and add financial burden on them . many corporate worker long for their retirement time to come and they try to save little money they have in order to enjoy life after the retirment . in japan , snior citizen who are over 60 and retired from their work are concidered to be richest group of people . they have money from saving they did during all those year of working for their company and also from pension fund . they have a lot of free time . hence , they have enough time and money to enjoy their life at last . the situation in japan i described may be different in other country . in poor country , young people can not afford to go to college and ther are expected to work at their early age . the government or poor country can not provide pension to their senior citizen , so old people there can not enjoy their life a old people in rich countiries like japan can afford to . to enjoy our life , we need some free time and money . but it is very difficult to have enough money and enough free time at the same time in toda
