some people might say that having a broad knowledge is more important than focusing on one specific subject ; this discussion ha been a subject of dispute for some time . however , this argument is asserted a a general rule and omits some important concern that must be addressed in order to substantiate this argument . most conspicuously , the professional life utterly requires you to be proficient in one subject . for instance , knowing accounting standard will not be immensely useful if you are working a a nurse . moreover , student are likely to decide a major when they leave high shools . as an illustration , it is worth having a specific skill in order to make this choice much easier . focusing on a particular subject may therefore be more effective for student . however , it could be argued that a wide knowledge is sometimes more important that focusing on a particular subject . for example , when a worker is made redundant , having a wide range of skill may sometimes be far more efficient in order to find a new job ; this seems to be even more important for people who do not have any degree . likewise , the personal life often requires you to have broad skill . for example , borrowing money , looking after child , repairing a car are situation which require some basic skill in order to be effective . in conclusion , this argument leaf out some key issue even if we may infer that it is a delicate subject . it can sometimes be more important to have a broad knowledge , but it could be also asserted that in some case , it prof most useful to be more proficient in one specific subject . therefore , it depends upon what kind of skill you require .
