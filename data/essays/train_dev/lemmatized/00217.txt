community ? who still help his/her community ? surelly young people do it le and le . it surely is disappointing but there are obviously many reason that explain this behaviour . firstly , it is hard for young people to find time to help their community . since school asks a lot of work and that more and more young people have sport after college , it is difficult for them to find a place in their schedule to help their community . in fact , society is so much turned towards self-accomplishment that it is hard for people brought up with this ideal to turn towards someting else . secondly , the point of view of the friend matter a lot , and since it doe n't sound very `` sexy '' to do community work , a lot of people just never do it . imagine the laughter of friend when you say are helping an old lady while they are going to play basketball ! the young people helping their community may feel rejected and thus stop helping their community . i 'm not saying that paying attention to other people remark is what i 'm doing or what i prone , not at all ! i 'm just saying that it is a behaviour i have observed . thirdly , unless youg people work in a political field where they really have the power to make thing move well people do n't really find it interesting to help their community . nowdays young people are so much turned towards the futur that ( often ) their only idea is to leave their city , to build their own life far away of the one their community have . to conclude , young people do n't really help their community and it is a behaviour that is surelly pittyful . but can we really accuse these young people ? maybe it is also the fault of the society which build u up in a way that we don ' t really feel the need of helping our community . a society yet more independant , more liberal and thus le familiar and social .
