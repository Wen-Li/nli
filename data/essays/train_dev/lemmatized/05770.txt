i think that young people would enjoy more than old . i didnot want to stick upon it . older people are once young only , so they have enoy their teenage life . young one have no responsibility about the family . they will have no tension . older one have family tension and they are now aged , so they donot have that zeal anymore . for young one they will try to do everything new and which is intersting . the example for such situation are they just take part in rock climbing and they participitate on having a roadies show . they are many thing student or young one perform in day to day life . enjoying life doe seem to participitate in cultural activity . some may prefer having a many a girlfriend a a meaningful one to their position etc . the older one will get so much tired and they probably have several health problem . taking guidance to their child about stiudies and different persecptives of them and to look about their health . they probably will have no time in doing other activites othe than these which are enjoyable . young one have no certain problem in it . but they have to study a well a enjoying . the family responsibility would depend on him so much . by experience i noticed t older one also enjoy , but to a little extent rather than young one .
