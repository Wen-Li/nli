i agree with the statement . there are three main reason for that . first , idea and concept are more various than fact . facts have the tendensy , but all idea and concept is defferent from each other by people who made them . second , to learn is easy , but to understand is difficult . students should study hard and not get easy . finally , if student understand idea and concept , they apply thier knowledge to thier life in the future . only to learn fact is not useful . therefore , i think that student should make the much effort to understnd idea and concept , not to learn fact .
