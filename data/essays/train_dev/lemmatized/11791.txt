in my personal experience , i 've noticed that having a better knowledge of one specific subject is better than having a broad knowledge of a number of academic subject . at the university i attended different course referring to three main area : history , law and economics . after my graduation i can say that i had a good knowledge of a series of academic subject , but i realized that this wa not so good for those who are searching a job , in particular the first job experience . in fact , like all my friend did after graduation , i began to search for a job . in trying to find something adequate to my generalistic preparation , i 've understood that it is difficult for people who do n't have a specialization to find a job , in particular a qualified job . talking with some friend coming from economic study , they all told me that the labour market ha notably changed in recent year . these change took place since a strict division of work had become a necessity for company and factory , for example . consequently , it could be noticed that who offer a job is generally looking for qualified candidate , for people who have a high knowledge of a particular topic or , in better word , who is specialized in a specific subject . i have found that this is true , because all my friend who obtained a phd or attended technical faculty have found a job in just a few month , while others with a more generalistic knowledge or university degree are still searching for a job . in conclusion i agree with those who prefer to specialize in a specific subject , because i think that in doing so , they could have more chance to find a job .
