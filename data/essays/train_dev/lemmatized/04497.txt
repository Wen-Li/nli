in my personal opinion it very important to understand idea and concept . nevertheless fact are the basis to really understand idea and concept . so learning fact and understanding is closely connected to each other . you ca n't understand for example politic system in country , without knowing some of their history . why the british have an constituitional monarchy and germans have a federal democrazy . the reason for this lie in their history , and you can learn history only through record from the past , which would be fact ( if the source is reliable of course ) . this is also true for many other area from sport to science . if you do n't know the rule ( which are fact ) of football you will never be able to get the concept of the sport . if you do n't know number it will be difficult to become a math genius and so on . .. of course there are some area where not many fact or knowledge exists or still many thing are unknown . in this area like for example in biology and astrology you have to formulate and develop fact through observing and experiment . this is naturally way harder than the normal approach to understand idea and concept with the help of knowledge ( fact ) . but this people also had to start with fact until they come to the point where there are no real fact are left , so that they can go on from there . so my statement is that in general you just can not say that understanding idea and concept is more important than learning fact , because thy are intertwined . besides some few exception in area where you have still to explore a lot of fact . by the way . a special exception is of course religion . since fact are often threatening religion . that 's why from a religious point of view it would better not to spend too much time on fact and just go with the concept and idea of the religion , be it christianity or something else .
