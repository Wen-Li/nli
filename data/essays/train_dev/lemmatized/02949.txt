i disagree with the statment that in twenty year will be a fewer car in use than today . cars are important now for humanity and they will be important till we find something more effective to bring u or our good from a to b , but that will not happen in the next twenty year . cars are also important to people because they mean freedom . with my car i am able to get to every point in the world it make me mobile and more available to the world . in the next twenty year the population an earth will increase . more people also mean there will be a bigger need for car . people will ask for them because they are available and company are going to satisfy this need in matter to make profit . they statment could be formed by the fact that our fossile resource are getting le but i am sure mankind will find a solution for this problem . companys already started to test optional resource instead of the tradional one . if our fossile resource are empty we will just switch to another one so that is not a point why there should be le car in twenty year . another fact why i think we will not see le car in the twenty year is the reason we need car . we need them to bring good to the destination we need them . our hunger for resource like water and food will increase in twenty year because we gonna be more people on this planet . since we live in city and not on farm anymore this resource need to come to u . we have to transport them from there origion to there destination . cars are the best solution for this problem because the are the cheapest solution to solve this problem so far and i am sure that will not change in the next twenty year . i disagree with the statment there will be fewer car in twenty year because we need car to satisfy our need on resource on the fastest and profitablest way we can . also i am sure we wound see le car because we dont wanna give them up car give u the feeling of being free and people do not want to lose this feeling .
