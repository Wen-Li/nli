what is the most important thing we have to learn at school or at university ? that is the question . .. is the most important thing to have a good understanding of the main concept or idea ? or is it to learn a lot of information , without having a good comprehension of the main concept ? according to me , the main character for a good student at the end of the school is a good comprehension and an hability for reproducing the concept . in your argumentation , we will present some element in order to give our own opinion . first , i think it 's very important for a student to be abble to reproduce the main way of a reflexion . for example , concerning a mathematical exercise , a student wil be judged about his hability to do again the problem with different information . so that 's more important , it is'nt the basic information but the way of reflexion . it 's generally the same for evey scientific topic . to my mind , it 's better to understand the general idea until of the general fact . secondly , i believe for general fact a the history fact , student have all time to learn it in the free time . for example , i do n't think a little boy , if he doe n't know the name of the actual president , will be a bad student . on the contrary , this boy can have the information by other way : television , news-paper , radio . .. and i do n't think the perfect student is the student who know everything concerning all the topic . so for me , a good student will generally curious and in the most case , he will search the information by his owns capability . last but not least , it 's clear that understanding concept is more important in the real life that learning a lot of fact . in fact , if a young student ha many habilities in learning his history lesson at the age of 8 year , but without understanding concept , it will probably be hard for him to continue high school . so it 's necessary to early learn comprehension and understanding . to sum up our reflexion , it appears that understanding the main idea and concept is very important for a student who want to integrate an high school . the fact are also important , but we have all the time to get it , whereas it is not the case for the general comprehension .
