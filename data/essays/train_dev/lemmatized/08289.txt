it is debatable whether traveling alone is the best way to travel that by a tour guide . some people might recommend to travel alone a least once in order to have alone time to sort out our think and relieve stress by having peace away from their heavy load of taks . however , i firmly believe that go on a trip alone is not the best way to travel because there are many dangerous vacation spot and it is time consuming . first of all , traveling in a group of people with tour guide is much safer . it is a tour guid who know well about the vacation spot based on their previous experience by living the place for a long time . we not only obtain accurate information that the place we should not go but also be protected with a member of group by moving with a lot of people . therefore , by traveling with a group of people led by tour guide allows people not to face unexpected situation including lose their money by lobberies , meet gangster and lose their way . for example , when i traveled hong kong alon two year ago , i went to the opposit direction to the park that i had planned to go . i could not speak chinese so , i could not ask anything to the people around me . i felt scared and cried all they long . in addition , traveling with tour guid in a group is much time saving . this is because poeple doe not have to make a schedual researching the information about famous place by comb through all the book and call all the hotel to reserve . poeple just follow guided direction withouth worring to check the time schedule of transportation , wherher the hotel reservation is available or not . without worring those thing , people can spend more enjoyable time with goup of people by talking about their feeling and sharing impression each other . to demonstrate , according to the research conducted of labor of korea in 2007 , 75 % people felt more memorable and enjoyable trip when they traveled with a group of poeple by tour guide . in addition , they answered that the reason why they felt happy with the trip is they doe not have to worris about the information making trip . for these reason , traveling with a group of people is more advantageous to make their trip more fun because of the time and feeling of sager . i belive that people should take into account those thing before they go on the trip alone .
