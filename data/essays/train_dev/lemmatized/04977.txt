i support the idea that most advertisement give wrong information to make product look better by three way . firstly , company use many picture which is not about the product . customers notice the advertisement by the picture which is not about the product . it mean that customer give first impression by something which is not the product , and then they misunderstand that this first impression is about the product . thus , advertisement give wrong information for customer . secondly , company use many technique to stand the product out . for example , a silver watch stand out in black backglound , and it make the product very cool . however , when the watch is used , most of background color is skin color . in this color background , a silver watch stand out le than in the black background . this kind of technique is often used for advertisement . thirdly , company use word which make the product very good . they often use the word , such a new , cheep , and good , but these word do not describe the important characteristic of product . for instance , a cheeper computer always ha le performance , such a amount of herd disk . however , company try to hide this fact by using the word cheep because the word cheep attracts customer . in other word , they try to give wrong information for customer . to conclude , most advertisement tend how to sell more instead of how to inform the good aspect of the product . the main purpose of company is making more money , so the customer have to understand that most information from advertisement include lie and be clever .
