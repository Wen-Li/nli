i think both are important . to learn idea an concept help to u to ubicate in a context and time . normally , they are very useful when there are not experience in one subject . concepts help to start to know about any issue and then , normally people start to develop your own judge about thing and understand the different alternative that exist for a problem . in the other hand , facts are also imporatant because bring to u part of the knowledge and help to bring more information . i think every fact must to be acompanied by concept and idea clearly understood . facts help to u to have a general idea about some special issue and help u to ubicate in the context we want to develop . also fact help to understand about anything in a very brief manner , they are very useful when there is a short period of time for analyze information or know about something . i.e. if you are a customer and need to know about some company , it will be very helpful to have a spreadsheet of the company with the main fact . after that you will have to investigate more about that fact but it is very helpful for initiate that investigation . concepts help to support any idea that each person want to develop , also help to understand how the thing work and evaluate diferent option . concepts are essential part of our life . if we dont have concept , we dont have knowledge , so we need to be guessing all the time . it is important to mention that to know a concept is not enough , the most important issue is understand it , because once we know the concept and understand it we can apply our own idea , other concept , solution , etc. and find a logical solution to almost all the thing .
