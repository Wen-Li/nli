i agree with the idea that people should have broad knowledge of many academic subject instead of just specialize in one certain subject . there are many reason supporting my opinion . first , i believe that academic subject are the path leading to the knowledge of the world , therefore one should n't limit his or her time devoting within only one subject ; people , especially college student , should take various course in all kind of field before they decide what certain academic field they wish to receive further education . if we only study one certain field , we will loose the whole forest for one tree . second , i believe that although knowledge is categorized into assorted academic subject , each individual subject is related to one another ; therefore we could not possibly understand one subject without studying the others . for example , math is considered a `` the mother of all science , '' but people studying in philosophy still need to learn math in order to understand the foundation of logic , no le than researcher in physic , engineering , or finance field . last but not least , a the old saying go , `` learning is like buliding a pyramid ; the broaden you build it , the taller it reach . '' by learning widely initially we can easily understand a specific subject later . moreover , if we can not absorb a broad range of academic subject , our perspective will also be narrowed . we wo n't be able to accept opposite idea and multiple opinion from other , nor will we be willing to adopt new thought and image from subject outside of our own instantly . in conclusion , i believe that `` jack of all trade is also master of one . '' a person who acquires broad knowlege of many academic subject could undoubtedly achieve speciality in one specific subject too . therefore , i agree with the idea that the former is better than the latter .
