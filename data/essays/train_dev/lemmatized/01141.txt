i disagree with stateman that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their community becouse the young spend many of his or her time to help the person that have some disability and also help the older people , for this reason the statement is wrong . an example is if a young have a grandparent such a grandfather or grandmother when he help them he make an help for the community becouse they spend a time to help an older person to buy food , water , medicine and other and ha also spend time to speack with them that in some case is more important than when a person go to them only for take a list of what they necessity . this is the same aspect that there is when a young help a person with disability becouse the true problem is n't his inability to do something but is the necessity to speack and play with other person same to him or her and this person is the young . i know a lot of young people that over the time that he spend for him also spend a little or a large of the time that remain to him to help this person and this is very important for the community and the people that do this .
