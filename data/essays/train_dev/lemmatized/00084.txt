i agree with the statement . but i do n't mean that young people are nowadays unkind but mean that they are looking at other place , not thier community . for example , many young people want to go overseas to help other people . it is a kind of trend among young people to participate in project of npo or other group doing volunteer activity . in actual , i saw many time the advertisment of such kind of project , tour or distribution . even though travel agency offer those special tour that tie up with those activity group . so i can say that it 's very very common and popular to help poor people or distructed green . but i do n't think they are really serious about the comunity around them . probably they do something for their commnunity , but will not give enough time to do that . there are two reason . the one is because of grobalization . we learn so many thing about other country from many source and some of young people can learn it directly . they could get to know the people in south africa sufferd and hungered . these knowledge is enough for them to participate in the tour for delively food and comodities for the people in south africa . the another , is also related with that . everything of other country is very different from thing that they have . food , custom and culture . these thing are very interesting for young people , and it make them take to other country . they can learn atractive and new thing , and some of them are really abusoluted in thing of other country . compared with thing g other contries , thing around them is le atractive . so that 's why they are not very interested in their community .
