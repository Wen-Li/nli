students have to do both : understand idea and concept , and learn fact . first of all , i do agree with the statement that understand idea and concept is more important than learning fact . for instance , in an history class , the professor will teach the date , when the event happened , but more importantly why , which is the idea or the concept . even though it is worth mentioning date because it is part of the history and it is also culture , in my point of view , learning the idea and the concept is more important . learning how the second world war started , the concept , the behavior of the government and the reaction of people is more interesting than knowing that hitler died and the war ended in 1945 . another example would be the continent . students know that a long time ago , there wa only one continent , then two ( the northern continent and the southern continent ) and finally seven continent . that is a fact . what would be interesting is to understand why and how it happened and that would be the concept of change in temperature and drift of the continent . nowadays , it would be the effect of the global warming on the ice and the level of the ocean . secondly , if student understand the idea and the concept , they will remember it easily . moreover , they will be able to use them afterwards for another application . understanding the idea and the concept refers to use the intelligence . to the contrary , student learn so many fact that they won t be able to remember all of them . nevertheless , learning fact is also useful . even if student can not remember all of them , it is worth doing it because it stimulates the brain . the memory ha to be used . besides , it is nonsense to understand idea and concept without learning fact . i agree with the statement but also think that both are necessary .
