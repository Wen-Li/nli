i agree with the statement . in many year , since car were created and got on sale , people have used them and had them in their life a their leg to go where they want to go . and car are also contribute to carry stuff faster and easier , not just people . today , car are needed by world and people life a i wrote . but you know what car need to move . that is gas . people also have used much gas along with car since they started to ride car . but it led oil that creates gas to be used up from underground of the earth faster . if people did n't touch , it would n't happen . but spending or wasting of gas is still going on now . so , wasting of oil caused using up of them . that is about why country that have oil is making the oil ( gas ) price higher and higher . then , who need more car that us gas even more than now in the future ? looking at the plobrem , scientist are trying to find or create new kind of fuel to move the car for gas . for example , there is an interestion way to get new fuel . they are finding the way out to get fuel form suger . when suger get heated up , it make a kind of alcohole . and that can be used for car only if they are mixed with gas . now , suger alcoholes ca n't be new fuel being used by itself , but scientist believe that they will finally sucssed making them completed and people will be able to start using them to ride their car . actually , this work is going well now by the scientist . and that 's why i said people wo n't need any more car moved by gas . that can be said that it is not so far people start riding car with new fuel , i consider . otherwise , people wo n't be able to have their life like right now with car . from the reason i wrote avobe , i agree with the idea in twenty year there will be fewer car in use than there are today .
