i agree that successful people try news thing and take risk rather than only doing what they already know how to do well , for these reason ; by trying new thing allow you to be curious to know how someone did it and you will find out how to do it too , that way it make you make a research . by trying new thing allow you to be positive in your mind and to have a great desire to succed no matter how difficult is the situation . by trying new thing you no that you should be openminded , go through disscussion with people who have done the same thing to learn their way of doing thing , you should meet or have conversation with a lot of these people in other to learn from their experience . by trying new thing you take a big risk , like in `` french we say if you do n't risk you do n't have anything '' , risk in a goog way to takle something . we never know if we might succed or not the only way to do it is to risk . since we do not loose anything when we risk . ed as for me doing the same thing every day become boring , i can say is a waste of energy and time , to conclude , people who succed try new thing and take risk rather than only doing what they already know how to do well .
