when we go outside we see lot of car around and we easily observe that the number is still increasing in a very rapid rate . we usually think that this increase will not stop or slow down but i think there will be fewer car in use than there are today in twenty year . to start with ; one thing is very clear : technology is improving continuously . if we had lived 50 year ago , we would not have imagined the level of improvement in the life style of people nowadays . i do not think that my grandmother would have thought that i can communicate with my friend in united states by simply sitting in front of a screen and writing . everything is replaced by a better thing day by day , even second by second . i have to admit that car are the major way of transportation ; but for now . in twenty year , by development in several area ; they will be replaced by other mean of transportation like travel by light or by small plane-like vehicle . some may think that these idea are extreme and will not happen in twenty year . this can also be possible , in twenty year car may still be the major transport vehicle but again there will be fewer car in use than there are today . even if the technology will not change our life that much , we can change it by ourselves . if public transportation become easier and more available , i think most of the people will use public transport instead of their own car which will reduce the number of car significantly . this is also about something with the improvement of people . when people stop thinking individually and think more general , they will certainly use public transport more and thereby they will reduce the car in the road . as a consequence ; in twenty year fewer car will exist in the road . of course , we can not predict the future or say certain thing about certain topic but i think i have reason to believe it . the most important of all , i want to believe it .
