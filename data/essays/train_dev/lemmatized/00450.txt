it is better to have braod knowledge of many academic subject than to specialize in one specific subject . i am agree with the above statement because of the following reason . these day getting job is very competetive . for getting job , surviving in society you need to know lot of thing . every where you are using lot of concept . for example take soft ware engineer . he need to know computer scince , mathematics , english , business logic . if he dont know one of the above , he ca n't grow in that job . nowadays the gap between any two academic subject is going down . we are using lot of subject for understanding single subject . consider the example mathematics . recent day for understading mathematics , we need physic , chemistry and some other topic . similarly we are using mathematics for solving lot of problem in phycics , chemistry , space related problem . even we are using mathematics in medicine . similarly every subject used for understanding other subject . if you have knowledge in single subject , we ca n't under stand recent mathematics . in reasearch , scintists are using lot of concept for finding one application . for understanding recent research paper single subject knowledge is not sufficiant . take an expamle space programme . in space programme we are using mathematics , statistic , physic , aeronautics etc . .. not only space programme every where we are using lot of subject . finally for surviving in this competitive world , for doing good reasearch , we need to know lot of concets . for that we need to study lot of academic subject than to specialize in one specific subject . .
