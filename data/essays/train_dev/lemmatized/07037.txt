although i think i am young , i can not enjoy my life because of lack of money and time . i had to study hard to attend a good university since i wa a child . after graduating from university , i also had to get a job to earn money for living . as a result , i disagree that young people enjoy their life than older people do because of lack or money and time . i think that the older can enjoy life more . first of all , the older have more money than the young . we need money to do something . if i like reading novel , i have to buy book . if i like a travel , i have to buy a car or buy a expensive airline ticket for going abrod . because of this money problem , i can not often travel abroad . however , my parent used to go abroad for their enjoyment because they are rich . they have enough nomey to buy expensive ticket and to pay for luxury hotel room . i am envious his welth , so i am working hard to earn more money . secondly , young people have no enough time to enjoy their life . when they were child , they have to study hard . because their parent want to go more high repuataional university , they have spend all time to study . they also have no time after graduating from university . because tuition fee of university is very expensive , the young people would have a lot of depth after graduation . after all , they have to work hard for the depth and then for marriage and for their child . in contrast , old people would have a lot of time if many old people already retired . thus , old people were not worry about lack of time . in conclusion , although young people have more high physical power than older people , young people can not enjoy their life more than the old people because young people have no enough money and time . as a result , i disagree that the young enjoys life more than the old doe . i think that when young people work hard , they can be seen a good people .
