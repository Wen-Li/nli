due to the very fact that the question statement entail a broad generalization , i must disagree with it , a generalization normally look inaccurate to me . notwithstanding , i would like to provide some personal insight in order to explain why i also disagree with such statement due to the fact that it look , from my point of view , totally misleading . although we can find very different enjoyment level in those person around u , young people do not necessarily enjoy life more than older people do , and vice-versa . i acknowledge the fact that there are really happy young person , but just a much a i acknowledge the fact that there are also lot of really happy older person . i do believe , however , that both population group enjoy life somewhat differently : - while young people tend to have a more active lifestyle , generally doing more exercise and having a more intense social life , older people seem to have more sedentary habit , usually prefering to stay at home longer hour and also increasing the amount of time they spend with their spouse or family , at the expense of the time dedicated to social activity with non-relatives . - another difference that can explain why young and older people lifestyle differ so much is the level and nature of their responsibility . younger people can usually enjoy themselves without having to worry too much for anybody else , a they do not normally have child or grandchild to feed and take care of . on the other hand , older person are generally responsible , at least partially , for the education and the welfare of their offspring , which although entail quite a bit of time and effort , is often regarded of a a very rejoycing experience . - last , but not least , the level of physical and mental health ha also a great impact on both young and older people . while the former generally enjoy stronger and healthier body that help them carry out and enjoy more intense physical activity , the latter are normally considered to be wiser and more experienced , and therefore better positioned and endowed to enjoy the quieter pleasure that life offer and fight the battle that it often present . the above reason help me explain why young and older people can enjoy life equally , despite having very different lifestyle !
