some people think that successful people always explore new thing and taking risk of it . however , most people will think that people do thing what they know how to do well are also success . in fact , we should determine the people are success or not in different way . first of all , people who are success by taking risk are mostly because they are lucky . investing money to a company , for example , you can gain a lot of money from it by the company getting bigger and bigger , but in the other way , you might also lose a lot of money because the company is closed . when you gain money , it is not because you are smart . when you lose money , it doe not mean that you are not having ability . it is just because being success sometines just depends of your luck , but not your ability . however , in contrast , in sometimes , trying new thing can bring people success . for example , the inventers are always try to discover new thing that we do not recognize at all . they are successful because they have an ability to invent new thing , and not for luck . the last but not least , people keep doing thing they already know how to do well doe not mean he/she is not successful , although most lower-classes is just keep doing same thing in every time . for instance , all of the engineer always repair a same thing each time , but they are usually high educated . in fact , no one will say that engineer are not successful . as a result , to define a people is success or not , we should not only consider he/she if she tried new thing or not , but also think of the other way , such a if he ha a high education or not .
