i completely agree with the statement that at present young people do not spend time to help the community they live in . one reason for this is the change in individual attitude towards community problem . nowadays , people are too much selfish and focused on their own individual need to be able to realize that there is the opportunity and sometimes the real need that their effort and time are also employed in something which help the community growing and living . this problem affect also young people . forn instance they spend more time in playing videogames and watching television , thinking about their own satisfaction , and they do not go outside the wall of their house to understand the problem of the world surrounding them . in addition , there is a problem connected with the lack of common value . due to the fact that at present most of the time the community the young people live in are multicultural and it is likely that within the same community member do not share the same value ( such a religious , ethical , political value ) , it is often difficult for young people to find out which are the need of the community . further , i think another problem is in the lack of curiosity . young people at present are le curious then in the past . this is due to the fact that it easier for them to access information , get answer and satisfy their need : they do not make many effort to solve problem and find answer to the question the surrounding world pose . this affect their ability to understand the problem of the community they live in and find a solution for them . in other word , they do not help their community because thay are not able to help them . in conclusion , it would be opportune that , starting from the primary school , teacher and parent teach young people how to understand reality and
