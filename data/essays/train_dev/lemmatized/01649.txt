i disagree with traveling in a group led by a tour guide . scinse i would rather be alone than do something with others , i wouldnot like to be in a group . first , i would rather go wherever i want with what i feel that time . i love to adventure to the place where i have never been or had never known . tours with some tour guide are generally planned by them . it may prevent me to do something i want . planned thing do not suit to me . moreover i am not a very timely person . therefore i am afraid that i would not be able to be on time . second , i like to enjoy by myself , which doe not mean i do not like people though . of cause , there are many benefit that a being a member of tour group . the tour guide may explain a lot of infornmation abd detail such a what kind of place they are , or these history and what is famous for . i am sure it would greatly help my tour fantastic , but i would rather than find new thing by my own . i believe that it is so much exciting and i can enjoy my tour more a discovering . as being in tour group , i might feel like i am watched from other people every time . i might not enjoy much because of this feeling .
