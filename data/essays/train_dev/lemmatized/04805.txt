today , more and more often old people is showed by the society a slow and sad people . but this point of view is really restrictive and can not be share with everybody . first , to my mind , the definition of `` enjoying life '' can change with your age : not because you can not enjoy like before but just because your mind change . for example , when you are a child , `` enjoying your life '' is just to play with your game . when you begin to be a teenager `` enjoy life '' is to begin go in club , in bar . when you are thirty year old , you need to enjoy life spending time with your friend or succeeding in your job . i think when you are young , it is really hard to understand enjoying life of older people because you did not discover what they lived and what they need . then i think anybody need to enjoy his own life with his own dream or his own hobby . more when you become older , your body can accept everything it accept when you were young . something which wa really sweet and so easy to do when you were young can become quickly hard and so strong . then a thing , you think in your childhood too hard or too string can become with your age really easy , funny or sweet . for example , to do go in club or do extrem sport can become really hard when you are older , and to learn chess can become really enjoying when you are older . to conclude , i do n't think every body can have the same one , because this term is linked to the target you gave to your life . this target can change and is too much personnal to be shared with everybody . and this is really hard for the different generation to understand why older or younger enjoying life with a another another activity which is not your view of `` enjoying life '' .
