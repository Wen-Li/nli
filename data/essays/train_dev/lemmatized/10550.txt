i would like to understand idea and concept rather than learning fact . there are several reason why i prefer this way . first , a fact can be more easily to use if you know the concept of it . if you do n't have any idea about some fact , you ca n't go further step in order to improve your ability . for example , let 's say you know many formula about math , but doe n't know how to use it . of course it is really important to know formula . but , when you have a math test , you will be confuse because you have no idea what the formula mean . you 'll have variety of fact , but you ca n't use it properly . by contrast , if you understand the concept of the formula , you know how and when to use it . secondly , if you know the concept of something , it is easily to understand the fact . this is because you feel comfortable when you have some image that are related to the fact . i can say this by using example from math formula again . if you have image of basic formula , you should n't have hard time to memorize many formula at the same time . sometimes i get confuse when i encounter to new rule we use in the math class . this is because i do n't have a basic understanding about formula , which mean i have no idea about it . when i know how to prove why the formula can be used , i have deep idea about it , so it is not painful to memorize it . also , if i know some background of these formula , i do well on the math exam . finally , you can improve in some way by understanding the concept . when i play golf , the ball curve from right to left . if i want to fix this curving , i ca n't just shot million of ball until i could finally make it straight . at first , i have to know why and how a golf ball make a curve . this part is the concept . once i got some basic idea , now i can hit and try some different swing in order to make the ball straight .
