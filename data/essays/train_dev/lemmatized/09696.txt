my opinion is very simple . .. i think that is true , young people do n't give enough time to helping their community . but i think that they are n't totaly guilty of this . in many case the action of a person born to the contest when they spent their life . .. family , school , frieds and tv and all of the thing that a person do in the first part of his life will influence his personality . the gift that a young people take to his life coach , are deeply wrong . it 's true that people do n't help enough their community , but is early true that at the moment there is n't good example to follow and so will become everybody best person . i know that there are many person that are more intersting to help everyone , but for me this person are early a small number . i'am very intersting for this theme . .. really !!! at the moment , in fact , i work on a call center that help some student of my country that have family problem and thei do n't have the possibility to explain their problem to anyone . .. for this reason i think that is very , very , very important tell to all the people to do the right thing and begin to help the people that are around we . and the better way is beginning to is't the first of all
