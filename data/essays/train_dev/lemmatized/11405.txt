i do not think there will be fewer car than today in twenty year , although i think it would be a positive thing for the environment . there are many way to discourage people to use their car , but these way are not very often put into practice . some country , like the scandinavian country , have been very successful in reducing the use of car . the method they used are well-known : tax incentive , available and cheap public transportation , ban on car in city center , education and sensibilisation to environmental issue . .. by reducing significantly the use of car , the standard of living is also enhanced : le pollution , le noise , le trafic jam , le stress . .. all of these are positive consequence of an environment-friendly policy . unfortunately , many country are not following denmark , sweden or norway 's example . the united-states for instance are the biggest car-users in the world . one reason is that it is a very large country , with huge distance to cover . another reason is that oil is cheap . moreover , the public transportation service is disastrous . conveniency is also a reason for the intempestive use of car : it is easier to take your car than to do a five-minute walk or to catch a bus . there might also be a cultural element in the american taste for car . given the governments'policy concerning car , i doubt the use will significantly diminish in twenty year ' time . an alternative method to escape car pollution might be the search for non polluting device that would allow to use environment-friendly car . hybrid car , using partly oil and partly electricity or non-polluting oil , already exist . but there is also an economical aspect to the question . huge economical interest are at stake . the oil market deal with enormous amount of money , and big oil corporation do not want to see their profit decline . they try to discourage the search for new technology to replace oil . but , a the stock of oil will diminish more and more , those technology will have to be developped anyway . but , first of all , the international community will have to become aware of this problem . to conclude , i would like to say that there will probably not be fewer car in use in twenty year . but , hopefully , these car will be environment-friendly car .
