it is a indoubtable fact that people get much older these day than in ancient time . though the medium try to illustrate the image of a generation of youth where getting old is stigma old people enjoy life more than ever before . these day old people certainly also enjoy life like younger people do . never before the senior generation ha had more financial opportunity than it had today . more poeple than ever before have their own house and home they live in . whereas young people have to spend huge amount of their money in building home or paying rent senior citizen can afford most of their pension for their own need . furthermore , old people do not have to afford the expensive raise of a child which is an enormous burden for young parent . old people have much more time to spend than young people . due to globalisation young people have to work more and compete with other worker to archieve their goal . mostly beeing retired senior citizen have the time to do everything they want . maybe they could go for a timeefficient hobby or travel to far place of the world a working person could never go to due to the lack of time . thanks to great effort in modern medicine the older generation can expect to live much longer then we ever did before . doctors nowadays can handle even serious medical problem . the decline in blue-collar worker is also the decline of hard physical work which also led to health problem before . globalisation also made possible to travel to almost each place in the world without problem . affording more money than any other generation before older people often decide to spend their last time of their life in their area where they dreamed of when they were younger . neither wa a generation before able to do that nor do we know if today 's youth will ever have the opportunity to do it .
