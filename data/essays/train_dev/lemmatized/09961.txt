in these day , college have many programes to offer for student . each student ha different opinion about having broad knowledge of many academic subject thand to specialize in one specific subject . personally , i think to have specialize in one specific subject can much achievment for the goal . fistly , if you learn many thing academic subject , you can not learn deeply . for instance , when i wa high school student , i learned lot of thing during the three year . i could not concentrated one subject because there are too much topic so , i can not find related each subject . therefore , it doe not help me to learn many subject so , i prefer to learn just one subject . it can be more concentrate for me . secondly , in these day , we have specialize person for each division part . when you know broad thing and doe not know specific about their subject , you can not do anything in our society . many people do the best their own subject and they are become speciall person who know really well about their own department . if you concentrated just one subject and learned lot of thing , you can help people who want to need to you . however , if you learned lot of subject , you did not get specific lesson from that subject . lastly , we do not have lot of time to learn everything during the life . we have lot of subject aroud u and if you choose one subject you should concentrated that because we do not have much of time to learn just one subject too . for example , i am nusing student so , i always think about care for patient and learned lot of thing for patient . i do not have much of time to learn lot of subject because , i am not perfectly to learn whole one subject . one subject ha lot of thing so , i decided learn only one thing . when i all in the nusing , i can improve my care skill . therefore , i will be a better nurse when i will graduated . i think , to concentrated one subject , can be make more specialize their own position . to conclude , there are many subject in our life . everyone want to learn everthing but we can not learn everything because each subject ha lot of material . in my opinion , learn to specialize in one specific subject is the better than have broad knowledge of many academic subject because , if you concentrated just one subject , you can be learn lot of thing deeply .
