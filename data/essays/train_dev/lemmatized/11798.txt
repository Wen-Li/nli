these day , company made many new item which is only for woman . there are many iems such a desk , chair are made simply for woman . in addition , in korea , there are going to have car which are only for woman to use it . however , many people are curious about that if those car are going to sell a lot . in my opinion , in twenty year there will be fewer car in use than there are today . first of all , now , people are much concern about the enviornment . as you see , there are many car are bring about the air pollution problem . people are hard to breath and even some people are getting illness because of the air pollution . in addition , there are not much oil left in the earth and price of the oil is much higher than before . thus people are hard to afford it because of the high cost . now , people are think about their lack of recource and try to conserve it . second , a the population grows , people need more area to live in . if there are many car , people have to live in much shorter space . this is because , we need parking area and road for those many car . moreover , people want the park , art gallery near by their living . parents want to have a space more for kid . as you see , in the city , there are not much place for the kid because of the parking lot and road . thus , people are more willing to build facility such a library , park rather than building the road for car . in conclusion , i think there will be fewer car in use because of that people are now concerning about air polution problem , and a population grows , people are think about the space they live in . they want to have the place which is more beneficial to their childern .
