i study communications and i have learned that one of the objective of advertising is to rescue the positive thing of a product or service . so i disagree with the statement that `` most advertisement make product seem much better than they really are '' because i think that advertisement do n't make product seen better , they just show the positive thing of a product . for example , if i buy watch , maybe my watch are n't cheap , but they have a guarantee for 10 year . so i have to communicate - in the advertisement - `` my watch are n't cheap but you are going to save a lot of money because of the 10 year guarantee '' . what is not permitted is to be dishonest . in a class named `` legislation of the communication medias '' i learned that are advertising code and rule that shoud n't be broken . in that code is stated that company ca n't lie about their product . once i heard a profesional in advertising saying that `` if you have to use dirty kind of advertisement is because you are'nt a good advertiser '' . i completely agree with that . if you are professional in what you do , you will sure find a good quality of the product to advertise instead of breaking rule and being dishonest . its true that advertisement have to persuade , but there are a lot honest and legally way to make an effective persuation . of course there are advertisement that make the product seem much better than they really are , but i do n't think there are the most . there will always be people that brake rule , but you will surprise to see how many people make his best effort with the rule they have .
