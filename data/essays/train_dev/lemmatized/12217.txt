the issue of that life is more appreciates by the young people rather than old people is a controversial one . on the one hand when a person is old she appreciate life in a better way . on the other hand certain young people consider that youth must discover lifer rather than studie . however , in the final analysis i believe that an older people enjoy life more than certain young people do . one of the reason of my belief is that study are too important to be sacrified by an edonist behaviour . indeed , every person who made studie and who have had a knowledge enjoy life with benefict . more than a person who decides to leave studie for enjoy life . the abbility of speaking different language is the greatest example . to my mind enjoy life would say bring to another people with another culture and another language . another way to justify my point of view is that life experience allows to discover more subtilities of life . for instance love deception , familly death allow to take the time to discover and apprecaite life . generaly is not the case of young people . the life experience bring some knowledge or behaviour that it is impossible to learn without experience . it is probably a empirical pompous speech , but for me experience is very important . last but not least , i am firmly convinced that the life is very interesting to discover but with money this become amazzing . when i say that i think particulaly to trip abrove in some part of the world . for example a trip in asia for an occidental person allows to discover a new culture and to enjoy life . however this trip is impossible without money . for all these reason i believe that the age and the experience are necessary to enjoy life . in fact , we can not pas our young year to studie and wait to discover the world and , by the occaion the life , but it is an hisytory of compromise .
