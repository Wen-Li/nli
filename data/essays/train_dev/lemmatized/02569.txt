first of all , i want to express that life is taking risk . people born with risk , they improve or change their and other 's life with risk . think that you are in an unknown forest that you do n't know anything about . you can stay and wait someone to come and escape you or you can start to move without knowing where you are going . maybe the first way is the secured one but also it is the closed one , it is closed to movement , finding , improvement or disappointment . some of you can think that it is not logical to choose the way that go to disappointment but i do n't think so because every acknowledge is reached by suffering and disappointment . consider van gogh , edison , tresca and the others . .. how did they paint the incredible picture or how did they create the complex physical formula ? how did the people go to the moon ? they all took risk to improve . .. even we have born on this theory because falling in love is also a risk . if our mother and father have not taken that risk , we would not be on the earth today . .. let 's think on an other hand . .. while we are searching for something , in fact we learn very different thing from we are trying to reach , different problem and view force u to think in different way so we think more and more . .. we find ourselves in a different field and we produce more problem and solution . it mean we change and improve ,,,, yes , but what is the success ? is it to gain too much money or have everything ? absolutely no . it is to change , not to step on the same land . .. we have borned to this beautiful world , we should try to change our world better and better . for u , for others and for our child , we should courage to take risk . .. for all the beautiful and peaceful thing . ..
