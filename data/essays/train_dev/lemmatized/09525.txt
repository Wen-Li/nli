as we all know , different people hold different view . whether one would choose many academic subject or one specific subject to study , each would have it advantage and disadvantage , it benefit and drawback . thus , a good argument could be made for either . as for me , however , i definitly prefer to have broad knowledge , so i agree with the statement . granted , a number of people of people study a special subject such a scientist who may during their whole life , the reasion is they really love the subject deep into heart . also , these people do a parament promotion to our society . on the other hand , however , living in an ever-accelerate society , we , it seems , can never avoid being influenced by information . we have to receive thousand of news or handreds of word everyday . it make me belive that without a broad knowledge , we could not even communicate with others , not mention to survive . what is more , a the reason of the society is so rapid pace , most of people may change their work in the future . thus having broad knowledge of manyacademic may adopt the new job in a short time because of they have know how to deal with the thing . for example , an increaing number of people who change their work more than once a year . why they get other job so easily ? in my opinion , they all have broad knowledge and strong ability . last but not least , student may have more motivition to study more ragion of knowledge . in my point of view , most of student like the intigratited knowledge , may be two or three subject , sometimes evenmore . that also can expand their horzion and get a world wide knowledge . in a word , in spite of the fact that there may a couple of disadvantage of study many academic , i still feel that the advantage are more obviously . take into account of all these factor , we may reach the conclusion that we should better to have broad knowledge of many academic subject .
