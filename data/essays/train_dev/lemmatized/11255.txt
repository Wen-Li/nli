it is very important for the student to learn idea and cocepts . b because idea contribute to the fundamental which are very important to learn in the initial stage . with out idea one can not proceed futher so understanding these fundament will help in building a strong base for the concept . for example a good reasoning will always help in drawing conclusion . only when a concept is clear the solution could be deduced from the information . for an example if an experiment is conducted learing only fact will not help . having the basic knowledge about the idea and how it developed will often tend to futher research and study . more or le idea contribute to many thing . secondly the basic idea of the concept is to learn about how the concept work . one can reach the conclusion if the concept is clear so understanding the concept is very important than learing abt the fact . with out proper understanding of the concept may often lead to bad study and the finding may not be accurate . only when the concept is clearly understood then it can explain the possible solution for the particular experiment hence idea and concept give rise to learn about the fact . just learning fact is not helpfull unless a complete understanding of the concept is not clear for an example in experiment the pupose of the experiment and how to go about the experiment is an idea . and understanding the pupose is the concept . and the result is the fact so before knowing the idea and learning the concept one can not reach the fact . hence i stongly agree that it is important for the student to understand the idea and concept than learning fact .
