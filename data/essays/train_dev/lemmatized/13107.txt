i agree with the statement because being successful ha to do more with attitud rather with aptitude . from my former experience a a student and a a worker i would like to support my point of view . through studying international relations at a top mexican university i wa able to understand the global context in which we live , nevertheless arly in my study i realized that to enhgance my criterion regarding interational dealing i would have to delve into the area of sociology . in depth personal resarch on this subjet ha not only refined my capacity to understand but also my capacity to negotiate and go beyond the evident specially when dealing with different culture and perspective . among my favorite author is dr , kevin skandia who in his work `` the clash of civilization '' he strongly bear , in one of his chapter , on the subjetc of leadership and how to be successful . he state that in order to become a leader and a pioneer you have to get out of the conventional , you and i have to go beyond the `` establishment '' to break the way thing are done so a to create a best way to carry on thing . obviously people have to take risk and have to be aware of failure , so successful people will go after their goal knowing in advance that they probably will fail , knowing that this is the best way to succeed . my work a a specialized purchaser for wal mart , one of the largest retailer worldwide , ha faced me with enormous challenge that have demanded full efectiveness to work well under pressure and competition , this experince ha helped me to realized that innovation and imagination are two important tool to succed anywhere you are , and again in order to be successful we have to go beyond and to try new way to do out duty . since it is company policy to upgrade the expertise of employee we are consistently enrolled in conference and meeting , many international in nature , that have given me many an oportunity to exchange idea and share decision that helped u in our everyday job . while exchanging idea or having conversation from people around the world our conversation often drift to more casual topic like the everyday decision we have to take in our life , and we remark ourselves the importance to be sure of yourself and sure about the thing you are to carry on in order to be successful . at the end , i have always thought that only few people have the courage to do something else in order to break their `` satatus quo '' and those kind of person are the one who change and succed in what they are after , so i do think that successful people try new thing and take risk .
