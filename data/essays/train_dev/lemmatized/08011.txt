i donot agree with the statement here which say that advertisement make the product seem much better than they are . i really feel it because a product owner know that how the product is made and how it work so all the other matter he will be thinking on quality of product and how it will be reahed to people in correct way and thought . to make him this possible the only thing he haas in his hand is how to advertise it . so he feel a better way to advertise the product so that the product reach the people and people come to know how worthy it is . without advertising now a day it take a long for a product to get settled in market and make it own stamp on that field to go into people . the advertising may not be thought a a thing that to make people to totally beleive it but in advertisement and also on the product clearly producer say what it doe and how it doe , so based on requirement only the consumer buy the product but not the way it is advertised . here we have to be careful that how it is advertised , to make an advertisement only the product must pas many test that the product is introduced to market so by certifying only the product is released to market . so based on the requirement fulfilled by product only the advertisement are done . not all the producer follow the same method but based on how much is the product cost the advertisement are done . the advertisement are done according to the taste of owner that how could it be advertised . some use medium a the advertising agent , some use marketer , some use paper phamplets to say there are many way to advertise . based on their taste and their capacity producer advertise their product . the way that the advertisement are very interesting in such a way that , by seeing them people would get of thought of buying them . some of producer to get hold of the market and sale they would use celebrity , well known person a their suit for advertisement by paying them a large amount of money . as advertisement is the only chance of making people know it a very important one . for example now government are also depending on advertisement to make people know about thing , project are done . here in my state a celebrity is the on for advertising about the polio programme done by government . so that people will know about it very quickly and correctly . so government also rely on the advertising show u how important the advertisement are . to make the conclusion of the thing that advertisement is a best instrument and a fake advertisement are not done they make the product seem to be a it is but they donot make them feel better than they reaaly are .
