the idea that it is more important for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact is very true . i will like to describe some point that support this statement to understand better why i am agree . there are two importants point to learn something and keep it in our cultural baggage , to understand the concept of the main idea and to practice the concept in some situation of the real life . most of the time , when a studen will have some exam , the student want to memorized all the date , place , name and rule that could help to answer correctly . but frequently we froget that this is not the most important part of the learn procces . the first thing a teacher ha to do is to make understand the concept to the student because when the concept is understood it is easy to applied it to the problem and , the most important , in real life . when an elementary school student understood why the citizen of some country had to make a civil war against their government , the student had understood the importance of a government taht take care their people and do not take advantage of them . when a student understend the main idea of some problem he will never forget that and he will can apply it in the real life . then , affter the understanding , it is very important to reforced the idea by practice with example and possible situation where the student can apply his or her judgement and make a personal opinion about it . to practice is to face the problem in meny other situation each one with differents characteristic and that will form the student making him to tought in some solution or creating and a personal opinion . that is why i said that if you make a student to learn the date when the human right were signed he will learn just a date but if you make he or her to understood the importance about the human right you will form an excelent human being .
