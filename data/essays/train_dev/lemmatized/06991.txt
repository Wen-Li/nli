well , i opine in consense with the statement given . yes , i actually prefer to be assisted by a tour guide when i am travelling a a group . the reason that support my argument are disclosed a under ! . firstly it would be of great advantage to be accompanied by a guide because it prof to be beneficial to be directed in a place which a group is not well acquainted with . it is better to be guided in a place which is new to u because it prevents the group of tourist being split up in case of any misshappening ! . therefore the group is led in a unison preventing the chaos of losing some member . hence it save a lot of time to concentrate on the purpose oftravel . secondly employing a guide provides u the detail of all the important place to be visited . therefore it provides u with a good review of all the important place without missing any . this again save u time in searching out for place to be visited ! . third pont of advantage of employing a guide is that of the awareness of the place visited . a guide really provides u with very valuable information a of how , why , when and other related question of the place visited . therefore it is of great advantage a the knowledge regarding the place is complete . another advantage is that of the communication with the people of that habitat ! . this is really very important because the right way of communication with the local people might be really very difficult in most of the case . this might mislead a group in knowing certain thing for example the whereabouts or a route to a monument for that matter . therefore if a guide is accompanying u we need not really face the communication problem a he translates the dialect of the local people and speaks out that is really understood by u . another important advantage is that a guide might really help u to sort out our accomodation at an economical place in case we are paying more for the stay than we are actually meant to pay . this again prof u an economic advantage of employing a guide ! . therefore from the reason which i have disclosed i really favour employing a guide although it is a bit expensive .
