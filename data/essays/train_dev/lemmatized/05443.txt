academic subject that a student take will help him get into the school , college or the university that he want . what subject should a student study ? how many subject should he/she study ? all these question confuse each and every student in the whole world . if a student specialised in one specific subject , he/she will have many advantage and disadvantage facing him . starting with the advantage , we will find that this student will feel comfortable and happy a there will be no pressure on him . moreover , the student will know what he/she is going to specialise in a he/she get into college or university and will not the trouble of being confused later in his life . however , the student will face lot of trouble if the specialisation doe not suit him . and if the student wish to change the subject , this will not benefit him/her a he/she will have to start all over again and waist lot of time ; and a i wa once told `` time is like gold , if u do not benefit from it you will lose it '' . on the other hand , if a student ha a broad knowledge of many academic subject , he/she will have le disadvantage than the advantage . firstly , he/she will switch into any other specialisation when feel like it , if the student find that the first one did not suit him/her without waisting any time . furthermore , this will help the student in his/her life outside university a he/she will have lot of general and specific information and knowledge . in my opinion the only disadvantage here , is that he/she will have a huge pressure on him and will have lot of hard time . summing up all those idea , i agree with the statement and would prefer to have a broad knowledge of many academic subject . although i will have hard time , but this will save me the trouble of facing the above disadvantage . just a my friend once did and told me `` i do not regret it at all '' .
