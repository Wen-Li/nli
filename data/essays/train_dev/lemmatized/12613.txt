iam going to writing about the specifis peaple whom love to try a new thing and take risk rather than only doing what they already know how to do well . in my opinen , i agree with this people becouse many reson . first , this people love to do this they are likey becouse they gave themself the chance to be better and to know more and more about every thing they know it . also , i think this people never felling pooring becouse all the time they have same thing to do it and enjoy . i think when you doing same thing new and it is going write you fell great . second , this people help the economic in thier country and ther is a big example for that china all the time the people from china doing anew thing in the computer . another example , united state now the power country in all the world , they doing that by the people have a good thing and by the people how to make every thing good . also the english langauge how is come the first language in all the world by the book , work and every poor thing in english third , if you gave yourself the time to think about same thing new and same thing noy usually you will not just help your country but you also help yourself to know more and more about thing you can do it and done . also , one day maybe what you think about in miunte be the most important thing in the life , the people remmber you by this work after you die your name will be there in conclusion , i think it really important to thing about new thing and you have to be faster becouse the one how come first always better and remmber you can be a really good person with a really good thing . any one can doing areally good thing if the thing one munite maybe not a big thing maybe it is small but i believe you can to do it just start to think .
