it is importent for astudent to understand idea and concept , because it is more needed for his future , iam agreeing with the statement following reason more helpful to my selection . firstly , if he simply learn the fact it may not useful in futureif student under stand the idea and conceps he perform well in future . . for example take human body how the signal from various part connect with brain , how the brain catch the signal . we are simply lean the fact it not give u a bette idea , if we are study the concept we get clear idea , which is not forgot untll the death . onother reason for these is we just mug up the thing these thing are we are not able to use it in future , the thing like automobile this idea better suited . if the student who know the concept he is able to all repair practically . if you are simply mug up thing you are not able to understand wats happening , eventhow both are studying same class . finally if a student understand the concept he may use it in his ownif a student understand the concept he may use it in his own problem . if you understand the concept you can easily get practical knoledge it may useful in our life . if you are simply learn the fact it may use ful for your exam , and some test you may score well in these but you are not get practical knowledge . now many company also prefering the student with practical knowlege then the person who have high percentage . inconclusion student should have practical knowledge it is more use ful in lifeif he simply learn the fact it may not useful in future
