in twenty year of time the number of car in use will be in fewer number than there are today . i agree with the statement the author had made . down the lane about 20 year of time the number of car being used will be decreased considerably vowing to many factor . a car can effectively work for maximum of fifteen year , after fifteen year most of the part in the car would be torn out and the efficiency of car decrease , even if the car is used beyond fifteen year it may release hydrocarbon which may increase the polution . most importantly our native government is taking to measure to implement the idea of using car for only fifteen year and after fifiten year the car ha to sent back to the showroom , or it ha to be thoroughly checked to use it , so that the car used will not increase the pollution . the demand for petroleum product have increased significantly , to run any vehicle we require a petrol . unfortunately we are running short of petroleum product . due to scarcity of petrol the number of car will be reduce a the middle class people may not offerd to pay such huge price for petrol and maintain a car , now a day the road which we use are congested because of traffic present . the number of vehicle are increasing daily , adding to the traffic problem . the traffic now a day is such congusted that we can reach our destination more quickly on foot rather tah using car . to have a smooth ride on our car we wish to have a spacious room t drive our car , but unfortunately there is a little chance to expand these road . so people are finding differnt alternative for their daily work . one of the most interesting aspect is problem of obesity in many people . the food habit and nutrient content in the food had cjhanged a lot and they have no time to do exercise to keep themselves fit and healthy . cycling provides a good chance of exercise to the body and there is a hope that many people may switch to cycling in nearby future for a short drive where they used car before . i canconclude that the number of car in the next twenty year will be fewer than car in use today because of problem mentioned above . the main important problem for the reduction in numberof car is the availabaility of petroleum product and health problem . inorder to overcome these problem people may switch to various mean of transportation reducing the number of car used .
