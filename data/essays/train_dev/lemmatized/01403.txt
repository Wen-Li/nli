the most of people around this world confusing that , young people more enjoy their time than that of older people . this is the most common flaw in this time . in 21 century , we have such a competitive and aggressive world to live . if you are not awake all the time , then you will be beaten by financial situation , co-worker , even freinds whom you rely on . that mean especially young people , they take part in a main competition for their survival , it 's hard to tell young people enjoy life more than older people . in nowaday , a lot of young people work for more than one job . of cours , they have many reason to do so . main reason will be to prepare for their better life when they got old . and after that , it can be said ; to accomplish the own personnal goal , to pay credit card bill , and so on . then when these people got old , they do n't need to struggle that much for their better life . because , a you know , the most important factor to enjoy our life is money now . without money , nobody can enjoy life , if we still sure that homeless , beggar , hooker on the street ca n't enjoy the life that we called life in the topic sentence . cleary , older people who can enjoy life more . those people are surely , who were being better prepared from when they were young . on the other hand , young people who enjoy life are just taking a break . after break , young people start to keep themselves in the long-run race for the better life . so they can enjoy more life when they got old . besides , young people have more thing to do for that of they responsible for themselves . however , since older people who already done with those thing when they were young , they can enjoy life more than when they were young . therefore , i disagree with the statement ; young people enjoy life more than older people do .
