i agree with the statement that the young people nowaday do not give enough time to helping their community . they spend too much time in studing their class , waste much of their time in personal enjoyment , and do not understand the real meaning of helping their community . as a fact , the parent in taiwan always want their child to have good academic achievement more than the other thing . they want their young people to study again and again , and do not expect them to pay any attention and spend much time to the other thing except reading and studing . as a result , the young people will not spend much time to the other thing such a helping their community . the young people are still like child , so they prefer to play such a spend their time to play computer game or watch tv in an air-conditioned room in their vacation or off-school time rather than to help their community outside the door , espcially in a hot summer weather in taiwan . for example , my nephew is a teenager , but he did not know any thing about the community where he lived for more than ten year . he prefer to talk to his friend by cellar phone , and have a date with his girl fiend . he spend his time to help his community only when his high school ask him to hand out the report about his service in his community and the report will be graded . except this . when i suggested that he may have a community service in our community , he wa surprised that i have such a strange idea that he never have . in conclusion , it becomes a common social phenomenon that the young people do not give enough time to help their community because their parent and the whole community did not facilitate them to help their community and give a good reward and help them to understand the real meaning of helping their community . as such , the young people are loosing their recognition of their own community .
