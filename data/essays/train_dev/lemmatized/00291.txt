there is growing awarness of car problem all around the world . cars have brought u much convenience to transport while they have caused various social or ecological problem such a traffic jam , noise , traffic accident , air pollution , too much consumption of petroleum and so on . now we have to solve these problem in order to survive on the earth . i think it essential for u to reduce the number of car . first of all , we have to spend much money to maintain our own automobile . in our modern society , we have so much developed public traffic that we need not to transport with our car . although we would be involved terrible trafic jam , public traffic such a train and subway are usually be punctual . moeover , in general , the fee of public traffic is inexpensive . therefore , we can save not only time but also money by using public traffic . the price of gasoline ha gotten higher and higher recently , and the tendency is to be continued . second , there are no longer much place to park car , especially in many city . the world population ha been getting more and more during this decade . now we have no longer much enough land to dwell on . therefore , it will cost u too much to park our own car in the city . many people have to shed their own car in order to save their money and to save the area to live in . in conclusion , for these reason , spending much money and insuficient space to park car , i agree the statement `` there will be fewer car than there are today in twenty year .
