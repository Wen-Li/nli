lately there ha been an ongoing debate over whether or not most advertisement make product seem better than they really are . some people are of the opinion that ad represent a great opportunity for manipulation with regard to certain product while others contend that ad can not change the nature of the product they are presenting and are therefore not manipulative . a close examination of the issue reveals that the statement which asserts that most advertisement make product seem better than they really are is unsubstantiated . a main reason why such a claim ha it limit is the fact that the advertisement industry is regulated . the state decides about what can and ca n't be said in ad by legislating about ad and competition . that make an advertisement susceptible to lawsuit : an angry consumer who think that a certain ad ha mislead her can sue the advertising company . since advertising company are aware of that , they will try not to make false claim about the product they advertise for . another reason why the claim about advertisement and their misleading status doe n't hold is that most ad do not actually inform about the product , but that they rather encompass certain image and emotion which are associated with the product they are trying to sell . how many ad about ice-creams include the nutrition fact ? the answer is none . and since most ad do not inform anyway , it is impossible for them to make product appear better than they actually are . perhaps the most convincing reason why the great majority of ad is not misleading is that an appraisal of a product 's quality is in most case subjective . for instance , some people like onion soup while others hate it . some people would immediately switch the channel when they encounter an onion-soup-ad while others probably would enjoy watching it . so , one 's perception of an advertisement undoubtedly depends on her subjective attitude toward the product . this subjective attitude would almost certainly affect the degree to which one would find the ad deceptive . in conclusion , the claim that most ad make product seem better than they actually are is unsubstantiated for three reason : state regulation , the advertisement 's non-informative nature and the subjectivity of advertisement-appraisal .
