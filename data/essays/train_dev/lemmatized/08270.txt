techniques of advertisement started to develop at the same time consumer began to spread in the world , and they improved a lot during the last century , especially a new medium , like television , grow up . as i always did job related with marketing and commercial activity , i am very aware of the fact that many advertisement make product seem much better that they really can be . so , i will explain the reason that this habit can have , and also the problem it can bring about . firstly , i think that a company always need to provide consumer with an amazing image of it product . as a result , an advertisement usually stress on the better quality of the product x , without naming any problem related with it . for example , when ferrari , an italian sport car manufacturer , launch a new car , it most likely create an advertisement showing the new car 's great speed , but it doe not really point out that this car would consistently consume lot of fuel ! this negative factor probably doe not even interest ferrari 's typical customer , and the car is presented a it really is . on the other hand , while i think that usually advertisement present the real side of a product , i must admit that sometimes they are really excessive . when a product is made for a specific purpose , it should not be presented a something different , just in order to create a better impression in people 's mind . for example , many car manufacturer , like fiat , another italian firm , are used to create sport version of their utility model , and they present them like sport car . the problem is that they really are not sport car , but only slightly more faster model of normal car , so the image advertisement introduce is completely wrong . to draw a conclusion , i thinlk that it is really impossible to prevent advertisement to give the best image of product they can . most of company really offer the truth of their product , just omitting some negative aspect , but sometimes they really lie to consumer , by providing false image . however , i think that this is not such a common situation , and most of advertisement present product nearly a they are .
