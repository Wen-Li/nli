the education is more and more important to everyone in the world now , but different people have different pointviews on what is more important for the student . some people think that understand the idea is more important , but there is also a group of people think that it shou n't be like that , learn fact is more important than understanding idea . i , however , believe that we should pay more attention on learn fact than understand idea . because the reason below . the first reason , the most important one , the idea are coming from the fact and the fact is helping u to understand the idea better . here is an example , when we take the physics class , we always do a lot of lab , for what ? to get the fact , then by these fact , we get the idea by ourselves , then because we got the idea by ourself , we understand these idea much deeper than just learned from the teacher . and also , the fact is helping u to understand the idea much quicker . as an example , if you want to learn swimming , do you think is it going to be learnning it quickier by just get the idea ? or you go inside the water , then you learned how to swim ? of course should be the second way . then the second reason , idea sometimes get wrong , but how do you know ? without the fact , you never know . like in the past time , there is a idea about if two object dropped from the same height , then the one got greater mass would hit the ground first . but then a scientist do n't think so , so he did a lab , he went on a tower and dropped two object with different mass at same height , but these two objests hit the group at the same time , so that mean the idea said higher mass hit the ground first is wrong . so we see , without the exam by the fact , you never know the idea is right or not . well , from the reason above , we can say that , learning fact is important than understand idea , no fact , no idea , even we got the idea without the fact , you might get the wrong idea . so i agree with the idea that pay more attention on learn fact .
