the problem is if it is better to have a generic academic preparation or to have a specialization in one specific subject . i am not so agree with this statement and now i will try to explane why . the advantage to have broad knowledge of many academic subject is that you know `` something of all '' , you can spend it in many sector of the `` world of work '' and you can do well wherever you want . but on the other hand , you know something of all but you know it le than a person that have a specific preparation in that , so for an ipotetic work a specialized person will be prefered instead of a person with a generic preparation . instead a person with a specialization have some problem if he find a work that he doe not know well , he can be confused on what to do . on the other hand the advantage to have a specific preparation is to do well what we kn finally in my opinion we shoud have a basic knowledge , a basic preparation on many academic subject , and then we shoud have a specific area of knowledge to spend better on the `` world of work '' .
