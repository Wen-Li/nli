i disagree with the statement , in my opinion it is better to be specialized in one subject field . in today world where the economy is growing at an uncontrolable speed , every industry is no le than a global giant , every field is becoming a money minting arena , in such an environment is will be a gross mistake to have a broad knowledge . specialization give one an indepth of the subject . it give one the chance to excel and give one hundered percent to a specific field . it make u clearly see our weakness and strenghts and help u to evaluate ourselves and see where we really stand . broad knowledge is like a half baked story where one is not exceling in any specific field . one can pick any field , art , business , music or even politics , everything requires the best peopleand those kind of empoyees who know their subject backwards . in such a senario one can not take a chance by having a broad grip on all subject . a situation such a this would only create doubt and ultimately a low pay or unemployment . there is another alternative to this dillema and that is that alongside being specialized in any one field one can also have a hobby . for example , a film star , she love her news coverage , her fame , her glory , her fortune , but there are time when everyone want to forget their work and find themselves by doing thing that they enjoy . she can do social sevice or something small like pottery or photography at a hobby . ` if a bird spread it wing beyond it reach , it will crash ' . thus , according to me it is more sensible to choose one line of work and excel in it . but yes sometimes we must retrieve and pursue other samll activity a well .
