i ca n't agree with the statement . in my opinion . in the future , there will be more car in the world even though there are some task to solve . at first , we need to concerntrait on the natural resource . the human being are used it without a long term vision , so they will be almost used up in next 20 year . but , there are lot of study which try to find another energy source . for examole , gain oil from natural grain , using sun energy , and using the wind . the most interesting thing is hydrogen . it 's source is water which is really fruent in earth . ( actually , the hydrogen cell is only meterial problem now . ) so , human being will find another energy resource in twenty year , i sure . second , china , africa , and india will have lot of car in 20 year . as you know they did n't boot their real economic engins . as many economic specialist say , they will have rapid grow . so , they will have a lot of new car . at last , like a hybrid technaligy there are many methodes which can enhance the efficiency of car . the more car mean the more happiness in the world ? the more advance in technaligies mean the more happiness ? i ca n't answer the question . a important thing is we have to a master of technaligies , in my think . thank you for reading . .
