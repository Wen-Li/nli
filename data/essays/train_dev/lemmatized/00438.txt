i do agree with the statement saying that successful people are the one who take risk with innovative thing instead of what they knew already . to support my idea , i will first show that innovative thing such a innovation and new technology are factor that encourage success . then , i will explain why people doing allways the same thing may not be successful . innovation is one sector that ha evoluated a lot during the last century . men are creative , they allways try to invente new tool to help them in their daily life or to allow them to do new thing . it is then easily understandable that through all the main evolution , such a the industrial revolution , or the internet , people who wanted to take risk had very high potential of being successful . per example , the people who were confident that internet will become very important made the good bet . today , many of them have been successful and are rich and/or famous . then , people doing the same thing continuously are le likely to be successful because they stay focused on existing sector and activity . it is evident that if we do n't take any risk , we can not have any potential in success . as an example , we can talk about a worker in a factory . some of them work during more than twenty year in the same position , with the same duty and salary . usually these people are n't like this because they are le intelligent than others , but rather because they prefer to have a confortable life with no risk . but without risk , we can not change and evoluate . to conclude , we can say that people who invest themselves in thing which are related to innovation or new technology are more likely to get successful due to the potential of growth of it . in the other hand , people who continue doing thing they know without looking in other direction and sector will not be able to be successful . these are the key factor that make someone successful or not .
