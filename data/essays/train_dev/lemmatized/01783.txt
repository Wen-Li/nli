no i do not agree with this statement . i belive that there are many reason why there will not be fewer car in twenty year , some of which are that : firstly , twenty year is not exactly a long period of time so i do not believe that in this period , scientist will be able to invent new way or method of transport for the million of people using car . even if they did have idea and sample of invention , it would either take to long to put into practice for the public or simply too expensive for many people ot use . in addition to all of this , many people are simply content with using car nowadays so therefore there is not so much of a concern in finding news mean of transport but more of an effective one . cars are still in use . the only difference nowadays is that scientist are trying ot find more effective and environmentally friendly source to use in car . so there probably would not be a decline in the number of car used but a decline in the number of inneffective car in use . for this reason there will probably not be much of a difference in twenty year . also , if anything , there will probably be more car on the road in twenty year . due to the poplutation increase globally , there will probably be an increase in demand for car , with respect to transport for people . this increase in people will probably reuslt in the urgence to find new mean of transport but twenty year is not a long enough period of time for such drastic change . so in conclusion , there will probably be many more car running on the road in twenty year which is the near future , then there are now .
