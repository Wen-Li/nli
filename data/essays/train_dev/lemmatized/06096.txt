it my belife that whole purpose of education is to train the mind to appreciate , comprehend and eventually implement new idea and thought that come along through the course of one 's life . hence , it is essentail not only to understand idea but to have a will to try and understand idea . unfortunately , we now live in the `` techno-age '' , where is it prime only to deliver , irrespective of how you got to the end result . results are of paramount importance a people and business have lesser time to spare on detail and subtlety . however , to deliver result effectively and efficiently is it important to know the fact , and to know them well . let me try and demonstrate this using the following example . a student sits-up all night studying for an exam on the ` indian struggle for freedom ' . she feel passionately for the subject , understands the emotion at play and reason due to which one event led to another . but , on the day of her exam , she is stunned when she look at the question paper . she ha been asked question requirring her to state date of important event and name of revolutionary . she however , wa so mesmerized by the determination of the revolutionary , that she forgot to memorize their name ! now , although she maybe able describe the freedom struggle a a story , her description will be inaccurate , leading to a low score on the paper . in conclusion , i 'd like to say that , although learning fact can be a or more difficult than understanding idea , it is important to be able to do both . i will go a step further and say that , today everyone is expected to understand idea and concept . what differentiates a winning student from the others is the knowledge of hard fact and a knowledge of how to implement them .
