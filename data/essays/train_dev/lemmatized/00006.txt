i disagree that in twenty year there will be fewer car in use than there are today . why people use car ? because car is useful . it doe not care time schedule , go somewhere directly , and can carry someting more than other trancepotaion . if people go someplace , people use some trancepotation . usually they have to care some trancepotation `` s time schedule , but if they use car , they do not care it . this is very useful . in addition , if people use a car , they can go somewhere directly , but if they use train or bus , they have to walk or transfer after arrive station or bus stop , so car is more useful than other transportation . furtheremore , if people have a lot of luggage or something , they difficultly carry on the train or bus . however , car can buring these . also , car can buring other people . for example , their child or friend . car is more useful then other transportation . it can decide use their request time , go someplace directly , and can carry many thing . therefore , i think in twenty year there will not be fewer car in use than there are today , but if someone find new transfar system , it will able to change .
