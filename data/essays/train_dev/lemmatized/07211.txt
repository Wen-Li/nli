everyone in this world can enjoy his life in his own way . people are different in expressing thier enjoying of life . how we can ejoy this life and be happy ? everyone know that life is not easy and it need lot of work to be successful person in it . there are two group of people who can enjoy this life such a , the young people and the older pepole . first , yong peple can ejoy life in different way . for example , they can do many thing in this life without any responsibility for what they are doing because they know that the resposibility are carried for thier parent . also , they can do a lot of thing that the older people ca n't do a a result of health . young people can do a lot of activity on one day , but the older peolpe ca n't do that . so the young people are the right people to enjoy this life . secound , older poeple can , t enjoy this life like the young people . there are different reason for that . the firt reason , is that the are responsible for eveything they do . also , the reason of health ca n't help them to do a lot of activity on one day . the logic provides these point in a very clear way . old people had already taken their time to enjoy this life when they were young . so they have to give the chance for the other generation to enjoy his own life . finally , in my opinion , i agree that young people are the right peolpe to enjoy ti life . that is because the older people had already taken thier own chance . also , i disagree that the older peolple must relax after they have finished thier work in the whole life because they are the people who must have other work . such a , teaching thier child the right ting to do and to have the resposibiltiy of what thier young child do . in conclusion , this life is for all the peolpe to enjoy , but the right people or the people who have the chance to enjoy it more are the young people . we must all enjoy this life in the duration of time when we are young .
