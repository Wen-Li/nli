young people today are faced with constant pressure from their family , school , and community . the life of each young person or teenager today focus around a common goal of education . with all the pressure of education and family expectation the time that each young person give to helping the communtity is not enough . in reality young people today do help the community but the factor that should be looked at is when do they help the community . they help the community every summer when the work load of school is decreased . during the summer young people look for summer job helping their family and working in small business . these summer job that each young person is dedicated to bring the community closer and help the community be stronger for the future . each young person help the community in an indirect way by working in different aspect to strengthen the bond of community . when a young person work in the super market he greets everyone in the community with warmth and work to give an extra hand to the super market and this in the long run benefit the community because a strong community is a happy one provided with all their food resource from the super market . in another example when a young person volunteer in the summer to work in an orphanage they are helping the community greatly because when any person volunteer they are giving without expecting something back ; they are giving to help the community . the question that should be asked is how much time should each person give to helping the communtity ? each young person should dedicate the time they gave to helping the community during the summer throughout the whole year . even if it wa for only five minute a day it would benefit the community significantley in the future . in conclusion young people are helping the commuinity but they need to give more time to helping it .
