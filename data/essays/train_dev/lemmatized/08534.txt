for some reason i totally agree with the statement , although sometimes risk can destroy a people , it is a part that people must go trough to get succeed . first , if someone want to be succeed , he or she must try to do something new , something others never did before , it is just like invention , new thing are always the thing people focus on , that is why people are interest on new cell phone and computer but not regular phone and calculator , the future successful people ha to find something that can interest people , but a an addition , there are always risk while introducing a new product or working in a new field , but if people want to recieve , they have to give , people who want to be succeed must give up doing the thing they already know how to do well , but learn to do a new thing , for most time , there are n't even book to introduce how to do the new thing , but once one people find out how to do and doe it well , he or she may be secceed throughtout one night . many people surround me are worrying about their job , some because they ca n't find a job , some worry about how far they can go in their career , for those who want to be more excellent than others , who are looking forward to be successful people , wo n't only try to do better than others in the same thing , because a people always say ` what you can do , others can do ' , take bill gates for example , when he wa determind to found a software company he wa only an college student , bravely , he did n't scared by the risk but went out from the college to the true world to discover new thing , to chase new goal , at the time he had a friend who ahd the same major a bill did , rejected the invetion of bill gates to found a new company together , may be he thought it is more unrisky to continue his study , or maybe he still think so now , but after year , bill gates becomes , we can say a legent of success , every body admire him , and seeking for way to be a successful a him , and his classmate at college i 've mentioned before , is now a college proffessor , i 'm not saying that being a proffesor is not successful , it is also a marvolous job , but in most people 's opinion , being best one in the world , is cooler , and a people like bill gates , is the most successful one . it may depends on that kind of life people want , but if people want to bu really successful , i think the best way is to face the risk and do new thing others never did before , there sure will be failure , but if he or she succeed , it will be a huge pride .
