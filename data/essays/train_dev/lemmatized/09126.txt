i do agree with the opinion that the student s should understand the idea and concept rather than learning the fact because every time itis not possible for one to go through certain fact to understand a particular problem and finding out a solution to the problem . for example to understand the logic behind the an object coming towards earth ha to have certain fact behind that or a theory behind that . at the same time to understand this theory of gravitational pool a student must understand the concept of gravity and then the theory of it . every thing ha a cause-effect relationship . according to which a student must understand the cause behind a particular thing happend and for which student must understand the concept or idea of that paricular thing first . for example . a tree like mango which is seen tobe so huge ha small fruit like mango which the tree can easily carry . why it is not carrying a heavy fruit like pumpkin . .. have you ever thought of that . .. god ha created this world with greater care . . considering each and every aspect in life .. he might have thought that if any fruit hanging on the huge tree like mago fall down on a person resting under the tree then what will happen ? for every problem solution a student must understand the idea and concept about the particular thing which will enable them to reach depth and objective of a particular thing . it can not be denied the the fact the fact are to be learnt by the student tounderstand a paricular problem and finding out a solution to it . concluding the above opinion student must adapt themselves according to the nature of a particular thing to understand .
