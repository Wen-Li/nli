i disagree with this statement because in my opinion for the new work 's world is more important be specialized in one specific subject than in many academic subject . i think that because in my school i have studied a lot of subject but i admit saying many thing but these subject are n't studied in a specific way . in fact i have found a lot of problem when i came in my university , where is important only one specific subject . the new world of the work , in my opinion , request a specific kind of worker . in fact now there are many type of work and the number of people who have broad knowledge of many academic subject are not increasing . i try to use an example . an architect that creates all of the part of his project is rare . we can find a lot of architect or designer that are specialized only in one specific subject . it is so because is changed the university and the new work 's world search different kind of worker . so , i think that is important study one specific subject and do the best work that i could make .
