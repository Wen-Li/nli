a broad knowledge of many academic subject surely ha many good aspect . but it also ha two major disadvantage : it is limited in quality and quantity . it is virtually impossible to have a more-than-basic knowledge of very many academic subject . and the more subject there are you know something about , the smaller the amount of information will be that you have about these subject . however , a broad basic knowledge of many academic subject is nevertheless very beneficial . but such a broad knowledge should not be based on the expense of very specifc and detailed knowledge in a particular academic area . our world today is incredibly advanced in all field of science . more progression , new discovery and invention can only be achieved by specializing in one , or maybe a few , academic subject . if everyone had a broad knowledge , everybody would know the same thing . there would n't be any expert with specific knowledge that could be further developed . another result of having a detailed knowledge is the ability to work together with people who are specialized in a different branch of science . that mean that some people with specific knowledge can achieve far more than a great number of people holding broad , but only basic , knowledge . for example , researcher specialized on cellular structers are much more likely to discover unknown detail about cell , because they exactly know what is already known , where there are chance for new discovery . a researcher who is not specialized in cellular structers might very well discover something new , but it is possible that he doesn'r realize that , because he think that it is only new to him , or her . another point is that research conducted today investigates very specific and detailed problem . it is thus impossible to contribute to such kind of research with broad basic knowledge . i definitely favor specific and detailed knowledge , but i also understand the value and importance of a broad education . this kind of education is especially vital for teaching in elementary school and possible also high school . on a university level , however , a specific knowledge is clearly required .
