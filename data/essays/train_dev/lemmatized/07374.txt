i think that in twenty year there wo n't be fewer car than there are today because of different factor a it can be tha growth of the population , the improvement of the technics or the globalization . the population is growing on every country because of the improvement in the sanity , technology . .. that make that the population growth also in the `` first world country '' so morew people will be able to reach a car . also , one of the main point is the improvement of the technology . maybe it can be thought that because of the polution or the non pollution plan that the government are trying to impulse in some year most of the people will change their car for the public transport . because of that the car company are investing money in evolute new green technology like hidrogen battery that will make possible to use a car without polutting , in fact you will creat just water instead of dioxide carbon that is really harmfull for our enviroment . in deed , that improvement of the technology will make cheaper all the proces of making a car , so there will be more people who will be able to obtain a car when before that improvement they could n't . and here is where the globalization get 's in . all the old technology that are not useful in the `` first world country '' will be sold on sale to those country that are not that rich . in that way , country where most of the people could n't afford a car , they will have car reacheble . and that mean more car beeing used on the world . to sum up , i think that all the problem such a politics plan or enviromental pollution because of the use of petrol , will be resolved by the improvemnt of technology that is already known , such a hidrogen battery a i told before .
