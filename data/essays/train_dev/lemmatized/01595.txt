i agree that this statement . first of all , young people can travel anwhere without concern . of course older people also can do . because of limitation of age , it is difficult for older people to go to trip . but young people have a lot of time to enjoy life . for example i have been to around europe when i wa middle school . having a only back , a little of money . that wa amazing . actually that wa so unstable trip . so this reason is that only young people can do . there is something exciting to do for young people . sporting event to watch , many concert to attend , exhibition to see for these thing , older people is so hard to experience it . second , young people can enjoy party and extrem practice . nowadays there are lot of party . almost party are should be all night long . likewise practice too . for example go to ski , go to snow board .
