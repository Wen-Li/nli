it is true : youngster do not care much about their community or at least a fewer part of them do it with respect to elder generation . our society is now living a period of general wealth meaning that there are le problmatic issue than past year and that living style ha been improved by new technology to make u always more and more comfortable . if we look back at the 1960s , the situation wa more complicated : in those day , people were demonstrating in the street to gather certain right such a the right to divorce in italy and the worker ' class claimed more facility to improve their life condition . many strike followed and it is worth noting that student took part too . this is why they were more concerned about community : they felt the need to manifest their opinion in order to achieve a better life style , the need to fight , without using phisycal violence , for their scope , strongly believing there wa something to change . this is my generational problem : we do not have something to complain about , we are well off . we do not feel the importance of manifesting a particular belief or claiming the fact the society still ha something wrong simply because we are not able to see these problem . of course not all behave selfishly against the community : there are some young member working in association aiming at community welfare . these youngster are most likely those who live close to community problem not only at work but during their daily life because they are the first to be aware of the situation and still the first that have to react . from these harsh experience awarness arises , followed by the aim to change in better the sorrounding enviroment a well a it happened during the 1960s . there is another set of person likely to help the community : wealthy people understanding that the huge difference among them and poor can not be totally flattened but they can give their help a well , exploiting their advantageous position .
