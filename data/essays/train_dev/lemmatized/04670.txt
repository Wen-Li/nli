i would strongly agree with this statement . in today 's learning environment , a student need to focus on qualitative learning a opposed to quantitative learning . a need for comprehension of the concept and idea becomes increasingly important for a person to achieve success in his/her life . as a child , benjamin franklin wa relieved of studying at junior school since he would not learn up everything that he wa required of him , which he believed it to be unnecessary a they were already provided . he went on to later become one of the greatest inventor of all time . now i am do not believe that school is not important , but that these ` fact ' , which are merely cluster of information , are actually derived from idea that other people once had . once a concept is understood , the idea can always be derived . once a theorem is known , a derivation can be made . in contrast , if a student is made to only learn fact with lesser importance given to idea , then that student may not be able to contribute to many aspect that require thinking in his life . if everyone were taught to do something but not told why it is done or what principle underlies it , then innovation would become an extinct concept . i would next like to highlight another important result - innovation . it is the only thing that ha given u what we have today ; this pc that i am operating on , the ets testing system and countless other thing . complacency would really bring u back to the stone age . in conclusion , if we were to only learn fact and figure , then we would not require school in the first place . everyone would be academically equal or based on the capacity of his/her memory , which would be a large encumberance to progress . this is the reason that all university stress on concept learning than ` mugging up ' . to conclude , i would say that this statement is perfectly right and that it should prevail .
