i agree with the opinion that having the knowledge of many academic subject is better than to have deeper knowledge in one major subject . it is more important for the undergraduate student to have the basic knowledge in the field like biology , history , chemistry , archeology etc . the student should be able to know the basic of the various subject before taking the major subject . for example , if the student dont have the basic knowledge in the biology subject then he may not know the various organ of his body and their function . then the student may not know the kind of food he must take for the proper function of the particular organ . he need to face so many problem if he doesnt know about the functioning of his own body . one more example is that , student can be able to know about the origin of the his culture and tradition if he ha a basic knowledge of the subject ` history ' . he can know about the different place in the world and he know better about the world map . the student should also be perfect in the general knowledge . he should know what is happening around him and also should know the change in the political affair . then only he could judge the thing in a better way . he must know the current affair . the university is the major source from which the student gain the basic knowledge in the different field . they should provide a good environment for the student so that they can have the overall development . for the student the overall development is very much important to compete with outside world in the future . before choosing their major field the student must have a basic knowledge in the other subject also then only they can compete with the outside world .
