of course many people might think , that the youth ha become more egoistic and at a certain point i agree with that . if you take a look on the big city , you see everyone living on his own , maybe additionally caring about his parent and his girlfriend , but that is all . in my opinion this is just an brief impression . if you take a deeper look , you would find out , that there are still a lot of beneficial club , who do spend time helping the community even without being paid . and that 's why i think the situation ha not changed in the recent year , there are just more youth living in the city and the people tend to see only that one , that do not care . especially in smaller town , there are a lot of young people , who want to help others for example in sport club or at church . i know a lot of people at my age , who are interested in these thing . concerning myself , i am member in the football club in my town , where i do the train for almost 20 kid together with a friend . sometimes this is very hard and exhausting , but it is just such a fantastic feeling to do something for the kid . especially because i know , how i appreciated the football train the time i wa in their age . moreover i am also member of a youth group , that belongs to the church . with this group we often organize trip for younger member to the zoo or bike-tours . once a year we have a one-week camp , sleeping in tent . this is really exciting , because instead of shopping or watching tv , we are singing or playing game in the nature , which is really something totally different from the dayly life . sometimes we also organize something for the older people in our town , like drinking coffee or playing card . in my opinion there is nothing better than a simple `` thank you '' or even just a smile on the face of a young boy or girl . so in addition , especially in smaller city or town there are still young people , who are encouraged in helping others .
