i really agree with the statement . in italy , the place where i live there are a lot of advertisement that make product seem much better than they really are , i hope these advertisement will disappear because i think that the the way how people spend money it 's not a joke . i could write a lot of example about these stuff . i have a friend , kate , she bought a shower gel that ensure her body skin to become smooth just like silk , but it is n't the truth ! another example could be the lcd television that clerk encourage you to buy with the promise of a great view and a lot of light , but then you discover that you need to submit a new pay-per-view frequence to see it . in past i had a lot of argues with people who sold these kind of stuff . i do n't want to say that is always the same , sometimes there are a lot of thing that seem to be great trought advertisement and after you buy them you discover they are really pretty good . in my life i do n't like lie , and i do n't like liar people , and i really hate who promise you something and then you discover it wa just a bad lie , and i think that these people deserve law judgment and to go in jail especially when they handle other people 's money . i think that in the time that we live with a lot of diffusion it 's important for economy to be clear , because having a clear economy is the first step for people to trust in their own government and make world work in the right direction . in my opinion it 's important to have law that allow people to trust in advertising and made advertisement clear and sure for people who buy someting without bad surprices .
