i disagree to travel around with a tour guide . it will be great to travel around the place that we like is to travel by ourself because if we travel by ourself , we can spend our time freely . we do not have to care that the guide is going to go somewhere in a few minute or they are going to spend a lot of time at the place that you do not really like . it will also be relax to travel by yourself , you can wake up in the hotel whenever you want , you can go to eat anything you like in any time . ane you can also have change in your trip . in order to have a good trip for ourself , it will be good to just go to the place that we like and spend our time in the thing that we are interested in . if we go with a guide , we only have limit time in all the place . and there might be some place that we do not like . we always want to feel relax on our trip . we are not there for business , we are there to have fun . so if we go there with a guide , we will have to followed the rule of the guide and we will have to get up in the time that they want u to get up . there will always have some accident in our trip and it will be good for u to make some change in order to solve those problem . but if we go there with a guide , our plan ha already been decided . we would not have any chance to change our plan . for these three reason , i recomand that we should go on a trip by ourself but not be leading by other people .
