getting the problem solved by your self i s appriciated i take the pleasure of disagreeing with the statement because the student can understand idea and concept when he is taught by someone else but not by him self , when he want to learn he ha to workout by himself to learn the fact . if he is taught by someone else he might not be that able to explain the same thing to the other person that effectively . he might gho wroung but when he try to explain the thing which he himself had learned he can be more effective and can easily explain what he learnt . for example : the person can not sit on the swmming pool and just understand the idea of swmming , he can learn swmming if and only if he himself get in to water and try to swim . in the same manner he ca n't just guide his fellow person to sit beside the pool and understand `` how to swim ? '' they are sometyhings that should be done by learning only , like learning bicycle , swmming , hourse riding etc . . a person can not sit on the poolside and measure the depth of the pool he can do this only if he jump and see the depth of the pool . the thing that lag with the concet and idea are that they dont have the essence of doing the thing practically . `` the first person who came on the earth do not have any concept or ideas '' the thing is he got the idea only when he started doings the thing . these work gave birth to the idea and concept . i would like to discuess one thing here what i fthe scientist would not work out for the thing and sit with an idea he can not go forward and invent these lot of thing for u . learning fact gave birth to the concept and idea . if fact if the child dont know how to ride a cycle he could sit at a conner and listen to the concepty but can not ride the cycle unless he try it out . for emaxple a group of friend go aroung to a racing club there they found that the idea and the concept that they had is diffferent they will be shocked to see the club i fthey r lerned practically they can drive the car in the race . here i end my topic .
