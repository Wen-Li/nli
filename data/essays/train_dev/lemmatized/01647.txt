i am disagree with this statement . if you learn with statement it will be more simple to learn and archieve in the mind . you can learn for what you need that for , see what is the important to learn , situation , will not be only idea , concept and theory . it will be more fun for student . when a math teacher give the class the student dont know for what they have to learn that thay always say is `` for what i need to learn that i dont going to be a cpa '' . but if they teach the kid the fact for what the need to learn that , the importance to need that to be someone in the world . they only learn the concept take the exam get an a and then what . they go out to difficult world without knowing for what they are going to use the concept . that is one of the big problem of the us nation , what i 'm going to study now ? . millions of student graduate every year without knowing what they are going to study . brilliant student working in foodcourts , why ? because they know to much they graduate with 4.00 point but they dont know where to go know . that orientation doe n't exist , thats why i think that the best way to a student can learn is by fact , so he can know before he go out from school in what he is good for .
