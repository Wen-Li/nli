i agree that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their community . i agree to this because young people nowdays have more work than what they used to have in the past . there are more responsibility for the young people nowadays though helping community is one . modernisation is one factor which is responsible for the gradual change in the attitude of the people . there are so many technological developements that people can evade their responsiblties from their daily work . young people are more aware of these technolgies through their educational system . young people make the maximum use of these technology to evade responsibility . for example young people need not take advice from people of their community anymore a they consider that all the information is already available which they can have it by themselves . another factor for young people not helping their community is the work load which is given to them . universities and colleges give the student so much work that they have to spend all their free time in completing the work . many family can be pointed out where the youngster work to support their family . some youngster have to also take care of their sibling in some family . with all this responsibility which have to be given proir importance how can the youngster worry about not helping their community . furthermore , the modern day parent are slowly losing time to teach their kid important thing . many family are there where both the mother and father are working . so while working how can the parent teach their kid the necassary value which are very much needed in the society . we can say that school do teach student the value but can these value be taught individually like how the parent teach . to conclude there are many responsibility for the younger people to take care of . it is necassary for the adult and senior citizen to help them realise their resposibilities amid all the development .
