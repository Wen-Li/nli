young people definitely contain the advantage of a fresh thought and innovative independent spirit , differently from the elderly that ha often experienced much of the world 's phenomenological offering and seems to approach situation with more tranquility and serenity . however , this proneness of both group of people to behave in a certain manner doe not determine the exact outcome of the indiviual development of personality , which is a key factor that truly determines how effectively a person chooses to enjoy the beauty of his or her existence . hence , when we speak of a vast majority one should definitely considerate the fact that younglings are more open to challenge and extasis than senior citizen who seek a calm state of being , which to the eye of society is le likely to express the true enjoyment of life . young people have the strenght and availabity to discover new ground ; it is part of our nature that whenever we discover and explore , sentiment of joy fill our soul . that is what young people take advantage of , this is , their physical condition and psychological standpoint that drive them to seek gratifying experience more often than elder do , and finally accomplishing such goal . my grandfather used to play soccer when he wa young and that wa his favorite sport . he received so much joy and gratification from this activity that he would never miss a game . now , he is 70 year old and all he want to do is rest . he used to tell me : `` soccer is it son , once it 's gone , you only live from your memory '' . now i am a soccer player and this sport ha become part of who i am , like a blueprint . my life would not be the same if i do not play , due to the fact that i find so much joy and happiness in it . thus , i believe young people do enjoy life in a more complete manner , not to be unjust or parcial , but because it go beyond what is palpable , it is a cycle , the cycle of life . just like a flower reach it most beautiful point and open up in all it splendor and after a certain time dry up and dy , similarly is a man who life and finish his race . even though older people might find joy in different task , their cycle alrady allowed them to reach a certain climax that wa once considered a true enjoyment , therefore leading the way for those behind them to discover and get to search for the same type of gratification , making the level of joy definitely higher at a young age .
