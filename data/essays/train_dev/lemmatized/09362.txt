i totally agree with this statement . it perfectly reflects our society , which is based on appearance . today advertisement ha become an added value . it is something that some year ago we did not even have , but that today play a central role in the society . i am attending a master in international business and during this master i attended a marketing class . our professor explained u how advertisement is important today . more and more society spend huge quantity of money in advertisement , a they think it is a good investment . and the result always come . one example that can give u the mirror of the situation is given by the company pippo . this company produce low quality brush . twenty year ago , it wa just a small company and today it ha become one of the richest company in italy . what the owner of the company did , wa just to invest some money in advertising his product . they used a very good strategy and they finally reached their goal . they pushed housewife to go to the supermarket and ask for the brush named pippo . they created , through an advertisement , value on a product which nobody had cared about before . the worst thing is that this product ha a very low quality and doe not reflect the perception we have watching the advertisement . one of the most important skill that people are required is the capability of selling . i have done a few interview in different company . in each one of them , people working in the human resources department asked me to try to sell something that did not have any value . they just wanted to see if i wa able to do it , because today appearance is more important than the reality .
