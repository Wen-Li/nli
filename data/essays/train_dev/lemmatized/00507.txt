on the one hand , i agree in some way with the statement saying that `` young people enjoy life more than older people do '' for specific reason . first , one ca n't deny that young people are healthy and it make their every-day-life easier than for older people : le sleeping problem , many outdoors activity offered , etc . then , young people do benefit from an other important advantage : they have time in front of them . indeed , such a situation help to make plan for one 's future . on top of that , young people can benefit from the fact that they do not have child and the responsabilities going with it . furthermore , life for young people often appears a easier and le heavy because of their easygoing way of being and thinking . but , on the other hand , many reason encourage me to disagree with the discussed statement and say that young people do not always enjoy life more than older people do . indeed , i would first underline the fact that older people often - but not always - have something very precious that youngster do not have : maturity . and it is to my mind a great help to handle everyday life . there are many thing i have done when i wa young i wish i could do again with the experience i got since that time . an other thing which also often lack young people : money . for insance , it is quite a heavy situation to be a student , even if adult often forget this and only remind the good side of their youth . as a conclusion , i would say that enjoying life is not really a matter of age but rather the way one handle with it . it happens that youngster with maturity , money and health really appreciate life , whereas older people can lack maturity and money . so there is no rule of age and enjoying age , i would rather say it is an every day work on oneself
