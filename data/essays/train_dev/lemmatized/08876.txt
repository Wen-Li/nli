in my point of view , it is allways good to have knowledge of many academic subject . when you are based only in one specific subject you will never be ready to do any other project that come up . you will only be ready for thing you know . many example exist on the world of today , people only study what they want to do in life . so all they are based on is on that material , but what happens when their future doesnt turn to be what they had planed ? college is the opportunity to choose what you really want to be in the future . you must know that what you study is what you are going to have to spend the rest of your life doing . sometimes thing dont go the way you plan . it is why we should have knowledge in all academic subject . beeing specialized in one subject ha it advantege and disadvantege . beeing specialized on what you think you are going to be good at , it sometimes a risk . we are not sure of what is waiting for u out there . for example : if i choose to study law , and im good at it but everything i know is law . so in my future i dont get a good job , but company offer me a better job but not a a lawyer a a business man. i cant take it because im not good at it . the advantege of beeing specialized in one subject is that if im really good at it i have 90 % of beeing the best a t it . that will bring you opportunity to have the best job and be well paid . for example when you study medicine . if you are only based on those subject and graduate with honor . you know for sure you are going to be the best doctor because of you knowledge . it it allways good to know many academic subject but at the same time to be based on what you like to do . that way you are sure that no matter what happens with what you are based on , you will allways have different choice for the future .
