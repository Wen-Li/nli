trying new thing and taking risk are two very important factor to succeed in life . to begin with , trying new thing actually give a person a chance to find out what exactly is the person good at and where doe his interest lie . i feel it very important to do something in life which interest you and excites you . this always drive you to give your best in whatever you are pursuing . one who doesnt try different thing in all probability will be doing the same thing throughout his life and may be in the later year it will be more for the sake of doing it and not because he enjoys it . sachin tendulkar , world famous cricketer is a tenth grade drop out !! he did make an effort to study but that never interested him and he had family to support him and who encouraged him to follow his dream rather than following the conventional model of keeping the study at priority instead of sport or music . but at that point of time sachin tendulkar and his family did take a risk and did something uncoventional and today he 's one of the most influential person in the world !! another thing which is worth mentioning is , that once people become successful they are in a better position to take risk because of strong financial , social and political support . eg a famous industrialist who ha his business in it sector can think of venturing into health care industry which is pole apart from his expertise . but , with the right planning , organisation and support he can do wonder and expand his business into alltogether different field . so , i strongly feel that having the courage to try different thing in life and taking risk can lead one towards success and with success come the liberty and ease with which one can further take risk and succeed to greater height in life .
