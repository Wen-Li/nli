the issue state whether it is more important for student to understand idea and concept rather than learnig the fact . abusolutely this a comtroversal issue , and the reaction from the parent and teacher are tend to be very two polar side , which mean some of the teacher they stand for making student know the undestand concept and idea but not the fact , thus the student are turning to be blindly , for they do not know the fact and only follow with the idea blindly ; additionally , it also restricts student about their thought . the others , however , the teacher focus on teaching student about the fact but not the skill of understand the idea or accept the new concept , therefore in term of this student would be so easy to be stereotype , or cliche . or they will be treated a a essenctricity , a they never follow the social conceousnes without being realized that they have done something which is so extradonary . as the all the above indicates , both of the very different two solution have their own superior and perior a well , so in my opion i would prefer to stand the neutral side ; try to conbimnate with those two idea , a it is better for student in case of being too stereotype , or abnormal . because student should to know the either concept or fact at the same time before they judge something , also it is useful for avoiding student from staying at the wrong perception , in addition , it also help student not to be over-aspect , which mean they are unable to consider thing around all itself , evenmore , somethimes they might go at the wrong direction , and so forth . in conlusion , there is no necessary to fugure out whether it is more important for student to understad idea and concept rather than the fact , a it is not make sence for student on their perception and the way how to judge thing justified .
