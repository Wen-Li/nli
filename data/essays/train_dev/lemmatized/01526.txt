having broad knowledge of many academic subject and specializing in one specific subject are , in my point of view , both very important . but there is a time for the two and i think that it 's better to first concentrate on learning many different thing when we can do it . i mean during our study . first , when we know about many academic subject , we can talk with lot of different kind of people . for instance , in my school , which is an engineer school , there are different department such a biology , civil engineering , informatic . .. before this school i made two year of `` preparating class '' , in which i learned about different academic subject . what is interesting is that i can now talk with my friend who are in different department without shame because i can understand a minimum of what they say and discus it . second , having a broad knowledge of many academic subject can help u to know what we want to do after and then chose the best specialization for u . during my two year of `` preparing class '' , i learned about physic , math , mecanics , biology , chemics . .. it helped me to chose my department and not to make a mistake and having to change my education later . more of that , all that i learned during this two year help me in my education of biology engineer and in my everyday life . i 'm proud when i can answer to basic question about physic that , for example , my parent ask to me and i enjoy reading easily scientific magazine about different kind of subject . to conclude , i will say that the specialization must be acquire only when it is necessary . we can specialize after , in our job , but it 's more difficult then to learn about many academic subject because we do n't have the time and we have more difficulty to learn than when we are a student .
