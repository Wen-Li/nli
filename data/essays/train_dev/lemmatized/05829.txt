with the decision of the governor of california to sue the biggest car-makers , the burning issue of the environmental effect of car driving seems to occupy once again the front of the political stage . but this question is not a new one . indeed , for many year now , we have seen the environmentalist to support the idea that we will no longer make an extensive use of ours car if we want to secure the future of our planet . however , on the other hand , the petroleum and car-makers lobbyist try to explain u that we do not have any other altenative right now . to my mind i think ( or perhaps i hope ) that the number of what we called today car will experience an important decrease while in the same time another kind of '' car '' will emerge . indeed , with the rise of the new giant in the world economy i think that we will no have the choice to adapt our everyday life to environmental constraint or not . the reason here is simple : these new world champion are currently trying to narrow the gap between the occidental standard of living and their standard of living . this implies that they will adopt the same mean of transportation than in occidental country . in other word they would want to have one car per person . and we obviously know that this is impossible because the environmental damage would be so huge that it will but in danger humanity a a whole . but a far a i am concerned , i do not want to believe that we will slowly continue to destroy our planet without doing anything . i prefer rather to think that , like in the past , we are going to adapt to this new situation and that the human creativity will help u to find a solution . and this solution will probably be the creation of a new kind of car , a pollution-free one . precisely , if we took attention to what currently happens in the car-making industry we can see some evidence that this prediction will occurs . effectively , we can already see some car which are fueled with both gasoline and colza which account for more than twenty percent of the car which are currently in use in brazil . moreover , it also exists some engine which are runned by hydrogen or electricity instead of fuel . to put it in a nutshell i definitely prefer to think that human being will succeed in creating a pollution-free way of transportation , the '' new car '' , rather than to think that we will all disappear because of our
