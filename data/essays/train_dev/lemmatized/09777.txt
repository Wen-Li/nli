in the last fifty year the number of car in use is increased all over the world , expecially in europe and in the north of america . in theese country almost everybody ( between eighteen and sixty year old ) have his own car and the problem concerned with this situation are becoming very high . the increasing of traffic and pollution are two of the more negative result of the excessive use of car and nowdays there are a lot of purposed to resolve theese problem . many major , for example , suggest to close the a part of their city to the car and this will be good also in order to preserve the beauty of the city centre ( especially if there are historical and artistical monument , like in italian city ) . but this will create the problem of moving from a place to another ( people have to go to work or to school ) so it will be necessary to improove the public transport . in my own experience , i 've seen that , depite of all theese purposed , anything ha been done . it 's really difficult to renouce to our habit , expecially if a chang mean to live a little harder than before . i 'm not very optimistic abuot the future and i think that the use of car will increase .
