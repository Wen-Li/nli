i agree with the following statement that successful people try new thing and take risk rather than only doing what they already know how to do well . as we go on trying the new thing it will be very usefull for the person to gain experince and also he can be able to solve the problem on his own with out taking the help of others , he can even face the risk so that he will be used to it and find easy to do well . as there is a saying that try and try untill u succeede and success is the stepping stone this is said because by tring new thing only the man can prove him self a the successfull person he must also be confident of what he is doing . if we do the thing a we know how to do it , it will not cost anything that is we can not gain knowledege by it . we gain lot of knowledege by trying the new thing and also we can earn lot of money by inventing or by making new thing in the market that is a we take example a the software company there we need to do the thing which are risky one and which are the new one . risks must be taken by the people by doing any kind of work because if we solve the risk we can get the expirence and a well a we be the successfull man among the others . some people create many new thing by their own idea by taking lot of risk those type of people will be successfull . hence i conclude this passage by saying that every person must try new thing , take risk and also solve them by their own so , that he may be the successfull man.successfull man will always be in good position in what evre he do . so , i say that successfull people should try new thing and take risk rather than doing what he already know .
