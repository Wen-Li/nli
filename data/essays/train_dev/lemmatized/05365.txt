in japan , where i live , many people think that the best way to travel is in a group with a tour guide . however , i disagree with the statement that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide for the following reason . first of all , there is quite little time to take a free time , if traveling in a group with a tour guide . for example , when my wife and i went to haneymoon to hawaii in 2004 , we traveled there in a group with a tour guide for seven day . we went to a lot of interesting place , but we could not stay one place where we wanted to stay longer because of restricted time schedule . if we had been there by ourselves , we would have stayed at our favorite place longer . as the above experience , i definitely think that traveling by ourselves is the best . second , traveling in a group with a tour guide is expensive . for instance , when i travel to kyusyu , which is located in southern part of japan , for three day , i stayed a excellent hotel and rent a four-door car , which made reservation by myself . the total cost of this trip wa le than a handred thousand yen . it wa a reasonable price . on the other hand , when i traveled to the same place in kyusyu for three day with a tour guide package , the cost of this trip wa twice a much a that of traveling by myself . this clearly show that traveling in a group with a tour guide is not economical . in conclusion , in japan , where i live , most of people think that the best way to travel is in a group with a tour guide . however , i definitely disagree that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide .
