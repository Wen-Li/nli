successful people try new thing and take risk rather than only doing what they already know how to do well . i strongly agree with this statement because i strongly credible that without risk and coming up with new thing there is no success in any field . firstly consider the example of film industry , in the film industry we always look for new thing because people will not accept the old concept . the successfull director of the film will always show intrest to take the risk and try new thing in order to satisfy the people , then only he can be appreciated by the people and can be successful person in the industry . if the director of the film is not willing to take risk and not intrested in trying new thing , people get bored of his film and after 2 film his film will not be seen by the people . secondly for example consider the student . if the student keep on studying book and and book and producing the same thing what he read in the exam he may get mark at that time but he can not be a successful person and he can not come up in life . but student who always try newthings eventhough he is getting failed will come up in life and acheives grand success . moreover he learns a lot thing while trying new thing . thirdly for example consider the good business person.a good business person will to try new thing and take risk to improve his business . he try and try new thing eventhough he is getting loss in his business and finally het get success in his business . but the business man who dont try new thing will not come up in life to the maximum . whereas business people who try new thing by taking risk will come up in life maximum . finally i conclude by saying that people can do well by implementing what they know but they can not get maximum success in life . but successfull people try new thing and take risk rather than only doing what they already know will get maximum success in life and these people will be the successful people in the society
