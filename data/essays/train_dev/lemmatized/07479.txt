i am going to explain why i agree that a variety of academic subject is better than to specialize in one specific subject . it is important to know that i am looking at this under specific condition . it make a difference if you are going to work in research where specialisation is mandatory or if you want to work for a company in an other department other than research . i am now refering to people in the business that would like to climb the ladder in a company . i am going to refer on one main aspect that highlight the pro of a broad knowledge . if a person goal is to have a career and to go up in a company hirarchy it is better for that person to understand the business a a whole . he may switch from different department and will therefore encounter several issue from many department . that person will also have to deliver advice and solution for different problem . of course he will also need to know where to get missing information on a topic . if he is a generalist he might not know all detail of a solution or might oversee problem but he will be able to get the information he need from specialist . as a generalist he should have enough insight to know how to prepare the input of the specialist in a form that can be understood by everyone . he need to know how to use the information for his company and how it would impact other department . idealy that person will also be able to connect aspect from several specialist in different range and put them togheter in a good way . as a conclusion i would say , that given specific fact , for example work , that influence this topic , it is better to have a wider range of knowledge than to be specialized . wider knowlegde will help carreer driven people to climb the ladder faster since they will be able to understand and handle upcoming issue better than specialist do . their general knowledge will make them better leader since they know the company a a whole and do not only see it with the eye of one department only .
