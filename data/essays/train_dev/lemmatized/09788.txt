in my opinion , i disagree with the idea in the statement that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide . i 'd like to give several reason belows . here is the list of reason why i think so . one specific reason that come readily to mind is that i am able to not only go anywhere with whomever i want to but also change the schedule of travel flexiblly by myself if i go to travel individually . in traveling to somewhere , i 'd rather want to go not only very popular place but also such a place where it is not so famous . for example , it happened when i went to germany with my family by not a tour . after traveling several day in germany , i went to a small church with my father in early morning . of course i also visit very famous place , for example the church of kelln , but at that time , i wa so impressed by the beauty of that small church . it is one of the greatest experience for me during my stay in germany . like this , of course visiting famous place by a tour group is good , but i want to go to a place which is not presented by a tour guide . i think that tour group tend to visit only popular place . secoundly , i can be excited by planning a tour itself . when i travel to somewhere , i always take long hour for planning and organizing the schedule of trip . i 'd like to consider how i will go round , where i will go and so on . i can learn the geographic condition of a place or the weather pattern of a place by planning by myself . it 's preferable for me . planning travel is very exiciting activity . if i went to a trip by a tour group , i would not be able to plan on any schedule because a tour guide must make overall plan . of course , i ca n't deny that there should exist some advantage in traveling by a tour group . if we travel by a tour group , we can receive detail explanation about some histrical heritage or cultural thing . and we may go a place where we ca n't find by ourself because a tour guide is a proffesional and he or she must know well about sightseeing spot than u . this idea may make an equally valid argument for the opposite position . but on careful consideration , i strongly believe that advantageas brought by traveling individually must exceed those by traveling by a tour group . considering all of the above factor , of course there are some advantage in traveling by a tour group , i find more advantage in making a trip individually . actually , i tend to change my schedule many time during my trip inherently , i think my nature doe n't fit the trip by a tour group . trip that i can change the schedule flexiblly is far more fascinating for me .
