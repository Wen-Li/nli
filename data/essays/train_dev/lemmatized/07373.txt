nowadays , it is important in time of applying at a university to consider rather study generalistically or specify in a certain subject . before applying student should take following aspect in consideration . firstly , it is often mentioned that being a specialist of a certain area make it easier once you finished university to apply for the position you are exactly trained for at an organisation . however , having a broad knowledge of many acadamic subject give you the possibility to apply for a wider range of job-ads . being generalistically offer you a way to enter a company more easily . once you are received the job you still can and you even have to , no matter being a specialist or a generalist , adopt to tyhe need of the company you are working for . secondely , it is argued that specifying in a certain field doe not take the same time a studying the basic of many different area . to some limited extend there is some truth in it , but , undoubtely , experience show that no metter what way of studying you have chosen the time until achieving a degree is the same . nevertheless , doing a generalistical degree is in my point of view better than completing a specific degree that take the same time . in other word your possibility are much broader after the study time finding a job then they would only being specified . and the time you have spend remains the same . to summarize , student first of all should be aware of the consequence when considering applying after they obtained a degree in a specific subject . furthermore they should mistrust the rumour that studying with the objective to get a broad knowledge of many academic subject take the same time then it would achieving a specific degree .
