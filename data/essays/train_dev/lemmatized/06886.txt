traveling mean that you go somewhere else , usually an unknown place , to see , relax , or to learn about those other place , their history and their culture . definetely the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide , because , it is a way to make the best of the trip and use each minute to it 's highest capacity , because each second that pass is not only worth money , but it is also worth precious time of learning and having a great experience . when having a tour guide , one can focus on other thing like assimilating what is happening ( what ha happened in those place that i am standing ) all around , but paying attention to someone that know where they are taking you . sure , it would be ideal to mark your own route when traveling , but not everyone can do that . at least , i would need to travel a little bit more , to know how to do that . the tour guide can be of great help when someone doe n't travel that often , because , they will summarize every important detail , and help you not to miss any of them , a you go along the journey . a tour guide is a qualified person , someone who doe n't only know history , architecture , and in most case culture ( they usually have lived in those place ) , which mean that a load of curiosity , historic and cultural detail go along with having a guide . now , the question rise : what kind of guide would you want ? one that ha lived in the place that you are visiting , one that is specialized in architecture , or planting , or church ? that is a question based on what do you want to go see specifically . each person ha different interest , and you may need a guide that can talk in your language , literally and figuratively speaking , so that you feel that your curiosity and question can be answered and taken care of by that person . so , in term of traveling , having a guide can make a trip a more enjoyable experience , and a very educative and interesting one at that .
