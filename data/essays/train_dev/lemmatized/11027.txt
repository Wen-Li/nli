i am agree with the statement that say that for student is more important to understand idea and concept than to learn fact . infact , i am a student and for me is essencial for learning well fact , first at all try to understand the idea and the concept that there are beside the fact that i must learn . if a person doe not understand the why of the fact i think that is not usefull learn about it . in my experiance , i always try to understand the reason that there is beside an event . becouse i think that if i understand the basic concept it will be more simple learn fact and not forget it . i study criminology and for my work is basic understand why is happen a certain event , what is the principle cause that cause a certain type of event . for example , for me is not important learn the fact becouse i must understand the reason that ther is beside a certain type of behaviour and not only the result of it . for my type of study is not important learn the fact but the reason . but i think that is not usefull only for my type of study but for all type of faculty . for example , in the scientific faculty is also very important it . it will be very important understand the reason why happening a certain natural event for example and not learn the event alone . in conclusion , i think that if a person want understand very well fact and not learn it becouse of the school or becouse a person say that he must learn it , he must question himself the basic idea and the concept that is linked on that event . also if , for example , the event that he must learn is not a good event , and he must try to do in a different way .
