undoutedly i would say that i agree with the statement given here that `` the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide . my first reason is , a we go to a new place , we may not be knowing how the place is , how will the behaviour of the people look , what their culture is , what their custom are , what their tradition is etc . if we go to some latin american country , we may find some difficulty in understanding their language and also we ca n't understand their accent even though they speak english . for example , suppose that you planned to go to france , the language the people speak there is french , you may not understand french where you need a guide . second reason is , if the place you planned to tour a historic place with out a guide , you finnaly end up with the rocky structers you see there . as each historic place ha a history behind it , the main purpose of visit is to know it history , a guide is right person to explain it for you . for example when you go on a tour to egyptian pyramid , you may not know who build them , how they are build , but if you have a guide with you he can help you explain all these detail . after all you derive a lot of thrill and in turn a great happiness by knowing all these detail . on the contrary when you tour alone or with you kith and kin who do n't know anything about either the place or the history you can not enjoy the place just becauce you do n't know the detail and there will be every possibility of getting detoured . when you encounter a mysterious inscription scribbled on stone you alone on your own can not decode them in order to enjoy the trip to the fullest extent . having considered all the reason given about i would say that i strongly agree with the given statement .
