i do not agree with the statement that the young poeple nowadays do not pay much attention to helping their community . in time of urgent need , the young people are always on the forefront in helping others . it is true that the young people are nowadays are much more carefree than the previous generation . however , this doe not mean that they are apathetic to the isssues concerning their community . take child for example . with the help of their school and parent , student are always known to conduct cleanliness and health awareness drive . recently the child near my block were collecting donation from everyone in the suburb to help the old people of the country . the school are playing a very vital role in encouraging the child to take such initiative . children a a part of their extra activity tend to go door-to-door creating awarensess about issue like proper usage of plastic , health and sanity , spread of disease etc . the younger generation is also actively help their community in case of emergency . due to increased use of technology , the younger generation is much more aware about the incident all over the world . youngsters tend to motivate people to act against unjust decision and rule through active response . recently my country wa plagued by a huge earthquake rendering thousand starving and homeless . the help that the youngster offered wa tremendous . thousands of young volunteer with food and supply arrived overnight to help those in need . all the student body in college and university collected cash and kind to help the disaster stricken population . i know many friend who regularly volunteer to feed and cook for the poor . it is true that present generation ha some flaw . it ha become much more indifferent to political issue and development . but taking into account all the factor , it would be unfair to generalise their behaviour a negligence .
