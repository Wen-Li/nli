in my opinion it is more important to understand idea about a lesson . i believe that student ha to focus on main concept of issue . by learning fact , student can gain only the information . as for me , first reason for it that when student focus on the main idea of any lesson , they might improve the idea , and they can add different type of idea to it . because i think that younger brain usually open for creativity . so if a teacher depends on teaching fact , he/she may cause lost of creativity in class . my second reason is , if student think about concept and try to understand the idea , they can produce question to teacher . so when they are asking these question , they may understand and learn all the fact of lesson . in the class , if teacher pay attention on giving the main idea , they can help to raise in number of innovative individual . because i believe that any student who ask question by using `` how '' and `` why '' can learn all structure . when i wa in high school we had two chemistry teacher in one year . our first chemistry teacher always asking element property whose student ha to know from periodic table . so we should know all element from that table . otherwise we sure that we ca n't pas the lesson . after his retirement , we had a new teacher for chemistry . she wa always giving research homework in the class . also we had to prepare project with our classmate . after that we got start to understand that how chemistry and it 's theory work . we were staying in library for hour . we were reading article about our homework . in the end of the year we gained a scientific point of view . and now , it 's really hard to remember of any element from periodic table .
