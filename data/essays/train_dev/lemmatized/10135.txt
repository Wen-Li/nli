the question about hiring a tour guide or not when traveling to a new place can raise a controversy . on the one hand , you know what to expect when taking a tour . on the other hand , you would totally depend on the guide 's timing , schedule and particular inclination to visit some place and leave others aside . i believe traveling in a group led by a tour guide leaf no room to particular experience while traveling . it can not be denied that tour are organized and save time a they know where to go and what would be the most efficient itinerary do do so . as they know the place , they wo n't waste time asking for direction or going to `` famous empty spot '' listed on travel guide . this is a great advantage a available time to travel is usually very limited . however , due to time constrains , tour-guides usually limit the visit to landmark and leave aside important thing a beautiful landscape or `` live-experiences '' . in fact , time is so short that many interesting thing are seen from the window of a bus . it must be very frustrating to go to paris to hear a tour guide saying `` on your left is the louvre museum '' instead of actually visiting it . moreover , traveling in a tour-guide led group is far more expensive than traveling on your own , thus limiting the posibilities of many people to do so . in addition , if you liked a particular spot , for instance the louvre museum , you do n't have the flexibility to stay longer , but instead you 're limited by inflexible schedule . in conclusion , i believe that even if traveling in a tour guide led group can be more time efficient that doing so on your own , it 's expensive , inflexible and limiting . a better experience can be held by traveling on your own , provided that a prior assessment and good planning of the trip are done .
