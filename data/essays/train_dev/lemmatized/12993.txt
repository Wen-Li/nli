in modern society people are confrontated with all kind of advertisement daily . commercials on tv , huge wall paper and other kind of advertisments influence and manipulate people to make them buy product . are these advertisement really truthful though ? or do they promise som thing that do n't even exsist ? i personally think that most advertisement make product seem a lot better than they really are . we just have to look at tv commercial to realize that they often promise more than the product actually offer . let 's look at the pharmaceutical industry for example . every day we get to hear about new cosmetic product for beutiful skin or pill that help to lose weight . i tried many of these product and i wa never pleased with them . another example for false advertising are food commercial . specific product we see on tv do often seem to be a lot larger than they actually are . with help of computer program people are able to make their product look better on tv or on a paper . they use specific technical method to convince their costumer of their item . a third example for the lacking of truth on advertisement are the method of politician to get more vote . they often promise great achievement and advertise with big headline on wallpaper that they are going to improve the country 's situation . i have gained the experience that they usually do n't keep their promisses . i come to the conclusion that we should be really careful about believing what advertisement promise u . many of them do n't tell the truth about their product . i personally think that these false promise are even the essential element of advertisement . we know that their only purpose is to convince people . therefor advertisement do always only show positive aspect of their product . besides our economy put a great amount of pressure on firm who try to sell product . there is a huge competition between company and everyone ha to sell a many product a possible in order to survive . this force people to create advertisement that are convincing and persuasive , even if that mean that they have to hide the truth and to be unrealistic .
