as a matter of fact i think we first start with the term young , who are young people , to count a young people should we in a certain range of age or should we distinguish certain behaviour . we all leave in a global interacting society , a human we all have function for the development our social and culturel life , a i 'm trying to say you can not society into part ( like young or old ) you uoght to think a a whole . people do not leave alone mostly they live in crowded city . on this city you are in an interaction with the rest these could be either young or old . sharing a place to live with others mean rule for society order preservation . these rule could be written ; like law or could be unwritten like cultural convention or practice . the one who did'nt came against these rule ought to live untouched . it is easy to blame or recriminate each other for behaving in an un acceptable way . instead of this tpe of behaviour we should requestion themselves both a an old or a young member of the society . we first try to find the mistake on ourselves than putting the blame on other side . if there 's a clash between young and old member of the society both side shoul held the problem together and try to find a solution together , a this problem may not giving enough time for their community or not doing their obligation . we can say if there is a problem this all ours we should solve it with all part of the society
