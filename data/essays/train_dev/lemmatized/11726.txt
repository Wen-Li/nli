it is important for everyone to have not only the substract ability but also the objective ability . substract ability is based on the understanding of idea and concept , and the objective ability is based on the fact . based on the research , kid and child are sensitive to the fact because they have not the capicity to think and solve the complex question . on the other hand , adult and elder youth are more willing to understand idea and concept because they have the ability to think substract thing . for example , in math , a child can only understand the simple calculte step , but for adult or youth , they can solve complex question step by step . as a result , i disagree the statement that it is more important for student to understand idea and concept then it is for them to learn fact . in my opnion , everything is based the fact , without the fact , any idea and concept are vanity . for a elementary school student , it impossible to catch the idea and concept .
