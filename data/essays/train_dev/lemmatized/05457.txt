i agree with the statement that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their community . i support this statement because of the busy schedule of the young people which make them run out of time . majority of the young people now a day have busy schedule either with their academic or with their regular office work . well because of the heavy competetion in this modern world the yong people who go for school will have a pressure on them to get good grade in their section . to achieve this they have to work hard which consumes a significant amont of their daily time in studying which sap their energy and concentration . usually after this hard work rest is needed and no time is left for them to help their community . for example when i wa studying in my intemediate i wa made to study for about sixteen hour a day which made me to ignore the thing and happening around me . young people working in office do not have time even to spend time with their family member so how they can help their community . they will face a lot of pressure from their head and upper managment to complete their project and the work in time which leaf them with no time either to spend time with family member or help the community . an example of this can be taken a the neighbour working in an company who leaf his house at seven in the morning and return at around nine in the nigt which make him restless . he just talk to me just twice a month or so . in the view of the above stated statement and the example that the youg people do not have enough time to helping their community .
