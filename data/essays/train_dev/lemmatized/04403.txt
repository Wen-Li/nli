the issue of car number is very important because of environmental espects that are involved in this problem . on the one hand , we can thing that in twenty year there will fewer car in use than today because of the limited energy sourves such a petroleum . on the other hand , people which consider developping country , or former developping country such a china or india can support the idea that the number of car will increase . in my opinion , the number of car will decrease in developped country a in europ or north america but will increase in newly developped country a china . first of all , we have to condider that the whole world is changing because of the scarcity of energy that will be an very important issue in the next twenty year . actually , it will involve high price for gazoline for example . for instance , people which doe not need long travel by car will use other way to travel such a bike because car will be too expensive . then , we know the country that use a lot of car are the developped country and now , new developped country are coming and it inhabitant are going to be able to buy car . thus , car number can increase a lot during the next twenty year . finally , my viewpoint is that there will be high difference in the car consumption between developped country and country like china or india where the number of car is sharply increasing . moreover , number of car in more little asian country is growing too . for instance , it is a new thai problem in bangkok . to conclude , it is difficult to answer and predict the car consumption in the worls that involve a lot of phenomenon like energy availability or country developping but environmental problem are linked to car number and some law or regulation about environment may decrease the quantity of car during the next twenty year .
