advertisements are increasingly present in our everyday life , in several support and in severals way . to wonder if advertisement make product seem better than they really are could be seen a a non-sense question , because precisely the aim of an ad is to make a product unreplacable . that is why i agree with this statement . advertisements are made to give people the will to buy the product . it 's also the only way to get people aware of a new product , and obviously the better is this product , the more people will buy , even if it 's just to try . so my first point is that advertisement should and must make product better than they really are , because they 're made for that . my second point is that advertisement can do more than just showing a product at it 's best . i mean that advertising is also a way to build an image , a spirit for a product and for the people who buy this product . for example , in advertisement for car , advertiser manage to show only what they want to insist on , in order to attract a specific range of customer . they can insist on security , fun , sportivity , but it 's always to make people feel attached to a way of thinking and behaving . so advertisement are a way for producer to sell their product by giving more to the consumer than only the product . obviously all people are not sensitive to the same purposals of advertising , and that 's a way to highlight the weakness of advertising . an ad ca n't be liked by everybody , and sometimes ca n't be understood by anybody . so ad can also be unproductive and unefficient . the point is that i believe that advertisement can be both very profitable and dangerous for a producer . that 's why i finally confirm that i really think that advertising is very powerful , and very important for the life of a product , but it ha to be well prepared , well broadcast to be very effective .
