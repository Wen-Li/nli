an increasing number of student realize that it is more important for them to understand idea and concept , unfortunately , there is a growing opposition among the other student , who maintain that learn fact is the most factor in their study . however , in the final analysis , i conclude that the former one doe make sense . in the following discussion , i would like to present some point to support my statement . in the first place , the key point for my view is that understand idea and concept , undoubtly , which allow the student to cultivate their ability of self-study is play the most role in their study . actually , the final aim of the student study in the university is to promote their sense of think independence . for exam , in their beginning study , they need a teacher to guide them . but in their future study , they must deal with the problem by themselves . of course , they need to practice their capability to solve the problem when they understand idea and concept in class . in addition , the student can understand idea and concept by themselves to check out what they have learnd in the class . it is benefit for them to build up their self-confidencial . furthermore , it is the best way to supervise the student . if they ca n't understand and concept , they would failed the exam at last . given the reason above , which sometimes intertwine to form a organic whole and thus become more persuasive , and we can arrived at the conclusion that inspire the student to master the ability of understand idea and concept in the class must be undertaken by the teacher . only by this way can we implement the qutity-education ; only by this way can we enhance the self-confidence of the student and only by this way can we supervise student ' study in an efficient way .
