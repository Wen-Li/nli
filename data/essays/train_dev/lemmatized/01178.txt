there is an old saying that if you can not be the best be the best of what you are which i thing true if you concern the acedemic condition poeple living in having a broad knowledge of many academic subject may have advantage a far a technical or culturel any other knowledge but it may leave you directionless and without a view of future planning what if you have 3 diploma and no job simple but interesting argument you might be the most intellectual person on the planet will it serve any purpose i dont think so if you have spent all those year studying examining or academically active true there is an aspect of personal indulgence but that is a rare case in my opinion for example you may have the information ability and resource to build a space craft will you be able to pilot it or is it sense building it or flying that motivates one it is hard to answer but i would say the way you best is the shortest way when you consider someone spending year learning all that knowledge without feeling not even a small desire to fly for someone who specialised in one specific subject for example a mechanical engineer it is easier to appreciate the thing he or she might accomplish that person will surely know devotion to his or her job or field of experty all because of one thing that person will keep everthing on a personal level knowing that someone else is doing something else important at very same level of concentration at something like a research or a development there are exception of course like the modern genius like einstein but do we all have that leve of iq is it safe the concertrate on everything rather than one thing at the point you are giving your live a direction no one want be left without out a vision because he or she have too many before they realise that they have to make a choice
