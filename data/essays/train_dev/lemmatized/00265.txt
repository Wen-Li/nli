nowadays young people ha change a lot , their education change and they change with it , is suposse to be a more liberal educacion with le rule and more freedom , but maybe we are giving freedom to people that is not ready to use it properly yet . what i wanted to say with that is that young people today spends more time looking at themselves than trying to be part of the society . maybe is because they are living in a society that do not offer them what they are looking for and for that reason the are not in the mood to participate of their community . we are living in the telecomunications era . you can live without human touch . without going out of your own house . most of young people think that his communiti is to small for them so they use internet to feel they are part of something really great , to feel importans . they do not mind if his neighbour need salt or if his hometown is clean or not . they are upon all that . as an example i can use new kind of culture that i have red about in a magacine last week . it is a new way of life , it is very extended in japan , and their philosophy of life is not to have any personal relation if it is not via internet . so they borke off whit their family and with their friend and they star living all by themselves . using internet for everything , for working , make their shoping , make friend and all the natural thing that we are use to do in our life . hearing thing like that i have got the hoppe that maybe in the future young people will help their community , maybe they would be cybercommunities but the main idea is to be part of something .
