i think that it is more important for student to understand idea and concept rather than to merely learn fact , hence forth agreeing to the statement . one of the best example to support this statement go back in time before the renassance period in europe . the roman catholic church at that time wa the ruling authority . they proposed false fact that the earth wa the centre of the solar system and that all the other planet revolved around it . this wa tought to the mass and then at that time preference wa given to the fact even if they were untrue regardless of the underlyng concept on how a solar system worked . so even if the fact didnt have any underlying idea to it or concept , it wa given importance , thus the result that people living under a lie . now if the idea that understanding and conceptualizing wa more importand than just learning mere fact wa presented at that time , there would have been a great advancement in the knowledge of the universe even before the renesance priod . the statement also support one of the idomoms that `` necessity is the mother of invention '' . if the student are exposed to only fact , which are a kind of invention by others who understood idea before , there would not be any room for free thinking and the resultant , which in this case is the future ( students are the future ) would be stagnated ! also i believe that some fact can be altered and/or proved wrong by understanding idea and concept . again the example stated above serf for this statement . at the renessance period the false fact were proved wrong by free thinker like galleleo with the help of their ability to understand idea and concept . great discovery and invention were made at that perioid and many new fact were made . thus all and all we can consider that one need to develop idea and concept in order to make fact in the first place and that fact are just resultant part of it .
