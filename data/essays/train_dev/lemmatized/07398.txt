the statement say the young people enjoy more than older people . personally , i do n't agree this statment in all of this part . infact , by my point of view the young people is le responsable of other mature people . generally , in the last year the way to enjoy life is changed . infact today young peole have le problem than young people of forty year ago for example . today a boy depends totally from his parent . in this way he have le responsability and this caused a total insoddisfaction of all . instead of the young people , the older people have achieved a total maturity that permitt they to enjoy life more than young people with small thing , like a only dinner with friend or a travel with family . it is also true that the young boy have a lot of enthusiam respect to older people . but this concept do n't go to over see the problem . there are also case where older people do n't enjoy life beacuse they have very big problem like the fact of to not fand a work or for example because their are very tyred . so , my personal opinion is that the young boy , in the state of parity of condition , do n't enjoy life so much . infact also in my family i see that my parent enjoy life more than me and my brother . finally , in this way i say that i disagree with the above statement .
