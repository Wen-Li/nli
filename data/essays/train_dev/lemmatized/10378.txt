different study and investigation have been proving during year , how contaminating a car is . however the number of car continues to increase at time pass by . in fact , i am not an expert in the subject , but i would say i disagree with the statement listed and predict an increase of car in the following twenty year . in the fisrt place , simply because the world 's population is growing . people are having more and more child , and those child get to be adult who can buy their own car . therefore , if the percentage of car owner stay constant , the number of car will increase . for example , if the percentage of car owner is 10 % , and nowadays the population is 100 people , and in the futur this population grows to 120 people , then the number of car would pas from 10 to 12 . the second reason i can find to hold my opinion is very much related with the first one . since population is growing there are no more space for everyone in the city , and , thus , living in the city is becoming more and more expensive . therefore , nowadays one can choose to have a more cheaper and calm life in the outskirt of the city , and in that way one is able to buy a car and travel to the city to work everyday . in the third place , i think there is an economical reason for which the number of car will increase . manufacturing tecnhiques are improving , making the construction of a car simpler and cheaper , which make the final product much more cheaper and accesible . for example in my grandparent 's time having a car in argentina wa a real privilege for car were luxury product . today , on the contrary , though not everyone can have a car , most of middle class people in argentina can afford one . however i also think that there are many different way in which the number of car can be regulated . in my opinion each government should find it 's own way to incentivating people to use alternate mean of transportation such a bus or subway to reduce the number of car . clearly the process is not easy but if nothing is done , and the number of car keep increasing , then the contamination caused would be really terrible and impossible to correct . in conclusion i think that if thing keep on being the way they are today , in twenty year the number of car will not be reduced but increased . population growth , their need to move out of the city and to move themselves daily , and the price on car are just some reason i can find to predict such increase . however , this increase can be reversed if action , mainly form the government , is taken to regulate the number of car .
