in my country that is to say in france , at school we are studing various class . but is n't it better to be specialize in one specific subject than having broad of knowledgeof many academic subject ? if broad knowledge let you discover new thing and follow one programe without doing any choice . on the contrary be specialize on a specific subject make you be better on this subject like a professional and not losing your time . broad knowlwdge make you dicover new thing in some case , and maybe , thing that you never imagine you could be interested in , maybe one can find it vocation . moreover , it can be usefull for your own culture to know about the story of your country or about what is happening in your body , even if you will not be an historian or a biologist . in addition , the fact that you do n't have any choice of class subject to make like in high school , help people who do n't know what to do . that it 's what happened with some of my friend . on the other side , be specialize on a specific subject can prepare you for your professional life , and with this solution you are only doing thing you like or thing that you want to know about . therefore people do n't have the feeling to lose there time because they are doing this in order to be an expert and to find a job which deal about the subject . to my mind it is better to have a broad of knowledge of many subject because i am really curious . i will borrow me being only specialize in one topic . i like to learn about many thing it make me feel more inteligent .
