people normally think that people who try new thing and take risk rather than only doing what they already know how to do well can have succeful life . however , i think that it is really dangerous thinking and i strongly disagree with this . there are three main reason and example why i disagree with the statement . first , it ha really low percentage of success . when people try new thing there are always a lot of risk . since new thing are not known and proved the people always take the risk . and sometimes it can be really dangerous for the people . if what the people try to do is succeed , then he/she can be a hero and others may respect them . however , that doe not normally happen in our life . so it can be really dangerous for you to try new thing and take risk rather than only doing what you know how to do well . for example , if you work for a company and you need to finish your project . then you do not follow the standard guide line and you try a new way to do the project . if your bos like the project , that is really lucky and good for you but normally that is really hard . you might get fired because of your new way to do the project . second , the statement seems right because there are some people who have become famous because of their new thinking and try . however , it is really rare situation . only few people actually succeed by their new idea and unusual try . then they look really good because they can be famous . for example , novel became really famous by making dinamites . he tried new thinngs and finally invented really useful equipment . but if he failed his work , no one would know him thesesdays . only when you succeed your try , people will respect you and remember you . otherwise , you fail your work and no one care about it . third , you can still succeed even though you do not try new thing and take risk rather than only doing what you already know how to do well . success doe not always require your new attempt . success is just depends on your personal value . for example , if your value is earning money and having a nice family , you do not have to try new thing and face risk . you can still have successful life without any new try . success deal with your personal value much more than what you actually do . as above , the percentage of success is really low when you try knew thing , and it is really hard to succeed by doing new thing . also you can still succeed even though you do not try new thing rather than onlu doing what you already know how to do well . therefore , i disagree with the statement .
