dealing with that statement about the student focus during the time he or she is studying , i what prefer to agree with that objective to concentrate of the the idea and concept . to support my selection i will start with the disadvanteges on learning fact . consider and example that i have observed during my own study , where a student a learned only the thing written down by the professor . he wa clearly able to pas a lot of exam but there are a few special exam where it is pariticular important to understand relationship between topic and to achieve a high graded exam by using combination of fact to buid concept . the ability of creating combination and to understand idea are so much common in the real business world after the study , that it should be the highest focus during the normal education phase not only at the university . for instance , new product and high valued invention are not be created by employee who have learned everything that wa wa written in a text book , they were done by people how are able to see the comprehensive concept including the business aspect a well a the technological background . but for sure that new product could be supported by fact . unfortunatlly the number will change over a certain amout of time but the basic concept will stay the same or be improved . a different important aspect that support the concept and idea focus is the traing of phantasy that is realy helpful to find new solution and to extent the capability of a person to deal with problem that have not standard way to be solved . summarising all written example i would suggest to start with the understanding may be of an entire product behavior a early a possible to be able to learn from that behavior , concept or idea . combining that with fact you will be able to create product and solution that could be recognized in your surounding business environment .
