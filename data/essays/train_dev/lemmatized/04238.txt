in order to understand something globaly , we should learn fact a well a understand idea and concept . however , sometimes understanding is better than learning , or in some case it is the contrary . it is important for student to understand idea and concept , because this will help them to memorise the fact and understand other isuues related to the subject they are studying . for example , when a student fully understands a mathematical theory , he or she will be able to resolve many related mathematical problem easier . for some student , it is much easier to understand idea than to learn fact by heart . others , on the other hand , prefer to memorise fact rather than trying to understand concept . in my opinion , there is no general rule stating what is more important for student . it depends on the class the student are taking , wether it is more important to understand concept or to learn fact . in history class for example , learning about event and fact is more important than understanding them , it is even impossible to understand some issue in history . whereas in a computer , physic or a biology class for example , student are asked mainly to understand theory and concept , they should be able to analyse data and give solution and result making use of what they understood . so , there are some class that requier more learning than understanding , and other class that requier more understanding than learning .
