i agree with the statement `` most advertisement make product seem much better than they really are '' the advertisement are made for help the sell of the product that they are showing . the advertisement are made by proffesional people whom ha been studying the way to transform a simple like in a necesity . they have had created way to produce and reflect the best caracteristics of the product , and of course do not show or let think about something can be wrong or is not really good , for make the people feel a necesity for more product than they need . for many year the advertisement ha been created with specific information , color , picture . .. everythig is put and combinated having a a result a machine maker of necesities based on like , desire and hope . the advertisement are showed by many way , from the most common and popular television , till the most sofisticate internet and movil phone . they have to be around and close to the public that they are made for . this can be done by schedule . for example if the product is for baby and kid the advertisement will have place on television by the time the school time end every day . also they can be in the supermarket in very big space , with flourescent color , music , and some time with the characteres from the kid ' favorite cartoon . by other hand when the product is for the big guy in home , like dad , the advertisement will be showed on weekend or some time during the weekday late at night . the advertisement have a good razon for exist , when they make what are they made for . some advertisement try to sell , other give infomation or can be asking for help . you can see some others that may seem like have nothing to do , but this is because they are made for no one of the grups that you can be on , but they still been doing a specific work , look next to you , it may be working with your family member . there is not way for say that i do n't believe that most of advertisement help product seem much better than they are in real . this work , and it work good .
