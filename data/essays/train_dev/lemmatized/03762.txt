the best ? i do n't like say that . it meybe is the best way sometimes but not always . because we have some different idea when we locate at the different age . so travling with a guide or not depends on the period of our age . if i wa a child or teensage now , i 'd like to find a guide to describe the cultrue of some spot . the reason is that , i have much le knowledge about some famours place . so travled with a guide is very necessary for me to learn new thing . also , traveling with a guide is a comfort way because i can save time and money to find the spot and bus which can lead me to the porpuse place . but , if i am a university student now , i will choose to travel myself . why ? because i have had the capable to do something on my own . for instance , if i want to go to yunnan , i will find some relative information about that place from the internet . you know , in the morden world , internet is a perfect source for out younth . so traveling alone is much easier for u . so , do n't you think it is a good decision ? then , if i am a old lady who have had not ability to walk along . certainly , the best way to travel is led by a tour guide . the reason is that i can get some essensial sevice from the tour guide , such a helping me to walk , introducing some spot to me aloudly and so on . something look much foolish but are all necessary . because i am a disability one and need more heart kindly . so , traveling in a group and led by a guide depends on the concrete situation . but , traveling in a group is the best way to make friend who have the same interst with you . i have some friend who traveling with me to some spot , and i found that we all have the similar interest at some aspect . hence , leading by a guide is the best way to trave sometime , but not always .
