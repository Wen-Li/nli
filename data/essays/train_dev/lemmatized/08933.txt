i agree with the prompt . young people do enjoy life more than the older one do . it is only at a young age that one 's mind is jostling with innovative , imaginative and creative idea . a young person is jostling with curiosity to plunge into the outside world and explore the various mystery it hold . all the zest to explore life gradually fade away with old age . here is an example . when you ask a teen about what he or she would like to do in life , you would get an answer right away that would sound something like , `` oh ! i want to be successful in what ever that i do ! ... and have a lot of fun doing that ! '' . on asking the same question to an adult , say a middle aged one , can you imagine such an energitic and zealous reply ? well , at least i can not . at the most , it would be something like , `` i need to get all my insurance settled '' . from this we can infer that with old age , our attitude towards life begin to change . one start to forget that life is something that come only once and it need to be lived to the fullest . and with that i mean , the zeal to face the challeges that come up in life should prevail , whatsoever . also , the saying `` ignorance is bliss '' would hold true for a young person ( if taken in the right context , that is ) . a young person need not worry about the complexity of share and insurance policy and all the material worry that are ought to haunt them in their old age . all that would ( and should ) matter in youth would be a positive approach towards life and the zeal to do something good for the society , the willingness to contribute to making the world a better place to live in . well , yes , that is the only time that one woud get the time to do good thing for the world , like joining an animal welfare association , or helping organisation that work to do some good for the society . all these factor sum up to one conclusion . life can be enjoyed greatly only in young age .
