cars ! car are one of the most used vehicle today and they lead to a better lifestyle and comfort for a lot of people . on the other hand there are a lot of negative aspect that are involved in the use of car and people argue about the existence of car . will there be more or fewer car in twenty year ? to discus that topic we have to look at happening all arround the world . daily newspaper write about pollution and about the effect that occur from car . people will have to consider our environment even more in the future and they really have to be aware of the risk when polluting the earth . another point often mentioned in headline is the one that new energy source , which will be able to run an engine are found and prepared for future use . meanwhile some scientist belive that there will be enough oil to support car for the next century others think that oil is a very scacre ressource and there wont be enough oil to provide all car . another point that ha to be taken into consideration is that street not only are overcrouded but also cause the government to spend a lot of money to repair them . surely some of that money will be collected by tax from street-users such a car driver but there ha to be further consideration . on the other hand there are reason to make one think that there will be more car in the future . for example there is the growing population especially in china or asia where a lot of people nowadays drive bysicles but a soon a they can afford car will buy a car . that mean that there are might region where more car will be build to satisfy one s wish considering the hole planet population is not growing that fast anymore and therefore there is no aid of more car . in conclusion i think that car will always remain on our street at least for the next 20 year but there will not be a significant grow of car . rather people start to think about future generation and environment which will make them able to establish bus system and train station to protect the environment .
