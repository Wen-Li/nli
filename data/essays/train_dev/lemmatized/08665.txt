nowadasys the rythm of life is becoming more and more frantic , and this is quite evident and clear to all of u . anyway i 'm not of the opinion that today we are losing value and dedicating our time to unuseful or trivial thing . i strongly desagree with the statement proposed and defenitely do n't want to believe that young people do n't spend time helping the community they live in . first of all , i want to notice that the chance , offered by society , to join voluntary activity and project , are much more publicized today than before . thanks to technological progress , our wide and fast way of communication make it easier to know the great variety of opportunity for helping someone and somewhere that everyday come out : from workcamps to sport event , from working with child to bringing help to old people who live alone , and so on . the environment a young volunteer can find himself in , is never the same so he/she doe n't get bored . moreover , the several opportunity are available for all the age , there are not volunteer too young or to old , just volunteer that want to get on their bike and work a bit for the others . i had a personal experience that gave me an important teaching and that i hope my child will desire to do too . last year i joined a group of 23 international volunteer in kenya and the aim of the project wa to build a road ( or may i should say a way ) in the middle of a forest to make child able to go to school . it ha been an experience unforgettable from many point of view : we were helping that african community and they were very kind with u , we lived in strict contact , so i got the chance to know a different culture in a deep way . concluding , i believe that today young people have in mind that every opportunity to help the community and to join a voluntary project , can be an extremely significant tool to mature and also a cultural exchange a much important a unexpected .
