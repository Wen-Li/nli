i agree with that , it is more important for studets to understand idea and cocept thanit is for them to learn fact . i believe in this because i think the idea and the concept of anything is more important than the fact especially in some subject like technology , philosphy , mathmetics , becaues here you have to analys the fact using the idea and the conepts . so that the indeas and the concept are important to understand and analys the fact it self . first , most of the subject that we are studing in the school are based on fact , but our understanding for this subject will not completed if we do n't know the concept and the idea about this fact . for instance if we are studing acourse about the structure of the air plane , here we are studying the fact of the air plan , but if we also studying the idea why we are using this material or putting this thing in this place this will give u have a wider view about the mechanisme how we could make the air plane flying with the most perfict and efficiant way . for exampl we use the aluminium instead of iron to made the skeleton of the air palne because it is lighter . this is an important concept we should know it about the structure of air plane , second the idea and the concept is more important than the fact in analysing the mathematical problem . if we want to solive any problem we have to know the idea and the concept of this problem . if we only know the fact we will never reach the solution . because in mathemathic we depend on the fact a well a on the idea and the concept to analyis these fact . finally , concept and idea are important in our life philosphy . philosphy of life is depended on fact . but we need to understant the concept of this fact . for exampl , there is a fact in our life is that every one of u should get married , but we have to understand the concept and the idea of marrige . here the concept is more important because we should get married not just becuse it is a natural desire but because the human bieng is a social animal and must live with a partner and ha a child in order to be happy .
