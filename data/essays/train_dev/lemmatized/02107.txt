advertisements make product seem better than they really are . yes that is true . advertisements are meant for selling the product faster and for commercialization of the product . to achieve this goal advertiser create a hype regarding the product . there are many variety of the same product , for example many cereal have the same basic ingredient but some are sold like hot cake while others do not . the product which are advertised more happen to to be sold faster than those that are not advertised . mmany cereal advertise that cholesterol would reduce to half by eating the cereal or the calcium in the cereal would improve their bone . these are not always true . in my experience i found that eating cereal which advertise that cholesterol is reduced to half or the calcium in the cereal make bone grow stronger is just to attract the society to buy the cereal . the advertising personnel try to attract the customer by health logo and slim waist line advertisement to sell the product . when my doctor told me that i should reduce my cholesterol in take i started eating a cereal to bring down my cholesterol for six month . after six month my cholesterol level wa still the same . my friend once bought a weight reducing drink being carried away by the advertisement which said reduce weight in three month . she took the drink a specified but she did not reduce weight . not only that the side effect with the drink outweighed the little benefit the drink provided . these specific example made to believe that most advertisement are just for marketig sake and just make seem the prodct is reaaly better than it really is
