the main problem with this statement is that it implication can not hold much factual value . it try to generalize without taking into account the domain of function . different field of knowledge require different approach towards specialization in order to be effective . i will formulate what i mean by this shortly . in my opinion the statement doe not hold much water a a general truth but rather depends on the context where it is used . there are certainly many field of knowledge , where it is imperative to specialize extremly into a the subject at hand . modern science is a good example of that . the problem is the speed at which human knowledge expands . thanks to modern storing technique and exponential growth of `` world knowledge '' it is impossible for a human being to have a broad knowledge of different academic field and still be effective to the maximum in a certain subject . thus if you for example specialize in modern mathematics there will simply not enough time to dwell in the escapade of ancient , greek hero . the main counter argument against specialisation is of course the lack of interdisciplinary thought , meaning a specialist doe often fail to connect the finding of his field with discovery of other field . for example you might be a person with great interest into the function and working of the business field . you might want to become a first class manager and thus vigorously invest your time in the wonder of the economic sector . what if for example psychology discovers a way on how to better influence the opinion of people ? would these finding not help your agenda -- selling your product to your costumer ? but how would you know ? you never considered to connect the discovery from one field with the finding in yours . thus molding part of different academic field into something better doe indeed require a broader knowledge than just specializing . from a personal standpoint , meaning the effect two different alternative of the statement would have on my personal development a a human being i would like to add : if my main goal is to life a healthy , fun , exciting life i do agree that it is more likely that a broad academic knowledge help me in my everyday struggle more than pure specialisation . this is due to the concept of interaction and the fact that human thought doe work a lot with association . this of course depends how much i am attracted to a certain field of knowledge . in conclusion the only true answer to the statement is : `` it depends '' . its quality a a general statement are certainly lacking .
