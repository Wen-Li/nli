i do n't agree with the statement that in tweny year there will be fewer car in use than there are today . in the last 100 year the growth of car in use ha followed an exponential pace , to the point that in the world today there are several million of car in use . that pace is likely to continue , especially because many country all over the world still have a huge potential in their car ' market , specifically emerging country . some reason that could hinder the growth of car in use would be a higher use in public transportation or a feeling of disdain towards car , which could be derived from high oil price . a higher use in public transportation could be result of no more physical space , but that may happen in big city with a huge number of car , not in rural area or emerging country where there still is a lot of room for car . in addition , people in those area have a big incentive - if they can afford it - to buy a car because , since public transportation is not common and/or efficient , car in those area are even more useful . an increase in the oil price could be another reason why people would stop using their car , and eventually stop buying them . however , we must not forget that the main car manufacturer are already producing some car that work with biofuels . those model are still almost experimental , but their technology is highly susceptible of being improved , so the number of car in use would not be influenced by high oil price . finally , i have been using indifferently the number of car in use and the growth rate of car in use . it is important to note that even if the growth rate of car in use decrease ( in other word it doe not keep the same rising pace ) the number of car in use would still be higher than today . in order to make the statement come true the growth rate in the number of car in use should actually be negative , and i do n't think that is going to happen in the next 20 year ; the potential to grow is still overwhelming .
