succesful people try new thing and take risk rather than only doing what they already know how to do well . i logically agree with this concept and i think that almost all time hope and a good attitud can make much more than knowledge and money , but the convination of the four thing is something amaizing . the most impportant thing to really succed in your life is achieve your gold , that is the reason you should be persistant ; be proud of yourself , never keeping the felling of knowing that you could do something more , or that you could be part of something but you were too affraid to do it . do n't be affraid , trust in yourself , the most important , believe in you ! a great example of succed in the life is my sister , laura garza , she is the person that i admire the most ; she is the kind of person that when she propose something , she get it , no matter what , no matter how much time it get , no matter how tired she is , no matter how much it cost . i realized that when laura want to do something , she doe it , a easy a that , i really got astonished when i knew she will go to study clinical phsycology in washington , and why , just because she want to do it , and guess what ? she is studying in there now . succes , what is succes ? well , the answer is different to all the people , but the real succes in the life is when you feel comfortable with yourself , when you get up in the morning and feel you really deserve to be where you are , when you look all around you and finally say : after all my work , i finally get it ! but the most important , you should never give up , you should never think , okeay that is enoght ; because , it is never enought . you could always be learning and doing something . i asure you that you will get up , and if you have an open mind and a competitive attitude , you will learn something new everyday . just never give up and you will rich your gold , and really succed in your life .
