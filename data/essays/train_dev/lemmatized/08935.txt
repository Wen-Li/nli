without question , i disagree this statement . there are two reason : dvelpoping country and the evorution of car . first , the people who need car become more larger in these twenty year than today . because in most of the developing country , the population are becoming larger and larger , and in such coutry people want to have car a they become rich . for example , in china there were many people who only have bike in ten year ago , but today many chinese come to rich and bigin to buy car . thus , a developing country grow in economically , need for car is increasing . second , in these day , car become more harmless for environment because of the evorution of their tecnology . for example , soler car only us sunlight and dose not contaminate air . if these car become more cheeper , people who care about environment could use car . thus in developed countories , the need for car may not decline . all in all , i can not agree with that in twenty year there willbe fewer car in use . because this opinion dose not concern about need in developing country and evorution of tecnology .
