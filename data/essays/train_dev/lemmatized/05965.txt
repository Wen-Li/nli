in later year advertisenments have increased a lot , especially on tv and newspaper . the most part of spot present product or service in a way that can make them appear better then they really are . many and many tecniques are used to present product enphatising their quality : for example in icecream 's spot they use a camera recording at a very high fps ( frame per second ) and then play the spot at a lower speed . using this tecnique icecream will appear to be more creamly even if they are n't really like that . i completely refuse the trend to present product in this way . in my opinion advertisement must present product or service a they really are . presenting product in such a way is also a risk for the firm : customer may be unsatisfayed by what they have bought if it is n't a the advertisement ha presented it . probably they will not buy something from that brand no more . i think that also governement should do something to stop this trend : for example the state should create a team responsible to verify if product are a they will be presented in spot . if a product seems better that it really is , state should punish trasgressors with financial penalty . nowadays firm must create advertisement that present product better than they are because every firm do that and people will not buy at all product if they seem lower quality than others even from spot . firms could stop this trend by creating a team controlling all advertisement : firm produce advertisement the best that they can but presenting product a they are . before publishing advertisement the control team will check if the presentation of product is or not corresponding to real product . if the check is positive , the advertisement can be published . this is also a way to help customer to choose the best product they need .
