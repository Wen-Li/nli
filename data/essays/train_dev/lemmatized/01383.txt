the world is changing day by day and the change is rapid . in this competitive world we face many issue for which we must have lot of knowledge on every aspect which we come across in our education but it is not possible to have lot of knowledge on every subject . so , atleast we must have a broad knowledge on academic subject . i support to the idea to have broad knowledge of many academic subject by giving few example . there are many advantage for my supporting to broad knowledge of many academic subject . for example think , i am working on a project which is related to derivative control . for this project if i do specialization on one particular subject i ca n't do the whole project because i have to know communication theory , signal and system and some software programming language in addition to electrical technology . if i do specialization in only one subject how can i do the whole project . furthermore , to study only one particlar subject it is very difficult to get progress in that subject because it may lead to loss of interest and more over after completing half if i think i am not suitable to that area my time and resource are wasted and if i continued without any interest there will be no satisfaction in job which i do relating to that subject . moreover , after my cource work i have to go for a job and the company want me to work in different area in different time which make me difficult if i am specialized in one subject and i ca n't say my manager `` i ca n't work '' . in addition to that i myself will be having a great scope of choosing my own area inaccording to the time if i have broad knowledge on different subject . in totally , i support to the statement that there must be a broad knowledge on all academic cources than getting specialized in one specific subject .
