maybe , but i am not sure . it 's true that tecnologhy are growing very rapidly , but 20 year ago we said that today we could have car with no pullution and that we cuold fly with them . i belive in our study , and i am sure that something are changing . now we are looking at hydrogen like only solution for a pollution dicrease , but maybe tomorrow we can find something different . i think that the only way to have le car in use is the introduction of a new tax to enter in the city and a good service of bus and train in the city . italin people are not able to reach the work place without their car and , i think a lot of people all over the world want their indipendent and to be free to go wherever they want . today we are about 5.000.000.000 people but in twenty year how many are we ? how many car will be ? if we grow up we need more transport and more car . now all the car are moved by gasoline , but is it price good and is it disponibility enought ? maybe only solution to cut the car number is the end of the gasoline or a price so high that nobody can buy it . some study say that the gasoline price reach in italy on 2007 like a 1 , 80 euro for l , and if we think about mind salary it is easy to see how is difficult drive our car . however i think that will be very strange if in twenty year will be fewer car in use but if we learn to go in 2 or more people with one car maybe could happen .
