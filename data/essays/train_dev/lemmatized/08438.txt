i agree totaly with this statement , actualy the most richer people in the world and the biggest manager are person who ha taken risk in their life to become what they are today . often people are afraid to do thing that go out of ordinary because that may be doe not work and they can find their self with no job any more , no money , they con become a person who is out of the socity and rejected . sometimes i think it is better to listen to our heart and to belives in our self and in our capacity and in our imagination and ability to create because we can be able to succeed even if there are risk to take , who 's know we may be able to do so much extraordinary thing if only we were more bravious ! in a other side i think that a person who is always doing the same thing at work all his life is not happy , it is such borring to repeat the same thing more and more , why ca n't we just blow all thease ennoying work away and realising our dream ? we most not forgive that we have just one life in this earth so we mo i take the exemple of bill gate who is very famous . bill gate when he wa at the bigining of his cereer took the risk to put a new conception of way to use computer on the market of pc , a totaly new project . others thought he wa a fool but he succeded and today every body use his logiciel , every one know microsoft 's logiciels , he is every where !
