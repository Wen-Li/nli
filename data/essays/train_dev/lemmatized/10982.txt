i totally agree with the statement that ` it is more important for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact . ' ideas and concept are quintessential for the development of understanding , propagation of thought and enrichment of student . there is a very strong relation and link that exists between learning of concept and the idea that lead to these concept , or how the idea are generated and are derived from a particular concept . all this form the very basis of knowledge and understanding . mere learning of fact without a background would be a futile an activity a dividing a number by zero . for student or for any learner for that matter , what matter the most is a strong foundation that lie in conceptual knowledge . only if the student ha the basic right , he can go on and challenge a plethora of theory or formulate hypothesis , proceed towards solving challenging problem , look at thing from different perspective , analyse situation and , may be , develop his own viewpoint on it . learning concept , idea and also the interrelation between the two , lead a student to build up a knowledge that is relevant or can be definitely counted on . take for instance in mathemetics if a student know the fact that 2 plus 2 is 4 , but doe not know how to determine it , the fact would be of no avail . similarly if a student of chemistry know that water is formed by hydrogen and oxygen , but doe not understand how the process ha taken place the fact will be a non progressive one . same go for other subject a well . hence , it is absolutely necessary for a student to understand the concept and idea and then , if necesary , proceed towards the fact .
