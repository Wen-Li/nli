it 's such a commen phenomenon , esparcially to the people who live in the prospers urban area , that large number of car in the road sometimes cause the heavy traffiic disabled . however , i can say with confidence , even someone may argues , that the trouble will disappers eventually . my reasones go a follows . firstly , a we all know , the technology develops in such a rapid speed , that it 's a rule that the thing which are not suitable for future will be replaced by others . the car is a good example to this point , no doubt , the car will be , or in near futrue , replaced due to their drawback , such a the toxin air that they release , the big noise the car produce , a well a it consumption of the gasoline , all of these fatal factor demonstrate that the car are not suitable for our futrue , both of enviroment and our people 's health . in addition , it 's a fact that the price of gasoline increase in a much grater pace than anytime in history . however , the gasoline , which is the essencial `` food '' of car , is none-reproduced resource , which mean that the future of car ha been determined , due to the limitation of it oil resourse , the number of car ha to be dropped . and what 's more , just image what would be like if more and more people buy car when accompanied by the quality of people 's live ha become more and more better . it will be a desaster for u if everyone can afford to buy a car , and put it into effect . based on these reason , in twenty year , there will be fewer car in use , all of the factor contribute the useless of car in future , the problem of replacment of car , it is only the problem of time , not the problem whether it will occur or not .
