being a young person i believe that in today 's professional world young people do not give enough time to helping their community , a they prefer their profesional life ha a dominant role in their life . now day life is getting very professional a compared to earlier day . earlier , people use to work till the evening and after that they go somewhere around with their friend , parent , family but now day the work pressure is so much that they dont have time to even take a proper sleep . according to the recent survey working people especially aged between 23 to 40 could not sleep for even 8 hour a day which the doctor advice one should atleast sleep in a day . earlier people treated temple and church a the place where they believed that god life and they can be relaxed and make themselves calm but nowdays people treat those holy place a a picnic spot where they can go with their child and enjoy . nobody want to work like mahatma gandhi . there are many ngo 's which are working for the welfare of the community but no one join them rather no young person join them , you can find most of the retired person who are working there a an officer because they dont pay you much . today young people want to achieve the higher goal a to earn more money . higher they will go in their company higher the remuneration willl be . for eg.an employee of a company can work there for 18 hour in a day but if he is being asked to work for a ngo or any social community then he will definately say big no to it a it will not be higly payable a he is getting in the company after considering all the fact i believe that young people want their life to be the most succesful professionally not for the welfare of the community in which they live in .
