the number of car is a problem nowadays . it 's a problem because reserve of petrole are going to be smaller and smaller and because of thism the price of petrole is growing and growing . nowadays , the environmental question is very popular in european country and car are considered a a very bad element for the environment 's health . so , in my opinion , in twenty year , the number of car in europe , japan and united states will be lower . but , in my opinion , car will be fewer in twenty year than today in developping country ( in poorer country ) like african country or south american country because for them , car still a very important element fort the economy growth . people of those country use a lot their car in order to go to their job whereas , in country which are already developped and rich , people used to take the subway , bus and the tramway . but , because the poorer polution represent a big part of the worldwide population , if all those people are going to have a car , the wodldwide nu ; ner of car will dra ; atically grow . there is also the problem of the lobbying . the car lobbying is very i ; portant in the unites states of america so , they will not allow the american government to make a law about the number of car per family . so if some people would like to make the nu ; ber of car smaller , they will be in conflict with politician and the lobbying . in ; y opinion , in twenty year , there will be a terrible struggle between the environmental proctectors and car constructor ( general motors , ford , vw . .. ) . i 'm very sure that green peace will be a more and more important organisation because who doe n't want to take care of our environment ? in my opinion , the number of car can be also smaller in twenty year because circulation 's problem are terrible in big city such a paris or nyc . that 's why nowadays , car are forbidden in the center of london . because of this interdiction , i 'm very sure that a big part of londonian sell their car and did n't buy a new one . cars become useless in london . i heard also that paris would like to make the same . is n't that an evidence of the fact that the number of car in europe is going to be smaller . as a conclusion , we cam say that in some part of the world , in twenty year , car will be fewers but in an other part , their number is going to be le important .
