the statement of quality of product is a complex and controversial issue . while some people argue that advertisments do n't give the real quality of product , other people think that they know what they buy . so , advertisement can not influenced their choice . both perspective are importants , but overall , i desagree with the statement that advertising influence my choice . my point of view is important because we overall know the differents product we use for ourselves . as an example , when you want to buy a car , you use specific information about the type of car you want and do n't follow necessarily advertising provide by any car company . secondly , advertisement are not firstly directed to influence the choice of custommers . it is highly used by company for settle their leadership ( best selling ) . this can be illustrated by the fact that when someone want a specific car , he ha the choice between sometimes more than one company . some people can object that , young boy are mostly influence by advertising . this objection can be countered by the fact that they are not responsible for their purchase . when they want something , they ask their parent to buy it for them . and overall , the parent do n't follow thre desire of their child because they know what is important for them or not . while the issue of quality of product must be considered carefully , the fact that we know what we want compoumded with the object of the company to settle at a leadership place produce convincing why i desagree whith the following statemement : ** most advertisement make product seem much better than they really are **
