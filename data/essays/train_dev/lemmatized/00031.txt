succesful people always try to do new thing this is like a habit for them . when somebody commonly journalist ask about this subject , they always answer with similar reason such a for public acclaim or everybody wait new thing from them or just for feeling . here i want to share my idea about this subject . first of all , generally successful singer or artist have this kind of problem . they have to do diferent thing every film or album . if they do not do this , their fun can loose their interest to them . therefore this is the starting to ending for them . when they loose their admireing image , they will be nobody like ordinary people . for ` nstance old movie star we do not remember most of them know and their star do not rising . secondly , i think to be successful is a habit for successful people due to the fact that they akways follow success . for example , some of the well known businessmen are always try to produce and sale new thing . this is like a habit for them such a nokia , they alwat produce new generatin phone and sale to society . they always need to top of the mountain . they can not accept to be second . finally , if somebody being a success , all society waited new thing from them . this not only their aspect but also our responcibility too , in conclusion , successful people addicted to success , this is not always good for them . sometimes they feel unhappy . although , if they do not have this addiction , we could not establish much more .
