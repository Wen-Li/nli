for the most student it is most important to understand concept and idea . to learn fact is not so important for them . i think if they understand what the concept and idea are about it can be more useful for them . because if they understand the main idea of something they can also use it on other topic . for example if they understand how the human mechanism work they maybe also compare this with animal mechanism which are in some kind like the human . so if they only learn fact about the human mechanism they can not compare it with other mechanism . and if student only learn the fact they may not understand them . this is a disadvantage if they for example need to compare the fact with another situation . so something like this would be more easily if the person really understand the topic . therefor i can understand the student who say that it is more important to understand the concept than learn fact . another point is that the student need not learn so much if they understand the main idea of something and maybe have learnt to compare this with other theme or situation . but it is also important to know different fact about the concept and not only understand their meaning . because the more fact someone know the more can this person explain the idea and the more easily he can compare it with other thing . so i agree with the student but alsoi think it is very complicated to say what is more important maybe it is the solution of any single person . the one are better in learning fact because they find it very diffecult to understand an idea without the whole fact about it . the other person for example can understand every concept without problem . the third person may not understand the idea at first but think understandig it is more important than knowing everything about it .
