i think it 's more important for student to understand idea and concept instead of learning fact . first of all if you want to understand idea and concept you have to do a lot of research . for example galileo galilei had do a lot of research before he understood that the earth is not flat and is instead a ball . it took him about twenty year . for normal student to understand some physic problem , we have to do also a lot of research in our book or on the internet . if you start doing research it give you the opportunity do think about the idea and learn something about it . another reason why i think it 's more important to understand idea then fact is , that fact sometimes sem really clear . we know for a fact that adolf hitler killed himself . if you would study the fact you woul study only his dead . instead if you are studyieng idea and concept , you will learn why he killed himself and why he all did this . for me a fact is something short wich we do n't have to study , but an idea or a concept is something big you need to do some research on . finally , if you are learning to understand the idea and concept you can use your study in live . if you studied the idea how a car is working you can work at a carshop and repair car , but if you only learnend the fact that car have a motor you will be not able to build a car . when you study to understand idea and concept you learn way more about life , then if you just study fact . facts do n't give the background were you can ask `` why '' . a fact is a fact and nothing change about that , but you can discus about an idea or concept .
