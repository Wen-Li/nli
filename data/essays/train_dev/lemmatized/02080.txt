if everyone had a car in this world there will be no place for u to live in . i will agree with the statement . the world is making it harder for everyone to get a car or even own one . the improved public transport is another alternitave for transportaion . those are some sign car are going down . the car now are very expensive to buy one . a middle income peoson will have to pay more than half his income to get a car . the expense wont stop there you will have to pay also for the gas . the maintance of it . even to park your car you will have to pay for it . anothr hassling problem is the traffic on the road and no one is doing anything about it . in a couple of year i think very few people will afforad to buy gas since they oil prics are going up so fast . some good sign that the car will go away . first you have the improved public transport , train , metro , and bus . which will cover up the need for people transportation . since almost eveyone life in a city and everything is close togther . also another thing that ha a sign car will go away is all these anti pollution group and the hard reglations in some country regarding the emssions . in conclusion , it wil be nice if the number of car go down . that will mean le car accident and le injuired or dead people from reckless driver . the will be a little cleaner not that much becase of the other factory . with all the technology going around u and the good public transport . i would say there is a very big chance the number of car will go down dramctilly .
