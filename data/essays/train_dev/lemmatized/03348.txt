i do not agree on this statement . i do not think it is best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide . there are a lot of way to travel in our life . for example , to travel alone , to do with your friend or family , and packed tour with stranger ( such a way in the statement ) . in various way , if i could travel anywhere , i would like to travel alone . it is best for me not to mind others even if it is my family , friend or boy friend . when you walk with someone , you should catch up with him or her . and , fllowing , you can not the thing you want to look if you have something you want . it is too unpleaseant for me . so , when i want to buy something , i will go shopping alone . this is same in case of travel . i want to go place i want . if someone and me want to go to same place , maybe i will concider well . on oppsition , the demerit that i thought when you travel in a group led by a tour guide . it is semilar to the case of my former reason that i do not go shopping with someone . a tour guide always can provide with a satisfied content to each u . a big tour can not response to each need of each customer . it is problem for me .
