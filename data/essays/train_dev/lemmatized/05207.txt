the education system ha always been a very critical discussion issue for all society . some society have favoured student to specialise in only a few subject from the early age whereas other society have favoured student to have a broad knowledge of almost many academic subject until the very last year in their education period . there are pro and con to both approach . as in turkey ; we tend to cramp student ' brain with so much detailed and technical information from the very early age that they start memorising and when the exam are over they can remember very little of what they learned . although it is quite acceptable that they learn a lot about almost any subject matter how much of the information they can use later on in life is definitely debatable . on the other hand in country like uk child start specialising around the 5th year in secondary schooling . this system allows a student to allocate time only to his selected subject and prevents the student from allocating time for subject that he is not interested in . the student in uk select 5 or 6 subject they are interested in pursuing in further year and after they take exam based on those previously selected subject they get qualified to select 2 or 3 subject out of them which will if they are successfull eventually enable them to gain an entry to a faculty that they want . as they already have a solid background before they start university the university also benefit from this . universities in uk donot have to reeducate student for the class they have to take in the university a turkish universities have to accomplish these day . as a conclusion i would definitely support a uk like system where a student can specialise in fewer subject . on the other hand it is also true that an education system should be able to make up for the culture gap student are experiencing with their own history literature culture etc in order to generate godd enough society . ps sorry i couldnot locate where the comma is on this keyboard so i could not place comma where they should be placed
