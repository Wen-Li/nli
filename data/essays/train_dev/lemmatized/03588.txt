will there be fewer car in twenty year from now ? my instant reply is no , and mainly because i realize how our technology are rapidly advancing , and car will change , changing only to make people love them more , satisfying urge for beautiful car model , creating more desire to own one . looking back into the past since car were first invented , there 's a huge big difference of how much car are own . compared to before when only the rich owns car , car nowadays are getting cheaper in price , considering the amount of second-hand car being sold and how cheap it is to buy one . as time pas , the rich will continue to buy more car and selling their old one , and at the same time , the lower class will buy these used car for a cheaper price . with this cycle going on , more and more people will be owning car rather than selling them . and why are the rich buying more and more car ? generally it 's because of the constant change in the car technology ; the desire of speed and unique design . a stereotype view of rich people are people who buy car just because of it look . car company looking at this , will exploit this point by coming up with more and more uniquely designed car . there 's a rare chance rich people will disappear and their interest in buying these car decrease . on the other hand , there 'll always be the lower class people who are ready to buy these used car at a lower price . most of the people want to own a car , and in my opinion , this is a psychological desire ; jealousy . when a person see another person with something they do not have , that person will also want a car . when a rich guy see his friend with a really groovy car , he will also want a unique car of his own . there 're always more generation joining u and with this cycle of jealousy and how the car price fall , it 'll be easier for people to own car . conclusionally , i 'd say that in twenty year , or even fifty year , the amount of car usage will only increase but not decrease . unless something better than car join this market and successfully grab car buyer ' attention .
