it is of course crucial that student understand first of all idea and concept ; one can not build a genuine knowledge of literature for example , if one doe not understand notion like romanticism , modernism , post-modernism , etc . .. these notion are a great help to understand and define similarity between writer ( or their difference ) , and it allows the student to categorize them , and to see if these category really fit them or if they can be challenged . the purpose of these big concept is to create category , type , which provide landmark for the student . if we think of history , it is impossible to understand the history of the xxth century without being able to define and understand major concept such a facism , communism , capitalism , or feminism , since all these concept are significant of a certain era , and of certain way of thinking . however , understanding concept and idea is useless if the student is unable to relate them to actual fact ; indeed , it is difficult to write an essay on the evolution of the feminist movement in a given time period if the only thing the student remembers is the definition of feminism . one need fact to support one 's point , and what is more , the student will not be able to handle the notion easily if he ha no actual fact to relate them to , and to clarify his or her point . facts are often very useful to understand better the concept , and they also allow u to illustrate our point . in this perspective , a teacher will rely on fact to illustrate or prove his or her point ; it is easier to convey the meaning of a given concept through an illustration , and it is also easier to remember for the student , especially if the example given is shocking , or amusing . a mere knowledge of the general concept and idea would be too restrictive , and would result in a superficial knowledge , which is not very useful in the end . on the other hand , a good mastery of both concept and fact will allow the student to have in-depth knowledge , which is the most important . in that sense , it is impossible to focus only on the general idea and to leave out the fact .
