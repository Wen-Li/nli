i personally agree with the statment about the advertisement , which say `` most advertisement make product seem much better than they really are . '' as time go , the number of the firm in the market is constantly incresing , and those firm are competing with one another in order to survive in the market . since they want consumer to buy their product , they are making so many creative advertisement . that is why there are flooding advertisement in the newpaper or television . but i think it is unfortunately true that the new copy advertisement thesedays are more like alluring the consumer eye , preventing the consumer from making the right decision , a they are losing their originally meaning which is providing the usefull information . as other consumer of the modern society , i have experienced it in so many way in my everyday life . when i wa in the primary school , i dreamed about having the human-sized barbie doll . my desire wa basically coming from the advertisement in which a girl and a huge barbie doll were dancing together and putting makeup on each others face . the advertisement wa saying that the barbie doll can play with a little girl , moving however the girl wished it to move . since i did not have any sister , i really wished i could have had such a doll with which i could dance and play . of course i did not think about the exaggeration of the advetisements , neither did my mother . one day my mom ened up buying me that huge doll , but i could not do anything i imagined i could do with the doll . the overall advetisement wa exaggerating , and the doll wa not even be able to stand by itself . relatively , my disappointment wa great . not only a a consumer , i experienced the exaggeration of the advertisement but also a a producer . when i wa in middle school , the student government where i belonged to desperatively needed money for the upcoming school festival . so we decided to sell some toy which we purchased from the local dollor tree . but later on , i wa greatly disappointed at the school student government when i witnessed the exaggerating advertisement copy we had to make , because none of the copy wa hesitating to mention that the toy were from the luxiourious toystore , which wa not true . from my experience , i learned that the copy of the advertisement is hardly revealing the truth . i think it is quite understandable becuase i know how hard it is to sell something for a seller while it is competing with other seller . but i still can not agree with that one can buy something only considering what the advertisement say , because i know the advertisement is relatively supposed to be quite exaggerating .
