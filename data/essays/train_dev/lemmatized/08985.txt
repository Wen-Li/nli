i dont agree to the topic given to me that young people enjoy life more than older people do . this is because , enjoyment is a vague term and there is no unique way of measuring enjoyment . the defination of enjoyment change from person to person . i ca n't take a firm stand and state that young people enjoy their life more than older people do . lets take my own example . as a young guy , i love playing sport , freaking out with my friend , going on an adventurous trip , listening to music etc . i enjoy myself when i involve in these activity . this is enjoyment for me . lets take the example of my grandfather . he is not in a position to do all that i can do , but that doe n't mean that he doe not enjoy life or enjoys le than i do . he enjoys the serenity of the place he life in , he enjoys playing with u and also enjoys spending quality time with our family . this is the meaning of enjoyment for him . what i really ca n't do is to measure his degree of enjoyment and compare it with mine . the defination of enjoyment might also change when i take an example of an other old man or an other young guy . lets consider an other old man who is fully fit and is in a position to indulge in all the activity that i really enjoy . though , the old man might not perform to the same level a i can but there is a possibility that he might enjoy doing the same . even in this case , measuring his degree of enjoyment and comparing it with mine is not possible . lets take the example of an other young guy who defines enjoyment a attaining success in his desired field of study . he might enjoy each and every step that is involved in making him a successful person . the same activity can be done by an old man but he might define enjoyment in a different way . he might enjoy only by reading the same and not having any sort of concern towards the result of such a study . i conclude my essay by saying that the term enjoyment is very vague and it difficult for me to take a firm stand on who enjoys more until and unless i am provided with a method or a formula that measure the degree of enjoyment for each and every individual .
