the issue of whether or not to travel in a group led by a tour guide is controversial . some people think that a guide is important to lead them to the most popular place . others believe they can travel by themselves without the help of a guide . in fact , i agree that people do n't really need to travel in group led by tour guide due to two basic reason . cearly , traveling in a group led by a tour guide impose many restriction . everybody need to be prompt . in case of an emergency or lateness , people might lose one whole day becasue the guide wo n't be waiting for them . they need to manage themselves usually staying in the hotel watching television . this might cause alot of inconvenience , such a getting bored . instead , people traveling without being restricted by a group , can take their time to do what they want . for example , they will take the needed time to sleep and rest . furthermore , they would have the option of changing their destination whenever they want . for intance , if they planned on going to disney land then knew about another place , they wo n't hesitate a minute to change their plan . truely , the tour guide will have greater knowledge about the most tourist visited place . this doe n't mean that people traveling alone do n't know where they 're going . there are many resource available to people , where they know the wonderful place in a specific country . for instance , people can surfe the internet or visit agency . these place provide almost all what is needed to know . evidently , people traveling in group face many problem that lead to vacation ruining . on the other hand , traveling alone doe n't mean being lost . yet , it mean having more relaxation , time and opinion .
