what kind of people do you like ? in my case , i tend to be interested in the people who try new thing and take risk . i think that i also like the people who is doing only same thing to know how to do well , however i really like the people who try new thing . therefore i agree with the idea that successful people try new thing and take risk rather than only doing what they already know how to do well . first of all , i really like challenger for new thing , because i think that challenger will give me a comfortable life . for example , when i lived in japan , i often watched a tv program which is some people try to invent new technology . i love the tv program , because some inventor had been studied some difficult new technology , finally they invented the technology , for example , dvd , microchip and so on . thanks to the invents , our life are getting better than before . if the inventor had n't tried that invents , our life would have n't been convenient . therefore i think that such people are very important . moreover , i really think that a challenge spirit will give u encouragement . for example , when i worked for a bank , there is a very good salesman in the bank . he wa very famous for a loan officer , and then he often got the best sale award . however , one day he suddenly quit our bank , and he established a business consaltant company . many banker in our bank were surprised , because if he continued to work the bank , he would be a president . however he quit . he said that he want to try new own business without our bank 's name value . after he quit our bank , i wa really encouraged from him . as a result i also quit the bank , and i tried to get an mba in the usa . even though we are doing very well , i really think that challenge spirit is very important for our life and our mental . if we did n't try new thing , our life would n't improve and our own ability and possibility would n't broad . i think that even if we take a risk , we should try something . therefore i agree wiht the idea that successful people try new thing and take risk rather than only doing well .
