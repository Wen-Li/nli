i agree this topic ; young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their community . first , i think now is information society . they have a lot of thing to do . now there are many kind of material . for example , internet , tv game , and mobile phone . they constrate their thing . internet , tv game are very fun more than to helping their community . second , i think now is individual society . people are selfish . current 's people are very busy . i think ancient age 's time more slowly . people must do something everyday . they do n't have sufficient free time . especially , yong people must go to school , study hard to take high level education . third , i think they want to helping their community , however , they do n't know how to care about community . now , they do n't have many brother or sister . and , they were playing indoor . i think they do n't know how to communication another people . however , they want to take care about community . but they are very shy . their mind is very beautiful , they only do n't have encourage . i think they do n't have enough time to helping their community . young people must think their community . human can think about another people .
