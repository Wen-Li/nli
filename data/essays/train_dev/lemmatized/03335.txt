i totally agree with the statement espically these dayes in denguras place . we have a proverb which say '' travel with a guide better than travel with your wife '' . a guide know where he is going and he know every thing bad and good in the city . that is his job . if you go to affrica or some country you need to be with a group and a ture guide because they have alot of culture . this person will take you to place you will nevrer go to it by your self or even by a person who lived at the same area because the guide know how can schedual your time and how can mak the trip to be perfest . i can give you example happend to me i went to china with my father for a bussniss and he know some chine tooke u in a trip . it wa wonderful . i went there again but this time i went alone in 2005 . i tooke a guide to show me the rigon it wa different because i went with a profitional guy . the other reson ther is alot of cauntries do not speak your language or english too a yamen and alot of area from africa . it is hard to talke with them and you can not connect with them to know some information . that happened to me in china the firest time when i went with my father the guy who wa with u . he can bearly speak english so i did not get alot information from him but when i went with the profitional guy i knew alot about history and cultuer of china . finally i want to say if you travel , you shoud take a guide and to be with a group to share you information togather and make frinds from different country . in conclosion , group or guide will help you to know alot about the country .
