from my personal experience and those of people around me , i strongly disagree with the opinion that `` young people enjoy life more than older people do '' . first of all , in order for one to really enjoy something , such a life or any kind of sport , he/she must first know what it truly is . when people say that they really enjoy doing something the first time they are doing it , what they really mean is that they like , rather than enjoy , doing it . when people getting older , they see the rise and down of the life , and they have a better idea about what life is and what the most important thing is in their life . i think such a deep understanding about the life is exactly the prerequisite for anyone to enjoy it . after all , how can one really enjoy something when he ha little or no ideaabout it ? secondly , when people become older , they have more thing to appreciate and enjoy . for example , family might mean much le for a young man than going to the party and hangging out with friend . however , a people mature , they see their responsiblities they owe to people around them and those they love and cherish . they could still go out to the party and play with friend , but they also have some truly enjoyable thing that most young people do not know to appreciate , such a family . certainly , there are many interesting thing that can said to be franchise to young people . for example , while many youngster are fascianted about the extreme sport , there are a significantly lower percentage of older people who would dare to try . their health condition might not allow them a well . in conclusion , i disgree with the assertion that young people enjoy life more than older people do . i believe that the following modification would be more appropriate : `` young peple experience life , but older people enjoy life .
