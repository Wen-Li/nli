cars can be directly linked to energy and pollution . which mean that by using car , we improve the air pollution . but it only concern the action of the consumer , a far a the producer are concerned , it is more obvious . this industrial activity is pointed out by every environmental association even if huge firm such a general motors are concerned . this pressure is part of the fight for the decrease of the use of car and of pollutant in general . pollution , it effect on earth , people who fight against the development of car activity and the new mean of substition which are created to replace the mean of travelling are they not way to make car disappear . the natural resource which are used to make a car drive is petrol . the recent financial event underline the fact that this product is harder to get and more expensive above all . it is necessary to find other carburants for example natural oil . but it is forbidden in a lot of industrialised country and the need would very important , it is not sure that every car could be provided with this element . instead of finding other resource to supply the car chain , it may be interesting to find other way of travelling . moreover these way already exist . bus , subway , even plane are mean of travelling which can be used in a lot of area . some government tend to develop these collective way of transport . in france especially in paris , for example , they are some day when people are not allowed to use their car in town . according to me this kind of action have several impact . it reduces pollution in town , but it also make the population aware that there is no need for a car in day to day life . for all these reason i think that car will not completely disappear in twenty year , but there will be different mean of travelling and certainly more ecological way of using car .
