in my opinion it is better to have a broad knowledge of various academic subject than to spealize in one specific subject . in our childhood a child we will be interested in different subject . even in our school we read a wide range of academic subject because all are essential in our life a we grow up . specialization in one subject will not help u to do whatever we want and to achieve pinnacle of success . we need different subject such a mathematics , history , physic , chemistry , literature and many other subject in our day to day life . without one subject also we cant proceed . for exampleif i do specialization in physic and donot know other subject at all then there is no meaning to my interest at all . i need to literature when i hav to converse with people and for counting money and all i must know math . so each and every subject is interlinked with each other . it also make studying easier by doing different subject rather than sitting with one subject . with the knowledge of different academic subject we can achieve immense knowlendge in various stream . we will be aware of the worldly progress and new invention or discovery . even the great scientist of the world had an idea of the different subject . for example marie curie discovered the effect of radioac tive substance and the cure for the cancer . its soleley not chemistry which she applied in the discovery . there is a lot of physic and math also involved in it . there are many advantage of knowing different subject . some people do specialization in art , literature , etc.but they should be aware of other subject . learnind different subject will include a lot of curiosity and general knowledge of a person . it will motivate an individual to adopt innovative thinking and to get exposed to the world . so i conclude by telling that there are many advantage of having a knowledge of different subject rather than a single boring subject .
