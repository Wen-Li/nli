i agree with the viewpoint that there will be fewer car in use than there are today . there are many reason to prove my viewpoint . one of the main reason for fewer car in use in future may be the crude price . crude price are increasing day by day which result increase in petrol and diesel price . increase price will affect the use of the car because it might be very difficult for normal person to cope up wit increase price . there is lot of demand for crude and a it is non renewable source , it is going to become expensive in coming future . increase in petroleum product have major impact on sale of car . other reason may be increase in traffic due to high number of car sale . people may get frustrated because of traffic and may prefer using public transport rather than car . for e.g most people working in london city travel by train because it is more convinient for them to use train rather than car . it will be more cheaper for people to use public transport rather than using a car . even government is trying to improve public transport which result in more convenience to people . in future may be price of car may rise due to increase in raw material for making a car . to compensate with the increase price of raw material , company ha to increase price of the final product , so this increase in price is passed on to customer which may resist customer to buy new car . increase in pollution due to burning of fuel in car may push government to impose new law which may add additional cost to customer and they may get reluctant to buy new car . so , in summary there will be fewer car in use in future than today . neways it is very difficult to predict a future but according to me car sale will have negative effect because of the reason that i have mentioned above .
