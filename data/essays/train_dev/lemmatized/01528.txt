a broad knowledge of many academic subject would provide breadth of knowledge . as against this , specialization in one specific subject would provide depth of knowledge . in my opinion , a person should obtain a broad knowledge of many academic subject while pursuing undergraduate study and must specialize in one specific subject while pursuing post graduate study . undergraduate study are generally undertaken by student in the formative year of their life . if at this crucial juncture , a student is not given an opportunity to explore a variety of area , his learning process may be stinted . if a student is encouraged to study many academic subject , he will be able to decide his area of interest . further , he will understand the interdependence and interrelatedness of different academic subject . pursuing many academic subject would help the student to obtain a functional knowledge in all the subject he study . such a strategy would prove to be useful a the student will have flexibility of choice , when it come to choosing his subject of specialisation . for example if a student is pursuing graduation in finance , by studying banking , corporate finance and equity research , he will get a functional knowledge of all the area in finance . he may choose course in banking or equity research while pursuing his post graduate study . post graduate study are undertaken by student who have completed their graduate course . post graduate study equip a student with specific skill that the student will need , when he seek employment . a person can not be `` a jack of all trade , but a master of none '' . hence it is advisable for a student to choose one specific subject of his liking and specialize in it . this would help him acquire expertise and mastery over one specific subject . if a student were to study only one course in his undergraduate study , say for example corporate finance , he may not be able to understand the effect of banking on corporate finance . on the contrary , if the student ha dwelved in corporate finance and banking in his undergraduate study , he will be able to correlate the impact that banking ha on corporate finance . thus , in my opinion , a person should follow an approach , whereby broad knowledge of many academic subject is obtained in undergraduate study and expert knowledge in one specific subject is obtained in post graduate study .
