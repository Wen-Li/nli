` modernization and globalization ' accompined with uncontrolled development lead to energy crisis and lack of resource in coming twenty century . i agree with the statement a definitely this rapid growth would result in adverse effect on car availability in coming twenty year . though somemay disagree to hold number will increase a big boom in market and rapid industralization . the most important concept of holding the statement a it population is increasing tremendousaly day by day and demand is also high compare to production . there is concern about to fulfill their demand lead to more car but also lead to traffic , noice problem . as today everyone believe in comfort life , good standard of living by using car . nobody is concerning about the result of these would lead to energy crisis . the pertroleum resource are vanishing day by day , and one there would be car but no oil , which is life of engine . similarly , as the cost of crude oil we purchasing from gulf country increasing rapidly . this mean that in near future it is not affordable to country to rely on it , so automatically it is warn signal to automobile industry like , tata motor , bajaa , honda to think and to take appropriate action . however , some believe the fact is wrong . they hold the opinion that nothing will happen a we have technology , talent to find alternative energy source like bio-diesel , bio-cells , cng . therefore i strongly believe that the number of car will reduce drastically in coming tweenty year because of modernization , rapid growth , population and pollution and energy crisis . but i suggest that we should develop some alternative to maintain growth , to focus on biodiesel to run car .
