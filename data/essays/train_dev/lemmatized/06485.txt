in my opinion , i disagree the statement that say the young people enjoy life more than older people . by contarst i think that both young people and older people enjoy their life for the following reason . first , although not a much a older people can be seen on the street doing stuff outside , they have their own activties to do indoor . such a reading novel , newspaper , watching tv , sewing . and other older people may go outdoor for several time to exercise their body in order to be healthy and live longer to enjoy more life . moreover , the young people generally are still study in school or university . so they can enjoy their life by studying in class and some activtes held in campus . for example many student join club after school like tennis club , football team , piano club , drawing or whatever . also there may be party to celebrate some festervial such a christmas , halloween . in my school , the party were always full of student and teacher to enjoy . furthermore , the young people sometime also enjoy life with older people . for instace , the grandfather go to the park with his grandson in weekend . both of them can play happily with each other . or even the whole family go out for a trip is a typically event that reveal young people enjoy life with older people . although some of the older people have no ablity to enjoy the life , they have to stay in the hospital , some young people do this too . however , everyone should enjoy their own life whenever and wherever by every kind of method to make their life better and meaningful . all in all , nowadays older people and young people enjoy their life in the way they like . even though we can not see both side in one time , we shall observe their life carefully so that we can find both of them are all enjoy the life .
