i definitely do not agree with this statement . according to me , understanding idea and learnig from fact have the same importance . let 's take for example foreing language teaching . it is self-understandind that first of all is required a base , something a student can rely on to move in his `` foreing environnment '' , for this reason teaching grammar , verb , preposition and so on is very important , but these thing have to put into practice . this practice can not only be small speaches between student and teacher an between the student . in my experience , i 've always preferred to be alone , in a foret \ ing country with no one around who speaks my same language . this is the only way to learn a foreing language the proper way , to put into practice what you learned in class . i can give another example ; some italian highschool that have the purpose to teach language a a second language , spend two over five year to teach grammar and the remaining three on literature . of course this is important , it 's only through book you can deeply understand the way people think . but this is not enough , once an italian student finish highschool , he is able to talk only about literature , sometimes he ai n't able neither to order a meal at the restaurant . this is the reason why i think foreing language teaching should be `` both-side '' . on one of ` em you give student the basic , then you encourage ` em to use these teaching : maybe school could organize period when a student go abroad to work an live , so he/she can really be able to rely on himself , and not only on his way of speaking . school ha to be tha chance to grow , not only a a student , but also a men and woman . this is the reason why i think understanding idea and learning from fact have the same importance .
