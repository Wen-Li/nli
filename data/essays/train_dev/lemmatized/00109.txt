i definitely disagree with the statement because , if we look at the present growth rate of car in use , i think we could realize that we will face a substantial increase in number in the future and therefore also in twenty year the number will be higher than today . it is possible to explain my position with my following consideration . developed countries like the united states , the majority of european countries together with japan are experiencing constant demand of car since more and more people are becoming independent and therefore need a car for going to work , for their spare time spent in travelling , reaching other people to different place . if we also think that developing countries like india , china and maybe some eastern european countries and some south american countries are facing an important positive change in their growing economy , we can infer that a lot of more people will feel the necessity of a car for everyday trip . moreover we can consider that car have become a symbol other than a mean of transportation in the last year , especially for some wealthy society . this situation can be seen at the same way for the developing countries in a few decade , therefore this can be a sign to support my disagree with the statement . my thought is also supported by a holiday trip i made in april this year , when i went to california in the united states . when i wa there i realized that more than in italy people need a car , because of the long distance and because of the fact that they live independently from their family . since the united states have a very advanced economy and the other countries are going into that direction , i presume that even the developing countries will face that economic evolution step . in conclusion i think that the number of car will increase in the future due to the fact that can be related a a consequence and a step of the growing process of the economy of a country .
