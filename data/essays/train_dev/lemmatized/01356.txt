the realm of age bettween people have always fascinated me . thinking on how and when we enjoy life is interestign and difficult too . i do not agree young people enjoy life more than older people do . for a long a a remember , i used to enjoy life when i wa fourteen the same way i do now . i mean , the year pas by , and time go on , but we still being enjoing it in different way . must of this depens on how we see life and what are we expecting four it . for example some week ago , i wa talking with my grandfather about his early year in college . he told about his affair and adventure during that time , but later the talk came deep and he talked me about his present . he told me about how his fighting against cancer , and how tha make him feel , how hard he is triying to keep waking up each day . i wa hearing him , not feeling comfotableand with the situation and intrigated with his future . but suddenly , he reach my hand and told me how fascinated he wa with bad time too . he told me how bad situation can help u enjoy good one , son every partor age is enjoylable . today , after that talk with the old man , i knew we all enjoy life the same way , even we are younguer or older . all depends on how we aprroach to it and built it . so , finally i just can say that im hoping to know tomorrow , how wa that i enjoyed life in all different way . and keep specting the good thing and the bad thing to happen for me and the others , but taking them a the best way i could .
