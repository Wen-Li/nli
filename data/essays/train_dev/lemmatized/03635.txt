` enjoy the yoke in thy youth . .. ' . i do agree with the statement ' young people enjoy life more that older people do ' , a the young are filled with energy , zeal to explore life and find way to have fun and live life to it full extent . life is all about living every second that pass by rather than worrying a to what would happen in the very next second that is yet to arrive . older people on the other hand carry a lot of responsibility on their shoulder , that always tend to worry them every minute , thinking of what best they could do now , to make their future secure and this keep them away from enjoying life . however by proper planning and spending time in understanding self can lead to a life that is worth living . young people are always at the verge of making important decision that can influence their life . all the experience they had in their school and college life , living every moment and having fun , would teach them to grow and be a part of the society in future and pas on their legacy to the younger generation .
