i think broad knowledge of many subject is good , but not always . so , i strongly disagree with the statement . i think , in mordern world one should be specific towards the subject , because there is a limitation for human being . a person ca n't be perfect in everything . for example there is a difference between the knowledge of an engineer and a doctor . an engineer can better think about mechanical thing like machine , instrument etc , where a a doctor can have better idea of presentation of human body than an engineer ha . so , a doctor can better manipulate human body . so the knowledge is always limited for both of them . that is why , a person ca n't be a doctor or engineer at a time and ca n't be expert in both the field . among doctor , a general practictioner ha knowledge of human body but are not specialized in purticular area like cardiology , neurology etc . as they have limited knowledge , they refer the patient with cardiac problem to the cardiologist , who always ha better knowledge of heart activity than them . so , a specialist in specific subject is always better . . at last i will say that , due to limitation it is always better for a person to be specialized in a specific subject , because this is the way one can be perfect in the subject , and one can learn deeply about that subject that having little knowledge of many subject . this is the way one can stand in this competetive world with the perfect knowledge in the particular subject , otherwise the person will neither have good knowledge of all the subject nor will be the master in one . this is the way i want to be in future , and would expect the same from others .
