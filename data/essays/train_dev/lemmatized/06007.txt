the humankind always need to education therefore education is the very important aspect of human life to reach high life standard . ideas and concept are most important part of education . some assumed that it is the most important for student to understand idea and concepsts in controray to this some think that the best for the student to learn fact . i totally agree with the first idea . these are my following reason . the first reason for my belief is that , the student must learn the idea first . because the idea are important and also the concept . students must give pay attention the idea and concept than the fact . if a student learn the idea and the concept the student can learn the fact by time . the second reason for my belief is that , the fact are not important exactly . because the idea make the shape to the fact . so the it concept is important so it is related with the idea . if the student learn the idea first he or she can prepare the fact before and he or she can look the fact in different way . this is the important . in the other hand the fact are the important some time to look the object truely . some think and say this student must learn fact first to prevent him or her to the lie . for all these reason i therefore believe that , it is more important for student to understand idea and concept than to learn fact . this idea is related with both give a shape to fact and prepare to the fact before . the long and the short of it is that the idea and the concept are more important than fact . i hope the student do n't disregard what i mentioned !
