in my opinion , i think that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour gide because of several reason . first , some people feel more comfortable with the group because they not alone . second , many people like to leding by a tour guide to show them the place and explain it to them , also the guide usually use the launguge that the people use it in the country that they traveling to , so that the traveler do not have a launguge problem during their trip . finally , some people like to be organize and follow a schuale that they not responsible of it . people will feel comforatable when they travel with a group of other people that probably their first time to see these place too . i belive it will be more intertanments , and make anew frinds . although , it will be many program during the trip that will make it better than lonly trip . many people like to leding by a tour guide to showing them the place , a well to explain it . the tour guide always known the history of the place the the tour will visit it , so that , the tour get more information about the place that they visit , and learning anew stuff about that place . culture , food , clothing , and tradition are the most important issue for the traveling , the tour guide who usually from that place , he is the best one who can explain all these stuff for the group . however , the guide usually know the languge that us in that place , a well the languge of the group , so the traveler do not have any problem that the may face from that issue . finally , many people are organizing and they care too much about the time , so that the like to be a part of a group to organize everything for them . inaddition , traveling is very good thing to learn more about how the other people live .
