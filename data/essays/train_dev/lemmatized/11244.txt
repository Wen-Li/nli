advertisements are made by advertiser that work for producters , it is made to be able to sell or offer a product . do most advertisement make product seem much better than they really are ? i agree that advertisement make their product seem better than they are in real because it is business communiaction . the better way the advertisement is made the more chance the producter will have custumers . for example , advertisement about car always discus about how secure is the car or how cheap it is compare to his concurrents , they explain and show only the positive side of the product and some time they may exagerate it . tv work thanks to advertisement because of the money , it is also a lot of pressure for the the advertiser to make sure the advertisement will have a real impact on the audiance . but the product and his advantage may not be the most important part of it , it is also important the way you make an advertisement , for example , the music , the subject , the people that play in there ... for example , if you want to sell a familial car , you will use specific character such a a family , showing how big is the car to take care kid , luggage ... to conclude , the advertisement is not always based on the product but also how it will affect people that are watching it . to test the product buy it , it might not work a well a it wa it described on tv but it can also be better and more satisfiable than it wa described . people want to buy the product if it most of the time emotionnaly affected them .
