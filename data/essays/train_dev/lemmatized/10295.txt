i disagree with that in twenty year there will be fewer car in use than there are today . many country is developping rapidly now . just like china and india . these two country were not so superior in ecnormics before , but they are developping now . there is a big population in both of the two country . as the country developped , they would be manufact a large number of car for transport or for the citizen 's use . as we all know , china is the biggest bike using country in the world . but now , more and more chinese became to buy car instead of bike . of course so do the people in india . people need car when they want to go to the place not so near to them . and i do n't think the people in well-developped country , just like usa and japan , will stopping using car . people feel inconvenient when they lost something they are used to use . espectially in usa , the usa is so wide that people live in there ca n't leave from car . the car company are trying to make light car which consume le gasoline to antipolution . but none of them stop producing car . they know car are greatly needed by people over the world . maybe you will say that people can take the metro or bus . they are also very convneient . that is ture . and people also can take them in rush hour . but what about weekend ? when we want to go out for a picnic with our family , do you think it is better to take metro than drive the car yoursevles ? of course not ! everybody need the space of himself . so a car is necessary to every family . we can take a metro to go to the workplace , but we ca n't bear do the same thing when we get along with our family or lover . so everybody of u need car . there wo n't be fewer car in use than there are today i think .
