although people specialized in one specific subject have often a better knowledge of it a i do , i prefer to have a broad knowledge of many academic sujects for two main reason . firstly , i believe that a good knowledge on several topic will help me to find more job in very different area . indeed , i am doing engineering study and i like both the automotive and the aeronautic industry . in order to start my first job in one of these industry and to have the possibility to switch to the other one after a few year , it is crucial for me to keep a broad knowledge in both two field . secondly , a broad academic knowledge will help me to better understand the world around me . indeed , even if a strong knowledge would allow me to understand a specific subject more in detail , i think that a broad knowledge will allow me to understand many more subject with a sufficient comprehension of them . a good example can also be taken from my study . i learned fluid mechanic in detail and i only had a short introduction to other subject such a turbomachinery or acousitc . nevertheless , my basic in acoustic were more than sufficient to understand the most common acoustic phenomenon that surronds me in my day-to-day life . i can now easily understand how a speaker or a microphone is working and explain the basic principle to my friend , even if i do not know all the theory in detail . in conclusion , although some student prefer to specialize in one specific subject , i definitely prefer to acquire a broad knowledge on many academic subject . it will help both in my professional life a well a in my life out of the office .
