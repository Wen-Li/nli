people who have broad knowledge of many academic subject are usually considered a intelligent people . why ? most probably because they will be able to have and give an opinion on any kind of topic discussed in society . in my opinion , the fact of aknowledging a variety of issue in different field is the key to an effective and constructive open-mindedness . this open-mindedness is constituted by the gathering of information from different academic subject studied and the synthesis one can make with them . as an example , i would feel more comfortable debating on a president 's policy if i took a class about the contemporary history of the country he is leading to understand how he got elected , a sociology class to understand who elected him and a political science class to analyse the way he communicates his idea and wht conclusion i can draw based upon his behaviour . by contrast , if i only studied one of these subject , i probably wo n't be able to have a wide view over all the issue that a policy involves . however , being specialized in a particular academic field will provide me with the ability to elaborate an expert answer , that is to say deliver an in depth analyse based upon a more specific knowledge . i personally think it is essential to get specialized in some academic field . variety is good for general culture and open-midedness but specialization is more useful in the professional field . becoming an expert in one field provides you with more skill and proficiency in the subject studied . this reason make specialization be a better choice when it come to the application for a job . for example , if i want to be a lawyer , i need to have a law degree . by contrast , if i want to be a business manager , i can get experienced in a company a an in house consel and still be qualified for that job .
