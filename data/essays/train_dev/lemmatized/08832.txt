in my opinion , it is better to specialize in one specific subject . first , i think that a general knowledge of many academic subject is important , but then you have to decide a specific subject to study . i think that is more interesting , because you can know this subject wery well . for example , in italian litterature is very interesting to study the first edition of canzoniere of francesco petrarca . of course ou have to know also the other litterature of the same period , but then you can pay your attention only on this work of petrarca , and you can understand , for example , why petrarca decided a particular order for all his poem . second , when you specialize in one specific subject , you can concentrate all your attention on this subject . instead , if you know many academic subject , the risk is that you can know a little bit of every subject , but nothing very well . it mean that your study can be shallow . in addition , i think that if you specialize in one specific subject , you love this sibject and you want to know this subject very well . so , you can spent many time on this subject , but you will be not bored , because it is what do you want to do . finally , i want to repeat that also a general knowledge of many academic topic is important , but only a a support on a specific subject . for example , if you study the history of the cinema , and you want to specialize in the french director francois truffaut , you have to know also the artist of the nouvelle vague , or the movie of alfred hitchcock ( remember the book written by truffaut ) , or the classic french cinema . but then you can pay your attention in the specific characteristic of movie of truffaut , and it is very interesting if you like this subject .
