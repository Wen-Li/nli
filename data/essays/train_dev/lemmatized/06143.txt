i do n't think that spending time for this reason is not really important anymore . . but it 's true , young people do not spend a lot of their time helping their community . should they really do this ? what for ? there are other thing they have to concentrate on , such a school and work . a few year ago , it wa probably different and it wa more common to spend time helping their community , but everything is changing , for example people and life . young people really have to do much more than people the same age a couple of year ago . young people really have to work hard to finish school , to find the right job and to be sucessful in life . there are many other thing that are much more important than spending time with helping their community . young people should better hold on to their dream and the government should hire people to do the work that ha to do with the community . there are so many people without work , even if it 's not the best paid job , they will be happy to find a job instead of sitting on their as at home , watching tv without doing anything challenging . we do n't want lazy people in our contry , the worst thing is that we have to pay for this kind of people and we do n't want that , people get angry when they think about that . we want them to work , to work a hard a we do and to gain their own money . i disagree with the statement above because of the fact i mentioned in this essay . this essay definitely make clear what i think about it , and that there is no need for young people to help in their community , because we want the government to do something !!!
