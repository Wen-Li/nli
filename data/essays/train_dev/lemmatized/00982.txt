the issue of trying new thing and taking risk to get success is controversial . while some people think that success can come if they keep on doing what they are used to do , others assume that they have to deal with completely new and risky issue . according to me , the latter viewpoint is the most appropriate way to reach success . in fact i have the feeling that one ha to discover some new opportunity to be on the front scene . one instance of this is the big computer compamy apple which launched the `` i-pod product '' a few year ago . in fact this device wa different from it competitor product . even the apple project wa risky , the consumer adopted it and the sale successfully increased . in addition , success can not be met if one doe not take risk . for example , in financial service company , success mean important money gain which is not possible if a minimun risk is not taken . indeed , warrant provide more hopeful gain than option do but are seven time risky . finally , being successful mean being the best of all competitor . one example is the formula one team that ha the goal to win the world car championship . each year , is ha to compete with other car brand and try new technology such a new bumper to improve the aerodynamic profile of the vehicle , and to invest a lot of money for which it is not sure to get a profit in return . as a conclusion , for getting success people need to try new opportunity and to take risk that can drive them to the top level situation they have ever dreamt .
