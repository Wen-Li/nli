i agree with that statement . there are several reason for young people not to take actively part in their community . the main point is the missing education of child and young people . today many of them are n't well educated in behaviour . families do n't spend enought time to affect the child 's behaviour , because they think it is the teacher in school who ha to do that , but he is n't . a familie ha to provide social rule to it 's young member to make them known in the importance of relationship and communitive life . to me , religion also play a role in this education . many young people are n't religious for several reason , but religion can have an important effect on the people communitive thinking . it teach equality and understanding and it tell that every single person is important and a good relation between each other is one of the most important thing in life . most of my friend who are member of the christian church are highly interested in our community and participate actively . another reason for the missing helping is the influence of mass medium on the teenager . advertising implies that everyone is only next to hisself , no one else matter and it finally suggests that one is the middle of the universe . young people who have n't a working familiar background , are left alone with that suggestion . it is no surprise that they ca n't cope with the influence and that result in missing interest of the community they life in . so a i mentioned in the beginning the main thing is education in the familiar background to increase the number of actively working young people within community .
