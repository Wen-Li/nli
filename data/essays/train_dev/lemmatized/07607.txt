it is generally believed that young people enjoy life more than older people do . our society tends to put older people in the corner and to see them a depressed and useless . such general point of view is misleading and i personally do not agree with the statement . i will discus why young people are considered to be happier than older and to explain why i do not agree wth the statement . first of all , young people experience a lot of new emotion , both positive and negative , that are considered very positively in our mind . secondly , the physical strength of a young person allow them to do extraordinary thing . nevertheless , experiencing a lot of emotion or being very strong doe not imply being happy and it is not what older people are looking for . in my opinion , older people do not need strong emotion or extraordinary thing to feel happy . in general they choose to do what they really want to do . in fact with their experience they are able to enjoy life simply reading a book or visiting a museum , thing that are generally not considered exciting by young people . i think that this changement is due to a physiologic evolution of the brain throughtout life and to the capability of understanding their own limit a well a their own source of pleasure . in conclusion , i do not agree that young people enjoy life more than older people , but i just believe that older people enjoy their life simply in a different way . as i wrote above this is strictly bound to the fact that human mind change during life a well a human being doe .
