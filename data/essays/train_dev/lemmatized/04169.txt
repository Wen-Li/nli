yes , young people enjoy their life more than older people do . young people have more strength and are very enthusiastic about their activity and also curious to do thing differently . whereas older people tend to satisfy with what they have and what they achieved in their life . at the very young age people try to do many thing in a short period of time like participating in cultural activity , camping , sport and not to forget study indeed it one kind of an enjoyment . besides enjoying they are also learning thing like riding , shooting , watersports etc. , for an example one my friend hobby of shooting at younger stage took him to greater height , a he enjoyed shooting our instructor sensing his ability and calibre asked him to participate in a competition , which he won later on he never looked back . whereas people in their older age do enjoy but small when compared to younger a they dont have enough strength and also they are affected by various illness such a diabetes , knee pain etc. , people who are content with their life enjoy even in oldage but confined to indoors . for an example my uncle who is well settled is happy with his life but can not spend much time outdoors , he is loosing outdoor experience what we enjoy today . enjoyment can be fatal too for youngster a they may lead their life into a wrong direction in a false impression that they can change whenever they want . it is a good practice to get guidance from elder and older people before doing some work . which give you a good future at the same a you enjoy your life now and in the future too . thus older people do enjoy their life le than that of younger but all this enjoyment depends on the the thing we have done in our youngster stage .
