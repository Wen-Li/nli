i agree with the following statement . becuase am not a child , i can do many thing by myself , and can do it well . first hand , i think many people want have their own place , they can think and they can do anything they want to do . young people enjoy life more than older people do . young people have many thing to enjoy life . such a shopping , swimming , singing , running and so on . there are much way to enjoy . but old people have not so many thing to enjoy life . they like to go out for a walk , and watching newspaper . sometimes they like to be with their childrens to have dinner . second hand , i like to do something myself , i do n't like to do something that 's allowed by my parent . i will fell some incomfertable . i want to have many time to do my thing . i like travelling and i want to go to hongkong and america one day . i like america so much , i want to study there with many new firends , i want to meet many new firends in america . but my parent do n't want me to make a lot of firends , they want me to study everyday . but i do n't want to study everyday , i want to have some free time that only for me to stay with my firends . so , i think i do n't the statement is right . i like cartoon best , but many parent think that is nott a good thing . they think only child can watch it . but i lke it , i want to be a cartoon maker one day . i want to go to america to study how to make cartoon . i feel that is intresting in my life . at last but not the least , i agree with the following statement . i think young people enjoy plfe more than old people do .
