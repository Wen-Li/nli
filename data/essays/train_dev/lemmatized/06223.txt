i agree that young people enjoy life more than older people do because they get more apportunities to play than the older people . another reason that young people enjoy life more than older people do is that they have much more energy than the older people and by taking much more risk the younger people get more chance to experience and learning from their life . first of all the younger people get more opportunity to play that the older people because they have enough motivation to enjoy playing . for example , at my age , my friend and i play often . we go hicking , dancing in the stage or in the club a well , and also we sing and listen to music , which is alot of fun . however , the older people don not get alot of motivation like u so , they basically spend their spare time in their home or in the office that they work . another reason that young people enjoy life more than old people do is that they have much more energy than the old people . the old people are too old to go out and have fun because they do not have much energy than the young people . they are very tired from their work and from their house work . for example , my mom , who is a dentist , get very tired from her work . when i saw her , her face is already sleepy . in fact , she doe not have any energy left to do something even other than fun . the last reason is that the young people take much more risk from learning new thing by experiencing from their school or communicating and sociallizing with different kind of teacher , school mate , and friend . for example , i learned and inspired from a lot of experince from the school and also the community service . it is true that old people do not get chance to have that kind of experience anymore because they a lot of time , spending their time in their home or from their work . young people enjoy life more than older people because they often get motivated from the school and by having new friend and getting to know each other .
