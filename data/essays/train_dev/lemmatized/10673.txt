i agree that it is more important for student to understnad idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact . there are some reason that student should learn and understand idea and concept before the learn fact and that they need to have solid mental background a base . first , learning fact without understanding idea and concept is same a making a sand castle . for example , if they use a machine or instument for any reason without knowing the mechanism or concept , they can copy some work but they ca n't make creative work . or when they encounter some problem , they ca n't solve anything and have to depend on other people who know the mechanism . second , they wo n't be creative . they do n't need to start from scratch for everything . however , once they know some concept , they can manuplate and apply many thing a they want and develope the current stage of work or improve to make it productive . the third reason is a making a good habit when they learn idea and concept . people who like to learn fact usually are lazy or superficial . once people learn fact first , they do n't want to learn idea or concept because learning basic need a lot of time and effort until they get the final product . they do n't want to spend their time and energy for learning invisible thing . they want just product without effort . students mean who are learning new thing and developing their ability for their future or for society they are belonged to . therefore , i think that it is more important for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact , especially when they are young .
