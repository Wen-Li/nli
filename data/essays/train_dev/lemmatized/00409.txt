nowaday people have a lot of work to do . children are start with kindergarden then elementar school after that highschool and university , after they graduate they are doind their master and if they are lucky , they find a job and start to work . after all these thing child became a man . i 'm now 18 year old and my all life long i studied and i am really not sure when it is going to finish . i 'm from turkey and in turkey life is soo hard , if you want to survive you should work hard . i 'm studing in u.s. right now because i want to live better in future . i belive that after i became 60 i will have money and i will travel the world and my son will take my place and continue to my job . as i understand old people tell young people to enjoy their life because they think that school is not too hard and there is no illness . also young people tell the old people to enjoy their life but in a diffrent version . young people think that old people are just watching television and travel but also old people try to fight with their illness . when you get older life became more difficult because you cant control your body easily and your movement became slower . in my opinion every age ha enjoyable part but of course not so much time to do that enjoyable stuff . i know that my parent trying to make my life easier and enjoyable for me and i know that in future i will make them happy and i will make life easy for my parent and for my son . if every people will do the same thin this world will became a better place for everyone and people can enjoy the life without any age limitatons .
