in our century , advertising is everywhere . we have to deal with and to be aware of adverstisement 's trick . to my mind , most advertisement make product seems much better than they really are . indeed , the aim of an advertisement is to sell a product . that is why they are ready to say everythings which can convince you to buy it . people who do advertisement have not the due to say the truth , their goal is only commercial , not educative . so how can we trust adversting ? to illustrate this fact , we can take the example of mc donalds . if we look an adverstisement for this restaurant , we can learn that meal are usually very dietetic , they are not bad for the health and picture of meal are really teasing . but according to the experience make on mc donalds ' food in supersize me , we can see that , this food is not good for the health . to give another example , we can considerate make up advertisement . women who play in these advertisments are model and if we put this make up , we will not looking at the model . moreover , on her rimmel seems to be something very efficient but on we it doe not have the same effect ! so the product work better on tv or on adverstisement than on the real life . it is usually the same for washing product which wash our clothes more white than white . we have to keep in mind that : advertising world is an i ; aginary world where everything is perfect . that is not supposed to reflect the reality . that sell we dream and that is what we buy when we buy a product after have seen it advertisement . indeed all is facke on an advertisement , people on are retouching , they always seem happy , and think everything is delicious or amazing . to conclude we can say that , yes adverstisement make usually product better than they really are because there main stake is to sell something and not to be true .
