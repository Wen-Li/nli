in my opinion the statement is partially true . i think the success of a person depends on several factor , not only on the capacity to to take risk . for example a really lucky man doe n't need to take any risk for accomplish what he is doing . i know a guy who just won the lottery , he is a clearly `` successful man '' , or at least he got more success then me , infact now he is having fun on his big boat , and i 'm writing an assay to pas the toefl test to be accepted for an internship in the other part of the world , and i will work for free . thus , according to the socrates ' theory , the point is to define the definition of `` successful people '' , and i think there is n't any general definition of `` successful people '' , i think a successful guy is the one who improve the world . according such definition one who want to belong to the `` successful people '' group should he have to follow the way he can afford best . if he improve the wrold he belongs to the `` successful people '' group . to acheive that point he can both employ new thing and take risk or just reuse what he already know . the goal explain the way used to acheive them . all the people are differents , so one can acheive the goal to improve the heart in one way , anotherone can acheive the goal in a different way . the important thing is to make the world better . a way could be let me passing the toefl .
