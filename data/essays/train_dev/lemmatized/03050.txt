some people said a tour guide is needed , when you travel the new country or unfamilier place , but i have a different opinion . i think a tour guide could not be good for travel always . there are some reason to support my opinion . first , every people ha different preference to have fun with new place or travel . some people might want to spend more time at art gallery , and the others want to go to beach or shore which are famous through out the world , but if we have to follow the guide . we do n't have chance to spend more time , where we want to stay more . second , the cost to hire any tour guide is not cheaper . whenever we thought about the travel or trip , biggest problem or issue is the buget which might affect the decision whether we can go a travel or not . futhermore , we could stay more day with extra money that came from the cost to hire tour guide . third , if we do not hire any tour guide , we must research infomation about the place where we plan to travel . after researching infomation of the place , we may gain more knowledge of the place . and it can make u enjoy the travel with knowledge , result of our effort of research . many people have different opinion about the travel and trip , but the most important thing for plan to go to new place is what kind of thing we could learn from the travel . we need to do it ourselves .
