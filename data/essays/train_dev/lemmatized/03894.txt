advertisement is the most effective and powerful way of communication . companys and corporates spends big a mount of assts on advertisments to make sure that people will buy their product . in my opinion , advertisement make product seems much better than they really are . in order to convence costomers of buying certain product , comanys have to convince them that this product is effective in doing whatever it is suppose to do and that what they see is what they get . company 's will have to make that product look like it serf it porpuse and more , regardless of being honest or dishonest . an adversitment will exaggurate the quality and the effectiveness of a product in order to be convensing . for example , some product like hair shampoo have a woman with a long silky hair that emplays that your hair will look like this if you use that shampoo . this is misleading becuase a shampoo will not make your hair long silky and shiny a shown in advertisment . therefore the adversitment in this case is not doing what it is suppose to do . most of dvertisements are dishonest and misleading . when people see and advertisment and decide to buy it , they expect to have what they have been promised to have . for example , some airline advertisement say fly with u we are always on time , while when you expect that promise , you end up being delayed 5 hour . this dishonet misleading adversitment lead to resentment and the company loos it credibility . adversitments are not always what they seem to be . comanys and corporate will do anything to mak their product look better than they really are in order to get a many customer a possible . the most effective way is to communicate thier product to the costomers through adversitments . adversitments work on a consious and a subconsious level , therefore people should use their critical thinking when looking at an adversitment becaus what they see is not usually what they get .
