i agree that advertisement make product seem much better than they really are . now adays advertising and medium is every thing to consumer . companys pay million in ad . every year to survive in the market and competition . it all go back to the consumer , not every thing u see in the advertisement could exactly be the same a u see . or example the soup u see boilng in the tv look always a if it taste good , but u might try it once and it might not suit u.this why i say it all go back to the consumer . another example is a laptop which look very nice in a newspaper advertisement , but once seeing it with ur eye it look smaller than the picture and not the right quality . there are lot of type of advertisement . one type is acompany whose looking for long term bussiness not willing to get out of the market easily , so they try to keep there advertisement the closest to reality a much a possible . another type is a company that want to sell the product a couple of time and build the company on the support they will offer with the product , and these company need to have nice advertising a little bit , than reality so the consumer can buy from the first pas . they company are mainly found in the market and they are meduim run company . another type of company is a company who want to sell it product for 1 time and leave with the profit , so this type of company ha to pay alot in a very fansy way of advertising method so the consumer can buy once only . finally what i can say is people now a day are more and more educated than old day , so most of the advertising should match up people thinking and they should be the closest to reality and the best looking to consumer .
