in my opinion young people enjoy life more than older people do . there are several reason to explain my opinion . young people can enjoy life because they dont have responsibility . they have more freedoom . they must go to school , do their homework and clean their room . but they have a lot of free time . they can spend it in different way and have a lot of fun . they can meet many other friend to have fun together . old people have important responsibility and they must work for their family or themself . they spend most of time at work . they can realize a dream or a hobby only during the week end or in the evening . old people are more mature than young people because they had many experencies during their life . in conclusion i think that young people can enjoy life more than older people do . to be a young people is beautiful . if you were a child , you could do what you prefer without problem . a child think nothing about serious event or fact . old people are under stress or serious . young people are always happy . young people can enjoy life more then older people because they cant look at bad thing or fact but only at good , pleaseant and beutiful thing and event .
