i totally disgree with this statement since it is completely unfaithfull to reality . we all know that the world population is gradually growing to it extreme . of course , and unfortunatelly , this mean a consequential growth of many thing , such a city , house , polution and waste . that in twenty year fewer car would be running through our highway seems trully hard to believe . it make sense , more people , more car . this is the real statement we should bear in mind , and specially when dealing with today 's materialistic society , eager to adquire more and more without caring about any consequence . cars , people say , are the reflection of one 's own whealth , and the better it is or the more you have seems to say much about your self . luckily , nowadays the concept ecologism appears to be more settle in our society than a few decade ago . we could say that the human being is , through time , more and more conscious about his environment , something that undoubtfully change our bad behavioir towards nature . public transportation should be of a daily use in our society since it sure help to reduce the polution generated by single car . it is a perfect way to move through the city while meeting interesting people . we still have much to do about this issue , but i believe a change is possible . maybe not in twenty year , nor probably in 50 , but in some future period the use of car should be radically reduced .
