in general , it seems that young people have many opportunity for einjoying the life because they have physical power to play , study , and so on . however , in my opinion , older people actually enjoy life more than young peple do . this is because that older people have advantage in term of time , money , and experience . first of all , most of young people do not have enough time for using their time for enjoyment . young people need to work to obtain saraly and they have to support their family . as they are very busy to work they do not have the time to do something enjoyable . to make matter worse , they need to rest on holiday because they are often tired with daly work . on the contrary , older people do not have to work because they can live with social security system . they can spend their time for enjoyment instead of work . in japan , for instance , a lot of older people go for a trip , concentrate on hobby , excercise in park with thier friend . as a result , i can say that older people actually enjoy life more than young people . second of all , older people generally have the money for enjoying the life . as i mentioned above , older people can live with social security sysem . they can obtain money for living from government ( a least in my country , japan ) . the money which is offerd by government so enough that old people can use it for enjoyment such a trip or shopping . finally , older older people are experienced man who know how to enjoy the life . as they live longer time than younger people , they actually know the way to use the time effectively . for example , older people have a lot of memory by which they can enjoy to talk each other . they also have familes include grandson . it is true that there are some older people who do not have enough time , money , and experience for enjoying life . all in all , though , i think that older people have advantage for enjoying life . that 's why i disagree with the statement .
