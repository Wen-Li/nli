this is a very difficult question to answer because i 've seen some old people enjoying their life everyday and some young people worry about their future and it challenge . in my opinion , in general there is that idea that young people enjoy life more because they do not reponse or comply to certain parameter or rule that society ha constructed over u . this give u the impression that they are more relax but a always reality is by far more complex and come in different colour and form . depending on the upbringing some young people can be very methodical , working very hard for their future and are often in a constant battle against time to get a place in society . another point i would like to mention is the definition of `` enjoy '' or perhaps `` joy '' . as i mentioned before people are complex creature so they enjoy a wide range of activity . some of these activity can be considered not very enjoyable for some other people with different interest . take botany , plant science , a an example for some individual spending day and night looking at plant and checking their part is very rewarding and definitelly it form part of the joy of their life . on the other hand , somebody whose main interest is robotics or clubbing , just to mention two extreme example , would have some difficulty understanding other people source of joy . older people especially the one who are already retired tend to have a very tranquil and quiet life , but then again this ha a lot to do with the efford they made when they were younger planning their finance so they can have a decent pention and a a result a more enjoyable life . i 've seen people who plan very carefully to make sure they will not become a burden for their family and society . as a conclusion i think you chose to enjoy your life regardless your age . however to reach a sustainable state of security and stability , so you can enjoy life more , some plannig is indeed necesary at any stage of your life .
