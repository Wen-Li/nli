in my opinion i believe the theory about that in twenty year there will be le car than there are today is wrong . i think that because of the way of human life , in the future will be more car there are now . the first point of this theory is that when i look at documentary about car in the past there wa just a few car and very expensive so nobody could buy one . today every family can buy a car or more than one . the amount of car in use have execeded the expectation and now there a car or more that people in the earth . furthermore , the human are getting more and more lazy . we plan owr life trying to do a le exercise a we can . so even we go near home we just take the car because it is easier to get and faster . if we think in the ovesity progress in society we can asume that people is getting fatter and and lazyier , and one reason for that is the use of the car . another point for this grownig sittuation is the economic aspect of this industry . govenments from all over the world ha a big intrest in using and selling car , because of their own economic benefit . as you can see the best car in world are produced y the economic potency like germany , or the united states , or italy or japan . moreover they have a big interest in the gas they sell because it is a big economic resource in all over the world . finally by my piont of view the indutry is growing more and more , so there is no reason i can give to think that in twenty year will be le car than today . so because of the human way of life , in the future will be lot of more car that it is right now .
