advertisement is one of the most important method that the business use inorder to increase their profet and to help to create a very positive mind image in the customer mind to buy this product a soon a possible . however there are so many way to advertise the product , such a producing poster and creating a t.v commertial or sometimes by radio commertials , in an addition small company use the most affective and cheapest way in order to advertise the product to the people and that is by providing test sample of their production or by posting poster in the street rather than creating a t.v comertial . advertisements will affect the income of the business and will attrackt the customer to buy the product , however not all product are perfict a they seem to be because the company will onlly state the advantage and the good point about their production and they wont state the disadvantage of the product becasue the main goal of the company is sell a much product a they can in order to gain high profit . in an artical i once read they have found that the company which they advertise their product befor selling it to the customer are likally to be succesfull and more garanteed to grow than the company who sell their product without a pre-advertisements and without advertising the product to the people . neverless in my point of view and according to my personal experiance i think that most advertisement make product seem much better than they really are , however i do believe that the business should find that best way to reach to the company main goal that is to increase their profet by increasing their selling production and having a much customer a possible , therefor adverising the product in a very positive image is one of the best way to reach to their goal .
