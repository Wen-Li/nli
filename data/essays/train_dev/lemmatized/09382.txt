as it is said that high return can not be gotten without high risk , it seems to be true that successful people try new thing and take risk rather than only doing what they know . however , i disagree with the idea because of following reason . firstly , success can be achived if you continue doing what you already know how to do well . for example , in japanese traditional art like kabuki or nou , the performer repeat the practice of the same story every day from the day they start the practice when they are 3 year old or so to the day they die . however , we all admit that they could succeed in fully expressing the traditional art a part of japanese culture . the same also applies to traditional craftmakers or even professional baseball player . they improve their ability by repeating the same thing which is the most familiar to them every day . these example are enough to deny the statement above . besides , even if trying new thing brings you the chance for success , new thing must mean the thing which is new to everyone , not to the person alone . someone who always change their focus can not have a chance to get success .
