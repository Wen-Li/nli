knowing and learning fact is important , but it is not everything that is necessary to live a successful life . the statement `` it is more important for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn facts. '' is absolutelly correct . what advantage do i have , if i can name all president of the us , or if i know all distance from the earth to the planet if i do not know how to use this knowledge or where to refer it to . factual knowledge , in my opinion , is simply usefull in quiz show . on the other hand , if a student understands the idea and the concept of a problem , he or she is going to succeed . if the student understands the problem or the idea , he or she will be much more likely to solve it . factual knowledge may only underpin the action but it is not going to lead to a solution . an other aspect stating the importance of the understanding of idea and concept , is the fact , that those student will remember thing easier , because they are able to refer it to a specific topic . they may also be able to use this earned knowledge on other thing and be able to understand those thing faster . by understanding idea and concept it will be much easier for them to remember fact , without even pointing them out a fact . as an example , let 's have a closer look on two student taking a history test . one student ha simply studied the fact , ha learnd the year and the event , but doe n't know how those event connect and refer to each other . it will be hard for this student to answer a question that asks to summarize or give an own opinion about their action . the other student on the other hand , focus more on the `` why-questions '' , such a why did they do this or why did it end like this . even if he doe not remember the exact year , he will be able do answer difficult question because he know how everything is related to each other . it will be easy for this student to settle back in this time and act accuratively . taking everything into account , i think that student who understand the idea and concept will remember fact automatically , because they are able to refer them to something they are familiar with . those student who simply learn fact , are most likely to forget them a soon a the test , etc. is over . and in my opinion , that is not the goal . the goal for each student should be to understand the idea and concept and remember them a long a possible .
