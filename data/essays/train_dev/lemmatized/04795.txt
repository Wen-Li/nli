i am completely positive about the statement . here i would like to mention some reason why a group travel is the best way to travel . i work for a travel company a a tour guide , so i guess i confirm advantage of group travelling . first of all , tourist feel secure when they are travelling with plenty of people and their guide , who is a local resident of the site . group travelling people can defend themselves in time difficult time and it is more likely to acttract public attention for requesting for help . in some place , it is suggested to tourist not to go out alone because of high velocity rate . second reason why i prefer group travel is payment for the travel cost . needless to say , it is noticably cheaper than single travel for certain country . even a number of tour company offer special programme for group tourist , not only discount , but also free-of-charge trip for group leader or certain amount of member . the third reason serf our company 's main goal , more people , more fun . it is much interesting to travel with many different people in order to have a real vacation . group tourist can attend different competition , match and other attractive entertainment . travelling is not only the meaning of to travel , but to make friend and to get relationship with them . it offer people more chance to make friend in an easier way . i know of many occasion that tourist get marry after a long , exciting tour . in conclusion , i have a strong point of view of travelling a a group . tourists feel more secure , more respect and guide feel more responsibility when they are travelling a a group .
