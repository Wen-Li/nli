i 'm in agreement with this statement for three principal reason . firstly , the cost of energy is continuing to go up and in twenty year will be much more expehensive than is today . that is becouse the petroleum is going to be finished in 50 year and the territory with a lot of oil are instable . in this situation there will be a lot of people who could n't effort the oil and conseguently who wo n't buy the car . secondly , there is the phenomen of urbanization in which people leave the countryside for the city . this phenomen that is ha already happened in europe and america is happening at this period in africa e asia . more people will live in the city e fewer car in use there will be . that is becouse the people who live in the city couse traffic or couse public transport facility have a le percentual of car respect the people who live in the countryside . and lastly , there is another problem for who ha got a car : when you finish to use it you have to park it ! and in the big city couse parking restriction or lack of space it 's often difficult to park it . for these three reason , cost of energy , urbanization and problem of parking i belive that in twenty year there will be fewer car in use than there are today .
