learing a fact , we ( human ) are always curious about knowing a fact . we whant know what happning , what wa a result . i disagree with the statement that student learning fact is more important than learning concept and understand idea . first of all , the reason why i disagree with the statement is because i strongly belief that understanding idea and concept lead to develope student thinking skill . specifically , if a teacher teach about the global warming , and say just a fact of it ( like `` global warming is progressing now badly , and the earth 's temperature is increasing . '' then how student will take that teacher voice ? most student will understand that the global warming is happning , but they could not know what element are causeing the global warming , because that teacher only did teach a fact ( global warming is happning ) and did not teach how and whyhappend ( ideas/concept of global warming ) . therefore due to a lack of key idea and concept of global warming , student only knew about a fact and they do not understanding process ( ieas/concept ) of the global warming . only knowing the fact is a big problem , because if they do not have inside story ( ideas/concept ) and only knowing the fact . then they could not evaluate the issue from there , becuaes they do not have data to estimate the issue . so , if they only knew about the fact , then they could not solve the global warming issue or other issue which happning on the earth . from above reason , i disagree whith the statement that teaching student fact is more important than teaching idea and concept . more over , teaching only fact is not ideal educational way . to develop student thinking skill , educator must teach idea and concept of each issue to develop student thinking ability .
