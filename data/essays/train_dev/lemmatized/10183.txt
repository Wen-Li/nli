i agree to the statement . there are considerable advantage and disadvantage to account the statement . only understanding idea and concept is something condemning , it sound not true . but learning idea and concept along with fact will lead to more interest for student and make their interest amplified . as the technology is growing at a jet spead the point of learning concept is increasing than fact . for example consider the programing technology used in computer for maintaing it huge database and processing of it . we have number of technology side by side for processing of data base . student need to learn improved technology faster than knowing it fact and hypothetical reason . in order keep pace of the updations one need to learn more faster and compete with the growing world . students are advised to learn or supposed to learn more concept in little time to meet the course schedule and timing of examination . so they have to pay more attention on concept than fact . facts help u to remember the point and theory well . for example albert einstein invention and law , without knowing the fact of law of newton and many other work of einstein we may not able to understand their invention and formula behind the derivation of those . considering the issue of relativity among the body einstein gave a nice statement and fact , that is -- `` a boy sitting beside a pretty girl for two hour '' count only for two minute where a `` sitting on a stove for two minute `` count for two hour '' a comical statement but a fact . then from that fact einstein brings the idea of `` relativety between body '' . so there is a support to learn fact before going to learn concept . without which the concept doesnt make sense at all . especially when considering the subject like physic , math etc . so learning idea and concept also fact are equally important to a student inorder to establish a control over the subject .
