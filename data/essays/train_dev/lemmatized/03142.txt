since the beginning of 90 's , technology is developing with an incredebale speed and it ha been developed with this speed in many area . we talked about the technology 's speed . but what about the real speed ? for many year technology 's main concern wa always speed . in our modern world speed play a key role in every field . speed mean time and time is cash . speed mean efficiency . speed mean so many important thing nowadays . so what did technology do about speed ? we began our journey with finding the wheel . and then everything ha changed . we invented train . and then car and then plane and now we have even space shuttle . but from all of these vehicle , car are the most important one . the use of the car ha increased during the year and now , nearly every people in the u.s have at least one car . cars helped and made the thing easier for u . but what will happen after two decade from now ? are we going to use same old , slow car ? are we going to use that kind of vehicle while speed will be much and much important ? i dont think so . first of all , a i said before , speed will be much more important . and there are enviromental problem too . there are so many car and they are polluting our air . also there is a energy problem . our planet 's limited resource wont be enough to support that much energy in the near future . from my humble point of view , the car will be useless within twenty year . we will find and we will have to find much rapid vehicle , we will have to find ecologic vehicle and we will have to find vehicle that transport large mass and use le energy . simply , we will and we will have to find more sustainable vehicle . because we have to improve our self and civilization and in the meantime we have to protect our planet .
