it 's very hard to generalize who enjoys life more , either young people or older people . this usualy varies according to each individual 's personality and life story . however , there are a few idea and observation that make me assume that older people tend to enjoy life more . young people have more energy to live and constantly experience more thing . however , they may get caught up on the velocity of our modern world and not fully enjoy the everyday of their life . they have a thirst for something different all the time . this insatiable craving can distract them from savoring each moment a somethig valuable and enjoyable . many time , young people confront difficult situation in which it appears that life is facing it limit . the bad situation seem graver and can affect the younger mind , not being able to see the long term perspective that an older mind can more likely visualize . on the other hand , older people live a life with a slower rithm , a life in which they can look back to what they have accomplished and enjoy where they stand today . individuals of greater age have more memory , and have experienced more situation , that can put them at ease with their expectation and make them enjoy the little thing more than younger people . unlike young people , the elder usually have created family , that constantly bring joy to their life . the satisfaction of sharing the everyday moment with the poeple one love , is something that come with age , when one ha had the time to value his beloved one . even though one tends to think that young people are always more enthustiastic towards life and generaly more satisfied , in my experience , it is those who have lived longer that posse the key and secret behind true happiness .
