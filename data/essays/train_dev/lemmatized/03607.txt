i do agree that most advertismenets make product seem much better than they really are . a possible explaination would be that these advertisement are based on different survey made by professional in order to know what the target public want to hear . for example , if a company wanted to sell a new skate board , it will interview teenager who are skateboarding to know what they are looking for in a perfect product . they will do the same with the parent of the skateboarder because ther are the one who will pay for it . once these information are analyzed , a publicity will be made out of that . the content of this advertisement would be based on scientifcal data . the target public will see in the product exactly what they are looking for , it will appear a the perfect product . however , they might be disapointed once they have bought the item realizing that it is not that perfect . an other way to illustrate my point is the advertisement for kraft 's dinner product . this publicity target whoever make lunch at home , i.e. the mother and their kid . the product is sold a a healthy and convenient lunch . the kid look really happy to eat it and it seems really tastefull . however , one can easilly realize that kraft 's dinner product are not a healthy meal and are not tastefull . the publicity conceptors know that someone will be more likely to buy a product if it a a pretty presentation . that is the reason why all the product are in nice little box with bright color and printed with impressive design . an other way to make a product look attractive is by using the picture of a good looking woman or a handsome men . therefore , the client will purchase the item in order to be closer to the model on the box . but the product inside might not be that exceptionnal . in conclusion , i think that advertisement company are able to identify the desire of customer and make a nice publicity featuring all them . they are able to show a way to people to reach their dream . but dream doe not always come true . ..
