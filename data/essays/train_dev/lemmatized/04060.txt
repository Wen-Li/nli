i do n't consider myself a a successful person . however my brother do rather well in a specific field that is gymnatics . and i have noticed that he ha recently started playing tennis . so i have had the opportunity to figure out that when people are fairly good at praticing an activity , they often try to do different thing . there are two main reason that support my viewpoint . one of the reason which support this statement is that when one is successful , he often want to explore other fiels to figure out what he is worthing . taking risk , having an other kind of experience prof to be beneficial in that it enables you to know what you can do , what your skill are . trying news thing is a kind of challenge to yourself . for instance , i am quiet sure that my brother decided to start playing tennis because it wa a way to pushing out his limit . he probably though that since he wa very good at gym , what he wo n't be a good at playing tennis ! however , trying to make different thing to those that you already know how to do is not only motivated by personal reason . taking risk is both a personal and a public achievement . as a matter of fact , i imagine that successful person are also tempted to impress people around them . friends , family are conducive to improving their skill and to be even more talented . successful person are probably prone to increase the public recognition they already have . trying new thing is one opportunity to do that and to be even more acclaimed .
