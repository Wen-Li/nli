the way we are educated is influencing a lot what we become later . i think that having a broad knowledge of many academic subject is important . it can be very usefull when one want to interact with other people . it is essential to share idea and thougths with others . in the professional life , for instance , if somebody in a company ha to work with another department , his task will be much easier if he know a little bit about the activity of this department . even if it is not a complete understanding , it will be appreciated by the other part . to give another exemple , related to personal life this time , it is very agreable to be able to argue or discus when we meet someone new . without this broad knowledge , how wolud we make contact , at least at the beginning ? we would obviously miss the oportunity to get in touch with peolpe . i would say that , having a broad knowledge is really a plus in life , it is like the promise to be welcomed and integrated almost wherever we go . on the other hand , i think we can not only be satisfied with a broad knowledge . we need to go further sometimes . we need to be in something exciting to keep a goal to our life . and this can not be achieved without being specialized in one subject . again , professionaly speaking , it is essential to be specialized . nobody can pretend to a job , which is something specific of course , if one doe not know enough on this particular topic . that is why we usually start our study by general education , a broad knowledge , and then , gradualy focus , year after year , on what we want to do . plus , i think it is something very valuable for a human being to go in depth of something , to prove to ourselves that we are able to do something special , something that defines u . to conclude , i would say that both approach are necessary . we need both to learn thing about our environment , about the world , in order to interact , but we need to survive , by saying , `` i can bring you this , i can be helpfull with this '' .
