in my opinion i agree the statement that it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subject than specialize in one specific subject . there are some reason to below . the most impotant reason is people go to the university is for to absorb and expand knowledge . the more knowledge one posse the more opptunity will have . for instance , the gradu student from the intergrate university will have more opptunity to get the job because the intergrate university provide many academic subject . so the student have more knowldge and skill than the student who just have specialize in one specific subject . another reason is with the pluramiu society requirement everone need to have a broad knowledge . someone who in the company can have the high star payment if they finally , if someone have no a broad knowlegde , just specialize
