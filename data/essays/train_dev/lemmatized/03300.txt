to specialize in one specific subject is better than having broad knowledge of many academic subject . firstly i would like to quote a saying `` half knowledge is dangerous '' . this explains that having a broad or not perfect knowledge is dangerous than having no knowledge . we should have broad knowledge of academic subject only upto a certain stage of education and then a specialized subject . secondly consider a person who is planning for his future . he want to join in any one of the higher study through one of these-iit , aieee , eamcet , bits . having an specialized idea of one will make him get succeeded getting admission in to higher study . stepping him into all way make lead him not being succeeded in any one atleast . next let me state an example . consider a person who want to have a broad knowledge of civil engineering . he go through roughly having an idea how house are constructed , how soil below account to the structure , what are requiremenys of house ( like electrical work , sewage distribution , pipeline connection etc . . ) . he need the assistance of each and every person specialized in each of these feilds to take an appropriate defination which which suit all the factor . rather if he is specialized in one of these he could completely take chance over that . so , i believe having specialized knowledge of one subject and being perfect in that is advantageous . one can completely relie on themselves and even defend others while they are misleaded . having a broad idea one should always consult others for more detail regarding that topic . the idea of being specialized also help a person to improve his self confidence because he can perfectly deal effectively . the state of feeling that `` i can do this '' incorporates a lot self confidence in a person . the knowledge of specialized subject will also make a person mentally strong . at last i conclude by saying that it is better to specialize in one subject rather having broad knowledge of all the academic subject .
