the view presented in the above statement is about the impact of the advertisement on making the product look better than they reallly are . in the present day scenario where there is a heavy competition among the various manufacture to increase sale of thier product . the manufacturer have resorted to investing money and time on advertising of thier product beyond thier real value . i agree with the above statement . first , the customer is very important to any industry and to attract a customer the manufacture have come up with various way of advertising thier product using the television , radio and news paper and these ha resulted in the advertising industry that solely relies on the manufacture resource and they are not interested to know wether the manufacture is manifucaturing a good product or not . the advertiser employ the famous movie star and other imoprtant personality in the society who are lured by the money and either knowingly or unknowingly they take part in the advertsement that build the image for the product beyond it market or face value . second , there are various example that show how some advertiser have gone great length to increase the sale of the product even with out fully knowing the good and bad effect of using that product . this happened in india , and in this situation one of the leading movie actor ha participated in the advertisement for a manufacturing company that sell the car and and the people who believed in the adveritesemnt have bought many car and later on it ha been realised that even though the car us the 800cc engine in it car , it advertises that a a 1000cc car , another example is that of a soap company where it ha been advertised a the best soap and after the lab result it ha been found that the soap ha some harmful chemical . eventhough the advertisement ha it own drawback , it is a known fact that the advertisement is a powerful tool in the present day world and it ha been a accepted fact that advertisement is a necessary tool to even sell a good product . advertisement must be used for the better pupose of the society by advertising the true nature of the product that the manufacture manufature , so that the customer will have a better information , so a to choose the better product from a wide range of product .
