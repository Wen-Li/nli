schools that teach k-12 student require student to study various subject . these subject that the student learn are not necessarly useful in their carrier . i believe that it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subject than to specialize in one specific subject . if it is better to master in one specific subject , why do the school teach numerous subject to the student ? a student might agree that the subject that they are learning in school is useless and meaningless to learn . this is not true because a you grow more mature you will realize that the thing you learned in school really come to help in the real life . so it is better to study and have knowledge on various type of subject rather than having unlimited knowledge on one subject . it may seem better to specialize in one specific subject when you get a specific job that require those knowledge you learned . well , this is just in your carrier . when you get out to the social world , the thing you learned are too professional that no one , but you and people who work with it understand . if you want to get involved in a social life and understand life better , it is better to know many thing . for an example , when you go to a party where all kind of different people gather . you want to talk to people , but you only know that specific topic and do not know other topic that people talk about . as a result , you will be secluded and feel alone . in conclusion , it is better to have broad knowledge of many subject than to specialize in one specific subject . with broad , but many knowledge you will enjoy better life where you are not left behind , and you will be able to appreciate other people 's opinion more . on the other hand if you only know about a specific subject , you will be left alone and feel secluded . to lead a successful life , it is better to know alot of thing rather than a specific topic .
