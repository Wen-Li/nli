nowadays exist a lot of people that study an specific profession , and when they finished it they realized they they do n't really like it , so they work in an area that they do n't enjoy . what is worst people study a profession and after a year or two year they change to other profession , and they can do this many time , so they waist their time trying to find something that they really like and they enjoy . so i agree with the statement that say that it is better to have a broad knowledge of many academic subject . if you spend time studing differents subject , and expanding your knowledge , later you will have more option to decide what you really want to study . because you will have study different type of subject , and you will have more option at the time you choose a profession . and the college you aply will see that you have studied subject related to the profession you aplied to . another advantage of studing many academic subject , is that you will have spend time in many different type of subject , so at the end you will know in what subject you are really good at . that way you wo n't enter to a college to study a profession that later you realize that you are not good at , and because of that you will have to change your profession and you will waist your time . finally we can say that studing different academic subject , you will expand your knowledge , you will see some of every subject , you will learn different kind of thing , and your knowledge will grow . so in the future , maybe when you have child , you can teach them what you have learned , eventhough it doe n't refer to the profession you studied . you will always have that knowledge with you . as a conclusion i can state that i agree with the option that say that is better to have a broad knowledge of different academic subject . it will help you in many thing in the future . you will be a mor versatile person .
