i disagree with this statement . i think that car is very important for our life . some people who live in convenient city do n't care to nothing car but local people do n't think so . for example , `` shopping '' . recently , many shopping moals and big supermarket are located in the place where is far from city or inconvenient place . if those people do n't have a car , they can not go shopping anywhere . and local place dose n't have many train .
