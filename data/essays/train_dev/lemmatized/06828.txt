obviously , the aim of advertisement is to make product seem much better than they really are . i do n't see any point to disagree with this statement . if a certain advertisement is failing to stimulate this impression , this mean that this advertiser is simply a bad advertiser . however , this doe not mean that advertisement is simply a lie and advertiser are wellcomed to lie given advertisement is the art of lieing ! . advertisement also ha to have it ethic . the positive impression in the mind of the consumer is to be created not by outright lie but by emphasizing the attractive aspect of the product in question . if the product in question is an expensive and good product , many advertisement wisely omit to mention it price . if the product is cheap , the advertisement would proudly emphasize it exact price . this kind of selective speaking is true not only for commercial advertisement but also true in our daily life . if we were to mention a certain man , one can only mention his positive side whereas another one can only speak of his negative side . both men would still be talking the reality . as long a people speaking about a third person and a along a the advertiser while presenting his product are honest , there is no ethical question . to lie outrightly and to speak selectively about reality are two different thing . in a commercial world , it is not realistic to expect u to criticize their own product ! the advertisement also perfectly know the weak side of the consumer . they know what attracts them and what distracts them . using the insight of pyschology , they benefit from the temptation of consumer . but this is one side of the coin . the consumer also know how advertisemnets are . they also learn that advertisement polish the product and aim to create a fairy tale image . the consumer use advertisement for knowledge . they are not stupid enough to be deceived by the advertisement . they are educated by the advertisement themselves of the characteristic of the advertisement . a typical consumer is more or le able to distinguish what is real and what is fiction in advertisement . to conclude , although i agree with the statement , the statement ha to be qualified . recognizing the fact that advertisement make the product look better than they really are doe not mean that advertiser are a bunch of criminal lieing unashamedly to the whole people . they make the positive side of the product accessible to the consumer . it is up to the consumer to make their decision and to agree or disagree with the advertiser .
