the advertisement is a way to promote a product with the goal to sell it for the price you gave him . in this definition is an obvious answer to the subject : advertisement have to make product seem much better than they really are to be efficient . but today the advertisement is not only focused on the product itself , also on the image of a brand . those two are different way to promote and sell a product , and therefor are different answer of the topic . both of them will be studied in a paragraph . the advertisement that promote directly the product is generally a demonstration of it efficiency , it power , etc . advertisers are obviously attracted to make the product seems much better than it really is . it can work if the product is anyway the best of it category or for a certain period of time . but if the customer discover a controversial `` truth '' about the real capacity of the product , the lie of the advertisement will be a very bad promotion and will result to an image of a firm not capable . for example , sony promoted a lot it computer with advertisement that show them very powerful . unfortunatly , their batterie wa deficient , so sony ha now to call them back to change them . the image of sony is now affected by this problem , and moreover because the advertisement lied . the second type of the advertisement is when the brand only try to give herself an attractive image instead of trying to promote a specific product . for example , the coca-cola company doe n't promote directly it drink , but try to give an image that is attractive for the customer . in this kind of advertisement , there is no need to give a false image of the product because it is only the brand that will attract more customer . to conclude , i will say that the different way to promote a product and the problem they each carry show how the topic is too general to be a true statement .
