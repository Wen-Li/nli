contrary a it might sound there are a number of reason and phenomenon that are happening around the world that may indicate the number of car in use will drop in the next twenty year . this may sound counterintutive a the automobile market is booming and car sale are higher than ever before . however a closer look at the issue reveals a slightly different picture . firstly there is the global oil crisis that ha affected almost every nook and cranny of the world . in most country it ha become exorbitant to fuel a car that is being used regularly . general environmental awareness level are also going up . now more than ever before people world over are realising how much automobile exhaust is polluting the atmosphere . this in addition to oil shortage will eventually discourage people from investing in car . furthermore mineral resource and metal mine are not endless . very soon they will run out at the current rate of utilisation . once this happens the prize of car will sky rocket . so far there have been very few car that effectively run on non-polluting safe energy . even the few that have developed have not managed to capture the general market . secondly most country are going to great length to develop efficient , and fast public transport system . in addition most city are expanding . as the city limit become larger and larger people have to commute greater distance to get to the destination of their choice . thus a public transport system become better and more widespread people will soon realise that it is definitely more economical to switch to public transport rather than to use car . lastly another global proble , seemingly mundane but actually crucial is the increase in incidence of road congestion and the lack of parking space . most city now day suffer from terrible and atrocious traffic jam which uneccesarily waste time . even if you escape a traffic jam you may have to go to elaborate length to find a free parking spot . in conclusion it can be seen that eventually all of the above factor , to varying extent will discourage people from buying more car . thus a older car slowly fall into disuse the number of car totally in use will go down in the next twenty year .
