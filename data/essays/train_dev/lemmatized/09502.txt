it is better to have broad knowledge of many academicsubjects than to specialize in one specific subject , having a complete knowledge about one subject will not promote to apply the concept of other subject , so in order to bulid up perfection in our study it better to have a thorogh in depth knowledge of all the academic subject , . i strongly agree with the statement , to bolster my opinion i shall present few example . turnining to the statement threshould claim , one informative example is docters , having a complete knowledge of the all academic subject such a anatomy and many more , will improve the jr.docters to perform the operation to the human body , because all the people going to docter will have complete credible on them that the docters cure their illness , there is no exageration that if adocter perform a eye operation he such be well perfect in all the organ funtioning such a brain , nervers etc. so docter should be well practiced with his academic subject . another informative example is in enginering section where , the student learn in the first two year the concept of the few subject will be help full them in their final semister , such a materal and energy balance will help full to them to apply in their transport phenomenon subject , such that all the basic principle from one subject will be related to other subject . soo it will like this , aperson go to a tv shop to buy a tv , the shopkeeper tell about the types of tv 's present in his shop , tels that one tv is having sound quality of 50 % and screen quality of 80 % and onther tv is of sound quality 80 % and screen quality of 100 % we choose the second one for better quality thus every student be perfect in all academic subject in sum , from my perspective it better to have a in depth knowledge of all the subject rather than having specialised in one specific subject ,
