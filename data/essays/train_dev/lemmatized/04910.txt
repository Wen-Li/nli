i will begin my essay by saying that i agree with this statement , and then i will go on in explaining why i feel this way . based on my own experience a a student , the most rewarding knowledge is the one that is cultivated by hard work , and understanding of the great idea that are behind the fact that are exposed to u . from what i can remember , the thing that i consider i have really learned in my life a a student are those that came from the process of trying to understand the logic and the dynamic of the problem i wa challenged to study , a opposed to those thing that i tried to learned by memorizing date , name and place . if anything , the only time when i have really come to learn and acknowledge important date and name in a relevant process in history , it is because i have taken the time to understand the logic of the historical sequence , so that i can place the event according to the idea and concept that are behind each episode in history . those student that learn only fact with nothing behind them , will sure be forgetting what they learned within a month , because the learning process did n't come form understanding the importance of those fact in an specific situation . the learning process , in the case of those student , came from the need to be passing through the course , test , and exam , without knowing if the thing they were asked to know were importante in their life , or their carrers . aside from that , i believe that idea and concept are tool that student have for their ongoing study , and also for life . once a person ha studied a concept , and ha struggled with the logic of it , and ha finally succeded into understanding it , that concept will last on in their mind forever a a tool to understand other process , or other concept . it is because of those reason that i believe that true knowledge come from understanding idea and concept , rather than from learning fact .
