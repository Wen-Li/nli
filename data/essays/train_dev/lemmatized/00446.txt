i totaly agree with that statement . people can find more thing to do when they are young . also , young people can have more ability to do something enjoyable than older people . that could be silly something to say when i am young because i do n't have any experience maybe that question must be asked older people . they would compere this better than me . but , of course , i have some idea and information to say . for example , i play soccer and really love it i ca n't think one day i am going to quit it . i mean l always think i 'll never be old . but , i know that is impossible . so , one day we will not be able to do what we want to do right now . even to think about that is horrible for me . that 's why a a young person i have been trying to enjoy until i lose my ability and power . on the other hand i do n't mean older people can not find anything to enjoy . otherwise , that would be better thing to commit a suicide for them . even altough everthing when there is a life there is a hope . people must be strong and keep their energy for ever . of course there must be some good thing to enjoy for older people . in same way , they can make themselves happy and they can put themselves in enjoyable life . that depends on their personality that can be changeable from person to person . finally ; considering everthing , a for me , young people enjoy life more than older people do .
