i dont think that there will be fewer car in use than there are today because every day the number of people who use car is increasing a i see . when i go out i with my friend , i can not hear her because of the car voice . wherever i look i see car covered all around me . and we see that it is getting worse and worse day by day.10 year ago i couldnt see so many car on the road but today people have to wait for hour to arrive home because of the heavy traffic . the situation is just for my country . if we think about all the country in the world , the number of car is horrible . in china most people use bcycles outside . but they are alone . even if thet do that car in use are increasing . if only all people in the world did that . if they did , the road would be very quiet and also the atmosfhere would be cleaner . but if we look today it is impossible that there will be fewer car in use . unlike today the number of car in use will have been so increased that we will not walk on the street . if it will continue like this it will damage the environment , too . we are damaging whole world and in twenty year we will not find anywhere to live . using car is also cause the decreasing in petrol . we are consuming so much petrol that it will not be enough . so we can not drive our car without it . maybe it will be better because if there is no petrol there will be no car . i think people have to be educated about this . while they are doing this they do not know that they are damaging both the environment and the atmosfher .
