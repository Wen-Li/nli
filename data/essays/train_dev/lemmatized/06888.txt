in my point of view , i am diagree with the statement , and these are my reason . first of all , because of different age , people enjoy their life in different way , but it doe n't mean older people donnot enjoy life . for example , compare with younger couple , instead of drunk and dance like mad . older couple are like to go to travel together and to recall their honeymoon . even thoungh it look pretty boring for younger people , but those moment are significant in the older people 's life . so older people actually know how to enjoy their time more healthy and more meaningfully . second , there are lot of thing that older people can also enjoy , such a younger 's favor thing -- party , club , and gem . older people like to go to somewhere that more quiet than the party room but they do enjoy dance with their lover and share their special beauty to the one who is important for them . and also they love to go to club to know more people and friend . for example , my grandmother lu to go to party and have fun with her friend . third , here is one thing that younger people can not undertand and enjoy but older people loved -- garden work . younger people assum that garden work are only for grandparent for their extra time . but actually it is not true , garden work is another way that show how much the older people enjoy life , because of time go by very fast , so the older people enjoy the moment that when their flower grew up , or their apple tree ha little apple and so on . because they undertand the joy to creative life and in order to enjoy life . therefore , in my opinion . older people know how to enjoy their life and even better than younger people . they wo n't do anything damage for their heath , they wo n't do any childish thing that bad for the community . they have their living style that provide for better living standard and quality . so these are the reason why i am disagree about the statement .
