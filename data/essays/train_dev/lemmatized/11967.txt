as technology ha been developed , many job and skill have been created . for example , bill gate who is the richest in the world and have company that related to computer program . history of the company that named ` microsoft ' is shorter than others . but bill gate knew what will the important thing become in the world . and not many people tried to these new part . that wa easy client of computer . he invented easier client . and he spread out to average user . i think that , like this example , trying new thing is better way to become successful people than only doing what they already know how to do well . here is some reason . first of all , there are le rival in new thing . for example , there were already a lot of coffee shop . so many investers struggled to make extraordinary shop . and also thet have to care location of shop and menu . because there are rival shop . but if someone try to new thing , he do n't have to care about the rival . as i stated about bill gate , when the new company developed new thing , there were any rival . they did n't worry about challenging with other company . so bill gate concentrated on his new thing . secondly , only doing what they already know how to do well is more dangerous than try new thing . as the age ha been changed , important thing are changed . for example , long time ago , laundry wa very important . because laundry machine wa expensive and hard to manager . so many people used laundry shop . but nowadays many company invented new and easy laundry machine . so many people have laundry machine in their house . and also many owner who have laundry shop had to closs his shop . for that reason , only doing what they already know how to do well is dangerouse for their work . because world trend ha been changing . for those reason , successful people try new thing and take risk rather than only doing what they already know how to do well .
