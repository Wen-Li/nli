is it better to know a little bit about everyting or everything about one topic ? this is a question that every student face during his academic career . but no teacher will ever answer it for you . in order to find an answer , there are many different level that must be considered . it will be usefull to look at the effect on the academic life , personal life and personal relationship . personally i believe that a broad knowledge is much better for most people . for your private life and personal developement a broad knowledge is more valuable than spezialized knowledge . a broad knowledge help you to handle all kind of different situation . you always have an idea what kind of solution may resolve the problem . for example if you have some knowledge about law , you can resolve many problem by yourself without an expensive lawyer . you could also help your friend who would be very gratefull . considering personal relationship a broad knowledge normally is more important . broadly educated people are able to communicate with everyone about everything without getting embarassed . in contrast , people with very specialized knowledge are likely to get a little lonely . they often talk to people with a similar knwoledge . if someone want to become an scientist and do some research , specialized knowledge is much more usefull than general knowledge . these day there is a specialist for everything and it 's not easy to find a topic to do research on . you have to know almost everything about your topic . so it 's very hard to get a board knowledge besides . so i think a broad knowledge is much better , unless you want to become a scientis . broadly educated people perfom better in their private live and are more sociable . they easier communicate with other people about all kind of topic . but this is a choice that everyone ha to make for himself depending on his plan .
