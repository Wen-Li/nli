i disagree with the opinion that there will be fewer car in use that there are today in twenty year , because , basically , i think it stay the same a many people like to have their private car . indeed , it is good to have public transportation mean such a , train and bus , a they reduces not only the traffic jam but also the pollution . and i believe , for such reason , there will be more high-advanced public transportation mean in the future and i can easily assume that many people may think that it may reduces the number of car on the road . however , at the same time , i believe that , even under such circumstance , many people still prefer to have their own private car . there are many people whose resident are not close to the stop-point of the public transportaion , especially in rural area . for instance , my uncle is living in a rural area of japan where it take fifty minute to get to the closest train station . and , there are many people who like driving itself . also , there are many people who really prefer to have private space even at the the time of commute . for example , i have a friend who really like to take car . i usually prefer to go for trip by train because , in that way , i do not need to care how to get to the destination and where to go to the bathroom . however , this friend living in urban area in tokyo , always go for trip by car even if it take longer time than going by train . he once told me that he prefer car to train and bus because it give him more private time and he doe not want anybody to bother while commuting . i believe this is true to many other person . many people think it is important to have private time . i think it is true that , if you are busy communicating people , then you feel frustrated and in that situation , people need private time . given all those circumstance , i still believe that , so long a people are a busy a now , even twenty year after , the there will be same number or even more car a it is now .
