when it come to learning fact , some people argue that it is easy way to understand some method . personally , i think that student are needed to understand idea and concept than to learn fact . this is because understanding idea and concept widen people intellectual and people can use these idea more practical way . first of all , student can broaden their intellectual horizon by understanding idea and conceps . in the case of learning fact , it is obvious that help people recognize some physical thing . however , these facial and physical thing only allows student to learn those fact . this would limites people 's imagination that they can not undertand above thing such a using other field . for example , one of the most famous scientist in korean , ho jin moon , once said that when he wa young , he had toughted by teacher who just conveyed fact information to student . his parent thought that these method would restricts thier son 's understanding so that they moved america . at there , he could take more idea based education and when he grows up , he returned to mother nation and have eagared to disffutes idea and concept based education . he argues that by taking this education student can undertants more in-depts knowleges . on top of that , people can use thier knowledge in practical way . in today 's society , people are bound and driven hectic schedule , this hectic atmosphere make people only focus on the fact so that they can not use thier knowleges only in few field . however , the basic idea and concept in education are liked each other . especially in science , if they undertand this basic concept , learning scientific concept is more easy . to demonstrate , according to a study released by the korean national research center , more than two third of surveyed scientist responsed that understanding idea and concept more important because by doing this , student can like thier knowledge not only thier major field , but also the other silimal scientific field . they said that electronic science can be useful in manufactualing engineering so that studnets who majoring engineering are needed to understand electronic sciendce basically . in conclusion , i strongly believe that student should focus on understanding idea and concept dut to they can widen their intelectuals horizon and
