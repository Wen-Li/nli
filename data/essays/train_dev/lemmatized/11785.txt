first of all i would like to agree strongly with the statment , because i am working a a lectuter at the faculty of education , and a you see this statment match my work closely , and due to my practical experince with the student i conclude that the human brain is composed of two main part , one is responsible for the logic , and the other for the memory , and i also found that it is better to the student to learn how to think rather than how to remeber , in another meaning it is better to the student to understanding idea and concept rather than to learn solid fact a it is for the followig reason : 1 - if we used to drive a solid fact to the student and make them remeber it during the exam , we make the do not use the logic part in thier brain a i mentioned befor , and that is lead to make them lazy to reach to any knoweledge alone without the help of the teacher . 2 - also the student who learned solid fact have n't the ability to solve any problrem out side the fact he learned , and that action kill the creativity inside them . 3 - but on the other hand , if we trained the student to thinking and to understanding idea and concept , we can improve the creation of th student and make them reach to the meaning of the fact by themselves . 4 - understanding idea and concept also help in the enhancing the two way communication between the student and rge teacher , becaause , a you now , there is a common role say that ( to understand you must to ask ) , and a aresult when you ask your two way communication skill improved . finaly i would like to mention that using the system of ynderstanding idea and concept will emerge a creative student , which after graduation they expected to be a good teacher having the ability to communicate good with their studens , and and also they expected to be a brightfull person in their community .
