it is more important for student to understand idea and concept than knowing fact . people should not only keep article or date from a textbook in their mind . dates where great war where held or milestone where set are easily available in today world wich is full with information . for example , only the knowing of the outbreak of the second world war , 1 september 1939 is an information anyone can get from any history book . but the reason for the start of the war , the circumstance how the nationalist came to govern the country and the reality that the reason for the second war are the obligation from the winning country to the defeated countriesat at the end of the first world war requires student to understand the reason , relation and connection of the main idea of any topic . another example is the manufactoring of car . a student may find out easily the number of car producted during a decade or the increase in the car production during the last 50 year , but the new live style wich ha the mass production of car brought with it , the effect on the society and the possibility to travel need more than learning statistic . there can be many example given . nowadays a student a can get many fact from libaries or the internet . so therefore i can say that not knowing fact , but understanding idea , concept , the relation between cause and effect are more important to learn .
