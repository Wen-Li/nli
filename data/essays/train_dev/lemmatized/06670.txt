in twenty year , the world will have evoluated . the transport will be more developed and high tech . nevertheless , we can ask u if the car will be also important than today or more . nowadays , the car enables to see the social level of someone even if some people spend more money than they have . but , the car is more and more crticized for many reason : there are too many car in the town , that polluates the environment and it kill a lot of people . indeed , this year , observators have seen than people were n't ready to spend a lot of money in the car . it show that mentality move . on the other part , the common transport are more and more efficiency . lot of effort are done for citizen circulate more easily and more quickly , in the best condition . a town like bordeaux , for example , ha discreased the number of the street for the car to enable the construction of the tramway . all is done to reduce the circulation in the town . there is also the fact that family prefer spend their money to buy something for their house . the confort at home is more important than before . people are more ofte in their house and want to have what is the best for their confort . it 's for these reason i think in twenty year there will be le car than there are today . people will use common transport and will have alone one car , and not two car a we can see it in few family .
