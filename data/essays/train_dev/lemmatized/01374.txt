in life , we are all seeking happiness . there are differents way we use to hope to gain this happiness . enjoying life is one of the important way that we all use to show that we are happy and the way we express it will depend very much on our age . for expample , a young person ( under 40 year old ) will seek the most intense way to enjoy life while an older person will seek long lasting happiness . in other wors , they do n't enjoy life more but differently . when you are young you are seeking temporary pleasure . you would like to have the most intense and the most recordable pleasure . you can not really think to tomorrow but how to do to take advantage of the present . furthermore , the subject that can make you happy is different wrether you are young or older . for example , for a ten year old child , a bycicle can be a subject of enjoying life . for a teenager it can be his his first love relationship and so one . however an older person will seek for a more lasting subject to enjoy life . he will never spend his time going on disco club or drinking a lot to show that he is happy . as they are more reasonable , they will enjoy life more cautiously but the result is the same a for the younger person . he will also feel happy . for example , for a 50 year old person , his subject of preoccupation is his retirement , his carreer 's end . .. so he will enjoy life for example by going on holiday , by finding the best way to finance his retirement . to conclude , i would say that young people do n't enjoy life more than older people do but they do it in a different way . young people are always seeking ephemere pleasure while older people are seeking lasting pleasure . the time that this pleasure will last will grow with the age of the person .
