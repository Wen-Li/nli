some people say that broad knowledge is better , but i believe tha to specialize in one specific subject is better for human life . first of all , new thing are innovated or discovered only by specialized knowledge in one specific subject . the cutting edge technology or art can bring about development of human life . for example , robot which aid handicapped people were not invented without special research in a robot thechnology . in the field of art , the computer graphic which entertains many people in film or tvs can not invented without computer . this example clearly show how the specialized knowledge contributes to the society . in addition , a worry that the society with only specialized people is biased and hard to live with is not true . it is because that various kind of people with special knowkedge can complement each others . for example , many manufacture company employ specialized people and make them research in special field . sometimes those specialist produce strange thing , but the specialist in other division can point out problem of the product . even if the odd product go out to a market , they do n't sell . consequently , specialistes realize they are wrong and improve their product , which lead to further innovation . this example clearly show that specialized knowledge doe not always make biased society . thus , people do not worry about that . for the reason pointed above , i am sure that specialized knowledge lead to better human life and should be respected more than broad knowledge .
