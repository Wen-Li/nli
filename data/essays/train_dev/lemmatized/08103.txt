i used to think that having a broad knowledge of many academic subject give people a widen point of view _that is to say a better one , a i thought_ on contemporary issue but i 've changed my mind . in fact , i realised for many reason that having this broad knowledge is unuseful to tackle real issue . to tackle an issue , you do have to have a broad knowledge , but a broad specific knowledge on this subject . you indeed need to have a very precise and accurate knowledge on this issue to understand the other issue it raise and to point out the consequence . this specific knowledge is in fact necessary to provide a serious work , to challenge the society and the governement for instance and to give solution . research in economic policy is a good example : it need a very accurate knowledge in economics to tackle real issue such a unemployement and to try to find solution to improve the situation . but we have to notice that this need an interest in other academic subject and other issue in order to be aware of the complexity of such an issue and of it consequence . let 's talk about unemployement , the economist ha to be aware of social consequence of unemployement because it is necesary to give good solution and improve the situation . to conclude , i want to underline the importance of a multi-academic subject learning during the study before specialisation , because the two of them are complementare .
