i do not agree that statemet , young people enjoy life more than older people do . to enjoy life , their age is not matter . most important thing to enjoy their life is having strong perpose to live . if people do not have certain perpose and reson in their life , they might to spoil their time . even they are still young , they will spend their precious time to just have some fun . i think enjoying life and having some fun time is not same . recently some american rich girl appeare on magazine , and they show their daily life-ltyle , go shopping , travering , atending party . they are rich and cool . but they seems not to have some special meaning to live . they just spend their time and money . people who have no money , no good-looking , but have strict aim to live and the pattion about his/her life , they can enjoy his/her life . in addition , aged people have much experience and more patint than younger people . and i think it is impotant poin to enjoy life .
