it is a general opinion that youngster do not give enough of their time in helping their community . i agree with this statement . in today 's fast paced life , hardly any youngster would even give this a serious thought . helping the community could mean something a simple a organising evening class for destitutes in the own hall , or organizing an event for the orphnage child , to collecting fund for building a new school or college . but how many youngster actually think beyond the day ' work ? consider the case of a student in high school . a typical day would begin at eight in the morning , class for the better part of the day , then maybe some soccer or piano lessions in the evening . and then , of course , the usual homework session that stretch into the night . not to mention the ` discotheque party ' that form an integral part of their weekly itenary . how are they supposed to find time in their ` busy ' schedule for community work ? even fresh graduate , just entering the job scene , are not spared . they have late night schedule , load of work , and very little time for anything else . even their family expect a portion of their time and energy . it is virtually impossible for them to squeeze in some time for a visit to an elder 's home or community centre to help out . there are a lot of expectation from someone who ha just entered graduate school or someone who ha got a new job . they put in their entire energy trying to live up to these expectation , and finally do not have the energy , or even the inclination , for anything else . if you consider their side of the story , it would seem rather unfair , considering their workload , if they had to put in some more effort for the betterment of their community . after all , they would say , `` are n't the clergyman supposed to take care of that ? '' but what they do not realize , is that each one of u ha to contribute , in the maximum possible way , to help our community . a proper division of time and workload would ensure that even college student and working youngster find enough time in their schedule to do their bit for their community .
