the knowledge are very important in the life , only those anyone cant stolen you because are in your mind , for this knowledge you can improve your development daily in your life , when the time go on in your life you learn different knowledge from different way . in my opinion im agree with the statement that it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subject the to specialize in one specific subject . for have broad knowledge of many academy subject you have to study a lot and paid attention to many thing for understand well for specialize in one specific subject you only have to focus in one subject and you may controlate all it derivates . with knowledge of many academic subject you can development various job because you have knowledge for that , with knowledge of many subject you are more intelligent person than with one specifct subject because the study of a lot of thing develop your capacity for think and for learn more and fast . the advantage of have knowledge of many subject are that you can find job in distincs office and you have more probability to join in one but those thing have a disadvantage too because you have to learn very well many thing and in specific subject the probability you dont have to learn much bue when you try to find a good with good pay is more difficult but if you have how work and you realize it fine you can find a good pay job .
