there is a recently discussion about if young people enjoy life more than old people do or not . as far a i am concerned , i think the young people can enjoy life more because of the characteristices of young people that is internatonl , mobilization and the ablity to communication . to begin with , with the advent of internet , the world we living in is becoming more smaller than before . today 's young people can easily get in touch with the most popular culture in the world . they are more international than their parent hence they can enjoy the movie in holywood from america , the most fashion clothes from paris and the most exciting football play from the endland . because of this , they enjoy the life more . furthermore , today ; s young people is mobilization . by car , train and air , they can travell to where they want to go . just contradicting the low quality of transporation their parent having in the past time , we can responbsible to say that the young enjoy life more . the young people can go sight-seeing and enjoy the magnificant culture all over the world . in addition , for the various way that people can make a communication , the young peole gain more stronger ability to communicate with others and it makse them more friend . during their study time they can meet lot of people who may be come from different place even country . those people all may help the young people or provide them many opportunity when they begin to work . so the young people can enjoy life more . but the old people may not enjoy so much friendship because of the limitation of way of communication . from what ha been discussed aboved , we can safety draw a conclusion that the young people enjoy life more than older people do .
