i believe strongly that the question seems to be controversial in one way and very relative because i can see that , it depends on person ' view and thereby the condition also under wich the travel is made . in one hand , a tour guide is not bad , if i will try to picture the why of a tour guide or it purpose actually , i can really go further to illustrate that . as i guess we all know nobody want to be unsecure or not well protected , or not well guided . why am i led to talk about people ? , for the simple reason that , travel is made mentionned and basically is ha to do a lot with people . for instance , if i have to talk more about the security aspect of the thing . when we see today , in the most technologicaly advanced century or age , the way people want to be secured ; tbe it political leader are guided or secured even country . it really show the long or the desire at the maximun of anyone wanting to be be secured . so from this point of view , i can really see that travelling in a group led by a tour guide is one of the good way of travelling in connection with some of the reason that i have announced previously . but i can also say that is not always necessary the only best way to travel . as i said formely , it can be relative i mean by also depending on people point of view of what is the best way of travelling . because for some people , during their travel , they use mean of transportation wich do not have a tour guide and all the same they qualify their travel always a being the best . so from this angle we really see the restriction of what is called best way of travelling wich is connected to being led by a tour guide .
