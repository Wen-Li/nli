i think yes ... the young people enjoy life more than older people do for example : the young people can go to a football match everyday and play a long a he want to if he is healthy sure . . but the old man cant go everyday maybe once in a week cauze he is too old and he cant run . .. and i think is the old man is busy with wriseng he child and be a good father like puting he child in the most famous school and that ofcourse need money soo he will always try to get the best job to get money for he child and he home , and that ofcourse dont leave time to hem to enjoy he life and see the beautifull thing in it . . except the weekend and maybe at the week end he will be tired from he work and he will sleep and lay-down for whole day . . but there are some young people who enjoyed there time by drug and drinking and that ofcourse is not an enjoying time for u . .. and i think that is the old people who spend there time at work or anything else are more enjoying from them that in my opinion . .. and i think is the young people will try to do everything new in their life otherwise the old man had finish doing he new thing when he wa a young man and ofcourse he will be borred from everythinig . . but i want to say that not every young man is enjoying he life more than the old man do . ..
