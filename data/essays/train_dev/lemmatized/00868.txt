happiness and enjoyment is a perception and ha no relation with age . i donot agree that young people enjoy life more than older people do . when a man is young , he ha to make a career and ha a lot of responsibility on his shoulder . though he is more physically active , but he may not have the resource to enjoy the way he want . his social and personal obligation would keep him occupied all the time . on the other hand a person who ha the time and resource and ha got the maturity to understand his need , can live a happier life . he know what would give him pleasure and would not merely experiment with thing . he know the value of time and money and would utilize it more effeciently . enjoyment is not just going to night club or do adventure sport . a person can enjoy a stroll in th park or a sun tan on the beach . but for enjoyment you need a relaxed mind . a mind free of tension and anxiety . i see more older men , who have achieved their goal enjoying life than their younger counterpart . i went for a cruise this year end with my parent and girlfrend . there were people from all walk of life and different generation on the ship . people were enjoying their heart out but to my surprise it wa the older people who were looking happier . there wa a newly married couple who were on their honeymoon and had a room next to me . i could listen to their fight every night . there wa another couple who didnot have much time to talk a the guy wa always busy on his laptop and the cellphone . majority of the young people did not look happy and satisfied . they had goal to be achieved . they didnot have time to sit back and enjoy their accomplishment . they had worry which could not leave them even on a vacation . a person who can not maintain a balance between his personal and professional life can not enjoy life . therefore , i feel an older person can enjoy life more than a young person doe .
