i totally agree with the statement that successful people try new thing and take risk rather than only doing what they already know how to do well . as we all know , creativeness and courage are very important quality that lead a person to success . as in nowaday 's intense competition , well-round development also play a crucial role . successful people are not a majority in the society . the reason they outstand others is that they find a new way that others have not found or dare not to go . the famous example of bill gates shed light on this point . bill gates went to a prestigeous university . however , he did not stay in school until gratuation , a most people usually do . instead , he quit school after two year and devoted to a new field interesting he -- computer , which wa then not common . the courage to try new thing eventually brought tremendous success to him . as one another contemporary successful entrepreneur , donald trump say , since you are to think , think big . this infers daring to take risk is also a stepstone on the way to success . if one only doe what he already know how to do well , he can do nothing other than this field . that is to say , even if he is second to none in this category , in others , he is nothing more than a greener . however , to be a successful people , expertise in a single , or limited range is far from enough . one must be well-rounded , at least knowledgeable in general , to get to success , which is not an easy case at all . after all , we can see trying new thing and taking risk reveal a person 's extinguishing quality such a creativeness , courage and well-round development , which are all indispensable factor to success . therefore , the statement is completely true .
