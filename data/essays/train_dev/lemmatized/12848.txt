enjoying life is not always directly related with the age . its actually requires both skill to be more dynamic a most of the young people do and to have more encourage a the older people have by their life experience . maybe the word of dynamizm may not be enough to explain how is important to have a certain attitute to enjoying life . the one first must be peacefull with own and with surrounding . then self-confidence becames and it make the people more relax . since most of the young people ha much le concern to worry about than i agree the young people ha more potential to enjoy life . also the chemically wise that for sure there is much more activity in the body of young people . it might help to be more healty and dynamic and make easy to live . even emotionally , it is correct that the younger people are more active than the older one . do you think , all these fact say u that the younger people can enjoy life more than older one ? mostly but not entirely . there might be still something missing i guess . young people are more suitable to get dissapointed by intersection between their great expectation due to huge imagination and the concrete tough rule of the reality of life . they are also more attent to take weong decitions due to their blowing blood and rush of everythin . how the people can be happy with this dilemma ? here the life experience come a a solution . while the one get more and more experience form the life - mostly the bad one - then gain more abilit to evaluate better the condition and to take better decision , so finally it would be better to be a older who have younger blood .
