i believe that successful people try new thing and take risk rather than only doing to do . because of two reason . first of all , succssful people usually think about new thing and keep trying to be successful . they may do not like to do same thing to the other . i think that they have a parsonality . however , if they want to do new thing , they have to spend a lot of time and money . in addition , they do not know that will be succeed or not . i think they may contribute a society or they want to get a good job . at second , they try new thing for some porpsose . for example , if they want to be more rich , they try to find more better job . because if they have personarity , they may invent something instead of money . in my opinion , i usually try new thing eventhough i had to take risk . for example , i came in u.s to study nursing in a university . when i came to u.s before , my parent did not permit me to go the university . in parent opinion that i do not need to go to and university and get a job in u.s , because i already have a nursing license injapan . finary . i pasuade to my parent , and came here . however , if i go to an university , i have to spend a lot of time and money . but i believe that it is the best choice for me to study inu.s . so , if i have many risk now , if ican contribute a society , i think that is valuable for me . in conclution , i think that people require knowledge and skill . they will not succeed without it and also they will have a risk . but if they satisfied about that , i think they should do that before think toomuch . because it will good opportunit . therefore , i think that people should try to new thing .
