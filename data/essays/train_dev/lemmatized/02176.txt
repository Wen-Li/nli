i totally agree with this statement . firstly , travelling in group led by a tour guide is convenient . leading by a tour guide , you may not have to worry about the issue during the travel . for example , you need not to think about which hotel you shoud choose to live in , where you have a meal , and which car or train you should take . every thing is arranged well by tour guide . only thing you need to do is to follow the group , see beautiful sight and enjoy them fully . also , you can get many knowledge and insight from the presentation of tour guide . tour guide is given good training or education on how to introduce the information about sight to tourist . in this sense , they are professional person who are most familiar with the information of sight . having a introduction from the tour guide , i believe all of you will get comprehensive knowledge without any effort . however , when you take a lonely travel , no one provides this kind of service and you may miss the best chance to learn about the world sight . moreover , there are often many people in a travel group . i am a sociable person and i like to do many thing with other people . i hate loneliness . of course , this include travel . also , making new friend is one of my hobby . traveling in a group meet all of my need above . at last , traveling in a group always mean low cost . it is well known that single travel spends much more than group travel . now i am not very rich and if i want to travel , i definitly choose group travel . because of all those benefit of travelling in a group led by a tour guide , i believe it is the best way for me to travel .
