i agree with this statement . i think that the young people enjoy life more than the older people do for many reason . the old people have to think some problem that the young people have not to think . for example , a old person ha to think at his or her work and his or her family . when a person ha got a family he or she ha to think his child but the child ha not to think anything because there are their parent that they think for them . i am 23 year and i know the difference between i wa 10 year and i am 23 year . now , i have to think many thing that i had not to think when i wa 10 year . now , i live alone and i have to do all the thing that i did not do . for exampe , now i have to cooking because there is not anyhing to do that for me . in addition , i have to buy my food and wash my clothes . in the other hand , when i wa a young child i thounght to play with a friend of mine . i liked to play football and i played football with my friend for many hour each day . in addition , i went to swimming pool with my friend and i stayed there all the afternoon . in the swimming pool i played volleyball with a friend of mine and we were very happy . now , i can not do that i did when i wa young because now , i have to go to work and i have not enough time to play football and to go to swimming pool . at the end , i agree with the statement above because when i wa young i enjoyed life more than i do now . i think that the young age is the most beautiful period of life that a person can live and i am sure that there are many other people that think this .
