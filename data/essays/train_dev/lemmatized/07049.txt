someone think that a concentrated knowlege is better than a broad knowlege of various field . however , it is so arguable issue because both case have advantage and disadvantage . however , i strongly believe that people should have a specialized subject for the following reason . fist of all , we should have a special skill or knowledge for getting a job . when i wa an high school student , my uncle lived in my home . he wa a gentlmen for my life . however , he could not get a job because he had no specific skill and knowledge . when he wa an university student , his overrall grade wa almost b - . he told me that people should have a specific knowledge in intereting field . he regreted his university life . however , he had broad knowlege of many academic subject such a physic , chemistry , art , music , and so on . at that time , i feel that i want to get a special skill or knowlege for my success . secondly , all subject are becoming more deeply . one hundred year ago , we do not know the special relativity . at the time , few physicist understood the speical relativity . however , i am a high school student in korea . i learned the special relativity in physic class . i heard that one or two thousand paper are published in a day in physic . espeically , all science are rapidly and deeply developed day by day . therefore , we should concentrate one or two subject for researching . another example is that we can not learn everything . although people should have a broad knowlege of many academic field , it is le than one percent of whole knowledge in the universe . in the view point , it is better to specialize in one subject than to learn various knowledge of many academic field . in conclusion . i strongly assert that people should concentrate on a special subject . first , we need a special skill or knowldege for a gob . second many field of academic subject are becoming deeply . to overcome this situation , we should study a special subject becasue recent knowledge should be a old one .
