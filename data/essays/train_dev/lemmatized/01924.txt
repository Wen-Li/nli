the question , whether it is better to have a broad knowledge of many academic subject or to specialize in one spefific subject is an issue of controversy . first , i am going to point out the most important point in favor of having a broad knowlegde of many academic subject . in my opinion it is very important to have a reliable basis of general knowledge in many different field of study , in order to be qualified for all upcoming challenge in future life . especially in our modern time , one can never be 100 % sure to be able to keep the same job during one 's whole carreer . this mean diversity is what count today . people need to be adaptive to new kind of task all the time , which will obviously work best , when they are educated a broadly a possible . on the other hand , there are also argument in favor of specialising in one specific subject . to begin with , i would like to point out that despite the advantage of having general knowlegde in many academic subjectes , this knowledge will always stay at quite a superficial level . it is simply not possible to get a deeper understanding of many different academic subject , a each one of them is very complex in itself . in order to work in a responsible position , i.e. a a doctor in a hospital , the general knowledge is not sufficient . this implies that at least for responsible profession it is absolutely necessary to specialize in one specific subject . in addition , human being are a very diverse specie . not everybody ha the same competency . this mean that people should be able to specialize in the area they are interested in and in which they are able to compete . for example a professional pianist might be very dissatisfied , if he had to go to class of economics instead of being able to go to more music lesson . to sum up , there are point in favor of having a broad knowlege in many academic subject and point that argue in the opposite direction . in my opinion , a compromise should be found : during the first year at an academic institution the student should be able to gain a broad knowledge of many different field of study but they should then be allowed to specialize in any area they want to , a nobdoy should be forced to study a subject they are not interested in .
