travelng is going to a place that is very famous or one that is your favorite . some like to travel alone while others love being in a group i had the experience of traveling singely a well a traveling in a group with a tour guide . i found a remarkeble difference in both . though travelling alone gave me the experience of being on myselfi i enjoyed travelling with a big group and a guide i very well remmember my trip to tajmahal with my friend . the trip wa full of fun . i wa taken care of and even i got the oppurtunity to take care of others . earlier when i went alone i can not forget how hard it wa for me continnue my trip despite of the morning sickness . and high fever . while travelling with friend i also realised how i can learn the joy of togetherness . i never felt lonely like my initial trip . with my friend i could share laugh , sing and dance too . which i wa unable to do a a single when i i went alone it hard to forget how boring it wa to see the castel . i dint hire a guide . i just glanced around and came out . but this trip with the guide helped me to understand the importence of the place . i could even go back to the history . of that time the guide wa a very witty person with lot of humor . so any information he used to give he , first he used to make u many gu , which really made the site and subject very intresting . though the advatages of going alone are solitude and . . decesion making i enjoy to travel with freinds and if i am going to a very new place i will always preffer to take a guide along .
