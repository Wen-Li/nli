some people like to travel in a group tour led by a tour guide , but others like to travel a they like without a tour guide . i definitely like the latter type of travel . if you travel in a tour , your schedule are usually already decided . it is good for some people because they do not need to worry about the place they go and the transportation they need to take to get each place . however , the tour schedule might not include the specific place where they really want . also , a for the time , if they want to stay a place longer , or if they happen to find a place where they want to stop by on the way of the tour , they can not do that in a tour . when traveling not in a tour , i think people can enjoy the place and the culture there more . when i went to australia to travel from japan by myself , i needed to speak english all the time , but it wa great chance for me to talk with local people directly . in the tour , usually the tour guide take the responsibility for everything , and you have le chance to contact local people and stop by the local and small store and restaurant . also , if you do not join the tour , you even do not have to decide the schedule beforehand . you can just do whatever you want and go wherever you feel after you get to the place . you can ask the recommendation to the local people or other traveler ' there . from my experience , i think there are many small but good place where the regular tour do not visit . it might be nice to join a tour when you want to travel but you do not want to think anything and just follow somebody . however , i think the travel is kind of an adventure , and that it is one of the fun part in the travel to think and plan the place where i go and the schedule for my own trip .
