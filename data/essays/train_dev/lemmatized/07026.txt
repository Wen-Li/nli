i agree with understanding idea and concerpts are more important for student because the idea and concept help u to understand the fact . when we learn something in our class or on textbook , the first thing come up is the theory or concerpt . then professor will explain the concerpt . later on , he give student some example to help u to understand it , why professor or textbook always give u a theory , then provides some fact to explain the theory ? after we learn a concept , we need to totally undersatnd it . so we need an example , even some fact to explain the concept . it is a easy way for student to learn . second , after we understand the idea , we always can use the concept to expalin other thing . we can use the idea that we learn in diffrent way . for example , when we use a camera to take some picture . we understand the relationship between light and curve mirror . we can make a simple camera base on our knowledge . third , the fact can not reflect everything . everyone give a respones differently because people are different from their family background , education and friend . they have vary opinion about a same fact . on the other hand , idea and concept are always the same , they never chnage . finally , fact can tell u what have happened in the world . but if we do n't have some idea or concept , what can we deal with some problem ? if we have some acknowledge , when some fact come up , we can explain how they happen . likes , everydays news talk about the federal reserves raise the interest rate and a bloom of an expansion in us . we know the fact but we do n't know why it happen , how it is going to be . concepts help u to understand more about our surrounding . in my conclusion , i think understanding idea and concept is more important for student to learn . they can have basic concept , then they have ability to explain about thing . moreover , they can use their knowledge to becaome their skill . then concept vary not depend on different people . and idea and concept help to understand the fact .
