yes this is a statement what is usually expressed by person of the older generation ! i generally disagree with the statement that the young generation do not help there community . ok there might be some case were young people have a little bit forgotten there community . but if you look at the bigger picture this is not the case . young people are very much engaged in ther social surrounding and they are trying to help where they can . maybe the view discribed in the statement ha occured because of differing standpoint . persons of older generation may have a different definition of what your community is . today in a globalized world the community ha broarded a lot . possibly your community can exist on many diffent place . if you help then in your community it might not be obvirus to a person who look just on one spot . i believe that all these young people who leave there country to help in a country of the third world consider this place far away from home also a there community . another thing what make it today more difficult to measure the amount of help you offer to your community is the factor that it is more common to help or e.g. to do some social work in your community . in the past e.g. environmental protection wa a quite new experience for the society a a whole . therefore person who fought for environmental protection in there community might have been much more visible for others . today such thing are normal and everybody expects them to be there . meaning that person who believe that young people do not help in there community should redirect there focus to the changed world of today . ok there still is one point to consider . today competition in education is much bigger than in the past . therefore it could happen that some young person are simply to busy to help in there community . but generally this is not the case .
