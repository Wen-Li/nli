i 'm not agree with that affermation . i have a grand-pa , 85 year old . and he is planning to go with me in the north of europe , for watching the ice-berg , next summer . he would like to do that with his big old car , and doing this big trip along the europe , alone , with only his grand-child , 18 year old . he is , for sure , a person that is enjoying his life . i know also people , that are in the best part of theire life and that love to stay in front of the tv , playing with the play-station , waiting to became old . we usually link young people to the energy , when i think about a baby , i think life , movement and when i think about an old person i think something slow , unlively . because that is the stereotype . since the ancient time the young people where the people in the spring of theire life , unlike the old people that where in the winter of theire life . but now i do n't think that that is true anymore . if people want to feel alive inside , they can do that at all the age that they want . i know a person in india , she is really old . and the last time that a friend of mine went to visit her in her country , she asked to that friend to prepare some casset with word in italian , because she would like to learn italian . is not that amazing ? she ha more than 80 year old , and she want to find the energy to learn italian , and maybe one day visit our country . that is something that stimulate me a lot . to be young or to be old , at this time , it is not depending on the age of the person but it depends only on how a person feel like .
