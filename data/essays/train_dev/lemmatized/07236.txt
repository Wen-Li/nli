i have a quite open opinion about the statement that `` in twenty yearsthere will be fewer car in use than there are today '' . on the one hand i would totally agree this . each day you can read somewhere in the newspaper , how the price if petroil increase from day to day . petroil reached his highest price and there might be no decrease in the next year . as well a the limited oil reserve which begin to reduce every hour , it will be difficult to drice a car . perhaps people will wake up and use the public transport , like the bus or train . that would lead to a better environment , because pollution and noise would reduce . as we could also see with the transrapid the public transportation development is great . on the other hand we all see that there is no ending of new car producing . nearly each inhabitant over 18 - year ha once drove a car . unfortunately for a lot of people , car are a symbol of standard and lifestyle . they like to express their positon in the society . some also dont want to give up driving a car , because it is a comfortable way of getting somewhere quick and easily . for a lot of people , especially men , car are more than only a thing to transport them . it is a playing thing , which they like to show and compare with others . conclusively , i think there will be fewer car in twenty year because some people in future have to stop driving their own car . insurance and petroil will become too expensive , when the price will further increase .
