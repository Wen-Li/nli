in my opinion both type , the understanding of idea and concept and the learning of fact , are important . one reason is , that student who just learn the fact of course have a great data bank but it 's just learned by heart , they do n't see any connection . to see those connection the student have to take a look at the idea and concept of what they learn . another reason is that student , which just learn by heart everything , are not a able to make a decision a student who see more than just the fact . for example , a history class talk about an important happening in their country 's history . on the one hand they have to know the date and why something ha happened , without this it is impossible to talk about the reason and the consequence , but on the other hand it is needed that the student understand the idea which leaded to this happening . only with this both kind of study combined it is possible to have a productive discussion and a succesful education . finally i disagree with the statement , because i think that it 's not possible to choose between one of the kind of studying . the student need both to get the best out of their education and so it 's important to use both type for studying .
