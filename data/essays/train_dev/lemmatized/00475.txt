i feel to have specialize in one specific subject because of various reason . initally , a we are concentrating only on single specfic subject of our interst , it provides lot of scope to study in detail of subject rather than , superflusilly . i feel that having little knowledge is always dangerous because , it may result in many problem . for , example if i know a driving car partially and i go for a ride then this may lead to accident . any student or professor who concentrate only on single subject produce very good result . for example if we consider scientist `` albert einstein '' who concentrated only in physic and produced great equation ( e = mc2 ) which is basis for famous princlple `` theory of relativity '' .which is used in all nuclear reaction , to measure the relative velocity between to moving object ... etc . if we specalize in single subject we can understand concept involved in subject in an effective way . let u consider if i am specilazied in commincations then there would be lot of scope to get recruted in communication company rather than , the person with half knowledge in that subject . many universites an college suppot to specilaze only in single subject a they provide in their finall semisters or in post graduation subject of student interest i.e .. , elective . this provides student to encourage in field of his / her own interest with out forcing to no each concept . so , i finally feel going for single subject is the best way to learn and understand a it provides scope for doing research in our interested field of study . i feel that half knowledge is just like `` half cup is always empty '' it never get filled up . as there are plenty of oppurtines in specific field student should choose subject of their to excell in their academic and be a good citizen to country .
