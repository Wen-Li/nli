i 've lived all my life in a scholar system that gave student a broad knowledge of many academic subject only in elementary and medium school . then , when student are 13 year old , they have to choose a quite specific area that interest them . so i can believe that this is the best way of learning , and so this system , ho give people a perfect mix of general knoledge , and specific knoledge is very useful for future life and work . in fact , in this set of scholar system , all student have a basic knowledge of every subject , and then they can choose the most interesting subject to specialize themselves . when student finish the basic course , they have to make a first step for their career : choosing their superior school . superior school are different in their main area of interest . this area make student free to choose the subject that they prefere , however going on depeening the basic subject studied in the past school . this area are very useful for university , because if you think you will be an architect , you choose a school that have a most importants subject design , and math . so with the superior school , and then with university , knoledge could be specializated in one specific subject . i think that this is the right way to learn , because for having a good career , you need to be very prepared in your own subject , but it is also quite important to show that you have also a general culture of other subject . in conclusion i think that it 's very important to have a general knowledge about many subject , that composes the general culture of a person . but i think also that is very important to have a specific knowledge on the subject needed by future work . this is because a deep knowledge is usefull for succeding in a good career and to demonstrate being able to do your own work .
