successfully completing the tasks of life in the following i want to take issue on why people wanting to be successful should try new and risky thing . where would we be if people wanting to make progress did not affront new challenge ? is confronting yourself with new challenge and unknown task not always connected with taking a risk ? so this mean , taking risk is what make people advance and this again i consider a being successfull . experiences like going to a new school , moving in a new apartment and having a new neighbourhood or start a new job or just do some bungee jumping , give the person carrying out the action a new point of view of life . the new living circumstance challenge him to get out of old pattern of behaviour and she/he will start to reflect on his captivites , no matter what captivity it is a social , professional or just a physical one . having this new point of life permit you to enhance your horiyon and allows zou to go step further . all in all , this mean to me going succesfully through life .
