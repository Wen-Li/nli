i would definetly disagree with the statement `` young people enjoy life more than older people do '' . i have two reason for this . one is because it is the thought that make a person enjoy their life or not , and the other is because eventhough i have only lived for 18years i have never hade a time that i thoght i enjoyed my life more when i wa younger . i offten hear old people say that they enjoyed their life more when they where young and when they could move more rapidly . however i also heard a person say that they enjoy every bit of their life sine the day of birth . i agreed with this person . the man said `` it is all in your mind , like or dislike , love or hate , enjoying or not . all that you think come from your mide . so you could find your life enjoying or not by how you think '' . what i noticed from this wa that the people that start to feel depressed form the horror of gradually becoming old , not able to move or do somethings that they use to be able to do and etc are the one that believe young people enjoy life more than older people do . on the other hand the people that constantly think of new thing to do find them self enjoying their life . and another fact is that the depression could be cured by medication or modern science . in my case i know that i would go out and find new thing even when i get old . i might not be able to walk without a stick or might even not be able to get up from bed , but i know that by one change of thinking everything boring could be interesting . in conclusion , i belive that old peole could enjoy their life a much , or more , than young people do . it is all about how you think and respond to your thinking . you could think all you want , but to make a diffrence you would need to make some action .
