i personally agree with the given statement . in a natural way , everybody try to challenge himself . there is always something new to learn or to do . life is full of surprise and possibility . most successful people enjoy their life a beeing successful , but they also feel the desire to do something else . this could be to work on a voluntary base or to do another job . it is satisfying to them to know that they already achieved a lot in life because of their study , experience and their education . still , they want to do more , some to gain a higher position within the firm they are working at , others just to challenge themselves . the reason might be to earn more money , but also to lieve a le stressful life . doing the same job every day might get boring with the time passing by . this way people are open to try something new . i think that doing another job apart from the main one one is doing , might be stressful and risky . doing another job mean to put a lot of effort , time and also work into it . this might lead to stress because there is not that much time left for hobby , family or relationship . it is difficult to be successful and parallel to that to live a pleasant and happy life . many people who are successful are always in a hurry and it seems that they do not have the time to appreciate little thing in life . in my opinion , though . they do a lot more than others by doing other thing than just doing what they already know how to do well . having the chance to try out new thing probably make people happy . some like their job a lot but there is also another thing which they do not want to miss doing in their life . it is also good to show the talent which god gave u . especially succesful people are motivated . they also have the money to afford doing new thing . this is why they should take their chance and feel free to do whatever they want to do . this might lead to recognition within the town they are living in and also satisfaction throughout themselves . people who are successful often like to do something that make them forget work . life get a little belanced and they feel better . i imagine that successful try new thing like sport or voluntary work . they might have their own business which is connected to risk , because there is not the guarantee that it will go well and turn out to be popular . others might lead a sport group or teach older people foreign language . to me it would be important to work woth other people and to try to help them out . all in all , successful people who take a risk in trying out new thing feel more balanced and more satisfied .
