i disagree to travel is in a group led by a tour guide . there are several reason . first , i want to many free time to travel , but tour is not enough to take free time . usuraly , go to somewhere together group member . i can not free walk and look interested in something . secound , i like go to unknown place . so , i want to way of meself look for new place , food , hotel , and any more . finally , i think maybe no guide to travel is occur to something trables , but these trables later good memoris . memory is important to travel . there are my opinion that is not to the best way to travel together a tour guide .
