whether it is more important for student to undersant idea and comcepts than it is for them to learn fact ? when facing with this question , different people may have different opinion . in my opinion , to understand idea and comcepts sometimes is more important for student than to learn fact . my reason for this are a follows . firstly , many knowledge in our world are the idea and concept of thing . sometimes it is difficult for u to reach to the fact because the technology we 've got today doe not have the ability to do it . for example , when we study biology , there are many thing about our human 's body that we ca n't explain how do they work , such u the memorial system in our brain . we can only guess it according to the limited consequence . so most of the time we only have idea and concept on these thing . students who can understand the idea and concept can help them develop their way of thinking and proceed their reserch . secondly , the knowledge in some scientific area are very abstract . it is very difficult or sometimes even impossable to learn the fact . the art , for instant need u to feel . the idea and concept of an artistic work is the only thing we can use to understand it . they do n't tell u the fact . in addition , to understand idea and concept help u to posse the ability of using the knowledge . if a student only know to follow the fact and never think about it , he or she probably do n't know how to use it . their mind will be stucked with no personal opinion and wide imagination . to sum up , nowadays , the most important tallent for a student i think is the creation . and if we always think of the idea and concept of the thing and try to understand them will help you a lot .
