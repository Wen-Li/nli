i do n't think that learning fact is le important than understanding idea or concept : both are demanding skill of our society and are useful in different situation . there are situation that require the ability of understanding idea like those in which a student is asked to solve a new problem . but there are also situation like a scientist in a laboratory where either he know how the chemical reaction is being evolving or he risk serious damage . in other word , sometimes it is essential to know fact . we can capture another aspect if when comparing this two activity we argue that learning is not so expensive like understanding . i do n't believe that . for some people it is very difficult to keep in mind even a telephone number , so i think that the cost of learning may vary from one individual to another . in conclusion it depends from the situation . mathematicians are notably asked to understanding idea , but are we sure that they also do n't learn fact ? no .
