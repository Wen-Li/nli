some people say that young people enjoy life more than older poeple do . however , personally , i disagree this opinion . i think that older people can enjoy life more than yonger people . i will give you some reason to support my choice . my primary reason is that older people have more time and money for enjoying their life than yougers . youger people , like studesnts have a lot of thing that they have to do . so i don ' t think that they have much time for spending life really . in fact , now i 'm studing art at the bunsai college . in bunsai collefe student learn art and english every day . teachers both art and english at bunsai always give u a lot of assinments . so students always are busy . they also can not have a little part time job . as a resolt , we have no time and no money . this every day life give student strong stress . other reason is that older people have more experience than yonger people , so i think that they know real good thing for enjoy life . for exsample , i have a lot of kind of interesting thing . for example , drawing picture , dancing , singing a song , i want to try to everthings . but time is limited . i think that older peple will be able to chooce a best way rapidry . as a reult , they can spend time usefully . therefore , i disagree with that young people enjoy life more than older people do .
