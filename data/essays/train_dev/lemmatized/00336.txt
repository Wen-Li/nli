i would not agree with the statement that in twenty year there will be fewer car in use than there are today . i believe the car increase rate will be reduced , however , there will be more car in twenty year time . first , car have become a necessity in today 's world . society is growing at a super fast speed , and a high efficienty is needed for people to maintain the modern tight life style . we have to admit that car , a the fastest land transportation mean , save u a lot of time in our daily life . people do not want to use too much time to stay on the road , which is considered a a waste of life . also , the modern city tends to be larger and larger in size , and there is usuarally huge distance between people 's home and their work place . this situation also brings the necessity of the usage of car . let u take beijing for example . beijing is much larger than 10 year ago , and many people would like to buy house in the rural place where the housing price is lower , while they have to work in the central city . can you imagine what it woud be like if these people do not have car ? they will spend half of the day on the road , or even more . and in the near future , i can not see any possibility that car number will be reduced . however , we can not ignore what harm the huge number of car have brought to our environment . the green house effect ha made the climate warmer and warmer . the scientist pointed out that , if the temperature keep growing at such a speed , our continent will be flooded one day , and by then , we would have no place to live . the atmosphere is no longer a clean a before due to the huge amount of wasted gas that car have produced . it is causing a slow negative effect on humanbeing 's health . public awareness should be raised to limit the number of car , and actually many country have taken measure already . in singapore , the government limit the number of car by charging a high tax rate , and fewer and fewer people can afford car . taking this issue into consideration , i strongly believe that the number of car will not be increasing a fast a now , in twenty year time . in conclusion , we can not omit car , because they are playing so important a role in our daily life . however , we have to learn how to use car properly , without destroying the environment we are living in . i think more and more people will be aware of this fact , and in twenty year time , the car will not increase a fast a today .
