i disagree with this statement . because not everybody like what i like and i dont have to like what everybody like . thats why i would rather go alone . but there might be somebody like me , which i mean by this is any person who like to do stuff that i do or like the thing that i like . i am really sorry to continue like this but right now i am taking the test in a room with 5 more person other than me and we all are taking the test with the computer . but right know i am in the writing section and some of u are still in the speakin section and i really can not concentrate on what i write . also it been on all the section because we use the head phone it make alot of noise and it seriously very hard to stay on task . i really study for this test and i wa hoping that i would do good in this test but under this condition i dont think i did good . i guess i will have to retake the test . i just wanted to tell you what i felt about the stuation . thanks
