i agree this statement . in moderm time , advertisement for product is a very important marketing statege . the industry want have a good sale on their product , then they need to make attracive advertiseings to consumer . therefore , most of them were made over to show it product quality that they really have . i make some example to support my opinion . first , they are over imagination on advertisement . like some liquard product advertisement , we can see offen on the tv . in a pretty hot day , you get a cool drink and drink it , and then you will feel the weather becomeing cold and forget the deady hot weather . i think this will not really happen when anyone drink the prioduct . they will never say what is not good for human , like soda , if you drink it everyday instead of water , you will gain weight a lot and also will cause some disease for body . second , it is not ture for the product on advertisement , i remember i have seen a comercial is about battery . they put their product into a robert and compare another unknowen company 's product which put into a same robert too , and then they test which battery can keep more time to let the robert move . after this , i have bought the company 's product and used , but i did n't recoginze what is really big different with other brand . not all the advertisement tell the real turth that their product is . next , they make everyone seems want to purchase their product . like some advertisement show people want to take the last staff make a long line or even fight to each other for this staff . it make consumer confuse that this product is every important for them , so we have hurry to buy it early or you ca n't buy it anymore . there is overshow why this product we really need it . we need more information to support this product is we real want or not .
