i strongly agree with the idea that successful people are eager to learn new thing and they like taking risk instead of doing what they have known well before . which three feature do you think will certainly bring the success ? well , i think openness to experience and taking risk make a person wiser , more creative and more motivated which are the most important feature . firstly , trying somethig new always make u gain more knowledge about the world sorrounding u . everyday we need to learn so many thing since the technology develops so fast . knowing many stuff about plenty of issue will make u wise and successful people at the end . secondly , we become more and more creative since we activate our brain so much in the learning process . we make many connection about different discipline and issue in the daily life . the artist and scientist are very good example of this phenomenon . lastly , wanting to learn something new and taking risk lead to increased motivation in people . for example , i believe that i would not have such a big motivation if i wa not interested in many area of life . to sum up , in the modern world if we want to be more successful , we need to take risk and develop ourselves by new experience and knowledge . these will also make u wiser , creative and highly motivated individual .
