there is on doubt that , young people play a an ever-increasing important role in our society , because they are more creative , active and vigorous than adult people in many aspect . however , i agree that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their community . first of all , young people nowadays pay too much attention on their study . because of the more and more competitive educational circumstance , young people are indused to spend a great deal of time on study and preparing for exam , decreasing their concerning about other thing such a family chore , community activity , to name a few . for instance , my community hold a feast festival on the moon festival every september ; unfortuneately , the date is close to young student ' mid-exam , there are very few young people helping to organize the feast , not to mention attending the feast . moreover , in the recent decade , people tend to have only one or two child in each family ; accordingly , young people nowadays do not have many sibling to get along with . the phenomenon lead them to more self-centered individual , rather than team-work person . they care much more about themselves , such a school achievement , personal pleasure and interest , evaluation from peer ; namely , some public affair like community service is not likely to draw their attention . to conclude , young people indeed play an important role in our society in that they are the future generation , and what they tend to be meaningfully influence what our world is going to be . i believe that young people are more intelligent and creative than adult people ; also , they are sure to make our world better . but , if young people can concern more about public affair to learn the spirit about teamwork , contribution and mutual help , they can contribute to our world much more , since our modern society can not operate through independant individual , but cooperation .
