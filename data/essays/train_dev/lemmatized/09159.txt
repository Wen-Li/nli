in my opinion , it is more imnportant for a person to have a much extensive knowledge of a variety of academic subject a he or she can because of two good reason . firstly , it could be considered to him and others a his bachkground knowledge and experience of life . secondly , some knowledge of everything is preferable that one might someday be in need of the use of that type of knowledge , and employ it in his or her own life . on the other hand , being epecialized in only one subject and forget about knowing a little from and a little from therer might make someone ignorant when he or she is exposed to situationms where he or she is required to make a response to a general knowledge stimulus . one 's life is not limited only to book and what he or she is specialized in . in my society , when people gather at a party or any similar occasion , they do not just sit there . they talk about any topic that might interest their life or thinking . for example , during my brother 's wedding last week , people ha discussed the impact of terreorist people on tourism in the middle east . i wa personally astonished to know from common people that the number of visiting france is double the number that visit the middle east every year . what puzzled me more , is the source of the information . another important issue here is that we should not limit our knowledge to book because what is ion book is mostly hypothetical , and what we need in our life is some kind of knowledge that can be practical and benefitial . so , do we sometimes need to use that general knowledge we have ? the answer to thgis question might lie when any of u face a problem and think of a solution . provided our knowledge is limited , we may not be able to find a solution to that problem ; if the problem requires some knowledge of physical law , or some chemical background . we do not need to be specialized in one field and when we have a small problm ask for help . thus , our general knowledge of different subject definitely help u to avoid every day trouble or have suggested soultions to problem that need a specialist .
