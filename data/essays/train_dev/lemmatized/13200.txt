i think this is the main porpuse of the advertisement , make to believe people to adquiere their product because they are very useful , attractive or is going to solve most of the problem that are making you mad at the moment . but the real deal here , is that advertisement are a brain washer for everyone that see them . in country of the first world most of them , are very persuasive and make you buy that product . they use all the tool and all the medium to get thru your eye . the ad in the tv , are so colorful and so vivid that you realy like them and al last you finish buying what the ad wa promotionig . the technology ha become a real advantage for the human kind , and the big corporation use this , in their big company to make this advertisement . everybody can see this on tv , hear then in the radio , they even stick big sticker in the bus , pul masive picture in the big avenue , in the top of the building . in the bathroom you can do 2 thing at the same time , while somene is doing they natural physiological need the marketing is attacking you in the poster or even in the small tv screen tagged in the wall . getting out of the point just bit i believe the advertisement are a waesting of money , which only the big company get benefit and none people that really need it i know that probably saying that sound hilarious but it should be a law againt this masive weasting of money , we have to end the domination of this company who ruled this world . is impossible that it happend but imagine if they save this quantity of money and with it give it to the person who need it for real . they will help to build up a better world with better opportunity for every one .
