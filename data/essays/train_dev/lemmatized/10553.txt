in my opinion , young people do enjoy life more than older people do , there are many reason why i agree with this statement . i will mention these reason in the following paragraph . to begin with , for health matter , young people have a smaller risk to have physical damage , in contrast with older people , therefore they can allow themselves to do crazy experience . of course this doe not mean that younger people are free from health problem . in addition , young people are not yet aware of what life is really about or the outcome it will take . this way , the sensation of an excitement of discovering it meaning is provoked in these youngster . moreover , older people are known to get sceptic due to the trouble that they might have faced during their early year of their life . therefore , they can not enjoy life a much a the younger people do because they already have done all their great experience . usually , during the early year of one 's life , it is the time when one meet it first love , which completes a life leading to pure delight . although , elderly people can have a love in their life , their marriage or having child already belongs to the past , for them . when one enters in the older year of one 's life , a sense of tranquility is felt meaning that life is not enjoyed a much a the previous year . for me , one enjoys life when one remains in constant activity because he can feel he is alive . in conclusion , young people enjoy life more than older people mainly due to the fact that older people have already had their time of real enjoyement in their life and their nature is to slowly fade due to the fact that their life go at an end . of course , there are some exception where young people do not enjoy their life fully and older people do . although , this is not the common behaviour known today .
