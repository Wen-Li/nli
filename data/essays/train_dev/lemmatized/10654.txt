first of all , i agree with the statement given here that `` the best way to travel is in a group led by a fow guide '' my first reason is , a we go to a new palce , we may not be knowing how the place will be , how will be the behaviour of the people , what their culture is , what their custumes are , whta their tradition is etc . if we go to some american countires , we may find some difficulty , understanding their language and aslo we can not understand their accent eventhough their speak english . for example suppose you planned to go france . the language the people speak there is french . you may not understand french . here you need a guide . my second reason is , if the palce you planned to tour a historic place without a guide , you finally end up with the rockey structure you saw there . as each historic place ha a history behind in the main purpose of visi is to know it history . as we are not familiar with the palce and it history , a guide it is right person to expalin it . fot example , take an instance o vising mahabalipuram , a famous historic site in india . it 's all filled with temple made ofrock , carring on stone etc . we need a guide to expalin what rocky strutures are . and lastly the important thing is fullfilling the purpose for which have spent the money , let suppose you have palnned an europe tour . but you did not have a proper person with you to expalin their what is the purpose of visiting is not knowing any thing .
