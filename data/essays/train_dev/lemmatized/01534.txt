i do not agree with this statement . this essay will explore my reasoning why i do not support the statement that understanding idea and concept are more important than it is for them to learn fact . first , i believe that learning is a step by step process . understanding idea and concept , and learning fact are both form the crucial step of this process . if one step is missing learning can not be completed . for example preparing a meal requires some necessary step . if the cook ha all the ingreditens and the cooking pan but nevertheless he doe not have an oven there will be no meal . i believe that it is the same in learning a well . if someone understand all the key point and concept but doe not learn the fact the learning can not be completed . second , this statement doe not explain clearly which kind of subject are the main aspect of the discussion . as some meal do not require cooking such a a salad , in some subject area learning the fact is not necessary a understanding the idea and concept . for instance especially in social science understanding the issue matter most than learning the fact since student are required to form their own fact through analyzing the idea . however in scientific subject such a chemistry or biology understanding the idea will not be enough and learning the fact is crucial . for example a chemistry student can understand that the idea of exploding element but he need to know the result what happens if those element come together . as being a fourth year business administration student i do not remember a time when just understanding idea were enough for me to learn a subject a a whole without knowing the fact . i believe that idea and fact go hand in hand in the process of learning . in conclusion this statement miss out the importance of the different learning requirement of different subject area and discourages student from trying to learn the fact . no matter what is the level of importance of the fact on the subject area , a i mentioned before the learning process is a step by step process . thus , without the step of learning fact it will not be completed a it is supposed to . many people do not even eat salad without chicken or beef in it , so even salad sometimes require cooking . therefore i believe many student may need to know the fact of a subject whey they understand the idea of it a well .
