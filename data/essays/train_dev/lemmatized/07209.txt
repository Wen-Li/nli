with the rapid development of our society , more and more people can afford travel , whether short-distance or long-distance , internal or oversea . but which manner do you perfer ? to travel in a group led by guide or travel alone ? different people hold different opinion due to their distinct background . as far a i am concerned , i perfer the former opinion to the latter one . my point of view can be greatly substantiated by the following discussion . the first important reason in favor of my position is that the tour guide in the travel agent are all trained and know much more information about the resort than any tourist , whether the story behind the scenery or the entertainment information . in the second place , another convincing reason for my propensity is that the expense in group travel will be much lower , due to the scale economy effect in travel industry . this point also deserves some word here . last but not least , guide-leading group is also conductive in some other area , for instance , we will be much more safety in group and can make friend with the people in the tour group , whom we never heard of before . admittedly , traveling alone also ha undeniable merit , for example , you can enjoy more freedom and more private space . but when the advantage and disadvantage of the traveling in tour group and traveling alone are carefully examined , the most stricking conclusion is self-evident . to sum up , due to the reason mentioned aboved , it is not difficulty to draw the conclusion that traveling in the group led by a tour guide shoud be taken into consideration when people want to have a trip . there is not a easy solution to such a complex issue , however , taking into account all the dimension of the issue discussed above , might be the first step out the dillemma .
