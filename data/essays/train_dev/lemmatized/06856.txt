i agree with the following statement . i have two reason why i agree . the first reason is because the fuel is getting expensive . as everybody know , the fuel in the earth which are used in large amount of machine and building are getting le . so the gasolin which provide energy for car is also getting expensive . then the people who us car will stop using car so often , and start to walk or use bus or train . the second reason why i think the car in use will be fewer , is bacause of the enviroment problem . the dioxigen which is include in the exaust from the car , is damaging the ozon which is covering the earth . and it is still been damaged . to stop damaging it , people have to stop providing dioxigen . so people will have to stop using car so often . this is the two reason why i agree the statement .
