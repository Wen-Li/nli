i disagree with the statement . i believe that older people enjoy life much more than younger people do . there are several reason why , first of all is that older people have more experience and can have a better idea of what they really want out of life . on the other hand , young peple tend to be undicided on what they want . second , older people knowing what they want , tend to be more appreciate of life since they probably have encountered hardship to get to the point where they can enjoy life . with young people is the opposite . they do not have the experience nor have faced a many hardship ( if any ) in life to realize how difficult life can be . moreover , older people have worked very hard and have been patient enough to wait and enjoy life . it is true that young people have more energy and probably are eager to enjoy life but older people have been waiting a long time and they can cherish and enjoy the the moment inmensely when it arrives . i recognize that older people are more skeptical and le likely to take risk compared with a younger person so the way of life an older person might live is le intense and thrilled with emotion but and older people can enjoy their way of life a much a any young person . thirdly , let u not forget that older people were once young people . they can look back and judge wether they are enjoying life more at an older age than at a younger age . they probably would come to the conclusion that life is better at a older age just for the fact that they survived and reached an older age . finally , older adult certainly are , phisically , older than younger adult , but they can be young adult in spirit . they can enjoy life inmensely knowing that they had a great life and that the best part is yet to come .
