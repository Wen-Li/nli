i absolutely agree with the statement mentioned . success itself mean the accomplishment of a risky or a tough job . people who take the least trodden path , come out with a whole new experience , and more knowledge than the others , who believe in convention and conformity . the whole essence of success , in my perception is achieving something that has'nt been done before . so it is all about doing new thing , and doing them well . most successful industrialist , and businessmen in the world are known to have tried and accomplished something new rather than what they are already familiar with and skilled in . larry page tried to design a new kind of search engine , coupled with a wide range of service related to he internet . at first , it wa considered to be naive and not much useful . but later on , his creation `` google '' became very famous , and is now , unconditionally , the best of it 's kind . one more example is the indian businessman dirubai ambani . without people trying out new thing , our life would'nt have been the same a it is now . we would'nt have had new kind of clothes , infrastructure and mode of travel . we would'nt have had new genre of music if musician of those day did'nt try them . rap music , for example , wa actually a form of minstrel song sung by the african americans . but some musician attempted to commercialize them , with modern context , and they succeeded . risk is another major ingredient of success . it is because of people 's positive outlook on risk , that man ha achieved a lot in the field of science and technology . today , we have mission going on on other planet , and on space , only because our precursor risked to do something innovative in this field . i finally conclude that , successful people , do take risk and try new thing . i even feel that doing something that we are already good at , and that is already tried and done by several others , hardly count a success .
