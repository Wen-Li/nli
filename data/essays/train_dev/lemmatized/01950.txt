i disagree with the statement that today , young people are becoming reluctant in helping their community . i agree that these day , youngster have started staying aloof , and they have begun to increasingly value their privacy , but this doe not mean that they are showing indifference to their community . first of all , i believe that it is very important to have faith in the community which the individual ha to adhere to , and make contribution to . if a person is fully convinced about the ideal and goal of the community , then he would show full support and cooperation to it . recently , i heard a news that a former student of my college wa suffering from brain cancer . as soon a this news hit the campus , many student body became actively involved in collection fund to succor the patient . thus , the young student showed great enthusiasm inorder to further a cause which they believed strongly . also , in my country , many political party have special division called `` yuva shakti '' which are entirely comprised of youth , and which have come into existence only exploit the strength which rest in the young generation . these young men actively support the party principle , and do their every bit to publicise their ideal and objective . they spend their precious time and effort , to help their community . many youth also associate themselves with non profit organization , in order to help the poor people to get ace to various facility . for example , i am a member of a community which aim at increasing awareness among unpriveleged and uneducated people about disease , their prevention and symptom etc . we go from village to village in order to spread this valuable information . in the last few year , that i have been a part of this organisation , i have seen a great increase in the number of youngster willing to join hand for this cause . there are numerous other instance in which youngster have been promising , in showing support to the community they are affiliated to , and so , i believe that they are standing up to the expectation of the society and are still fulfilling their responsibility very well .
