enjoying life is altogether a different phenomenon taking into consideration the age of the people . most people enjoy their life when they are young and tend to become more sober during their later life . there could be many reason apart from the age factor that make people to stop enjoying life when they become old . firstly , i do think that young people enjoy life more that the older people . the reason for this might be that the people are quiet young and energetic and hence tend to explore more thing in this world . for example , young people generally like to travel around and see the place they have not visited before . not only with the family but also with their friend . hence those tour are meant for the enjoyment they can derive being with their friend . whereas , older people do not involve in such activity because they may have more responsibility on their shoulder which the young people may not have . secondly , when people become old , they tend to think more about their offspring rather than themselves . and also the fact that the people like to look after their grandchild in their later part of their life might deter people from enjoying . whereas , young people when they join their college , meet with new friend and tend to learn something from their new life . this will make them to explore new thing and enjoy a little better . apart from all these factor , the most important factor is that the old people are being discarded by their child and being kept in the old age home where they have very little to enjoy . youngsters , meanwhile enjoy a lot by partying , dancing and hanging out with their friend . to summarize , older people like to relax in their later part of their life . they would have also enjoyed when they were young . perhaps , this might be the reason , apart from the energy factor that the young people enjoy their life more than the old people do .
