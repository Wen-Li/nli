a community can be defined a a society where people can relate themselves into . i do not agree with the statement that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their community . in fact , i believe that young people nowadays spend more time in helping their community than young people before . doing volunteer work is one way for young people to help out with their community . although young people before also did community service , now the urge and the need in doing community service increased . there are many factor which caused young people to do volunteer work . first of all , nowadays , young people have more opportunity to do community service . in school , nowadays , teacher encourage student to sign up for community service such a flag day or teaching english at local school . nowadays , it can probably be said that doing community service is not optional but is now becoming compulsory . before , student were not required to do community service , but nowaways , it is compulsory for student to do voulnteer work to participate in various activity . for example , hkayp is a program where student work on their outdoor experince . in order for student to join the hkayp program , they have to do specific amount of service hour to enter different level ( bronze , silver , and gold level ) and receive certificate after they complete each level . also , the importance of community service . all student want to be accepted by good university . it is now known to student that doing volunteer work can give university a good impression to them a the volunteer work they have done can be reflected on their university application . so for example , now , young people in hong kong spend alot of time doing volunteer work during their spare time ( especially on holiday ) since they receive a certificate provided from the government when they fill up certain amount of service hour . overall , i disapprove the statement that young people nowadays do not give enough time to help out their community . i believe that young people nowdays a a matter of fact , help out more due to the fact that they are more exposed to community service ( school encourage student by introducing community service ) , some avticities require student to do volunteer work in order to join , and that student can write their service on their university application .
