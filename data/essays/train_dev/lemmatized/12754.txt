i do not agree with this statement . this is because that helping their community includes to spend their time to see their friend , i think . young people join a lot of event of their university . we can not say that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their community . actually , a lot of student spend their time to work rather than help their community , but they have enough time to join their community . young people can manage their schedule , so when they want to join them , they can go . there are a lot of club and circle they can join their community . and also university give student a lot of oppotunities to participate in community . during high school and junior high school , student have a little time to help their comunities really , but it is not student ' fault . that is because the government deside to the system of school . if they had enough time , they would give time to helping their community . after university , we are able to have a lot of time to cope with our community . in japan , we should help our community . we have a lot of kind of helping , for example , to help some shop of their home town , clean up road , river , and station . throught those kind of experience , japanese young people are able to learn how they join their community . and after that , they help their community by themselves . finally , i think that all young people give enough time to helping their community on their own way . from someone ' point of view , it doe not seem to be like that . but , we have enough oppotunities to help our community , we can not avoid them . and we think that we have to that . so , i believe that young people nowadays give enough time to helping their community .
