well in my view i dont think there will be a reduction in the usage of car in the near future . firstly , since many new car are been coming into the present market . one can surely expect that many people in the near future will be buying those . moreover by using latest mechanism these day the car are been manufactured at a lower cost than before . so this may even lead to a reason for buying a car a they are very cheap . secondly , since technology is been developing day by day and also human showing a lot of interest in leading a luxorios life . some people consider that without having a car it may affect their status . each an every individual will be interested to buy a car . even the student in college also using the car these day . so i dont think there will be a decline in the usage of car in the upcoming year . thirdly , when coming to population , a there been a massive increase in almost all country no surprising the car user also certainly will increase . and also when safety is been considered many people prefer a four wheeler such a car rather than a two wheeler such a bike . since two wheeler are more likely to be dangerous a there are no proper safety measure done in it design . finally the only point i can see about declining the usage a car in the near 20 year is because of increase in number of deseases due to pollution . majority of the car exhaust smoke will generally contain cabon content which may combine with oxygen and form carboxyhaemaglobin . due to the consumption of such gas many may suffer with different kind of disease like breathing problem , asthma etc .. , so if the people become aware of such dangerous disease then they might stop using the car . but still , i stick to the fact that this may not happen so soon .
