i do n't agree with the statement about most advertisement make their product better than they really are . it undoubtful give some fake permitions to people and would make nobody to believe any advertisement any more . there wa an old adverticment about mallbore . in that advertisment an actor who always acted a a cowboy wa showing in it . this advertisment made people , especially young men believed smoking wa relativing to `` cool '' . however , this actor died of lung cancer finally . but the fact is that nobody know during his life time how many young died or would die an same reason because of this fake advertisment . thus this kind of advertisement really doe bad thing to people . it 's hard to deny that there really are some advertisement are true , good to people . but , ask youself , how much dare you believe in advertisement , because you can not point out which of them is real . depend on the same reason , nowadays , advertisments are not a way to tell people what kind of product they can buy , instead they are becoming are kind of boring show on tv . so the bad advertisement harm the people who believe them , and at the same time they hurt this field , too . from these reason , i think nobady would n't agree with my situation , especially those who were cheated by some bad advertisement . i wa worked in this field , so i could see both of these . so i hope it would not happen again .
