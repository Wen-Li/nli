will we success if we always make a decision through the old way ? in my opinion , this is a quit clealy answer . i believed that if we want to creative a really achivement , we have to make change that 's for sure . if someone want to be successful , he or she must have the character bellow : first of all , old thing wo n't attract people . for instance , we wo n't buy another product for their same function or appear . we will purchase something because of it newest and fleshest nomatter in any aspect . in addition , ability in make a right decision is a key to success . the differents between the leader and member is determine alility . it is obvious to look their position in salary . leader were the one got the high payment in a job . finally , the most important character in successful people is a precisely foresee . this is the heart for a person who will earn the respect and acomplishment . those people always saw the opportunity we will never see and seize this adventage to make a big profit and large benefit . to sum up , successful people try new thing and take risk rather than only doing what they already know how to do well . because they have the talent or ability to convince people to join with them , make the right decision without pain a well , and saw the chance advence .
