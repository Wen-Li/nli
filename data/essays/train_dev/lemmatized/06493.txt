i think that it is better to have broad knowlegde of many academic subject because there are many reason for this . first , i think if you have broad knowlegde of many academic subjets you will have a better chance for a job in the future life . companys or firm will search people who have a big knowlegde of many subject . also this people have the ability to help in many department . so for example , if they have had varios ecnomic subject they can work in every department of the firm or company . secondly if you have broad knowlegde of many academic subject it is good for yourself . you save the feeling that you have learn a lot and that this what you learned can help you in many situation of your futher life . so for example you can help people which need any statement from you . thirdly i think it is very busy to have many academic subject because you have a lot to learn . so maybe you have n't got the time to meet your friend , to do some sport activity or something else . there are also people who prefer it to specialize in one specific subject , but in my opinion i think that these people are n't interested in other subject and maybe they have n't got the interest to learn . they more likely to meet friend or do sport activity . for these people personality life like the hobby a sport acativities or meet friend are more important than the broad knowledge of many academic subject . in addition , to have a broad knowlegde of many academic subject is better than to specialize in one specific subject i think because it help you in many situation a like in your job or personal situation .
