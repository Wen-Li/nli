i completelly disagree with this statement . but before supporting my opinion i should define what i understand for enjoying life . for me enjoying life mean selfawareness , being aware of what we have and being able to feel pleased with it . according to my definition of enjoying life , the only requirement to do it is to have awareness . that mean that not only young people can do this . adults could enjoy much more than young people . after all , they have accquired more experience during their life and have gain more independency . people with more experience have , generally , a clearer idea of what they want and are in a more settled-down possition . while young people are just about to discover theirselves , and their sort of freedom cause a lot of anxiety . they are not sure what they want for their life . they have to live day by day trying to find out wheter they want to study or not , where they want to live , etc . and this kind of situation brings them sometimes more stress than pleassure . young people have yet a lot to learn , about their life and themselves . there is a well-know quotation that say that we do not value what we have until we have lost it . this usually happen to young people who , for instance , do not value their time living with they parent , thinking that life would be much easier or better by their own . and after they lost their parent , they regret not having enjoyed more time with them . once again , if you are not aware of something , if for some reason you can not value it , and this reason could be lack of knowledge or experience , how can you enjoy it at the most ? in conclussion , i believe everyone can enjoy life a much a anyother . it is an individual task and ha nothing to do with the age , sex or culture . it is important for me to explain that with the example i gave before i am not saying that adult actually do enjoy life more .
