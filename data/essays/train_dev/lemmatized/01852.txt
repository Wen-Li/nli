i have a father who work very hard . he is a manager of a group of japanese people at a company called hitachi . sometimes my father work so hard that he work at his company until the next morning . i feel bad for him sometimes . one day , i asked him about how he managed to do all the hard work . in japanese , he said that he enjoys the work that he doe and he said that the work that he doe is very hard work , but he feel rewarded when he finish the work because he get a bonus when he doe an extra hard work . i work very hard too . i go to a very demanding american school with high standard . i work hard to keep up my grade in my ap environmental science , ap calculus and ap statistics class . during the time off when i have free time , i work on my homework . during the weekend , i work on my homework . i am under a lot of stress and pressure . i turned my college application in last week . i am worried that i might not get accepted into the college that i intend to get in . fyi , the college that i applied to last week wa in america . my parent also gave me an option to apply to japanese university but i can not apply to them until i get the result from the american university because the year start different for american and japanese universities . to be honest , i do not know which country to go to . in addition , i have a choice of rejecting the university in america and instead apply to a university in japan or i can go to a university in america . either way , i do not know which country to choose between japan and america . the universities in america that i applied to will give me the result of whether i am a good candidate or not in april . moreover i have three month until i can decide whether i will go to america or not , but i have not a clue about which country to choose because i love both country . ( i can not stay in england because of financial problem ) considering that young people are people younger than a college student like me and older people are people who are older than a high school senior , i think older people enjoy life more than young people . young people are under enormous pressure because of the issue with the university and the future after that . on the other hand , older people do not have to endure with that pressure because they have already gone over that obstacle .
