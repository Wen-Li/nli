i do n't think young people enjoy life more that older people do but in fact i neither think the contrary . in my `` short '' beginning life i met lot of differents people from all age . i met young people like me who wanted to discover everything . they wanted to test new sensation , discovered new culture , go out every night to meet people and make party . when you are young and you want to do that you can ! but when you are young and you want to jump from a plane to experiment thrill of falling you meet an older instructor . when you go to the best discotheque you learn that the owner is 50 year old . when you drive fast on the highway and think `` i am the ( stupid and crazy ) king of the highway '' you see an `` old '' man behind you in a bmw / mercedes / audi car that drive faster than you . i think most people think that when you are young you can make lot of enjoyable thing because of your health , strenght , young mentality , freedom etc and when you get older you have more contraints . but in fact i know people older than me that show me that you can enjoy life if you have child , if you ca n't run very fast and jump everywhere . there is not an only way to have fun and all people have there own way to entertain . to conclude , i think you can enjoy life while you are not so seak that you have to lie all day long on a bed . it do n't depends on your age or the money you have . enjoying life is a way ... of life
