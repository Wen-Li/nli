we live in a era in wich every product ha an advertisement . for example when i watch tv , or i listen to the radio , or i walk on the street i can see , and listen a lot of advertisement . usually the media describe the product like they are the best but , unfortunately , in a lot of case this is not true . for example i 've just bought a new television . i saw on the tv the advertisement and it described this television like a really beaufiful product with a lot of new technology detail and , for this reason i decided to buy it . when i arrived at home and i decided to use it a realized that all i heard , unfortunalety , is not true . i 'm very sad for this choise because i spent a lot of money for a bad product and i think that i 'm really stupid girl . on the other hand , there are also advertisement that explain only true advantage and tell true information , in order to garantee the quality and the good name and reputation of the brand . for example my brother bought a car last year and nowadays he 's really happy for this choise . i think he 's a really fortunate boy ! i think that the advertisement shall say only the true and in this way people can choose the different product whitout the fear to buy a bad item . the right of the consumer are not respected by the media and i belive that this problem can be risolved soon a possible . people spend a lot of time to study the product , because they do n't want to spend a lot of money for item that are not like they want . at the moment , i think that is really dangerous buy something without a corret information about it . i trust , that in the future , the law can change this situation that not advantage the citizen .
