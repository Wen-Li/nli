advertisements are very important influence and useful in our life in many subject . from this i agree with the following statement ( most advertisement make product seem much better than the really are ) . as i said advertisement are important in improving the selling of a product . without advertisement people do not know or hear about product unless they have tried it , so advertisement show people a product , make them aware of it , and make the product familiar to them . let u take an example about an example of an advertisement of a specific car wher a beautiful girl or a celebrity is riding it and racing a lion and beat him , that advertisement will increase the selling of that car . otherwise advertisement are not always honest about every quality of a product . either way , advertisement make prouducts seem much better than they really are . advertisements expand the popularity of a product and make it very common and adorable , because of the picture and the show that present . they provide the best picture of a product and hide the worst . everyone is interesting in advertisement , follows and watch them to see what are new and good and cheap , and after that go buy the product . in the reality the product will differ from what is in the advertisment , because the advertisement make it the best and doe not have any mistake . in this situation you can not blame the advertisement because their work is to make product seem much better than they really are .
