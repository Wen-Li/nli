from my point of view it is more important for student to understand idea and concept , because of my own experience . it doe not make any sense if they learn fact , sometimes by heart , without understanding . furthermore , if they understand the idea and concept , they automatically learn them . in addition to that , they remember thing , they learned by understanding better then without . moreover , what do they want to do with their knowledge , they learned once , without understanding ? they can not use it in their life . and student learn for their life and not only for their teacher . for exemple sometimes it is not important to know all the chronological year and event of the past by heart . it is much more important to know , why something happened and/or someone did ? another exemple which refers to that topic is the subject latin . i learn it in school since 4 year and we do not only learn a large amount of vocabulary to translate some text into our language , but we also analyse the text . today it is easy to make research on the internet , by only printing something out , without understanding anything . you have the choice to learn everything without understanding , or you read everything carefully with understanding . as far a i am concerned the second way is the better one . all in all it is better for student to understand everything , then only learn them by heart .
