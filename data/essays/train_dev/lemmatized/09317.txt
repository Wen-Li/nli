helping community is one of the most important think that can improve a state . as a matter of fact some year ago people spent more of their time in helping the others . although nowadays people , and expecially young guy , are not used to spend free time for their own buisness rather than giving a social contribution . in my opinion this behavior is not useful , because if all people go on thinking only about their owns , so many problem are going to increase . i can give you an example to make you better understand my state . first of all i would like to speak about the poor . these people have a lot of problem that are linked with their economic health . worldwide there are people that prefer to spent their time in increasing their amount of money and in general their beneath , instead of investing some of their huge amount of money in the community . if all of the richest people in the world would invest some resource in helping others , i 'm sure that everyone could be happier , also the richest one . in fact one of the most important thing that this kind of people can not understant is the emotion and the sensation that they could feel when they help someone . when people help someone else the benefit are not only for the poor or the receiver of the help but also for whom ha given the help . in conclusion i want to say that people , and in particular young people , would learn again that give is the best thought that someone can have . if young people would improve the way to give help to the others i 'm sure that all of u could have a lot of benefit not only in the closed future but also in the far future . in fact in this way people that now are guy will be able to teach this concept to the offspring and go on . all the world would be better than it appeares now .
