i disagree , i do not think that in twenty year there will de fewer car in use than there are today . people who think differently probably feel protecting the enviroment merit strict regulation restricting car use . nonetheless , such regulation have proven , in many instance , to accomplish the contrary regulatory goal . for example , in place such a bogota , colombia , longstanding restriction on car use have helped to improve the traffic situation during rush hour . nevertheless , such restriction have been ineffective a regard the overall number of car in use . the restriction implemented in bogota , and other colombian city , allocates the right to use a vehicle during rush hour on certain day , depending on the last number of the license plate . for example , license plate that end with the number `` 2 '' may be used on monday , wednesday , and friday , an not on tuesday and thursday . such a meassure ha greatly increased the demand for automobile , since peolpe are not willing to use the preecarious transport system in place in the city , and prefer to buy a second car in order to avoid the restriction . considering the exponentiality of birth rate , and the importance of car manufacturer a job generator , i think it is safe to assume that more and more people will become car buyer , and automotive industry employee . i also think that researching better fuel alternative , and better , enviromental friendly material and car construction technique may lessen the impact the industry ha on the enviroment . in sum , i do not think the number of car will decrease in twenty year time for four reason . first , restrictive regulation is not always the best alternative , and sometimes even make the situation worse . secondly , there is no reason to beleive that that overall demand will decrease , given the fact that population increase , and ecomonies such a china , which are waking up will surely fuel the market for more than 20 year . thirdly , the industry generates a lot of job , it is very important , and lastly new technology may lesser
