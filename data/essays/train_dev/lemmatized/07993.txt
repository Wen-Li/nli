i agreeto the above statement because of the following reason , broad knowledge help in knowing different thing that we need to learn in our daily life . one should not get accustomed to one subject because if we are like that , we cant survive in this competitive world . a human should have knowledge about each and every thing that is essential in his life , by learning every subject and obtaining the knowledge from various field , a man can survive in any part of these world particularly in any field . after having a very good knowledge in every field , we can come to know the importance of various field in our daily life which can be useful atleast once in our life . we shouldhave a knowledge about various academic subject like literature , arts , science and technology , pharmacy etc just i mentioned a very few important subject that had a vital role in our human life . any way after having a broad knowledge about the various subject , we can achieve a very good knowledge which can improve the creativity and individuality of the human . we should learn various subject for getting a grip all over the subject that are neccesary for a man to survive and copeup with this competitive world . by learning and experiencing various thing in our life , we can able to understandfor any kind of situation that lead acoss our life , by this learning atleast we can develop humanity towards other people and we can be kind to them . by knowing various thing and having knowledge at the same time man should not missuse this scientific knowledge by destroying country by discovring some nuclear bomb etc we should use our great knowledge for developing the welfare of our country but not by destroying with a criminal mentality . therefore i agree to the above statement given , why because by having a broad knowledge about various subject atleast we can know the minimum neccesities that are useful in our human life , bylearning about various subject , later on we can do specialization only in one subject that we are interested and help in developing our carrer in this busy life . now a day many of the engineering it people people are settling in the software field for having an exposure to various field .
