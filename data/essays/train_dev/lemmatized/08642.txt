i do agree with the statement `` successful people try new thing and take risk rather than only doing what they already know how to do well '' , for the reason that being adventurous can expand one 's vision , and help one catch new opportunity firstly , trying new thing and taking risk can expand one 's vision . the course from good to great of the world-famous company well fargo is one of the best example to support this idea . well fargo wa a indeed american company for the reason that it pay only 1 percent of the entire attention of the company , to it international department . one day , the top leader of well fargo took a big risk : he place the company 's chief ceo , who had been in charge of over 60 percent of the entire business of the company , in the international department . everyone wa confused with the decision of the leader of trying new thing . however , well fargo succeeded . after several year of the replacement of their chief ceo , well fargo became not only a big american company , but a huge international business a well . the expansion of vision enabled well fargo to reach out and became a great company , and make it leader a successful manager a well . secondly , trying new thing and taking risk can help one catch new opportunity . living in a fast-pacing world like this , we face new challenge every single day . if we only stick to the daily routine without getting to know this world better by trying new thing and taking risk , we will surely be left behind by those who are more adventurous . with closed eye , we may never reach the destine opportunity even when they are just knocking on our door . ready and willing to try new thing and taking risk , one will finally become successful from mediocrocy . starting from today , our new life with open mind will bring u something amazing sooner or later .
