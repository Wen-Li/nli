in my opinion , saying that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their community , is a very pesimistic statement . it rather sound to me a an exaggeration of the reality . there are some hided aspect concerning to this topic which i want to mension in order to discus this topic . if you compare young people nowadays to the young people in last year , you will gain the impression that people are more and more engaged in activity , which keep them busy . nowadays , young people are more and more involved in activity to enhance their education state in order to remain competetable for getting a job . the market in our socity nowadays request more and more profitional and highly qualified people in order to follow the stream of high technology . given that the circumstance and requirement to ensure your and your family life ha changed so drastically , there is much le time to help community . apparantly , although young people are enthausiastic in helping their community , there will be no enough time to invest for this goal . therefore , i would say that the intention for helping ha not changed comparing to last year , rather the competition among people and the circumstance make it unpossible more difficult for young people to invest time for helping their community . keeping this reason in mind , i would say that this statement is overgeneralized and should not be evaluated a true in this form . we should observe and study the circumstance of individual to make sure if the le readiness for helping ha characteristic reason or is it really because of circumstance which make it not possible . then , we should be able to make a better suggestion concerning this topic which is made from empirically observation .
