i agree with the opinion ; young people enjoy life more than older people do . younger people have many relationship with other people from community such a school , company , or internet society . i believe that to keep being related with somebody make life more enjoyable , because i can communicate and share the happiness or pleasure with others if i am related with somebody . of course older people have the relationship with people , but it is much smaller than younder people ha . old people do not go to school , probably retired their job too , therefore younger people ha larger relationship with others . younger people are more aggressive , active , and powerful . they can act and do a well a what they want to do . they can go other place whenever they want to go , they can play sport or other activity whatever they cant do . it is hard to move their body for older people . i think many old people enjoys their hobby inside their house or around their house by theirselves , but i do not think that those are real enjoyable thing . my grandfather life by himself since my drandmother wa died , and he say he enjoy watering his bonsai and walking around his subdivision with his dog , but he doe not look happy for real . if i do not have much relationship with people , it would not be so much fun at all . i think people can feel that `` i really enjoy doing this ! '' from their deeper part of their heart if they are connected with other people . therefore , i agree with the statement `` young people enjoy life more than older people do . ''
