i am of the view that the number of car which will be employed in tewnty year from now will be lesser than the amount present on our road today . global fuel price inflation ha reached an all time high . the price of transport fuel have become exorbidant . buying a car will no longer be a provident option . this inflation will only compound in the next twenty year and hence the idea of buying a car to the common man will no longer be an attractive option . the environment is decaying by the minute . people have begun to realize this threatening trend and are inclined towards a more environment friendly existance . cars , with the pollution they emanate do not help the environment at all . with growing awareness , people will recognize th danger and abstain from buying car which are source of great air pollution . the world 's poplutaion ha increased rapidly and will continue to increse over the next twenty year . unfortunately , the size of the earth will remain the same . thus , traffic congestion will be a major problem and a hurdle in year to come . the only prudent method to tackle this problem will be to introduce effective public transport system . people will prefer to take the bus or the subway rather than having to wait for painfully long period of time on the road while commuting . this will therefore lead to a dwindling in the number of car being purchased . the cost of raw material needed to contruct a car ha also risen alarmingly and will continue to do so in the next few decade . for example , metal price have soared and metal form an integral part of the car body . this will lead to a hike in the car price . . manufacturers will have to increase their price to accomodate the high cost of raw material . the high price of car will discourage common people from buying a car . this is also one of the reason why people will refrain from buying a costly commodity . in view of all the above reason and illustration , i feel that they will be fewer car being driven in twenty year from now .
