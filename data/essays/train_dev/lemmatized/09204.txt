i agree and in the same time i disagree with this statement . it defers frome each side point of view . let u supposed i 'm a young guy i will agree . because young people can play alot of sport like football , basketball , swimming , gouging , and body bilding , but eldary people can n't . also thay can do dangirus sport like bongy jumbing . and can travel for along time with out taking medisin like eldary one . however young people can gather with friend at late time enjoying them self and can sleep late unlike eldary people . and if we look at it from old people view thay will say we can arrange our time and play sport like table tennes , cheese , monopoly and we can enjoy our time by watching t.v. vissiting friend . they do n't need phisical motion to enjoy life . finaly am with youn
