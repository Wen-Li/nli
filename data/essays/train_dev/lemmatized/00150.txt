in general , i agree with the statement because i think that a broad knowledge of many academic subject is more precious to people when it come to their every daily life and surrounding acquaintance . in other word , i believe that a knowledge on several subject give people the possibility to better understand many matter which are facing every day like hystorical and political situation , foreign culture and country , scientific aspect and and physical fact . a broad knowledge can really help all of u in better understanding the world we live in and get used to that ; this is why , in my opinion , many primary and seconday school tach basic of several academic subject instead of reducing the range of taught matter and specializing student on some of them only . however , i also believe that , when it come to work and business , this opinion is not longer applicable because specialization becomes a must . i think infact that a specialized worker ha often to focus on few matter only and can not keep pursuing a broad knowledge on different subject . being focused and specialized , worker can gain advantage in their job , become more competitive versus peer and colleague , get more valuable to employer and deliver stronger and higher performance . an example is given by my personal experience . at the primary and seconday school i have been studying several subject from art to physics , from hystory to maths , etc. and so i received a very broad knowledge on many matter . after achieving my `` diploma '' af the end of the secondary school , i specialized in mechanical engineering and then , after graduation , i started to work a mechanical engineer on some very focus matter , keep developing my skill over and over and , at the same time , specializing in some very narrow subject . after 5 year of working experience and at the age of 30 , i can say that i chose the right way because i am very conscious of my everyday life and very rewarded and appreciated at work .
