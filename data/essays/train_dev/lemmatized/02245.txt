according to me , i think that it 's better to have broad knowledge of many academic subject than to specialize in one specific subject . it allows u to have knowledge in differents domain , to understand so many thing and to posse all the basis in order to choose a specialization , in case of one . firstly , i think that a broad knowledge of many academic subject give u a very wide range of information . this range of information permit u to become aware of a lot of thing , subject and topic . we can learn so many notion that it would be a pitty of not integrating various knowledge . second , i think that there are a lot of thing very intersetings in this world . knowing tho , allows u to understand the place and the world where we live in . it give u a different perception of the life , not a focused one a if we are specialized in a particular subject , that could be a very deep one but not very large . be this way of thinking we become more open-minded and our place in the society will be a result of that . and finally , by having broad knowledge of many academic subject , a specialization will occur alone and naturally . we all have affinity for a specific domain , so by knowing a lot of thing , one point will appear a more captivating than the others . this view demand more research than if we want to specialize u in one domain , but it also permit u to compare diferrents subject and then choose the best one for u . to conclude , i would like to say that a wide broad knowledge of academic topic is decidely better than a specialization . we live only one time on earth , and knowing thing in a hudge range of domain is a possibility that we have the benifits of . so , why being closed-minded and focused on one thing we suppose the best for u when there is too many fascinating thing to know ?
