when you are doing study , you are confronted with a lot of fact , and also with idea , and specific concept , either you are studying biology or literature , or philosophy . we could wonder what , for a student , is more important : is it understanding idea and concept or learning fact ? right from the beginning , we could answer that what is really important is both to understand concept and idea , and to learn fact , that is to say learn to understand both to the light of each other . actually , we could think that understanding a concept doe n't mean anything if you do n't have any fact to link it with . if you just have a concept , but no fact , it serf for nothing to know this concept . nevertheless , if i had to choose between both , a a student , i would argue that it is more important to learn to understand idea and concept , during your course , at the university . i would say that because in my opinion you have le chance to encounter concept and idea and to understand it in your personal life than in university . university is the place you could learn about difficult notion and where a teacher could explain them to you and develop them , whereas you could learn fact on your own , reading newspaper , listening to the radio or reading book . yet , i would add that it is important to learn fact , so a to improve on your knowledge , which ca n't be composed of concept and idea , since it is always important to know , for instance , important date of the history , if you are an student in history , or important formule if you are a student in biology , or the date a writer wrote an important novel and the political and cultural context in which he wrote it , if you are a student in literature .
