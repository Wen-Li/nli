i totally agree with the statement that most advertisments make product seem much better than they really are . i have three reason to explain this . first , the aim of the advertisment is to sale more product . no producer want to decrease the function of the product in the adversitiment . on the contray , the producer will try their best to show the positive aspect of the product and minimize the negative aspect . so , the product in the advertisement will only have the advantage . for example , the advertisement of the medicine will only tell the custom which disease it can curve and neglect the serious point of the medicine . some custom will be extra-damaged by the medicine for the negative aspect of the medicine . second , in order to sale more product , the producer enlarge the function of the product in the advertisement . the product in the advertisement will be much better . for example , the mineralized water are good to the health of human body . some producer take the mineralized water a penecean which can be used a medicine to some illness . third , the advertisement is a good too . the advertiser can sale it only when it can satisfied the producer of the product . that mean the advertiser need to make sure the product in the advertisement should be excellent , even better than it actually it . from the above , we can draw a conclusion that the product in most advertisement are not the same a themselves . their funcitions are been enlarge in the advertisement . so , the goverment should care about this problem to let the custom know the truth of the product .
