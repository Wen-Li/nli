no i do n't agree with the statement that it is more important for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact because for my opinion i think both of them are imporatnt for student to know . student for their knowledge need to understand the concept and the idea in order to answer the `` why '' question and understand why thing work like this or like that andon the other hand they need to leran fact in order to understand better the idea and concept and especially that these usually are the conclusion of others work and most of them come from a passed period so you ca n't just ask the student to learn them if you can not prove them by real fact . imagine in mathematics course the student ha to understand the idea of parrallellism and the teacher ca n't give a him a real fact or example about parallelism and how two parallel ligns could never meet or in physic he ha to understand the concept of the light without giving him a fact how this concept work in reality and what about history course ? how can a teacher teach history class without using fact ? to conclude i would like to change this statement into the following one : it is a important for student to understand idea and concept a for them to learn fact .
