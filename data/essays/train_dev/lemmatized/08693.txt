risking or hesitating ? in my opinion taking risk is something that make your life worth living . off course taking risk is not something that all the people are able to do , because you may have to put up with the eventual negative effect of having done a certain choice . so if you have a strong personality , if you are audacius , you can go throgh the `` experience of risk '' and most of the time you will have positive feedback . in my personal experience something happened that make me strongly support this idea . my father ha been working for all his life for some technology company , but one time he had to handle with the terrible `` mobbing practice '' which are conceived to put a person under a psycological pressure . he decided to leave the company before being fired , and so he took a great risk putting our family in a condition of economic uncertainty . then he took another great risk deciding to start running is own bussiness . right now he is really happy and satisfyed because everything is going in the right direction . i 'm not telling that everytime you take a risk there will be something more positive waiting for you , but if you 'll never try to do that you might regret the fact of not having been enough brave . furthermore if you keep on doing something that is really familiar to you , something of which you have a perfect knowledge about the possible consequence , you won ' never experience excitement and your existence will be flat and annoying . so taking the risk is something that everybody should do , in order to gain self-confidence . because most of the time this is a way to understand a far a you can push your limit letting you know that possibility are infinite .
