some people believe that succesful people take risk and try new thing in order to acomplish their goal , others believe that doing what they know to do well will get them where they want to be . i believe believe that successful people always have to take risk and not just do what they know to do well . i will explain why i agree with the statement using an example on an specifical career like engineering . risks can take you to field of your carrer that you did not even know exists , because you are always too busy doing what you already know . for example the devlopment of a new technology or the expansion of one that already exist . if you don ; ` t take the risk to explore new thing , this new technology might never be developed because you a an engineer are doing the same thing over and over again . another advantage ot taking risk is that if you fail you can always go back to what you where doing before . let 's think of a new product we want to develop . if the engineer have an specifical product for example deodrants in roll-on plastic container , and they never try to invent another way to apply the product , they probably would not be able to create the spray applicattions . but let 's say they formulate this new application using aerosol and they find out that it is affecting the ozone layer on the planet because of the gas expelled . they can always go back to the roll-on aplication and help the environment . they took the risk with the new technology but it brought a lot of problem so they can go back to the old way to apply the product and solve the problem . these main two reason explained why people have to take risk in their professional environment . however this apply to other thing in your life . like for example , in a personal field let 's talk about marriage . when you get married you are taking a lot of risk . you are signing a contract that last forever , not knowing what is going to happen in your life . but a i mentoined , this contract can be voided and if thing are rough you can get divorced and go back to your single life . you took the risk looking for success but it did not work so you can go back and star all over again .
