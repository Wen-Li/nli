i totally agree with this statement . ecspecially in business you can see that . i think that people that always keep the same habit are more likely to be not successful . i our generation you actyually need to take more risk and try something new to be successful . as an example after i finished my trainee program in a big business here in germany they asked me to stay and offered me a full time job . of course i wa attracted by the money but i knew that i would not be able to continue my career . so i said no and moved on to go to school to get eligble for univerity . during that time i applied for a year in the united state and it worked out . so taking a risk may offer you new possibility which you would not have gotten to with doing what you already do and know . of course you have to use your reached knowledge to move on in life but you need to extract that and this only come by trying new thing and taking risk . this doe not mean that you will always be successful by taking risk but it enhances your chance . to get a job you need to be open and show them that you can do different type of work , that you have several experience and that you are able to handle different situation . there is no way around with only doing this with what you already know . so in conclusion it is very importend for people who want to be successful that they need to take risk and try new thing rather than moving on with what they already know .
