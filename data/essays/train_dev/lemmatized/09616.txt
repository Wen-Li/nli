i agree with the statement . to me the question shown in the phrase is an ethical problem because society which create a new product trick people who believe in their lie , so the entire population depends on advertisement which show `` incredible product '' which can resolve many different problem , such a how to clean up house or car at best with a new soap which era any stain , or how to repair a part of the furniture ; in reality many of the effect of the product are created using a modern computer program . in this way people believe in something which partially doe not exist and waste much money . for example , one year ago i bought a new soap which could erase every stain on my shoe and clothes : i used it only 2 time and then it did n't work anymore : now i still regret buying it ( but the product presented in the tv advertisement seemed very different and much better than the real one ) . the philosopher karl marx , in the 19th century , said this : '' ... the religion is the oppium of all population . .. '' : to me this expression may be changed in this new form : '' ... advertisements are the oppium of people ... '' , and it 's really related to the today 's situation .
