since you are a child , your parent , and other facors , teach how do well in your work , or in an activity . when people grow up , they choose and follow their own way , which can be differents of that way that their parent teach them . some successfull person try new thing and take risk , rather than other person only doing what they already know how to do well . i agree with this statement . people are influence by the money , the own personality . first , the money ha an important impact on someone 's behavior . the money drive the people crazy . nowadays , the money represents the only thing that make people happy , relax and safe . it mean that successful people , people which have a good job and earn money , can try new thing , take risk , and have novel experience . they are safe and can pay for the new activity they want to try , or can take risk to play to casino , for instance , because they are sure to have money after have lost . it is the same way in the work . they can take risk because they are succesful and have money . if they make a mistake , they do n't worry because they have money so they are safe . however , a person who are no successful and also not very rich ; this person ca n't do what she want to do , try new thing , or just take risk . it mean that all these three fact represent a risk or have to be due to a long reflection . people without money do n't have choice . they do what they already know howdo well , in the aim to be safe and take risk . for instance , a successful person want to try something new such a rock climbing . it is not a probem for her . in contrary , a person without money ca n't wake up a morning and say she want to try this activity . she doe n't have money to spend in that . she ha to work for that . it mean omly doe what she already know how to do . secondly , the personality of each person have a huge influence . some people want to enjoy the life , everytime , rather than other prefer just follow the cheep 's group , and do what their parent teach them . after , there are the person who are afraid to take risk or try new thing . they are scared to pas away from the everyday life , and they are simply afraid of what they do n't know . for instance , the person succesful are generally the person narrow-minded , extravageant , who express themselves and want to enjoy the life in every minute whatever the risk . in contrary , i remember than when i wa fifteen year old i wa scared of what i did n't know . i did n't know it so i did n't if it wa risky , good or bad . also , i wa afraid if my parent were agree or like this or this new thing . i just simply do what i know do well . to conclude , successful people try new thing and take risk rather than only doing what they already know how to do well . it enjoy the life , become independant , and live iyour own life in your own view of the world . the life it to short to do n't be ex
