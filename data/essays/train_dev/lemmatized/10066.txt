in this text i am going to deal with the question if young people enjoy life more than older people . young people do not have a lot of problem like older people because they do not need to work for getting money . they get money from their parent or grandparent . furthermore , young people do not have fear of the future , because they do not think about it . additionally , they enjoy playing with their friend , e.g. playing football . furthermore , young people enjoy about little thing , for example a young child is happy about a small bubble gum . young people like child have to do what their parant want because the parent give them a little money and food . older people have to work because they need money for food , a flat or a house , clothes and so on . furthermore , they have not a lot of free time like young people . otherwise , older people have some advantage like driving a car because of their work . they decide what they want to do and do not rely on other people 's decision like young people do . in conclusion , i think young people enjoy life more than older people because they do not fear the future like older people sometimes do .
