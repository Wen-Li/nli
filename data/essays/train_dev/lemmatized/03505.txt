i am a business guy . so i take risk . in my opinion , everybody ha to take risk in their life . but risk is risk . so you can not make sure if you take it , it is going to be good for you or not . no body can know that . i can give an example about my uncle who wa one of famuous importer in my country , which is turkey . as i said , he wa a big importer and he wa bringing fruit from other country such a , usa , peru , chili etc . he had been in that job for about 10 year before he decided to change his good what he wa bringing . actually he did n't change basicly . but he started to bring more tropycal fruit such a ; pineapple , kiwi etc. rather then the others . . but he had not thought that if you want to change something in company you have to think all changing . for example of his company is that company had to buy new vehicle for carriying fruit . because those new fruit more sensetive then he used to bring . it is a big problem for company cause of these vehicle are expensive . beside that , they did not have any experience about new fruit . they did not know how do they have to do keep them or how long they can keep . some more problem and then everything wa going bad . i am not telling do not take risk . if i wa he , i would do that a he did . but if we want to do thing , we should think about everything . i love this phares '' the only thing not change is changing '' . so we need to change something and while we change , we have to take risk , whatever i am in future i will always take risk . because i believe in that taking risk is the most importent thing in life .
