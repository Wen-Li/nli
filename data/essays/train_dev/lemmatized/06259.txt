this world is dazzling , various yet institutionalized . some compays use advertisement to illustrate and attract customer to buy their product . however , most advertisement make product seem much better than they really are . in order to get people 's attention , advertisement always use some special case which might not be suitable for every sample . comercially , it is the primary goal to get the benifity , wich make the experiment result showing in advertisement are more like a story instead of an academic strictly paper report . some advisement will even provide inaccurate experiment data in their product and bambast for them . this situation is much more serious in most of asian country because of their goverment 's careless attitude for popular medium . take one notorious case for example , chai-ca , one of famous communication ic design campanys in taiwan have ever proposed a cell phone called nan-chi . in the beginning , nan-chi wa so popular because that the advertisement meantioned it can still work in some rural area even the density of signal base is sparse . however , that kind of assumption will only work in east part of taiwan because of the specail reason . in conclusion , i highly aggree with the statement that most advertisement will make product seem much better than what they really are in view of the advertisement i have ever watched . and it is really necessary for goverments to face , handle and make the related law to this probelm .
