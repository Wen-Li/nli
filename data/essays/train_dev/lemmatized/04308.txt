today , travelling ha became one of the most important entertainment for people to relax or borden their view . most people do their travelling in a group led by a tour guide , but is that the best way to travel ? i will not give not an answer such that either completely yes or no , because this depends on the situation of different type of people . having a tour guide can be benificial . first it ensures better on traveller ' safety . people such a child and elder should definitely be taken care by a tour guide . we can not expect our 10-year-old daughter or 60-year-old grandmother to travel on their own , in this situation they should travel with the help of tour guide . second , most travllers are new to the place they visit and do not have a very good understanding about it , a tour guide therefore will be helpful in introducing the place and making sure the traveller can enjoy at the most extend during the vocation . however , there are diavantages of travelling with a tour guide , too . what come first is the lack of freedom , especially when our traveller are young and independent . me a a young and curious woman , for instance would rather travel with my own friend , so that i will not restricted by the guide and have more fun . second , from the aspect of scheduels , plan that tour guide provide may not satisfy people 's desire . different traveller have different taste and preference , and a a group there might be conflict between memebers . so when it come to the matter of freedom and flexibility , travelling with a tour guide will not be a wise decison . to sum up , whether to travel with a tour guid or not doe depend on people 's own situation . they need to weiht their preference to decide if a tour guide is helpful or not .
