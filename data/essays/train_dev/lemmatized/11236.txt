it is common to think that young people enjoy life more than older people do . for instance , it is obvious that young people party a lot more than older people , that 's why they seem to enjoy life a lot more . but , if we take a closer look , is it really true ? i 'd tend to disagree with this well broad idea , and a far a i am concerned , i 'd say first that older people ceize the day a lot more than young people do , and then i 'd like to underline the fact that the age doe n't matter , that it is the person 's personality which lead him to enjoy life more or le . first , it seems obvious to me that older people enjoy life a lot more than younger people do , precisely because they have nothing to loose . they are conscious that they are going to die one day , therefore they are living in the present , they are enjoying every moment of their life . young people , on the opposite , are always making plan , thinking about what they want for their future and how they are going to obtain it . they consider themselves a immortal , thus they are not really enjoying the present time . older people experienced a lot of good and bad thing and are now aware of what make life worth living to them , consequently they are able to really enjoy their life . but above all , my opinion is that enjoying life is n't a matter of age . some people , no matter if they 're young or old , will always live in the past , mourning about what happened to them , or spending time thinking about their good memory , and a a result , they will never enjoy life , the real life that 's going on before their eye . that 's why i consider being able to enjoy life a a trait of personnality , which doe n't depend on the age of the person but on it ability to be satisfied with what he ha got .
