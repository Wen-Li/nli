i would like to disagree with the statement that young people enjoy life more than older people and would present argument against the topic . first of all we need to clearly define the word - '' enjoying life '' . a lot of u misconstrue the real meaning of these word . true enjoyment mean something done to bring joy and happiness to oneself or loved one and not a a public demonstration effect . this is especially true for older people . after having experienced life and gone through different stage during their life time , older people are much more experienced and mature in their outlook . therefore they would seldom indulge in activity which are popularly seen a being part of enjoying life . young people on the other hand , due to a variety of reason which can include peer pressure , need to experiment , energy , enthusiasm etc. are often seen indulging in the more demonstrable form of activity which can classify under the broad term - enjoying life . so while older people might not go out a often for travelling or adventure trip or movie or partying , they have their own set of activity like book reading , gardening , religious activity , community event etc. to complete a happy and enjoyable day . i also believe that while at a young age people often enjoy themselves by indulging in self driven activity , at an older age human being get more happines , satisfaction and enjoyment by doing thing for their close and loved one . for example a father who invests day and night to build a house so that he and his family can have a secure shelter for a lifetime get an equal amount of satisfaction and happiness a doe a young adventure trekker . this gesture should not be miscontrued a evidence of not enjoying life . therefore in conclusion i would like to state that enjoyment is not dependent on one 's age . it is a state of mind which all human being strive to achieve through various method and activites during the different stage in their life cycle .
