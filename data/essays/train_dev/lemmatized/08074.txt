teachers are constantly asking themselves whether it is more important that their student should understand abstract concept rather than learning fact . these two thesis were in fact respectfully defended by montaigne and rabelais : the first believed in a well made mind whereas the latter a filled mind , for surely it is better that a student go out in society and in the world knowing by heart fact in their head rather than having an empty mind . yet , i believe that it is preferable to have a well made mind that are open enough to understand concept and that montaigne praised so much about . most parent , however , believe that their child should go to school to learn mathematics , know the date of historic battle , know that name of famous writer so that the child would sound highly accomplished a they would be able to show off their knowledge , which a erasmus stated is `` power '' . this would generally imply that the objective of going to school would be to gather fact . yet what would be the use of accumulating them if the student do not grasp the meaning ? thus , instead of being supercilious , they would make fool out of themselves and would be dismissed a false machine , in other term useless to the world . indeed , what is then the use of having such portable dictionnairies when one would usually be in possession of such book in their reach ? furthermore , with the frequent use of the internet , various information that we did not learn and that are needed could be found in a matter of a minute . thus , it is not required for a person to recite fact especially that his or her memory could not be entirely depended upon . what the world need which neither a dictionnary nor any machine could provide is the use of one 's intelligence to ensure that he or she take the most righteous or practical action or decision . such a capacity could be provided with a well made mind and also with an experienced one . of course , it is important to have some knowledge and learn idea and concept to forge one 's way of reflecting and to gradually allow them to take their own personal mind up but this could not be done unless they have a well made mind . this education for a well made mind would allow them to understand new idea and concept and fully grasp them . therefore , it can be said that is it more important for the student to generally have the capacity to understand idea rather than learning fact .
