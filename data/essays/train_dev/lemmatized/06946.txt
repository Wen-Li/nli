the most promesing way to sell a product is by advertising it to people . to sell their product , company often claim false information about them . i totally aggre that most of the product advertised seem much better than what they really are . the objective of advertising product is to attract people into buying them . some company often attract people by selling false information about their product . for example when i am watching television , i see many advertisments of reducing fat pill . the add claim that these pill will reduce your body weight in just two week . obviously this is not true , and i have hear of many people who have bought these pill , that it could seriously affect the heart . thereby , the producer of this pill attract many customer and only care about making money regardless of what may happen to people . marketing company rely on certain technique that attract people in order to sell product . among the technique used , survey are conducted to explore people 's need . thereafter , the advertisments contain information that hook customer . the problem is that many customer are ignorant and have not learn to differ the real product with the product that they see on add . as a result , company can take advantage of this and make their product seem better and suitable for people . for example , salesman find rural town a perfect place to sell product . why is this ? the people living in those town are ignorant and can be easely tricked into buying the product . in conclusion , i aggre that many advertisments make their produts look better than they really are . the reason to do so , is to attract people and make more money than what they would make if they told the truth about their product . unfortunately , marketing company can easely sell their product to ignorant people who believe them .
