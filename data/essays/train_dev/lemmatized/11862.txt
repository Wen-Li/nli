successful people are often those who try new thing and take risk rather than doing what they already know how to do well but not always . one the one hand , i think that trying new thing can help someone succeded . successful people are people who try to inovate and to make discovery . for example , one of the most successful man of the last year is bill gates . it is because he ha tried new thing and he ha found a new way of making computer that he is now one of the most powerfull man in the world . an other example of a man who have succeded by taking risk and trying new thing is henry ford . he improved the way of working by introducing machine in warehouse and chain working in order to be more efficient . this new model ha been imitated by a lot of firm because it wa a good model . but on the other hand , people who do what they already know how to do well can also succeed . for example , a person who would like to create a firm can create it by using all the technics and the theory that he already knowns . if he know how to use them very well it firm can be a real success without improving the way that already exist to built a firm . an artist can also be very succefull by painting very well for example that is to do well what he know to do . according to all these argumemts , i agree to say that successful people are those who try new thing and take risk . i think that people who only do what they already know how to do well can only have minor success . because you can succeed by doing what you know to do well but the success wo n't have the same repercution in the history . the succes that evrybody remembers are success linked to risk or innovation .
