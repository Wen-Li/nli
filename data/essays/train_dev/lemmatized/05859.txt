for the development of the world and individual , broad knowledge and specific knowledge are both important . however , a far a i concerned , i agree with it is better to have broad knowledge than to specialize in one specific subjuect for reason a following . first , you can make sure that what you interest in only after you learn broad knowledge . when you know nothing about something , you do not know if you like or dislike it . so if learning some about the all aspect of knowledge , you can know which aspect you interest in and you can choose the area you will specialize in . this is one of the reason that why university arrange many various course for student to expect them to find their real interest and then prepare for work or further study in the future . second , broad knowledge of many academic syjects is the basis of specializing in one specific subject . for example , a biologist must have the knowledge of chemistry , math and so forth . without any knowlege of other field , he can not deepen and broaden the research in one specific field and may confront with many difficulty . with the help of broad knowledge , you can think more efficiently and creat some good idea . in addition , the more developed the world is , the complicated the knowledge is . as a result , if you want to reach some accomplishment , you should have comprehensive ability of many aspect . if you only have knowledge of one specific field , you may face many difficulty to handle problem in your work and life . in a conclusion , broad knowledge can estabish a good basis for your work or study in one specific subject . you can find your interest and development in learning broad knowledge .
