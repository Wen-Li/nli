basically i agree that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping or involving in their comminities . young people now live in a modern life that provides them with a lot more choice than they could have had in the past . internet is the typical example . young people spend a great deal of time surfing on net , whether doing research of school work , chatting with friend or playing online computer game . there are also other attraction besides internet , such a travelling . the improvement of transporation allow people to travel to other country at faster speed and cheaper cost . it wa not common to hear or to see student plan to spend their summer vacation in another country or across the pacific ocean back in the 60 or 70 . moreover , the development of modern society is also the main cause . population increase is associated with the growth of modern city . more people live in the city , more child grow up in the city . a young man 's childhood in the city could be very different from the one spent his own in the country side . due to the different lifestyle , kid grow up in the citiy are generally more distant to stranger and people they are not familiar with . they are possibly told by the parent and teacher to be aware of stranger when they are young a the crime rate is normally considered higher in the city , such a kidnapping . growing under this circumstance will naturally make them more self-centered and distant . another reason is probably because the relationship young people have with their comminity is rather shallow . most people , including adult and young people , rarely have any interaction with their neighbor . as a result , they would not devote themselves to community activity ; they 'd rather to spend time focusing on their personal life .
