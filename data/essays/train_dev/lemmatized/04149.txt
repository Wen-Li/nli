in part i agree the statement , couse i think human progress , from the begin of human 's history , is possible only taking risk , exploring the unknow , tring new way , ... i think in the world 's history there are some famous people who changed the way to do something and made innovation ( a leonardo da vinci with mecanic 's research or giulio natta with chemical research . .. ) and i think they are succesful people who tried new thing taking a lot of risk . i think the real question is : what is a successful person ? is it a famous person ? is it a rich person ? is it an historic legend ? there are a lot of successfull people who reach the success only doing what thay already know how to do well , without doing innovation or taking risk : they are common people who do very well their job making a lot of money . there are a lot of people famous a cinema 's vip but they never taked particular risk . .. if success is make money , we do n't need to take risk to reach the purpose . .. in the end i think the secret to have success in life is belive in myself
