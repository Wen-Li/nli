i agree with this statement . today 's life it so annoying and stressing , we must give some change to our daily rutine , we ca n't be of only thought , today we live on a multicultural world in wich we must rescue something of each culture . with this statement i do not mean to be a musulman or a catholic , but i mean to respect diversity . we live for our work , for our job and our bussiness , i belive it 's alright to test new thing , new feeling , and maybe be happy with them . i 'll use myself for this example . i am a studen of odonthology in a recognized university in chile , my mission is to fulfill what my parent and me want , this is . .. finishing my career a soon a possible . it 's my goal too , but to my goal i add many more activity . for example i like sport , i love sport , i 'm a basketballer , and a soccer player too , besides tracking running in school . i know i passed to another part okf my life but i wo n't give up sport on me . it 's an emotion that fill me when i 'm on the court , specially on the zone . i just love it . i think i am a sucsessful man . risks perssue me , because i have few time to study , my university is quite difficult , and sport for me now . .. could be a bad choice . the big problem , or the great disscusion is that i love sport , and i 'm not able to leave them apart from my life . and this essay 's awnser is quite simple , i belive we have to fight for the thing we want , that sometimes we have to be ambicious and work a twice a we are doing now , because 10 year later i do n't want to regret that i took the wrong desition . i 'm not willing to make that error , i 'm choosing both my career and my passion , sport .
