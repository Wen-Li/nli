when you try to guess how many car will be used in the future , you have to pay attention to several fact . some may imply that there will be even more car but in my opinion there are far mor reason that their will be nearly no car at all on our street anymore . the first and most important reason why i am thinking this way is fact of rising gas price . no one belief that the rising of gas price will stop . no , it is a fact that they will raise even faster . and who of the ordinardy people can easily pay the gas station bill nowadays ? this will become more and more difficult . so in my opinion , only a few people will be able to afford having a car . another reason why i am the opinion there will be fewer car is that the public traffic institution will improve there service and so the possibility of using them will look far more attractive then it doe now . the price you will have to pay when using a train or bus will decrease when more people need to use them , e.g. a a result of raising gas price . and this will lead more people to use public traffic vehicle again . the second improvement of which i am sure to come is that the net structure will become better day by day . this will also be a result of increasing interesst in them . another fact is , that according to my own experience , you can use the time in a far more efficent way when you are travelling by bus or train . the time you spend with driving can be used to work . let 's assume you have to travel half an hour each day to arrive at the place you work . if you could invest this time in preparing you work , you could take a free afternoon avery two week . and i am sure more and more people will see these advantage and there will be fewer car .
