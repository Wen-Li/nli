i think it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subject than to specialize in one specific subject . first of all , i think there is almost no profession only dealing with one academic subject . for example , if you study english literature , you also need historical , cultural and linguistic knowledge to be successful in understanding your own subject . or if you plan to become a physicist , you need extented knowledge in biology , chemistry and especially mathematics . furthermore , to be specialized in only one subject cause remarkable difficulty in private a well a public life . your relationship will be limited to people of your own specific subject and you are not able to connect or communicate with other people because you can not understand them and vice versa . if you talk to a biologist who doe not know anything about any other topic , you will not be able to talk to him because there is nothing that connects you . the most important argument for favoring a broad knowledge rather than a very specific one is very personal . for me it is very important to gain a broad general knowledge because i think people with limited specific knowledge also have a limited emotional ability . i am sure that people who read a lot of different kind of text can much easier relate to the problem of other people than people who tend to read text exclusively dealing with one subject . people with knowledge of many subject can understand situation although they will never have to face them , whereas people with restricted knowledge will not be able to deal with those situation because they are beyond their limited horizon . in conclusion i may say that a broad knowledge of many subject make more sense than to specialize in one specific subject . people belonging to the first group have advantage in many different situation , such a academical , professional , interactional a well a emotional one , a stated above .
