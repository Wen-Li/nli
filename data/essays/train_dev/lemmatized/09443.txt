at the first , i have to emphasize that i totally agree with the statement . having broad knowledge of many academic subject is better than specializing in one specific subject . once you have broad knowledge of many academic subject , you will easily understand everthing in daily life and wo n't get confused by the subtle stuff . the reason why people usually respect and trace abnormal stuff , even think it is enigma , is always coming from the lacking of broad knowledge . if they had ever read a lot , then they would easily figure out why the miracle happens . like the magic show , the magician show everthing superising and make people confusing . but if you ever had that kind of knowledge , and you will easily know what 's the secret inside . same example of chemist , they can make lot of uncommon specie . without the broad knowledge , you will never know what truely happens inside . specializing in one specific subject is good for a researcher , that would lead him or she to discover science and advancing detaily . but without a broad knowledge of many academic subject , he might sometimes get confusing when his topic is out of his specific subject . with a broad knowledge is the best way to fix the problem . same a the condiction today , scholar who study in biology start to study chemistry , and they also learn the physical process from the physicist . the combination of then make advancing for science researching .
