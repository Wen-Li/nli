i agree with the opinion of those who believe that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their community . i do not think , however , that young people are the only one that have to be blamed for this behaviour . as a matter of fact , our society , the medium , and even politician continously trasmit hedonistic and selfish message , encouraging people to care about money more than about other people , to be competitive and succesfull without thinking about the others . the result of such message is , then , that young people consider themselves a individual rather than a part of a community and that everyone ha lost the sense of the community : we basically consider the others a stranger and a a potential danger . in a context in which we do not talk to and even to do not know our neighbour it is then normal that young people think that helping their community is only wasted time . before helping a community , they should , in fact , understand what a community is . for this reason it is common to observe that helping a community is much more frequent in little village than in big city . little village still mantain a `` social '' life-style . in little village , in fact , people still talk to each other and take care of the others . the result of this approach to life is that all people are proud of their community and ready to spend their time to help the others . in big city , on the contrary , we have adopted an `` individual '' life-style that destroys the sense of the community . it would be then very strange if young people wanted to give time to their community in a context where community do not exist .
