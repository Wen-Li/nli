i agree with the statement `` successful people try new thing and take risk rather than only doing what they already know how to do well '' because people gain experience with what they had previously done and this improves their perfection and creativity of doing thing betterly . they are also financially well settled and the person reputation also help the new project to be successfull . for example let see about reliance industies proprieter mr.dhirubhai ambani first he started his life a a small business man and with his hard work and planing he became successfull millionare in the world . after that he and his family is financially settled and they moved into new venture like mobile communication and network , insurance and mediclaim policy . though they took risk in starting venturies , they were able to attain success because of their confidence , creativity . experience and ability to face the risk and solving the problem , leadership , team spirit and their motivation towards the employee present in the firm led them a great success . firstly to start a new venture there must be a proper planing which should aim for long term benefit rather than short term benefitsand with their tactics people should be able to capture the market , if it is maintained constantly interms of reliability then long term benefit can be obtained . but there are case where the new venture during there start only are facing many loss in the stock market . this happened because of not proper advertising , not maintaing proper standard and quality of good and can also be there because of improper employee-employer relationship . if these problem are solved then the new venture also will become successfull from this i conclude that successfull people try new thing and take risk only when they are properly planned about their new project and in addition to that their experience . decision making ability , motivation are also making the new venture to become successfull .
