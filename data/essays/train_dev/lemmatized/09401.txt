as far a individual is concerned , i agree with the statement that the car will be fewer in use in twenty year than today . there are bounch of reason can voice my support in the following passage . first of all , we have got a terrible traffic system in today . we used to waste many precious time be stuck in the traffic jam in everything morning and evening . fortunately , the govenment already began do something to slove this problem , so i believe the situation will be better in tweety year with the govenment 's politics and the slogan than today . to the second factor is that the car will be fewer because of the development of public transportation . in comtemprary society , many people prefered choose public transportation cause the high oil payment and other pressure . in many city of china , subway already being the most convenient transport tool in citizen 's heart . the last but not least , along the growth of tenology in twenty year , maybe many inventor already invent some transport tool that may more better than automobile , especially is no more pollution to our living envioronment . as we all known , our planet already been polluted by human being since the first industrail revolution . we only have unique earth , so we should try our best to protect it . believe it or not , no matter what reason cause , the car will be fewer than today . maybe because people found that a better environment is more inportant that car .
