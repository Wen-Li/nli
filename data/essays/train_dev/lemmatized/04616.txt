i agree with this statement that sucessfull people try new thing and take risk rather than only doing what they already know how to do well . consider scientist einstein who had developed the power and light source for the world because he had done his experiment sixteen time and he saw the same result that is failure . but he never giveup himself and conducted the same experiment seventeenth time and at this moment he acheived a result and became one of the most recognizable person in the world . there are so many people in this way who try untill sucess meet them . now we look at the present technology and the innovation that are happening in the world . before the century if a person want to develop the power there is no way for obtaining it . but another scientist named a edison who is famous for his wooden block model bladeless trubine which is used to develop the power from the water . he might not be a sucessfull person at the beginning of the era but he conducted many experiment and revealed the result form greater risk and won an international award which is given by the american society . i disagree with those people who will do the same thing that they have already known . because god had gifted the people with superficial knowledge and one ha to aspire that knowledge and one should increase the potential skill to develop the new model . when the people do the thing that were very known to them they will never obtain some thing different in their life and they are always seems to be in the same position . one should try for new thing which involves risksand many huddle , but when you pas through the risk there will be a result waiting for you . so every one should try for a new thing . let u consider an example the person named a newton , because he wa unaware that he will be the most sucessfull person inthe world in the feild of science . he wa just sitting down the tree and suddenly an apple fell on him and he question himself immedaiately that how it fall and then a a result he discovered the newtons law of motion . so i would like to conclude that when a person take the risk and pass through the difficulty and hurldes instead of doing the same thing that wa well known he will meet the sucess .
