i agree with this statement for allot of reason and argument . the first reason for this statement why it important for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact is because it so much important to understand it then learning it and forgetting about it in the future . the main idea for this statement is a student ha to understand wats he 's learning because it help him in lot of way instead of just helping him in one day just to get it over with and done . me a myself it better for me to understand it then to learn it and not know it . i think it better for a teacher or a proffesor to explain wat he or she is talking about exactly instead of writing and writing on a board and the student not understanding a thing . its better if he or she ( teacher ) go in detail and explains everything for the student so the student will actually understand the topic and what there talking about . the idea 's the teacher give student are really important for them because they 'll get and idea of the topic i mean the main idea and the concept of it . in conclusion of all this i agree with this statement because of allot of stuff such a what i said for example it better for student to learn what the teacher is actually talking about then just learning the fact of it , because the fact will not take u anywhere becuase you will forget them but in the other hand learning the idea 's and the concept and actaully understanding it is much better for the student so he wont have any difficulty in the past about the main topic given in class . so thats about it about whats important for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact .
