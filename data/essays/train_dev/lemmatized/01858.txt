people start the cycle of learning and understanding from the moment we were born . during the cycle , we discover many thing in different way . while understanding of idea and concept can provide u with a basic knowledge of the nature and society that surround u , on the other hand , learning fact give u the opportunity to feel and experience thing that might happen in our life . both of the idea are important , but for student , it is more improtant to learn fact rather than understand idea and concept of a subject . firstly , learning fact is more accurate and reliable in many field of different post . we can find the answer in crime scene investigation , we do n't know the exact cause of the death of the victim until we open the body and examine it thoroughly . a single substance in the artery may ha vital influence to human , but in textbook , we ca n't find them . the same thoery applies to the teaching of student in school , especially biology , only through a real experiment can they understand the concept more clearly and correctly . secondly , through learning from the fact , student can remember thing more efficiently , the vivid image of the process of how organ work and respond to each other may leave a strong impression on student , which are easier for them to remember rather than the boring content of the concept or the textbook . as a high school student myself , my classmate and i both prefer the class in lab rather than classroom , they are both exciting and impressive . thirdly , in the view emotional development , learning fact can make one 's life more colorful by experiencing and thinking the connection and consequses of how thing are organized . because at the early year of our life , we learn thing through fact and experience . knowledges we attain at this period are original and pure , they are just the fact , which are more realistic . the more experience we have , the more calm and objective attitude we can have when faced with an emergency . as a conclusion , despite that we can get a cut through by learning the concept that are already proven and given to u , we should still try to find the answer by ourselves .
