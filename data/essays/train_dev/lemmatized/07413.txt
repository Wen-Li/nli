i totally agree with the idea that successful people try new thing and take riskes rather than only doing what they already know to do well . most important thing in a life is improving and challenging and it helped the person to success in the future . eventhough it need high risk to do new thing , you really shoud try it . to improve your skill , carree , and knowledge , you have to challenge . the most person who successed are the person who do not fear failing . the person who fear failng can not challenge new thing . i wa that kind of person when i came to america . i did not try or challenge new thing . i did not speak english at all because i wa afread to fail and someone may laugh about my poor english . after few month , i realized i wa wrong . in fact , although i live in america , my english were not improved at all . i started try adopting new culture and i recognized that how wnderful english is . i am sure that try new thing are tough and it need more power , but it will affect the person 's life . i believe that tring new thing is worth that taking high risk . think about food company . if the food company stop to try inventing new food , people whould get bored about same food and the company would bankrupt . we have to keep tring every day in our life . that is the way how famous company success have successed . if you really want to success , do not afraid failing , and think about only improving yourself . the short cut to improve yourself is , of course , challenging new thing .
