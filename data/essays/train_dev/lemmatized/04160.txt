although some people prefer to travel in a group because of the easiness and safetiness , i would like to travel by myself or with a only few friend . travering individually is flexible and economical . in the beginning , i did travel with a group led by a tour guid , because i did not know how to make a plan for a trip , and also i did not speak english enough to travel abroad . in that case , it had better travel in a group and have a tour guide . how ever , i found myself frustrated about waiting the other people to get ready to leave the place we visited and not having any extra time to spend more time at my favorite place . on the other hand , if i am traveling by myself , there is no such a problem . i can stay in bed late , or wake up early morning and enjoy the sunrise . therefore , i can more enjoy the trip without . travering with a group is usually more costly than traveling individually . the tour group usually rent a larger van or bus and reserve the higher grade hotel and restaurant to fullfill the satisfaction of all the guest . this may not be needed for some people . if i am traveling by myself , i have time to select hotel and restaurant according my budget . instead i can spend more money to visit other place or from what i have stated above , traveling individually allows people to easily change and adjust the travel plan instantly a they desire . moreover , the cost of travel is le than that of traveling in a group . the personal travel is the best way and more enjoyable .
