in twenty year , there will be fewer car in use and the following will illustrate why . maybe you will find this saying quite odd a nowadays automobile are found everything , especially in city like hong kong . however , due to the decrease population rate and the increase elderly and death rate , such scenario can be easily understood . with the low birth rate and the high death rate , in twenty year time , it is believed that the world 's population will be decreased by forty percent . wiith such low population , the demand for automobile will definitely decrease and hence by that time , fewer car will be found . pollutants caused by car are another example that will support such saying . according to a research , it is estimated that pollutant and other toxic gas exhausted from the car are three time a harmful a breathing in smog directly . in order to control the problem of air pollution , many country will eventually impose heavy tax on car , or to certain extent , ban the use of car . hence , in twenty year , fewer car will be in use . the rise of oil price and other economic factor are also the reason for the reduce in the use of car in twenty year time . as you may observe , the oil price have been fluctuating rapidly , together with the adverse economic factor such a high unemployment rate , many car user will find it relatively expensive and risky in using car , causing the decrease in number of car in us in the long run . last but not least , improvement in technology will also reduce the number of car in use . we all know that car can narrow the distance bepeople and improve communication , increasing the interaction between people so a to make a better society . however , with the improvement in technology , such mean are n't essential . for example , with the rise of the internet , we can commmunicate easily and need not to drive our car to see each other . besides , with the improvement in technology , maybe within twenty year time , invention such a travelling machine will be invented , making car being redundant . all these can explain why there will be fewer car in twenty year .
