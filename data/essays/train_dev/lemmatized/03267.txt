different approach in education discus wether it is more important for the student to learn about fact or to understand idea . if one ha to choose between both of them , i would say it is more important to learn to understand idea . i will first present some argument to support this point , emphasizing on the intellectual importance of the idea . then , i will try to explain how complementary are these point and why they are necessary to any good student . as a student myself , i feel very concerned by this topic , especially because i am a young researcher and the relationship between concept and fact is critical . however , mainly because fact can be learn outside the school i would agree to state it is more important to understand concept . for instance , in my own research about the gentrification of harlem , i am le interested by the fact and the detail than by understand the whole process and the trend which drive it . it is true it is very important to understand the concept of class , place and territory ( their role , symbol etc ) . i think it the role of the school to learn to the student to think by themselves and it succeed giving them the intellectual and conceptual key and tool to understand a problem , and solve it . however , saying the concept is more important than the fact ( a it implied in the question ) i face a big ethic problem . in effect , how can you understand a concept or an idea if you do n't know some fact to contextualize it for example . even if fact can be learned differently than in an academic way , they are required . for example , if i do n't know how many people are displaced by the gentrification or in what extent the rent rised due to the gentrification , how can i expect to understand the nature of the transformation occuring in the neighborhood ? i think concept and fact are linked and the reciprocity of their relation is the secret of a good understanding of concept and idea . to conclude , i would say that theorically understand concept is more important but it only can work with very abstract object of study . the reality is more complex and to understand efficiently an idea , you need to know the context and the fact .
