there can be found several reason to think that younger people enjoy life mor ethan young one a well a to proof the opposite . however it is fianlly up to the individual environment a person is born into a well a his personal approach towards life . young people , provided that they grow up in an intact environment generally enjoy their life because they are not burdened with the sorrow , experience and responsibility older people have . they do not have to bother about money or looking after a family , nor are they usually held liable for the ( wrong or stupid ) thing they do . in contrast , a grown up ha lot of resonsibilities and thing to worry about , which might leave him le time to enjoy life . having said that , it is a fact that older people , who have left their family and started to work and becoem responsible for their own life have more ( economic ) freedom in what they want to do . they might have the money to fulfill their dream and therefore enjoy their life more than somebody dependant on his parent to sponsor them . children usually have to obey their parent and usually are limited in the way they live their life in normal circumstance kid will have a lot of spare time . consider the long summer and winter holiday and the afternoon left to their own use after homework is done . in adult life work or other responsibility a family will ake most a person daytime and leave le time for leisure . however , after retirement older people may have again more time available and therefore do thing they enjoy . in general young people will be healthier and fitter than older people . older people tend to hav emonir or even mor serious health problem keeping them from doing whatever they wish to do . depending on their mentality some older people value the positiv esides of life even more when they are old , because they know how hard life can be . this is something young people lacking experience will not be able to . there are a lot argument in favor of young people enjoing their life mor than older one and there are several one which support the idea that older people tend to enjoy life more . in my opinion this question is decided mainly on the given environment of a person and his personal approach to joy .
