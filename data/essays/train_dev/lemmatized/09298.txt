in my opinion , in some situation it is better for people to have broad knowledge of many academic subject , while other specific circumstance , people need to specialize in one specific subject . for example , if i plan to go out for a camping , it is probable that i need much more knowledge from different area , such a geography , some of the medience skill and a good sense of surviving knowledge . to learn knowledge form a broad part will help me to solve the problem which we will catch in any delimma . in addition to this , it is better for people who learned many skill to find a descent job in the competitive job market . on the other hand , if i want to fix the broken television , i need to be control professional and accurate electronic and mechanical knowledge , thus helping me to recover the television . especially , in the part of advanced techonology area , most scientist must study in a potiential degree that help them to create the new thing . different job also need the knowledge different . for a saleman , it is more than possible that they should learn a broad knowledge . if a salemae study phychology , marketing and business , it must have a big merit than other people . they can sale too many thing than the people who not know broad knowledge . but a a teacher , they should specialize in their subject , so that they can teach student professional and accurate knowledge . but the student would be better to learn broad knowledge in the school , they can find their interest on some subject and develop it in the future . in conclusion , the knowledge for people whther learn broad or specific is depend on their situation . if people can control the good scale on that , they must be successful in the future .
