some people think that the more important thing for student is to understand idea and concept ; other people think that the more important thing for them is to learn fact . both way are very important , but i prefer to lean fact . there are three reason . first of all , learning fact is basic of study . for examle , when i wa high school student , i had a history class . this class 's purpose is learning historical fact , not idea and concept . second , student can get the specific while they are learning fact . for instance , in math class , student are supposed to learn formulars . this is the fact . finally , learning fact is to understand the truth . in other word , fact never tell a lie . however , if student understand idea and concept , it ha possibility for them to misunderstand . for example , everybody ha own idea and concept even though they are correct or not . if these idea and concept are correct , they make sens and have no ploblems in their life . however , if they are wrong , they do not make sens and have a lot of trouble . in order to prevent that , student should study fact , not idea and concept . i do not mention that it is not important for student to understand idea and concept . at the same time , i do not mention that it is important for them to learn fact only . as i stated , both way are very important for student , especially young student . in japan , a lot of school such a a elementary school , a junior high school , and a high school , teach their student fact . however , a lot of universties teach thier student idea and concept because they are not young . in addition , they have ability to understand idea and concept . in conclusion , it is more important for student to learn fact because they need foundamentals of study , especially young student .
