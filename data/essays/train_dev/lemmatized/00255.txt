as i 'm doing engineering study , the question of take my course on one specific subject or on many various themas occured to me several time . my choice follow the way of a broad knowledge , excepted the last year : i prefer to specialize myself in only one subject during one year . so why ? the first reason is that study in diverse academic subject give you a large view of how take a problem when it occurs . you can have many way to develop a solution which could respond to your problem . if you studied only one subject , your mind is focused on one method which could finish in a dead end . for example in microelectronics , a friend of mine proposed a solution using his knowledge in mechanic ! another reason for learn about diverse themas could be to understand the world we are living in . history , geography , economy , physic , mathematics , and language are essential to see follow our changing environment every day , not only at home , but also when we 're working . for instance , social science could help you to understand why your bos is in a bad mood today , and maybe learn you not to ask him some thing which could be desastrous . .. my last argument for broad knowledge would be your ability you can have to change of job , or decrease your time of adaptation when you enter a new firm . nevertheless , the specialization is - i think - also very important . it will be the first thing a manager will notice when you will present him your resume , when you apply for your first job . moreover it is interesting when you study to keep time to make a deep analysis on subject you prefer . it will be give you the qualification of expert on the matter . eventually , a i want to have some managerial responsabilities , i choose to diversify my study .
