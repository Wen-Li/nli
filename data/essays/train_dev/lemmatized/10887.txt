it is generally agreeded that a way of succeed in life is to take risk . living one 's life fearfully is know a a loose of time . people who do not dare experimenting new thing are said to be coward or loosers . i think that this question is debatable and that we have to be carefull with stereotype . it is undoubtable that sometimes in life you have to move on ; change your way of life to succed . for instance , two year ago i had to leave my home , in paris , to aix en provence , in southern france . i have been accepted in a political science school to pursue my cursus . i wa afraid of living alone in another city but i take the risk and move to this new place . nowadays i am happy of having done the right choice . even if there are positive point in taking risk rather than doing what you already know sometimes it could be risky . risktakers are often self-confident . my grandmother always say that too much confident is dangerous . in my opinion taking risk becomes dangerous when you loose sen of reality ; when you think that all is easy . sometimes daring new thing turn well , but you have to keep in ; ind that also it could turn bad . for instance , my aunt wa tired of her job , one day she decides to leave thinking of all the exciting new experience she would experiement in a new job . unfotunatly it wa not so easy to find a new job and she wa unemployed during 3 month . the risk she take had tremendous consequence . to conclude i want to say that taking risk is a good think but it ha not be systematic . fear is a normal feeeling and it contibutes to self protection . a balance between daring new thigs and living carefully would be a ggod compromise .
