what are student going to school for ? do they learn the thing that are nescessary for them ? students are asked to understand idea and concept from the subject they are learning . they are also asked to learn fact from past experience . however , which one is the thing they need more , understanding idea or learning fact ? in my opinion , understanding idea and concept is more important for student . to begin with , student go to school because they need to gain knowledge that are needed for their future . student should be able to understand that the idea and concept of the subject they are studying , so that they will understand the subject easier . for example , the use of a mathematical formula , the rule of a chemical equation . without the understanding the idea and concept , they do not know how to use it and when should they apply it on . as being a student , i think that when student have the idea and concept of something , they will eventually understand the fact of something too . since a fact of an event or object is actually the result of the development of a centain kind of idea and concept . in the other word , idea and concept are the basic requirement for student to learn a fact . moveover , some people think that learning fact is more improtant for student than understand idea and concept . it is because they believe that fact is more easier for student to understand something nesscessary for thier life . but their never understand that fact can only tell use the surface of somethings , not the meaning that are behind them . in conclusion , it is improtant for student to know both the idea and concept and fact of what they are learning . however , idea and concept are the basic element for them the study a subject . facts may not be able to show the main point they need to know . as a result , student should focus on the idea and concept before they take the next step to learn the fact .
