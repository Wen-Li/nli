many people asserted that youg people nowadays do n't give enough time to helping their community . although it would easy to accept this statement at fact value , it is such a complex one . personally , i disagree this statement for two reason . the first reason for my disagreement is that personailty . a man 's worth is not lie in what he ha but lie what he is . that is to say , personailty is essentially . take me for example . when i wa college student , even we had a lot of thing to do , we still seprated the rest of time to helping our community . we do a lot of thing such a assisted taking care homeless child , play with them , and read story for them . therefor , i did n't yough people spend few of time to helping their community . another reason is that young people would like to enrich their experice and increase their awareness and consiciousness . to help their communties is nessary and important . young people will spend a lot of time to helping people who is ineed . they think is valuableto do this . so , i do n't believed that young people do n't give enough time to helping their communitied . all of these reason have deeply influenced my point of view on thia issue . that is not to say , of course , that other point of view are completely without merit . however , i believed that the reason i have provided in favor of my point of view are stronger .
