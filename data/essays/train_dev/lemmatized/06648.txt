in ordinary life , we often have to face delimmatic choice , just a the statement give rise to a debate over whether the understanding of idea and concept is more important than learning fact . some people assert that understanding idea and concerpts are more important for student , while other people believe that learning fact is more benefit to student . as a matter of fact , this issue is a complex and a controversial one . different person will have their different choice due to their distinct background . in my opinion , there is not a universial answer to this question , and which choce take precedence may quite depend on the specific situation . the final decision , nevertheless , should rely on a case - by-case analysis . as far a i am concenrned , however , i agree that learning fact is more important . i would like to provide evidence and give reason to suport my choice . the first argument that can be presented to support my option is that real knowledge come for practice . i can think that there is not a better example of the idea than the obvious fact that learning swimming must make practice . only understand idea and concept can not grasp swimming . to illustrate , that chemical experiment make student to learn chemistry knoweledges more better . although that real skill come from learning fact is an imporant aspect , it is not the only explanation for me to choose the statement that learning fact is more useful . the increased value place on the idea that fact are the deep understanding to the idea and concept . in addition , according to my personality and experience , a well a common sense , i believe that learning fact is a better choice for student . to be sure , it may be true that understanding idea and concept are useful in some condictions . however , this is not fufficient to support to claim that it is more important for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact . it is too weak to strengthen the argument . in cloclusion , based on the above mentioned reason , which sometimes correlate with each other to make part of a larger unit , thus become more convincing than each single one of them . so we can firmly to say learning fact is more important .
