one of the main problem of the scholastic system in italy is the huge program we have for all the subject we have to learn . i can say for my own experience that the most of the information they give u at school is forgiven immediately after we study them . i completely agree with the statement , it is more important for student to understand idea . a famous italian writer once sayd that what we call culture is not what we remember to have studied at school , but the mix of all the experience and of all the idea we have and it doe n't matter if we do n't remember some stupid detail about something we studied year and year ago . in my opinion a good teacher should try to guide a student throught history ( for example ) not filling his head with date or name of ancient emperor and fact , but just trying to passionate that student talking about the difference between our life and life of that time , trying to bring the student in a fantastic world with the wand of fantasy . of course we can say the same for the most of the subject , but with some exception like for mathematic or phisic . moreover , we can forget learned fact , even because they could not match with our everyday life so that we could never have the opportunity to recall that fact to our mind but we can be sure that if we have learned the idea of something we 'll never let it out . it is more important for student to have the taste of thing and this allows to have passion and interest . in conclusion italian school ( but i 'm pretty convinced it is a problem felt in other countryes ) should give value to it student , just the sense of how many thing we do n't know and open the door to infinite world student should explore by theyrselves depending on theyr interest .
