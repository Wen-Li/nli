does successful people try new thing and take risk rather than only doing what they already know how to do well ? successful people try new thing . to be successful is to be the best and different . if we are different that 's mean that we are always looking for new thing , new idea . the world is always changing like a . i think that the reason that make people successful is that they are always changing and having new thing . if this people are taking risk ? of corse they do ! but who care ! taking risk make a feeling in life . life become more exciting . successful people are not scarred to loose but they ca n't support doing always the same think . of corse they have to do well what they do but they are always lurning , and changing . i really do not think that we can be successful with doing only what we know how to do well . for me , i will called that '' stagnation '' and may be we can become successful for one periode but when the tendance will change if we are not able to try new thing and change with the tendance we will not be able to keep our succes . for exemple , for the scientist they need to do experience , try new thing take risk to make some invention , or discover new medication . of corse they know how to do it well what they already know but to be on the top of the screen they have to find newest and greatest thing . so in conclusion , we can tell that only doing what we already know how to do well is not part of the successful people . for sure that will be a reason of the succes but not to keep it . to keep the succes , we have to try new thing and take risk .
