i never think about this argument before . i hope that the phrase in bold at the left of monitor are true , but i do n't know if this will be in the future . i am only twentythree year old and twenty year are a lot of time for me , and so in this period will happen . my dream is live in a world wirh fewer car , because i think we can do everything with public transport or bike . now i live in milan the one of biggest town in europe and i always can move to one part to other part of the town by my bike , so i think most of population of city can do it . if is immpossible moving by bike i thin k that we can take an autobus or other pubblic transport moving i nhe city . another example of this argume is the china . in this country the most of population move by bike . this is important in my opinion and this kind to move can permit a world with fewer car . i think that car are a good mead of trasport for the travel and a good logistic solution . some year ago i wa in spain for a trip with my four friend , and with them i went all spain alog by car . this wa good expierence for me and so in my opinion in releted case the car are allow . another aspect where the car or simila meands of transport are necessary is to solve the important logistic problem like the transport medicine , illness people or for emergency case like a fire disaster . in conclusion i hope the number of car decrease immediatly , day by day , so when i will be adult there will be fewer car in the world .
