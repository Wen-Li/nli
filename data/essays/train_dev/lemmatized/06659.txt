life wa a box of chocolate , you 'll never know what you are going to get . yes , i start my essay with this famous sentance . i always consider life is a period of unexpecting experience . no matter we like the situation you 're in or not , we should accept it ; no matter we were young or old , we could not escape any of those experience . my point of view is that we could enjoy it , with a grateful heart , seriously and hopefully . when i wa young , i begun to learn dance when i wa four . i should practice everyday after class . i not only received numorous award in dancing competition , but also gain much more joyful compared to my peer . i have a vivid childhood . when i grow up gradually , i still like my life full of colorful experience . i never give up attampt different kind of thing , either for entertainment or for serious academic subject . my interdicipline research includes economics , journalism and political science , much more broader and deeper than others . i 'm content with my life pattern , i believe i enjoy my life more than the generation older than me , such a my parent . my parent wa almost fifty year old now . i wa always believing that they were busy working everyday , all of theire concern is earning our family a much better life , competing with others , and so on . but thing change when i begun to oberserve them more carefully , i begun to doubte myself , doe young people really enjoy life more than older people do ? i found although they are becoming older and older everyday , and they still have their own work to do now , they go to park every evening after dinner , contiuning for twenty year . you could not imagine how beautiful that picture are --- at that very moment when they are walking together , talking and smiling , it is the happiness . yes , walking together in the park , for several year . it 's quite simple , but i believe for them , it 's the joy of life . as i stated previously , no matter we were young or old , enjoy life with a grateful heart is my own choice . all of u could enjoy life well .
