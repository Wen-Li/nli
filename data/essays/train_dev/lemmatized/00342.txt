as the technology advance , many young people enjoy the benefit like computer game , tv and so on . however , there ha been negative factor such a broken unity between people , weapon using in young people such a killing person without thinking . and also there ha been negative factor by technology . in my opinion , i can not agree that young people enjoy life more than older people do . first , technology advance cut the unity between people . for example , the past generation doe not have the machine such a tv or computer . so , people must rely on each other and must be active . according to scientific experiment , the active person are happier than the inactive person a young people . however , nowaday , people do not rely on each other and do not move actively because they are always in the world of convenience , entertation with machine . but , young people get stressed out because they find no purpose in life or get bored in life because they are just doing same thing everyday ! also nowaday , in many case , technology is used in bad way which would harm people in nowaday generation . second , a mentioned in second paragraph , people need each other anyway in order to live . but when society loses the unity of people , people would fight each other because they only think of their convenience . as a consequence , the society and even individual would lose many thing and could not be happy . third , from my neighbor , there are many old people . i sometimes ask that past is happy . and they said to me , `` well , we do n't know how you will feel you life , but we are happy although we had to work hard at past compared to nowaday . we all had hope . '' in addition , there are many news that young people kill themselves or kill other people . it is because a mentioned in second paragraph , people try not to adapt with society because in the home , there is everything you can entertain . but because you have to live with society , people must corperate with society . these could cause young people who are so deep in the technological machine to be stressed out . i think that young people enjoy their life le than the older people because of following reason : first , unity is broken in many way and cause trouble and many consequence to young people to live on . second , because many of young people are deep in game or tv , they find their life boring and think life a without hope . third , technology that past generation never ha sometimes is used in bad way and decrease happiness in life . because of three important reason , i can not agree that young people enjoy life more than older people do even though life becomes convenient and advanced because of technology .
