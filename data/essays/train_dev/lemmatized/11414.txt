i 'm not completely agree with this statement . today , in our world , i think that people ca n't do an activity without a general knowledge of many academic subject . infact , our society impose to people to have a base cultural and economic knowledge to do every work or activity . it 's also very important that people are n't only just like a computer specialized only about think they must use in their job . for a big good society , it 's important also that people know a little bit of culture , economy , art , religion , history , and others . .. school must do all it . but when a man decide his future , the job of his life , he need to specialized in his specifical subject . he must know more think a possibile about the activity that he have choised . sure , he can change , always . but if i go to an architect to ask him to project my house , he must have all the knowledge necessary to project me a house , and i do n't want that he studied battle of waterloo when he wa at school ! now , i think that better think is : everybody must know battle of waterloo , or the important of artistical element in a house . everybody must know most important notion of general culture , but it is also necessary that everyone found his road , and he start to walk to the destination that he have choise , he study more notion a possible about it . at the end , he will be able to do an activity in the best way , and he will be very important to the other member of his society .
