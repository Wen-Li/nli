many people have asserted that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their community . although this topic can be reject from some skin-deep reason , it is a topic which is hard to answer due to it complexity . in my opinion , i strongly agree this statement . there are several resons . first of all , most of young people spent their time on studying , playing and excerising . moreover , those activity have obivious effect on their future life . that 's why most of teenager and men do n't want to spent time to helping their community . they think they ca n't get any profit from this action . in my hometown , student only help their neighborhood when their school ask them to do that . second , some adult think that , it is very dangerous for kid to clean or to help the community . we can read and see many bad news like murder or violent behavior happend in our society every day . according to this reason , we seldom see our teenager and kid help their neighborhood . there is a report say that , only three percent of the kid in my country have done such of work . third , there are many worker help u to clean our community . that is common scene in my hometown because our government ha already hired them to do that from a long time ago . so , young people do n't have to do heavy work , and they may be lack of motion to do so . by the way , young people also lack of efficiency on doing such of work like cleaning or protecing their community because they wo n't get any payment from their hardwork . of course , some people who disagree with my opinion also have their own reason . however , i 'm very confident that my reason are more important and indeed .
