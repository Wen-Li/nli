nowadays the advertisement are very important for a product in commerce . advertisements make the product be known and they have to help the product to be sell . so factory and society that product something try to present their product the best they can . so that an advertisement make a product seem much better than it really is often happens . for example , i love going to the cinema and obviously to do that i have to know what is on in the day i want to go ; i must have an idea of which film i 'm going to watch . there are many advertisement on tv , for example , that describe these film , and these advertisement are called trailer . in this case the most of the time the film whose trailer i watched seem wonderful and i often decide to go and see them ; but when i am in the cinema i understand that the trailer , during it sixty second , present to me a collage of the best scene of the film , but the other dozen of scene are bad ! in this way and in this case an advertisement make a product seem much better than it really is . and this can happen also with food or drink . so i essentially agree with the statement , but also i think that after some time , after the product wa known by the population , people start to speak each other about it and each other they clarify all the aspect , positive and negative , of the product . after that there is an evolution in watching or listening advertisement ; after that people recognized the tipical way society use to make a product seem better than it really is . in this way , now i am partially able , for example , to understand watching their trailer if film are bad of course or if i can try and see them . in conclusion , i agree that most adverisements make product seem better than they really are , but i think that sometimes people are able to understand that .
