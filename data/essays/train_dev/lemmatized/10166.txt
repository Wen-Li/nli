i agree with the following statement . it is important for student to understand idea and concept , rather concentrating on fact . facts are a deriavative of idea and concept . you learn science through theoritical and practical approach , either of these alone can not do the job . take physics , you learn numerous formula , understand the concept and idea behind it , then only you can put it into practical use for society . when you apply a certain formula or method you get fact and figure which you can tabulate and store for further use and bring out new result . for proper application of a theory or hypothesis a student should be clear of the concept and idea then only he will be able to think creatively , logically , practically and may end up adding new dimension to it or even challenge a fact . a better understanding or concept and idea will lead to greater understanding of the subject . concepts and idea are the foundation stone of science , whether it be quantum physic or cell division . science is everywhere and every activity is related to it , from gardening to rocket science so it should be based on concept so that student development is such that at an advanced stage he is able to relate thing , apply his/her scientific knowledge and do other productive thing . facts are also necessry but only after concept and idea . fact are the contraints present . knowing or unknowing a fact will not effect the end result , but will effect the process . facts are secondary they should be emphasised on only after knowing the caocepts and idea right . for better learning environment , competetiveness , application and for the cause of science concept and idea are to be induced in the student . this can be done only with mutual coordination between student and teaching community for a
