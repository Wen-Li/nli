i disagree with the given statement . in my opinion , young people do their best to help their community and society . i can say this with conviction because i myself have done my best to help society . my grandmother run a primary school for child with limited mean . since i wa about ten year old , i have been going to this school every summer to do voluteer work . i have interacted with the child , played game like soccer and cricket with them , taught them extra-curricular activity like dance and painting and even taught the child younger to me academic subject like math sometimes . it is a great feeling to be able to give to somone something so important - education . some of the child there became my friend and i still do talk to them . some of them are in high school now . my brother too ha been doing his bit for the society . he go to old age home . he interacts with the old people there and read story to them . they are lonely and need someone to talk to . they feel extremely touched when young child like my brother take out time to come and meet them . my brother too love to go and spend time with them . many of my friend are into community service a well . a very good friend of mine , julia , work closely with mentally challenged patient . she is also an active volunteer for a school with mentally challenged student . so , in my opinion , it will not be entirely correct to say that young people do not take out enough time to help their community . i do agree that there are exception this , that there are people who do not wish to indulge in community service . however , they are mere exception .
