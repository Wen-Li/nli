i agree that the opinion that young people nowaways d onot give enough time to helping thier communitues . i think there are two reason . first of all , noaways , young people do not care about thier community . the reason why is because , they do not think they receive a lot of benefit from thier community . however , they receive a lot of benefit from community . for example , they can go to the school , and can study because of community . in addition , they are protected from the criminal because of policeman . therefore , they should cooperate with their community . they should back what they received . second reason that they do not give enough time to helping community is that it is increasing to communicate with prople . for example , there is a case that they do not know people who life next to their house . in addition , recently cell phone is becomming very popular , so people can talk or communicate with people even if they met each other . therefore , their mind that helping each other is increasing . in conclusion , it is dangerous thing to increase the time to helping their community .
