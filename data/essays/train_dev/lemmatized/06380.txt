as the famous saying go ` jack of all trade and master of none' i believe if one day my mom try to make cooky with the method of making cake , pudding , ice-creames etc. all together it would taste rather ridiculous . try and imagine a person wearing a white shirt entirely covered with circle of red , green , purple and blue . iam sure it reminds of a clown . on the other hand imagine a persson with white shirt and tiny scattered red and blue square ; look assum . similarly if a person ha broad knowledge of many academic subject and no deep knowledge in any specific of them then it could not be put to any specific use ; and if tried to use in some way would actually spoil thing . consider an example wherein the teacher of history in the lecture while explaining about civil war start relating it opera it would rather lead to a rather useless junk of thought in the student mind . in order to be able to apply the knowledge one ha gained to some practical use deeper knowledge regarding the same is required . this is neccesary in oredr to ensure that what we do will be flawless . a student to stand up strongly in future is no doubt ha to be versed with everything under the sun . but the depth of such knowledge ha to be limited and whereas knowledge in one particular area ha to be really strong . now is wan era wherein the complexity in various fieldfs is increasing ten fold and so is the avancement . to keep pace with both of them what is neccesary is specialisation . it ha been observed for this matter that post-graduates and more precisely doctorate are in graeater demand in professional world than are mere graduate . this is due to the fact that they definetely hold more depper , more preicse and absolutely flawless knowledge in order to be apllied directly . also the apllication point of view for their field is more clear thus , although one should have knowledge about what is going around and whats in , it is also essential that he is able to get the deeepest possible knowledge in a particular field and apply the same in oredr to stand up strongly and more confidently in the professional world .
