i think that young people enjoy life more than older people do . many people can think that older people can enjoy more , but i agree for the following statement . many people said that student should always study hard . i think that 's wright , but not always . when you are young , you can learn more various thing that when you grow up , but i think you also enjoy your life when you are young . students are attending class in school everyday . and there are many friend in school . it is very important to study , and get much knowledge from your teacher , but in my opinion , i think to get close and communicate with their frieds are more important . some older people said `` i want to be a student '' . first i heard that , i thoght it is very funny . i do n't know why they want to be a student . but i recognize that student can more enjoy life . many student meet and hang out together . i really like that . when i play with my friend , i can do what i want . i think enjoy life is doing something what i want . when you grow up , it 's hard to do whatever you want . because you have your family . so i think young people enjoy life more than older people do .
