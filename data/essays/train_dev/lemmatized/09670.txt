i am agree with the statemant that most advertisement make product seem much better that they really are . to support my opinion i have a series reason . i think that the presentation of a product is the most particular advertisement . you imagine a person that go to buy a product and that at the supermarket he ha in his front two product that are the same but they are different sealed . of course a person will chose the product with the most beautiful packet even if the quality of the two product are the same . this is an example to demostrate how our idea about a product can be influenced by simple factor . i think that television is the most important advertisement that doe to seem a product much better than it really is . it is incredible how television influence the think of the people about a product . i have many friend that stated that they purchase only product that they view at the tv . they think that if a product is merchandised at the tv there is a good reason . this is true in some case but it is completely false in others . i think that it is necessary to valuate a product in all it characteristic and only after that to judge it quality . however people have not time and in some case the knowledge to do all this work to valuate a product . so they buy the product that usually view at the television . enterprises do their interersts and out of dubts this is correct to merchandise a product . so enterprise do their game but customer would do attention at the real quality of a product .
