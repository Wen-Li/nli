i agree that student should understand idea and concept that it is for them to learn fact . i think understanding one specific thing such a : why the war wa occured , how this problem resulted , why this music sound this way , requires to understand backgraund of the thing , idea , concept . ideas and concept lead you to understand why the fact were occured . i think that understanding idea , concept , and fact are one thing to achive your learning skill . understanding fact are the easiest thing to do the out of all three . for example , when you learn the history , teacher talkes about `` what is happened '' wa the first thing which is the fact . and after you know the fact , you would be interested why , how , when it happened . when i learned japanese edo era in japanese history class , the teacher taught u about tokugawa shougunn , what he did in the big government plan and change and i wa so interested how he became a head of samurai , why him , how he relate with this big government plan etc . i had a lot of question . it wa hard to understand the idea and concept of why and how he govern the country . i spend way more time to learn the idea and concept more than the fact . understanding fact in the first make you interested to know more about it . i think that learning idea and concept lead you to understand deeper of the thing , and relate you with the thing more than understanding idea and concept to lead you to the fact . it is very important to relate all three , however , knowing and understanding idea and concept are more important to achive your learning .
