in life we see and fall down in al lot situation that show u that the world is moving and changing . this is because of people that can feel when is the moment to do or to try to do something new and unknown . there are n't a lot of corageous people but we can see and we have to admit that these people exist and improve our society taking risk . if they had n't been existed , we probably would n't have had what we have right now so , i think that a good example might be leonardo davinci . he lived a long time ago and he wa considered a mad man with a lot of strange idea . nowadays we have the possibility of using his idea and to adfirm that he wa and he continues to be a genious . he continues to be a genious because we are already following his knowledge to do usefull and important thing , but when he wa alive he took a lot of risk because all that he wanted to do , all that he said , all that he wrote wa new and considered by normal people strange , crazy or even stupid . another example might be dante alighieri . he is the father of the italian language and he started to write in italian language when other people were using the old one . probably he wa considered mad too , but if he had n't written the `` divina commedia '' , we would n't have spoken how we are doing today . he wa really corageous and tried to explore other way to do something and to improve his work and he finally did it . he wrote one of the most important book of the italian literature . at the end of the day , to achieve the success we have to take risk and to try new thing . in my opinion , we could n't and must n't continue to use and do what we already know how to do well and we have to follow the example of our master .
