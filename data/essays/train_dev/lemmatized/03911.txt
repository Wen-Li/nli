the growing pace of technology and the ever increasing demand of intellectual and learned people , in today 's world , is giving way to the traditional mode of acquiring knowledge and educating one 's self . it is becoming increasingly important to be well versed with a variety of academic subject , and i very much support this point of view . a broad knowledge base is very important in tackling problem . one need to have an overall knowledge relating to various field to be able to solve the problem efficiently and easily . a multi disciplinary approach is required in all most all field now . it not only quickens up the process , but at the same time save a lot of man - hour , money and time . for example , a student working in the field of environemental science need to have a strong academic background on various subject such a waste management , water conservartion , climate change , environmental pollution , bio diversity and so on . environment just doe not mean greenery and your surroundings , a is commonly percieved . thus one need to a good knowledge base to be working in the feild . at the same time a , multi - disciplined background doest not limit our thought process . it enables u to venture into various field , learn and gather knowledge about them . it is indirectly helpling u to improve our personality and become an intctllectual and refined person . a broad knowledge base also ensures professional success . today one may be working in the environemtal department of a company but tomorrow because of the field trip , interaction with the people and experience gained by the person he / she may be placed in the social department of another company at a better postion and a well - deserved salary too . thus , i would like to conclude by saying that a `` jack of all trade is better than master on none '' .
