i agree with this statement of course . nowadays young people are not involved in helping their own community . for me the problem is young people education and our modern way of life . in fact in the modern society the most important thing is succes , and the first thing that is related with this is certanly the idea of competition . since we are child everyone ( parent , relative , friend , teacher ) teach u that the only thing that is important is to be the best . a good example is a football match where for everyone the only one goal is the victory , and partecipation and meeting with other people is not important . so we tend to see our social life in this way too . we do n't have to help the community were we live , we have only to fight against the others and try be the best one . and the greatest example of this concept is given by television , that nowadays is very important in young people education and so it is responsable of what they will do in their community . but there are also other reason to this attitude . for example in the modern society averyone ( also young people ) have really a little time to try to help the community . we have always something to do , and it is alwaiys something too mutch important to spend our time helping the others . but often it is only a simple illusion . young people in fact tend to give a great importance to thing that are really ridiculus . for example for a kid having time to play with videogame ( and a kid is able to play for hour and hour ) is one of the most important thing in his life . this is a great problem . nowadays young people tend to misunderstand what are their real priorites . and this mistake is helped by our modern concept of competition for success . in the end , young people think that helping their own community is not important because for them there are many other thing to do and helping the poor and the sick is not a way to improve their status and compete for the success . this attitude of young people is very tragic because acting like this demostrates the they are loosing the real value of human being .
