a question ha been raised about whether or not the young people nowadays devote their time to helping their community . in respons to this question , i think that there are two kind of young people nowadays : one kind is more polite , other kind is le polite . usually , the young peole are more polite because they have their parent more quite and more lovely . maybe when this young people have a problem they can ask a help from your parent without having fear to them . so , for this kind of young people is normal to be helped and when they see other person that suffering they would help him or her . instead , the young people are le polite because their parent are more angry or maybe their parent pas few time with them . so , usually when they have some problem they resolve it alone without asking a help and if they see a man who have a problem they think that he or she can resolve alone . so , i think that it 's important that the parent pas the most of their time with their child . my parent work every day , and they come back in my home very later . i never asked them to help me because they are n't . so i have difficult to ask or to give a help and i prefer stay alone rather than stay with my community .
