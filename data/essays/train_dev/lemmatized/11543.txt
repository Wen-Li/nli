i believe , to be a successful person one should be capable of taking risk when it is asked for and should also be adept enough to continue doing the work which he doe well . a combination of both act a a lethal weapon in this today 's world of excessive competion . person 's ability to learn new thing and taking calculated risk always put the person in a favorable position in the eye of success . because success ha and will favour all those who have taken risk . for example : - consider howard hughes who wa not only a inventor but also a imaginative thinker , who believed extensively in taking risk and also cultivating and moulding the ability already possesed by him . when he wa shooting for the film , which when released . .. turned out to be a block buster , he had inculcated so many new thing in movie which during his time were totally unthinkable off . but not only were the risk accountable for his succes but his ability to be good at what he doe and to keep on doing what he know best helped him to direct a blockbuster . he also took risk when he wanted to break the record for the fastest speed a plane could fly at . this risk wa not minute , but it wa his lilfe which wa at stake . his expertize helped him to reduce any human error that might increse he risk , and at last he won . another example is his endeavor of building the largest plane `` the hercueles '' . at that time he had vowed in front of an enquiring comission that if he is not capable to construct and fly such plane then he would leave the country and live in exile . such high were the risk involved in this task that he had to use all his expertize and he required to focus all of it into realising his goal . that made him successful . therefore i totally believe that consisting of only one of the mentioned quality might ultimately result in the person 's failure because large number of uncalculated risk would make him vulnerable a he would not be experiencing stability . whereas only doing the work that the person know very well would lead to stagnation of mind and imaginative power of the person . thus a heathy mixture of both the quality would be the right formula for a person to be successful .
