i agree with the statement for the following reason . first , the public concern about environmental pollution ha been increasing remarkably . because the problem of global warming by exhausted gu from car is one of the big problem at present , people can not help paying attention and trying to prevent the increase amount of the gas . for example , many people are sick because of air pollution by car and some abnormal condition occur these day , for example insect which people only see in tropical country are discovered in some country . so , people rethink using their car because car is one of the major cause of increasing the global warming . second , people realize the limit of oil production . nowadays , the skyrocketing oil price is one of the big problem in the world . because the japanese depend on imported oil for most of it energy , the increasing price influence directly public life expences . then , people can not taking public transportation such a bus and train to suppress their money . also , government face the problem of global warming by exhausted gas from car . there is a law called kyoto protcol and some country contribute together to stop this problem . and , medium deal with frequently this problem . however , although this kind of law , not all country , especially developped contries participate in this contribution . then , country which have already been member of this law , make more effort to state the importance of the law and the need of their contibution in order to keep our planet clean a much a possible in the future . therefore , i think the statement is reasonable and we should do that . i think also that it is important for people to cultivate their mind which think seriously the global problem and contribute to deal wiht this matter .
