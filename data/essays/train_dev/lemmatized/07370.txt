i strongly agree that in twenty year there would be fewer car in use than there are today . to support and explain the stated point we have many reason and let review them logically . the main point which hold the statement that in twenty year there would be lesser car than used today would be since there is a drastic decrease in the natural fuel being used , such a peteroleum product . to support this point the recent survey conducted by national geographic expedition and their study show that these natural reservers like peteroleum would last for not more than another 30 year , if the same rate of usage is continued . this study also involves the different peteroleum product being used a fules , these include diesel , petrol , gassoline , lpg ( liqufied peteroleum gas ) and other minor fules . we should also include the case of using natural solar power , or nuclear fuel , but at the present rate of financial investment and other government policy these donot look to spring up in the next recent year . as for example starting up a nuclear plant in a place called thungha in the north west part of india took five year . so a a result of increase in the fule price and also the rate of growth of pollution caused by the burning of these petroleum product , people are highly encourached to use other mode of travel , for example using public transport , metro system , cycling for short distance . as for example in china , employer are adoptinjg techniquies to reduce the usage of car , like locating close to work place , using metro system for travel . also when we focus on the government policy being laid in recent time , we see that more encourangement is give for public transport than for purchase for car . as taking for example a place called bangalore located in india , during the past five year then price for fuel ha grown by more than hundred percentage , while to compensate for this issue , the government had activated more public transport , allocating industrial area next to be in one major location , where the fequency of public transport is concentrated . this did lead to the decrease in the usage of car in bangalore . also we may raise the point of using sloar power and other mode of generating fuel for car , like liquid fuel where water is a byproduct ( presently used to power up space flight and super sonic jet ) , also using electric car which also need petroleum product to generate , but this demand for great amount of revenue and also a mojor world collobration . also the research in these fileds donot show big progress form the past year for major car production . so looking at these feature , this will take time and we can not expect them to happen with in the next twenty year . parallely thier would also be the depletion of fuel in the world leading to minorty class of people to use car ( those who could afford the high price of petroleum product ) . hence a stated and explained with example , according to me i agree that in twenty year there would be fewer car in use than there are a of today .
