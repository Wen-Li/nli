let 's define what we heard by young and older person . for me a young person is typically a student . on the contrary an older person will be someone who have accomplished his professionnal carrier . first , we will try to define how young people enjoy their life . i am convinced that a student try to experience lot of thing . it is said that it is the better age to travel . in fact young person do not need a great confort to travel . moreover the connection with their parent begin to break . they have not really lot of thing which can make them stay in the same place . so that is right , they really have all argument to travel , discover new country , coutums and civilisation . but is it really enjoying life . it is sure that it is easier for them to travel but are they mature enough to keep in mind their experience . they certainly hqve not the same approach their parent would have by visiting new country . it is also important for them to experience new thing like being responsable , have a budget to conserve . those thing can inhibit their life . then we will discrib what can be the life for an older person . if this person is healthy enough i assume that it is the best period . your child have finished their study , you manage to educate them . you can endly enjoy your life and have profit of your year of professional activity . traveling , taking time to cook , making sport , taking part in associassions . in fact you have time for doing what you want . in the one hand you have lot of time but in the other hand you have not . certainly you had established lot of thing to do but it is hard to manage to do all . usually the question is also am i still able to do this ? to conclude i would say that older people may more enjoy their life . principally it depends on their health . it is sure they will be fastly tired but they have their experience to choose essential thing to do . younger person do not have this experience but are working on it by trying to enjoy the most they can their life .
