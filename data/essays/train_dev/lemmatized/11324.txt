i agree with the opnion that it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subject than to specialize in one specific subject for the following reason . first , having broad knowlege of many academic subject is more convient . for example , in 1995 when i wa junior in tokyo university in tokyo japan , i studied law and tax . one day , when i and my friend were researching for bank law , i were confusing with the law . one of my friend , tanaka , is the best student studied economy and had a lot of knowledge of bank system . he helped me . i were able to learn a lot of thing about the bank law . as the example show that having broad knowelege of many academic is more convient . second , to have variety of academic subject is more fun . for example , in 1996 when i worked part-time at a private school , i taught japanese history . i taught japanese history , law and tax in the historiacl class . children in my class were interested in social sytem . they asked me a lot of question about history , law and tax . some of child wanted to study law . i had good time in my lecture . this experience clearly show that having broad knowelge of many acadmeic subject make me fun and brings me good time . thus , i definitely agree with the opnion that having broad knowledge of many academic subject than specializing in one specific subject .
