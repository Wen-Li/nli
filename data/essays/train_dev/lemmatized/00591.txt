i disagree with the statement that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their community . there are several reason and example which i would like to cite in support to my position , which can be enlisted a follows . the young people i.e the group of people between the age group of eighteen and twenty-five who are mostly graduate and under graduate will have lot of work to be done in the university in term of assignment , mid term exam , publishing research paper , submitting a thesis at a college or university , etc and it would be unfair on the community people to help them in the social work . all the young people who are studying at university may not be rich enough to pay their semester fee and those will have to pay the fee by working at part time job such a cafetaria , assistantship , etc . and the most important to say is it is not the unwillingness of the young people to help community that is stopping them to help communitybut it is the time and livelihood factor which influence their attitude towards their community . secondly , the community in which the young people live is also an important factor . if it is a community with diverse religion with frequent quarrel between the religion of the community then it is very difficult to get together the youngster of the community to work for a single cause that is to work for a single community . an example of this type of community is any city in country like india , iran , iraq , etc . thirdly , the help the community need also is an important factor i.e the type of help the community need from the youngster if the help is small there no need for all the young people to look after it and instead my best opinion wuould be to take the advise of some several senior wiser men of that community instaed of catching hold of young people yo get help . to sum up , the assertion that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their community is wrong and in my opinion all the problem ( small ) must be looked after by the community head .
