i dont agree at all that young people nowdays do not give enough time to helping their community . of course , technology may distract young people and may let them very occupied , but it is not necessary that they do not give enough time to helping their community . if you look around you and you see the developed project , it is because of young people and i consider these development a a help to community . i think that helpness is not only substancial or tactile thing , i mean that you can also help your community by loving them and giving them a lot of passion . i am a big example to prove that young people are helpful to community . i am eighteen year old and i am in a medicin college . i have alot of subject to study and a lot of work to do but i work a a volenteer in an orpahange in my country every weekend and every summer holiday . in addition , i think it is a big help if young poeple help their community but they do not give enough time for this helping , i mean that ther are at least help . for example , my cousin is fond of internet , she is always setting 24 hour on the computer and searching on the internet and chatting and having a lot of fun , although , she rarely do a benefit web site which help people in different field , and because she seldom help people , i think she is a very helpful person . in conclusion , the more young people give enough time to helping community , the more development we will reach and in my opinion , every young person is welling to help his or her community a much a he or she can .
