i clearly contradict the statement `` it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subject than to speciaslize in one specific subject '' . it is better if we specialize in one particular subject a we can gain the complete knowledge about that particular subject rather than knowing inadequate small amount of knowledge in various subject . to have complete grip on one subject one should put his complete concentration in one subject , but if we try to gain knowledge from every other subject the concentration get distracted . it is better to be a king of one subject than being a jack of every subject . as an example if we take a doctor , he ha complete knowledge of his subject , but if he study other business or art subject along with medical subject he can never become a succesful doctor , same in the case of a bussiness administrator , if he concentrate on other thing his business may suffer a loss . so , it is always advisible to gain complete knowledge about the particular profession or subject . one of my uncle wa interested in learning all the subject which he came across , and to fullfill his interest he didnt concentrate on any one subject but tried to master all the subject and wa finally left with inadequate knowledge about each of them . as a contrast my father wa interested in being a succesful bussiness man and from childhood concentrated on his subject of interest and now became a famous business magnet . this clearly depicts the advantage of speacializing a particular subject and on the otherhand disadvantage of trying to gain knowledge from all the subject . thus i clearly want to state that one should master in one subject which can give him a great monetary or social gain rather than trying to master all the subject and ultimately fail to do so .
