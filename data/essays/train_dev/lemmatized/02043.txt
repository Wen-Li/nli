the issue at hand is to tell whether there will be fewer car in use twenty year later than there are today . this question is very crucial in judging the amount of travel infrastructure ( like road , fuel etc . ) and car production required in the future . i believe the number of car in use is going increase over the next twenty year . there are several factor that hint this change , the most important being poulation rise , rise of developing nation , increasing lifestyle requirement of people . firstly , the world poulation is on a rise . human poulation on our planet ha shown significant growth rate in recent time and there is no reason to believe this pattern will subside in the near future . so , twenty yers later , there will be more people , implying usage of more car . another important point to note is the present economic improvent in highly populous nation . for example , it is worth noting that china constitues one-fifth of the world population and india constitutes one-sixth . also to be noted is the rate at which these two nation are advancing economically , which is slated to sutain over the next two decade , if not increase . they are moving from a state of high poverty percentage to prosperity . as they improve , more and more people in these area will be rich enough to afford a car . thus , we can expect many new car in these nation . additionally , regardless of nationality , the world is getting busier . people are running against time . they do not want to compromise their time for anything , let alone using public transport when they can afford a car . thus , we can safely assume that increasing lifestyle demand of people will result in an increase in the number of car . thus i have enough reason to belive that there will be a lot more car in use two decade later than there are now . that could mean that drastic step will be required for finding enough fuel for these car , among other issue .
