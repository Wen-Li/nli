i agree with this statement , ` successful people try new thing and take risk rather than only doing what they already know how to do well . ' in my opinion , successful people ha great ability to do something , efoort a bit , and good luck . as you see some famous star or celebrity , they are mostly clever and have amazing idea which no one had never though . however , they had also risk because they are trying to do something new . new thing must have risk because no one had tried before . although they had risk , they always try and get succeed . needless to say , it 's not easy , but they have strong feeling to do what they want to do . in addition , they have experience and knowledge , for example about bisiness , art , trading money , and so on . this is the most important thing to be succeed . on the other hand , people who want to something new , but are afraid of doing that can never be succeed . if they really want to be succeed , they should be brave to try new thing . however , if they do n't have any own plan and people who help and support them , they must not try if they want to do . as a result , in my opinion , successful people always learn , study , compair and check others . they read book , magazine , get information and so on . then first of all , they want to try a soon a possible , faster than others . taking risk are not matter for them . being interested is the most imoirtant thing to be succeed . if we are not interesting in everything at all , we ca n't find any new thing . not only feeling that , but also knowledge , ability effort and energy are needed . no one ca n't be susseed without them what i told .
