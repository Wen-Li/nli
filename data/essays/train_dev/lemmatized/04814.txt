i agree with the statement . to make the point clearer , i have taken `` their community '' a their local community where they live . i do not know how many young people attend their local community event or even strictly obey rule in their local community . examples are everywhere . one of the reason would be that such behavior to help their local community need to be learned some way or another , but not learned . if young people lived with their parent or there were neighbor who had known them long time , they could learn it . if young people lived in the same place where they grew up , they would undestand naturally how to behave . but young people nowadays tend to live alone or only with their spouse and far from their hometown . another reason is that since nowadays almost all the every day life is supported by business undertaking , people can live without helping their community by themselves .
