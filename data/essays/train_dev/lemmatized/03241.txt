i think that it is more important for student to understand idea than to mechanical learn fact , especially for student that have to learn scientific concept ( a for example math 's formula or physic 's concept ) . while just learning fact might be good if you to have to prepare for a class test that will take place in a short period of time , you will probably not remember much of what you have study on the long run . this because if you really understand why something happens or how doe that happens you would know how to solve a particular problem also if you forgot the specific formula . another good reason to understand idea other than just learning fact is that doing so they would be able to use their knowledge also outside the contest they learned it from . from example a mathematical formula or theory could be applied in other area a chemistry , biology or even medicine . such an advantage would not be possible by just learning a process and mindlessly apply it . understanding fact is very important but there are some field where i think learning fact is not the main necessity . this is the case of history or literature , although understanding fact can also be useful in some case to understand , for example , why one nation invaded another or why one author ha written one way instead of another and how he ha been influenced by external factor . probably the best way to learn is to first understand the idea and then to learn fact . doing so you will be able to remember what you have learned for much longer than either just understanding idea or just learning fact .
