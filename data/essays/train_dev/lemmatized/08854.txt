yes , i agree with the given statement that `` young people enjoy life more than the older people do '' . i justify this by giving and example related to health , patience and etc . . young people can play many sport , eat well , thats the time to them to enjoy . but the older can not do that . old people like be decent and calm during their age . thats obviously their nature because by that age every body will loose their patience and energy and want to lead a peaceful life . and they are the who experienced every thing and they know whats good and whats bad and what to do and what what not to do . and they will be very careful while they are doing some thing . but comming to the young people it time for them to enjoy , they have to taste every thing in their life . even it may be with their friend , in the techinical section , and for the young people have their own idea and their own way of enjoying . after they do what they want to do they will be recognising the positive and negative from what they have done and gain certain knowledge by their own . if the older one restrict them to do something then they will feel some bad about them . if they know whats bad and whats good by their own practically then they will take care of that incident or situiation in future . if , there is any festival at our house the older people doesn , t come forward to enjoy , but the younger one will be very much intersted in doing and enjoying . the thing the older people and younger people differ in enjoying is depending upon their experience and also it depends upon their mentality . for the older people there will be some restriction for each and every thing . for example that the older one can not enjoy with his friend by going out and party . because he will be in such a position that it will ristrict him but the younger one doesnt . he surely and definetly go out with his friend and enjoy alot and party . as the coin ha two side , we can support only one person that he is right and he is worng . it mainly depends on their mentallity also . some young people may not enjoy everything and the older one may not restrict everything . some may differ but moreover , most of the young people will prefer to enjoy every movement in life rather than the old people .
