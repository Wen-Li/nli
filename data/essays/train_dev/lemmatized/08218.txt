nowadays , in korea , i think many young people do not give enough time to helping their community . instead , they spend their time on their own task . i 'd like to give you some of example of young people in korea . the first example is that many young people say that they are helping their community . they claim that they go to orphange or public place such a post office or police station in order to help their community . actually , they are not going to the place in order to contribute to society . they volunteer in fake in order to get score or fulfill the time required to go to high school or college . if the required time of volunteering is fulfilled , they do not volunteer any more . the second example is that , in korea , when a social matter occured , many young people protested against it and they continually protested until it wa improved . however , nowadays , most young people are ignorant of the social matter . they only pay attention to their own . because of that , there are many social problem unsolved throughout the country . though the some young people are really spending time on helping community , most of the young people do not help their community . they only do their task . they do not give much attention to their society . i think the main reason for this is that the ` individualism ' which wa spread to young people from european country or america . we , koreans , should follow our tradition , which put a lot of emphasis on helping community . if we behave like this , our country can not develp well . if we want to make a better country , we , young people should spend some time helping to the communites . these kind of activity may not be hard . we can pick some trash scattered in the street or we can help disabled people in the road . we can give some of our money to poor people or we can visit hospital or people in need once in a week . these might be not tough . instead of spending time on ourselves , we can help community with those kind of acitivities . through our effort , we can make a better world . help community !
