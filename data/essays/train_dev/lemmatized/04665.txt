i believe this statement is true only in part . youg people nowadays are involved in a variety of activity for their social and cultural development , that it is hard to find time to help the community . schools take away the most part of the day and personal study take away another big percentage . the rest of the day is used by young people to relax or to have fun . a critic reader might say that these aspect are secondary , but it is not totally true . in a culture where social pressure is so stressed and everybody ha to reach high standard , the time used to relax , think , and have fun is foundamental . young peolple of today are more stressed than young people of fifty year ago . i believe this is a basis that is hard to demolish . on the other side it is true that the time a person ( not only a young one ) sacrifice in order to help the comunity is a well spended time . helping the community mean , for young people , the possibilty to grow in a wide sense and , in particular , to start testing the world of work . these young people who help their community are developping those skill that are essential later . there are still thousand and thousand of young people who are hard working for their community not regarding of money . these people are part of the hidden world that the adult like to forget about when they wrtite their critic speech about the passitivity of the new generation . i can assure that i know at least 20 boy and girl who everyday take care of the country , the society where they leave without a single world of gratitude by anybody . those are the people of tomorrow , the people who will change the world in order to secure better condition for the society .
