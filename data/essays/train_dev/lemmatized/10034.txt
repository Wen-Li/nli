in my opinion , apart from some specfic case of people who are ` self taughed ' , we always need to use the experience of our ancestor . it is completly insane to set a frontier between past and present . success in whatever field is built on past experience . for instance , in biology , current scientist are leading research program using the conclusion of former scientist . alexander fleming discovered pennicilline in the 1920s and medical progress could not be a advanced a it is today if he had not . nevertheless , admittedly , if you do not take risk , you are not likely to make progress . indeed , if investor had not trusted scientist to fund their research , there would not have been such an advanced science . investors can be states , private company , etc . they take risk because when they invest their money in medical reserach for intance , they are not sure that this research program will be successful tomorrow . if the program fails , they can lose all the money they invest in such a program to the detriment to other potential successful program . the solution would be to match both the opinion . most of successful people try new thing and use what they know from former experience at the same time . indeed , people must call themselves into question before taking risk and they must try new thing to survive . tht is why human being are so different from animal . this is what we call human intelligence . not to take danger basically , i think both part of the statement are true but we must bind rhem together not oppose them . indeed , in order to go further in the analysis , it is impossible to take risk whithout using what we know and , on the contrary , you can not make progress without taking risk .
