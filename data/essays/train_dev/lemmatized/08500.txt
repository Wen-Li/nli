i think that i am the kind of person who is willing to give a lot of time to helping my community , but when i get right down to it i can not find so much time . probably , like me , a huge amount of person experience the same problem . i absolutely agree with the statement but , at the same time , i can understand why different category of people do not spend time helping others . first of all , young people are extremely busy with their class and sport activity . writing paper , preparing seminar and doing homework require quite half of the day of each student . in addition , they are usually asked to be part of a sport team and so they spend several hour a week training and improving their performance . as a consequence , they are unable to help others , but i think that they do not feel happy about it . normally student are altruist and they feel like they are wasting time when they can not improve the life of the community they belong to . secondly , people , who have a family and child , are completely full of stress . sometimes , they have their own work in the morning and then once at home they have to take care about child . i think that the real problem is that the life is too fast for them . all day long , family are planning something or improving something different . in this way , they can not understand the importance of taking their own time and dedicate some of it to the community . poor and alone people , for instance , would be enthusiastic spending a weekend with a family , but , anyway it doe not happen so frequently . concluding , i want to say that even if i can understand different and valid reason that lead people living apart from their community , i hope that , tip by tip , everyone will recognize the importance of spending time within a community . it can add value to the routine everyone experience during the week . perhaps , i will start doing something for my hometown little community from tomorrow .
