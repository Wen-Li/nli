the topic of how many time young people must give to the community ha constantly been debated in my neighborhood . this theme originated at the time of first community . in fact , for example , socrates wa tryng to estabilish the best balance between the time that people must spend on their community an the time they can spend for themselves . upon this theme there are two school of thought . the first one say that giving the time to the community is not only a way to iprove the community too but also a way to improve the level of knowledge of young people . in fact , they say , a young people nowadays do n't need only to be learned by a teacher , but also to have a pratical feedback against to his work . for example a young person that have studied the painting method is not really able to paint a ceiling , or a wall , because it need the experience to do it . the second one , on the contrary say that , for young people , giving time for the community in which they live in , it is not a good idea . these because young person might be more interested from these activity than their own study . a team of american psychologists ha been observing the way to give time for the community of about two-hundred of young people for two year and they have developped a theory that is in according with this second school of thought . on balance than , i agree with the first opinion because i think that a young person would became a better person only if he share his time with the community in which he is living .
