our life are affected by different factor . one of the most important factor is the age , where there are some people who think that being young is better than being old and this what i am going to disscus in my essay . there is a statment which said `` young people enjoy life more than older people do '' and i agree with this statment becuse of many reason . first of all young people can enjoy their life more becuse they still facing new thing that they have not met yet and they still learning and having experienses , however old people had face lot of difficulty in life so they are tierd and sometime they might be pesimistic . another reason is that young people are active more than old people so they are able to do different activity that let them enjoy their time more than old people . more over , the mental building of young and old people . where young people have differntn way of thinking and they take life a an easy thing and this might be a reason that let them enjoying their life more than old people . also the physical part where old people do not have enough power to face everything . an example might clariffy more why i am agree with this statment . if there were to men one who is 18 year old and the other is 50 year old and they both were trying to have a new experience in their life such a a sport activity of climbing mountines , so the 18 year old man can do this activity easily and he is adding something to his life and enjoy his time more than 50 year old man . so a we can see from this simple example that the physical apperanse affect their time and activity . but it doe not mean that old people can not enjoy their time and have fun and this is because the best thing to do to enjoy your life is loving youe age and never think of it and take it a a number not a a problem or a fact . finally , i would like to say that even if i agree with this statment it doe not mean that when i became older i am not going to enjoy my life and i would like to give advice for all people around the world that never take life a a problem and always see it a a piese of cacke .
