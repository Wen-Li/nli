cars have caused many problem to the society , such a pollution , some have been resolved , others not : for the pollution special equipemets have been invented to reduce it , but people want more will car evolution be enought to make them survive ? cars are causing a lot of problem : pollution a i mentionned , but also cost required for their functionnement ( rising price of oil ) , noise they make and perturbation they cause in traffic of big city . to these issue car-makers are offering several evolution , but it is not enought : many brand of car have recently be in great financial trouble . general motor or ford are exemples in the united states : they had to reduce their production and have made big change in their direction . they also lost many point in bourse cotation , and had to fire many people . in france the same problem of lose of competition ha appeared recently : brand like renault or peugot have lost more than 10 % of their market part last month . this is going to lead to main restructurations in the next few monthes . for these reason car do not have a bright future , and a reduction of their number can be predict in a few year . altought all of these elemets tend to confirm the car decrease , i think that car have not already done their time , or at least the new generation of car . to my mind car brand have many resource , every sector ha been in difficulty in a period of time . they are inventing a new generation of car which is going to revolutionate the world of car : new car are going to work without petrol , but with more clean material . for this reason they are adapting to new mentality of saving environment . these car will make le noise , and will be more adapted to an urban life . also all brand are not going bad : brand from asia a nissan or toyota are growing up in the united states and in europe : they may remplace local brand . to conclude , in my opinion even if traditional car may dissapear in a few year , they will be remplaced by new car and the number of them is not in significantly going to decrease . so we will be confront to an evolution .
