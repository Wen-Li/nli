i think that it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subject than to specialize in one specific subject . i think that we have to `` open our mind '' to everything because we live in a global society , so we should have many interest . a broad knowledge of many acedemic subject could create different interest . an interest grows through teaching many academic subject in school . i studied many subject in the secondary school , for example latin , math , italian literature , history , philosophy , biology and i appreciated many view of these subject . now i have many interest and i am able to understand different point of view or discussion . i think that a knowledge in one specific subject is wrong .
