what is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subject or to specialize in one specific subject ? in my point of view this is a very controversial topic and i will explain you why . on the one hand you can say , that a broad knowledge is very important and it is good to understand many thing and if you know a lot you will be able to learn new thing faster . but on the other hand there are many disadvantage . fist , it take a lot of time to get a broad knowledge . for example you have to study longer and so you have le time to earn money later . second , you only take an overview of the topic , but you do not receive a deep understanding of them . that is not a problem for easy discussion , but it is very depriving for really big problem like in scientific understanding . moreover , company want to employ specialist , because they are often confronted with very difficult task , which can only solved by an expert . so in a society , where knowledge is becoming more and more important we need people who are the best in their subject and not people , who only know a little bit about everything . in addition to that you are unique when you are an specialist . so you are better than the rest and therefore you are in a very comfortable postition . for instance if you apply for job , you will have no problem to get it , because there are not very many other applicant , who are so fit a you . as a result you get the job and you can earn a high salary and live a pretty good life . to sum it up there are more andvantages than downside to specialize in one specific subject . deeper understanding of the subject and work are only two point , which show you that specialist do better than people , who have a broad knowledge .
