nowadays , we can see a lot of advertiments in everywhere . so , we can get some information about the product which are advertised by their company . some people say that because of the advertisement we can attain much information which is helpful u . however , i do n't agree with them . advertisements have several bad effect because the product are not same a what are advertised . i have one experience . when i wa high school student , i watched a television in my home . suddeny , i saw a advertiment on tv . it wa a ibm computer . when it come to computer , ibm wa second to none . i believed tha comapany . also , at that time my computer wa broken ; so , i needed a new computer . it looked so great . on the advertisement i could see that it wa very new computer , perfect condition for game , free print machine , perfect after service , fast delivery . therefore , i called the number and i bought . i thought it will be deliverd in a week ; but , after 3week it arrived . that wa just beginning . when i got the computer , i could hardly find the printer . so , i called to the company and protested . yet , they just said that they choose some people and they got the printer . worse is that the computer wa not so good to play game what i had wanted . lastely , after service wa the terrible . one month after purchase my computer had some problem . so , i asked after service . when i bought the computer that told me that all of after service would free . in contrast , they required 100 $ for repair fee . they just said that the service day were over . that wa my story . some advertisemnts are same a they really are . but , some are not . we have to think and make sure one more time to believe advertisemnts . the best way is that company advertise just real not exggaeration and then we trust the company .
