the young generation of today is part of global world which is evolving very fast and ha become very demanding for all the people who are an intergral part of it . the life of today embrace only those thing which can help people to run faster in their life to achieve their sky high ambition . thus to say that the young people of today 's world do not have enough time to slow their life and take out some time for helping their community is not an overstatement . first , the global mantra of modern world is to get the best of everything in every sphere of life to be able to become very successful . what this result in is an inner drive in all the young people to go to the best school , best college and then get the most paying job . however , this doe not mean that these young people do not spend some time with other people around them and help them . but the community service mostly done today is done to get some good voluntary work on their resume to be able to make it to best college . second , i feel that there is lot of pressure on these young people to perform the best . this pressure includes both peer pressure at workplace or place of study and also social pressure in the society which doe not recognize people unless they are on top of every activity . this increased pressure ha resulted in young people becoming part of only those group which include people who have similar goal and aspiration . as a result , these young people feel that is it waste of time by doing something like community service on regular basis that doe not promte their own ambition . finally , i feel that the work load of all young people ha increased . the school work hardly result in any time for these young mind to take out some time even for their parent . the extra long working hour of the wokplace also ensure that people are out of house for most part of day all week . my example is most suited for such situation cause i spend atleast fifteen hour daily for six day in week at my job place and there are time when i do not get a chance to even talk to my parent for week in row . the one off hoilday here and there is spent by me with my friend . thus very little time remains with me to be able to do some help to other people . however , there are still certain example today of people who have left college and their well paying job to start some venture to help their community , the example of a famour nri is inspiration for all who left his multi million dollar job to start micro finance project in rural india which ha become the first and biggest organisation of such kind . there are other example too where young college student have gone to rural area to teach the farmer and help them to manage their business . these student have formed a ngo in delhi which ha affiliation from more than 10,000 student all over india and are involved in giving reaching class in 35 village in 5 state in india . in conclusion , i feel that the youth of today is too engrossed in his own life and thus find difficult to do anything for the people around him . not to mention , that there are people who are able to manage this so called busy schedule of theirs and realise that helping others is the biggest virtue of human being , these people perform the dual role of achieving their ambition and also helping some people round them in whatever way they want can .
