there is some student who prefers to study without understand the principal idea and concept of what he is studying , because he think that it is unhelpfull or also a waiste of time ; other student , in the opposite way , prefer to pay more attention on the concept rather than on the mere fact . i am in this second group for many reason , whose the principal one are three . the first reason is that i am not so able to study by heart , because of my often failing memory . therefore i prefer to study the logical process , the reason and the link of different event , rather than the mere fact and information about them . for example , studying history , i prefer to learn about the cause of a fact , while it is more difficult to me to study date or event . the second reason , that can be linked with the previously one , is that , when a student understands the logical base and the reason of various fact , it will become easier to him to learn the fact that derived from that because he make on his brain a logical map of all the argument he is studying . in history , for example , it is helpful to understand what event cause another one , and why ; in this way , it is easier to learn that the first one occurs before the second one , and thus it is easier to learn date . the last principal reason that make me sure about my agreement with the statement is that to understand what a student is studying is more helpfull for him , not only for the graduation , but also and mostly for his life . in fact to understand something that also is not interesting improves people 's mind , and we can become smarter . to sum up , though somebody think that we can learn only the fact from what we are studying , i am sure that it is more important and productive to understand idea and concept , and sometime it is also necessary to me !
