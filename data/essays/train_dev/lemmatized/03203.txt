knowledge is like a sea . it is so vast that there is no end to it . even if you feel you have expertised in the subject there will always be something related to that subject which you are not aware of because in every subject there is always some advancement being brought . in my opinion it is always good to have knowledge about different subject rather than a specific subject . these are the following reason for which i support this opinion . firstly , knowledge of different academic subject will always give a person better job opportunity when he step out into the competent world . he will have different choice available with him from which he can choose the better one for him . however if he is equipped with just a single subject he ha no choice but to go for job available in that field which might not be a appealing a he thought it would be . i had one of my friend who studied geography but then later she ended up realising that she wa not in the right place and she wolud rather enjoy better if she wa in the field of computer . secondly , it avoids boredom . we become lethargic studying something for a long time . if we are studying more than one subject we can switch over to the next and get a change . for instance , if we are studying history for five hour and we have music a our alternative subject switching over to it will always be refreshing . thirdly , we obtain an understanding in different area of study . by specializing in a single subject we will have knowledge about only that particular field . however , world is filled with variety of thing and if we are to encounter anything else other than our subject we might feel a if lost in a forest . this is not good because it can keep u away from mingling with others and this can also lead to frustration in life . hence , i feel it is better to obtain bit of knowledge in various subject because this will help u widen our horizon . it will help u to find a place in society and also help remain happy .
