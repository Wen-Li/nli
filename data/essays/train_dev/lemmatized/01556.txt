i do agree with the statement that `` the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide '' . there are four reason show that it is benifitial to travel in a tour group . first of all , it is much more safer to travel a a group than by one ' self . especially when people want to travel in different country , it is possible for them to get lost or get in trouble . if they travel in a group , since people can take care and protect each other , the opportunity of getting lost or even get ripped is very small which keep them having a wonderful trip . secondly , when travel in a strange country , there are too many thing needed to be considered . sometimes , it will be exceedingly confused for people to figure out which way to go , what bus to take or even where to live . for example , once i went to the capital of china , beijing with my parent , it should be a wonderful trip for u , since we had no much time to get together . however , it took u almost the whole day to find a hotel to stay over night which we wasted time and energy . eventually , the trip wa ended in a unhappy mood and everyone wa so tried to even look around . threrefore , travel in a group and having a tour guide can make the trip more efficient and easy . thirdly , sometimes due to the misunderstanding of different culture , people who do not fimiliar about that culture may make mistake . in addition , the mistake can be very seriours that tourist may cause accident or hurt . however , having a tour guide can give tourist the best and most accurate suggestion and warns which provide them avoid making unnecessary mistake . lastly , the tour guide always know the best place to shopping of present for friend or tourist themselves . usually , tour guide will set up a day or particular time for shopping , since it is not only about shopping , it is also about the culture in that country or city . however , if people travel alone , they probobly may not find the cheapest and the best to shop . in conlustion , i think travel in a group led by a tour guide is a bright idea for saving money and energy , keeping themselves safe and having the most efficient and wonderful trip .
