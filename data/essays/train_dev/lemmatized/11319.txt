what i can say is that in twenty yaears we will probably witness the change af the whole concept of car , regarding thier number anyway , i do n't think it will lessen too much . at least a far a our civilization will save unchanged it concept of progress and wellfare . i believe two main choice or possibility are open to u , talking of personal moving device : we can keep integrating the old concept of personal car with our newest hi-tech-toys and system ( and this is indeed happening ) , either we can use our latest tchnological achievments in order to radically change the hard problem of massive and personal transportation , and try , int his way , to cope with other big unsolved problem too : such a pollution , democratic acces to technology , urban traffic and public transportation . it is a matter of fact that the main source of energy for our society , ( that 's oil , petroleum ) , on which is based also the whole productive chain of our new millenium culture , wo n't last for ever . thus answering about the population of car within twenty year becomes quite a complex subject . just consider that a similar crisis , the lack of the source energy ( slave ) which wa at the base of their productive system , deeply contributed to the fall of roman empire . .. and yet we do not have report about wondering whether in their future the romans would have used slave for their leptigae or something else . jokes a part everyone must consider two point : are we ready to submit our health , our money , and in time like these our peace a well , to a small group of man 's greed , who want to sqeeze the last drop of oil out of the earth and the last cent from our pocket ? and then , would it be possible that an old device such a a car ha become defintely obsolete in more than one hundred year ? because otherwise you see , i really can not understand why a tool supposed to improve our speed and mobility nowdays just jam u more than else . concluding i suppose car will remain a we know them untill someone will be able to earn money from them , then , after , i hope something will change at least in it same idea , transorming the car in something really useful , m ore than
