facts can be research by student in order to improve their knoledge about an idea . there is several way to support the statement that is more important understan idea and concept than acquire knoledge of fact . science requiere student to think constantly and develope a critic way to think . for example , for a lawyer it is more importante to learn how to think logically than learn a set of law in order to be sucesfull in his carrier . a set of law can change withing one period of congress ; this will leave the given lawyer who just learn a set of law obsolet . he will need to go to university to learn again the set of law to be usefull in his field . fortunately , this is not the way that lawyer learn about their carrier , most of the knoledge adquired at a law school is to think logically . even with a cange of legislation a lawyer still been a lawyer . however , there is allways the requirement to be updated with tecnology and new research to be succesffull in any given carrier . for a historian there is no discution that is require to learn fact . the same concep doe not apply for a doctor . there is allways the necesity of improve proceces to evolve with socity . this is the reason that university develop research department . if socity doe not make research there will be no progress in many industry . in order to achive progress stdents make research to understand idea and concept . if their noledge is based just on fact they would be no able to discover new theory . for example , all the improvement in telecomunications . thanks to the understanding of idea and concept student ha improve the internet telephony making ship to call long distance . finally , will be imposible to socity to progress if we just waste time to learning fact . like in a picture , socity will be static with no improvement , like the menonites that like to live in the past ignoring the new opportunity that idea brings .
