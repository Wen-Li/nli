i am 24 year old and i have been studying electronic engineering for five year . during my study i have often asked to myse lf it is better to have a broad knowledge of many academic subject than to specialize in one specific subject . from my experience i realized that the best way to attain good result is to specialize in one specific subject . in particoular thare wa an event that convinced me of that . in fact there wa a semster in wich i had four course at the same time plus the development of my bachelor ' s degree thesis . i wa going to begin my master 's study and in the same period i even had to present my bachelor 's degree thesis work in a conference . i wa very busy with my thesis however i decided to register for four class . it wa a big mistake . in fact i could not attend all the lesson and when i had the exames i did not took good grade . moreover i did not have a broad knowledge but just a superficial one . this wa an important experience for my future choiches . in fact i realized that a broad knowledge is something that come with time . in the next semester i chose to register for two or maximum three class . i could attend all the lesson and when i studied at home i had enough time to go depper in the topic that i have had listened in class . in this way i took very good grade that now permit me to apply a ph.d. at the m.i.t . . from my experience during my master 's study i realized that it is quite difficult to have a broad and deep knowledge at the same time . therefore i think that it is better to specialize in one or few subject . in this way it is possible to have a deeper knowledge and after few time even a broad knowledge . with this porpouse in my mind i am going to apply for my ph.d. and i am sure that in this way i will able to have other success .
