`` it is more important for student to understand idea and concept that it is for them to learn fact . '' i am strongly agree that idea and concept is much more important than just learn or remember the fact a it is . although we are surrounded by milliones of billiones of fact , but a a student , i believe that somehow tell them how to fish is better than just give them fish . undeniable , we have to learn some basic fact in order to do some further explanation or elaboration . ultimately , we go through that much of study basically is to archieve something . if ours goal were just to learn something , learning fact will be much more easier and effective . but we are not only learning , absorbing , and memorizing ; we are also improving , creating and inventing . for instance , if we just tell a student that sun provides heat and light . he will just tell you a it is . in other hand , if we told the student the idea and concept of sun providing heat and light . perhaps here come different , since the student understand well , he have much more space for him to create or imagine . imagination brings creation . by simply memorizing or learning fact will not prevent the student from further thinking . hence understanding is better than learning . follwing is understanding will give the student better imprint than just by hard learning . people say , '' learn by heart not learn by only head '' or '' study smart not study hard '' . these show that better concept on a subject will create a newline in study . students will never allowed to say , `` sorry , i forgot '' . this is because they are not memorizing hard or just `` swolled '' a it is . things that they learned is learn by example , idea , and concept . the will simply recall the fact by seeing the example or relate this to that by ultimately knowing the basic idea . we are moving to a new world , a whole new era . students are those who support the coming future . they should neither study with only old fashion style nor just forget about tradition . instead of that , they should study in a fusion , a combination way of study .
