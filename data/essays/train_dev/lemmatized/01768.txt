from the first glance more people see that car help people to achieve their goal faster and more safe than any land mean of transportation . cars save in time , go to the goal quickly and return to home quickly , and if the man ha a sudden event happened at deep night he can take a quick decision to go some where rapidly to solve the problem . now aday there a huge number of car for all the purpose mentioned above but on the other hand car are the source of pollution and source of paying alot of money . so , car have advantage and disadvantage but with the progress happened in the world and the high technology in the field of it , communications and transportations make people if they anything they call by phone or send by email to ask their need either they need to buy good or to acheive a service . an example : for man : if someone want to know his account in bank so he will enter via the internet and go through the web site of the bank and enter with his account from his office or home and make all trnsiactions he want to do . for housewife : if sher want to buy any anything from the supermarket , she will call buy phone so her movement outside the home will become le . for student : in the summer vacation and the student want to know his result or grade , he will know the result from his home via internet . and so on so the need of car will be le than before . also , enhancement on the mean of transportation and the suitable price of their ticket make people do n't want to buy car and using the train and bus more than car . so , in my opinion , i see that these factor which are - progress in the world in it and communication field - enhancement in the other mean of transportation like train and bus and they become more comfortable and safe. make the no.of car - suitable price of ticket either for bus or train . at the end , i am agree with statement which said that the number of car will reduce in the next twenty than today
