the manufacturer are using advertisement to mark their product . they are using new technique which will attract many people . thus increasing their market . according to me i do n't agree to the perception that , if the advertisement is good , the product is always good and reliable . advertisement is a source used to make people familiar with a product . but it will not judge the quality of a product . due to spending more on the advertisement , the producer are not able to invest money to increase the quality of the product , decrease the price of the product and icrease the quantity of the product . recently there are so many problem identified with the use of prducts like coke and pepsi . the manufractures are spending more money to advertise and they are also investing lot on celebrity to make them their product 's ambessedors . but it is found that these product are causing daingerous effcts on the health of the people . toxic substance are used in these product which cause serious health effect . they also deteriorate bone in adult and cause growth hazard in child . children are more attracted by the celebrites . another thing about advertisement is that , than to spend money in producing an attractive advertisement , company should invest more on improving the quality of product that they are producing . also buy spending more on advertisement there is no economical benefit for the consumer , in order to attract more consumer , the price of the product should be reduced . also if the quantity is increased then more middle class people will be attracted to that product . so in my opinion the advertisement are sophasticated source which seems to make product better than they are actually .
