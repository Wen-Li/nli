i disagree to this concept because if most of the advertisment contains a false knowledge for thier product . nobody will believe any of the advertisment . which lead a lack of knowledge for a consumer which is the most suitable product to buy . that mean that all the money budget for the advertisment gone for nothing . moreover , it will cause the hatrege of the consumer to the company , even if they sell a varies kind of product . but it better for the advertisment company to have a funny advertisment in the tv . after that announce the name of the product . in that way everybody body will remember the product because of the funny advertisment . the only effective time to advertise about product is when you have a low amount of product . and the company want to get red of it .
