the world today demand for student to understand that an education is a tool that is used to `` keep the world going . '' now , many student choose to learn the bare minimum to get by in their professional career , and are exempting from their life that understanding concept and idea is more important than to just learn quick fact . in my experience understading a specific subject in a class ha enriched my learning ability , and given me the satisfaction of understanding every detail of that specific course . i have seen many of my classmate barely get by through school , because they rely on learning quick fact , pas coursed , and then receive a diploma so they can join the work force . i strongly belive that they join the real world unprepared . the student body that us fact a a method of learning will have incovienient disability understanding concept later in life becuase they will not know how to analyze situation correctly and solve problem . as simple a a fact can be , it may influence learning significantly , for example , fact : if student use the method `` memory dump '' a soon a they receive the test , it will help them to do better . well , if student would rely more on understading the subject matter and the idea they are being tested on prior to the exam , they would not have to rely on `` memory dump . '' i am in complete accordance with student experiencing life through understading concept and idea , since this way they may always be able to spread their knowlege with other people . just imagine living life with only fact , that many time are uneccessary and vague , whereas to live life with the full knowledge that you can explain or simply express any topic due to the understading you aquired during your learning period .
