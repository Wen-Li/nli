the world we live is full of variety and diffrences between people . we share diffrent culture , diffrent tradition , diffrent job , diffrent responsibilties . everybody is diffrent for the others in his way of expressing life . the world is a huge stage and nearly everybody is an actor . to be able to communicate with each others we should know about each others intresets , this is mainly based on what we aquir in our academic life . it 's a vaste subject list . it 's better to have broad knowledge of many academic subject simply because the society requieres the variety , requieres the change between all living humains . this is to lead u to communication and communication is to lead u to knowledge . immagine a person life specialized in one specific subject only . no variety , no communication , no expanded knowledge . tyhis is the type of person who communicate with there ressemblance only , or in most of the time they become `` the outsider '' . complete isolation of the society , and this may lead to a public danger , or to suicide . it 's then prefarable to be an open person . meeting diffrent person with diffrent intersts and charing diffrent aspect of life . image a man specialized in complexe physic and only complexe physic , can you draw a life for this kind or people ? it 's very difficult for him to built a family , to communicate with his wife , child , neighbor , friend . one step after the other they will turn to isolation , live and work outside society and thus a failure of life . we live in a absurde world with so much of diffrent desiers and intrestes . i herebly agree with the statment above . it 's much better to have a broad knowledge pf many academic subject than to specialize in one specific subject . life is an adventure , we live once , we should do what we feel is rite to do . we 're like an flower , said descart , we grow and acquire knowledge we feel we 're king of the world , a we grow more we realise we know just a little of the perplexe and complexe world , we then start to become humble , and die .
