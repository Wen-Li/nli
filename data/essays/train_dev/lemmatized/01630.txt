i agree with the statemant that in twenty year there will be fewer car in use than there are today . i have two reason why i agree with the statement . one reason is that there will be a lot of people in here japan in twenty year . so if there are a lot of people here in japan , of course they will buy a fewer car and use it maybe everyday . because it is really usefull to use a fewer car when we go to somewhere eals . so i am sure that they will buy a fewer car . other reason is that there will be a lot of nice fewer car , great fewer car and very usefull fewer car here in japan in twenty year . so people will want to get them ! as a result , in japan in twenty year , i agree with the statemant . because there will be a lot of people and also there will be a lot of usefull fewer car and so on .
