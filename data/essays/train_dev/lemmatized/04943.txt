people have their own idea whether youth do not give much time to help their neighborhood . some people may say that in these day , some young people do not have enough time to help others . in my opinion , however , young people do not give time to help others : they focus on their own thing and they are more busy than past younger . first , young people have to concentrate on only their work . it is generally agreed that young people can not avoid any competition such a have a job or enter the university . therefore , young people do not have enough time to help other people . for example , if they do not focus on their task , they can not survive in modern society . having a job is the very important thing in their life . they must think only their work for their future . in this way , younger people can not have time to help others . second , modern society make young people busy . some people might think that young people have a lot of spare time such a vacation . however , lot of people enjoy their life at an early age because if they get older they can not have much time to enjoy their life . for instance , young people make plan at long vacation . they can go abroad or thay can study other major which young people want to learn . in this way , young people nowadays can not spend their spare time helping their community . to sum up , young people do not have time to help their community . they have a lot thing to do and they must enjoy their time when they are young . all thing considered , i can definetely say that youth have difficulty in having time to help their neighbor .
