i am quite agree to this statement which state `` it is more important for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact '' nobody can learn all fact about any subject , but he/she can understand all idea and concept of any topic . genrally science and technical student prefer to understand the idea and concept of topic , they know that if they remember the idea and concept of any topic of a subject , they can explain that topic without the help of fact . when i wa in collage i prefer to give more time on understands the idea and conceptas of a topic , becouse i belive that idea and concept are unique for a particuler topic but fact may match . research student are also give more time on understand the idea and concept of a topic rather than learn the fact . becouse they know that during the answer of a question , teacher and student like to know what are idea and concept behind this work rather than fact . business student are also give more attention on understand the idea and concpets rather than learn fact . becouse coustmers and company want idea and concept behind the successful product not fact . sports student are also give more attention on understand idea and concept of any game rather than to learn fact of that game . they think if they know the idea and concept of any game , they could give good perfomance on that game . most of my friend ` when i wa doing master in technology ' prefer to understand the idea and concept of any topic . becouse in master lot of complex topic are involed in syllubus . so , nobody could perform well in this complex topic when they do not have good command in idea and concept of that complex topic . so , i finally can say that it is more important for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact .
