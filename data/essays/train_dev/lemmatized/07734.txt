in my opinion it is important for student to understand idea and concept beacause without them they will never understand the fact . i can expalin it much more better with an esample : if you understand the concept of gravity you can understand why we can ' t fly , but if you only know the fact that we ca n't fly you do n't know the concept of gravity . you can understand that there is something more but without some further fact you can ' t find the concept . but at the same time fact are very important for a student . we live in a socety that it forgets the past in a very easy way , the more we go on the more we forget and school are not good in giving u the information . i also konw it is difficult to give u all the information because there is so few time but the few argument that they had chosen for u are not enought . in italian school , for esample , we study for many year the preistoric period , tha acient , tha middle age . .. the story ! but when we finally arrive to study , at latest year of school , recent story of the world and of our country we run and at least we arrive at the first period after the ii warld war ; now we are in 2007 and there are fifty year of fact that we don ' t know well and for this we have a not culturate class of people that it will govern u . .. this is only an esample to show how fact , in my idea are much more important to understand than idea and concept also because if you learn much more better the fact , from them , you will reiceive also the idea and concept that are unified to them .
