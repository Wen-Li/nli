although my job is a kind of advertiser , i have to say , yes , this problem happens daily . it 's not difficult for u to find some shampoo advertising on the tv , after used that brand of shampoo , your hair become , woo , shining , beauty and fantasic . unfortune , when i use that brand , the magic did n't happen to me . for lot of reason , advertisement make product seem much better than they really are . first important reason is , when the client believe the advertisement , the will buy the the produce . the producer can earn much more money than before . a little over than fact , nothing big deal . then , lack of manage from the goverment . some medical and food advertisement , the effect are different from the advertising , the end-users canl be hurt or even dead . but some product have n't been challenged yet , still producting without the goverment 's control . as a person work on advertising , i know this situation need to be changed . with my workmate , we always try to persude our clients-the producer to accept the advertising concept `` the advertisement , the real fact '' . we can believe , with the more goverment 's and all people 's support , no one buy these product , no benifits , the problem can be sloved .
