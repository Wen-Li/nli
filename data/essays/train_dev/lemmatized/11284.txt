i agree with the statement . i think people should have broad knowledge of many academic subject . here is an example why i agree with the statement . i know a person who became rich man . actually , he is my grandfather , and died in peace . when he wa young , he wa good student . he never thought about making money . he just liked to study everything he wanted to know . his teacher thought that he could be a teacher of math because he never got wrong on math test . so , his teacher told him to have more time in math , but he did n't want to do . he wanted have broad knowledge because he did n't want to study one specific subject . so , he studied and studied , but he could not go to a university because he wa so poor . after he graduated from his high school , he wanted to get a job . many company did n't want to hire him because he did n't graduate from a university . the company wanted well-educated people on that time . so , he worked a a darily worker . he wa not a formal worker , but he worked hard and hard . while he worked , he still studied everything he could do . after eight year later , he made some money . he wanted to get a own company , so he opened a small market . he already knew about how to do because he studied all the time he could do . he used all knowledge to his market . the market wa getting bigger and bigger . he got marry with pritty woman and he opened another market . he opened four market until he died . in conculsion , i think it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subject than to specialize in one specific
