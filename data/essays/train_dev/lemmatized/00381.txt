generally speaking a successful person is someone who succeed in all his attempt , is good in his job and earns a lot of monnaye . and all of this aspect are often seen in the area of a job . so a successful person must have a good job and ha to do his job a no one else , what can lead u to say that he try new thing and take risk rather than only doing what he already know how to do well . to my mind , it 's right that to be successful somebody must have some nerve to apply some theory or to launch a new product on the market . i think that without any quality so a to stay undisturbed or the ability to forsee what will have some success , we ca n't have any success . the two quality , enonced in the subject , are also not enough . sometimes these successful people take risk , just because these risk extist , they do n't care about there success , but they like the game that it implies ; it 's not a question of doing well or not . but i must say that there are other people , who one day also try new thing with nerve and good idea , but were unsuccessful . so the fact to try new thing and to take risk is not an insurance that our project will succeed . there is a part of luck that we ca n't forget . we can say that successful people are kind of lucky people . and to be carefull is not so bad , i think ; because to do well is not something that anybody can do . it requires quality , which are not the same a to try something new , and it can appear a more difficult to do well a to be an aventurer . i ca n't forget to say that there is a third class of people , those who do well , who analyse the situation and take advantage of it and so are successful . and we can take example on these one , because they are a good melt of a raisonable mind and of an aventurer spirit .
