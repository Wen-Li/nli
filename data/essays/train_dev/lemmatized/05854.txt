in one hand , i 'm not agree with this following statement . as we can see , there is more and more people who living on this earth . progress of medecine , which make u our life being longer , the multiplication of the population let me think that we will be more human in 2026 than in 2006 . and due to this multiplication , the number of car sold out each year make me feel that car will develop in the same way like the population . moreover , no government have for the moment took postion in order to discover a new mean of transport . they are elaborating composed fuel ( with ethanol ) or other kind of fuel , in order to reduce gas emission in the atmosphere but not in the way to reduce number of car . but on the other hand , many thing make me think it to the contrary . fisrtly , i have talked about progress made by the medecine , in the first section , but it 's also all progress made in science in general . something let me think that some utopists had the right key . i 'm attend to wait for a replacement of car by plane . it 's in my logic . and why do the teletransportation can not be created in the nearest future . teletransportation can replace car . secondly , i 'm sur that the lack of petroleum which must happen in further year , will be the key of the substitution . even if we find solution . .. but today , it is not going in that way . we can also try to limit the number of car by instauring mass mean of transport , like bus or train . finally , the lack of petroleum is not the only reason of a whispered decline in the number of car . even if we are still to discover new material , added to the number of car made by year , we can suggest a lack in metal , plastic , a far a the consumptiom of all habitant of this earth is so fast . to me , it is difficult to forecast such a statement , even if i hope there will be le and le car , and what i hope the most , is that a genius must created the teletransportation , it will be very efficient for all people in all the world . but who know what our future is made of . ..
