from the this question i would say , i strongly agree about most advertisement make product seem much better than they really are . theseday we can see advertising everywhere . so we can have effect by advertising but most product advertisement lie to u first , advertiser want to sell product so they lie to u . most product seem really nice in the advertising . but it 's not . because advertiser want to sell thier product so they make product seem much better in the advertisement . for example , fewdays ago i bought bulejean . i saw advertising from tv and jean color is really nice . so i bought jean use the internet . but when i got a jean , color is different . they lie to me . second , advertiser get a money from the producter . so advertiser make famous advertisement in addition advertiser should lie to people because to sell product . and if product sell very much , his advertising will be famous . finally , from the this reason first , advertiser want to sell product so they lie to u , second , advertiser get a money from the producter . so
