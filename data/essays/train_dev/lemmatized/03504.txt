although being polyvalent is a good thing because you are able to discus about everything , being specialized in one specific subject is more valuable to me . indeed , in my opinion , when you are able to be the best in one specific subject it mean that you can focus very hard on something in a way to do your best . that 's the most important . people who have a little knowledge of a lot of thing are common person . being specialized in one topic is very important because it 's a way to make yourself different . being good at ease on several subject is common nowadays . you are not efficient when you are know a little of severals topic because your mind is not focus on something that you can do , or explain better than everything . even if you have an important knowledge of several topic , you are not able to be a good , in your argument , a someone who is very good in one subject . furthermore , being very good in one subject mean being weak in other topic . because you spend most of your time in studying ( or working ) the same thing , you do n't open your mind to other thing , or do n't even being interested in doing something else because you know that you wo n't be able to be a good a you are in your specialisation . anyway , if your are able to focus yourself to only one thing , it mean that you can focus on anything . being well focus on something is one of the most important thing nowadays : in work , study . . anything . to me , you are more efficient when you are able to forget everything around you except the thing you are doing . as an example let 's take the car . if you are focus when you are driving , if you are not changing the radio or dialling a number on your cellphone , nothing can happen even if a other car arrives very fast from anywhere . because being focus on something mean control it .
