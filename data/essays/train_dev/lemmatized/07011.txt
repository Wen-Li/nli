as the year pas by , many university , school and other institution are trying to teach the future generation and provide them with the wide variety of science which make them ready for the future challenge . the question that always rise in these institution is whether it is more important for the student to understand the idea and concept or to learn the hard fact . in my personal opinion , i think it is more important for the student to understand the main concept of the subject than to learn fact . as for a student to learn a fact , all he ha to do is to memorise it . memorising something without understanding it will lead to forgetting this fact a soon a _or shortly after _ the stimulus for memorising it is over . facts are only memorised and stored in the long term memory if they are constantly used in everyday life . for example when a medical student ha to memorise all different type of drug . if this student wa n't asked about these drug in every morning round , where he had to revise them everytime he made a mistake , he would otherwise forget them . on the other hand , understanding the subject make it easier to remember . for example when the same medical student ha to memorise some information about the physiology of the human body . he can understand it once , and answer any question related to this topic year after he had studied it . this is why i prefer understanding the topic over learning the fact . as the fact are easily lost over the year and what remains is what we understand of that particular subject . understanding the idea and concept requires far more work and processing by the student than only memorising the fact . so it is always up to the student at the end to choose between understanding and memorising .
