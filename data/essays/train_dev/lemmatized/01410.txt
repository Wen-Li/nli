i agree that the person should focus on one specific subject . basically i can summarise the process for success a `` find and dig it . '' discussion might be related to what subject rather that how many subject . sometimes people are concern of money or reputation . money is a demonstration of success and reputation is an elevation of social status . i agree that money and reputation are important . however , i also believe that if someone is loving what he is doing , ultimately he will receive what he planted . the person occupied business with more dedication , it will be blooming with many flower . those who reallly perform what they like they can show enduring dedication . roumi once said that a person who stand in all gate can never stand in any gate truly but a person stand in one gate will stand in all gate . people who try to collect everything will end up with nothing . they will have many distracted idea . his effort were dispersing in many issue and his knowledge will be limited . he can not deepen the subject and know the detail . however when a person specialized in one subject , he get a perspective of analyzing the problem . since he concentrate all his effort in one field , he can become more creative . he will think of the subject all the time . many people have a problem about timing . they criticize their mismanaging schedule . therefore the time management concept wa revealed a a part of business field . the time management is about work le and do more . how will we create this seemingly paradoxal case ? well , while we are squezing our day in a few issue , we will become more productive . every action will be complement each other rather that obstacle each other . so , i finally recommend to all mentor ( parent , friend , teacher ) to help kid to find the beloved subject and to encourage them to work hard .
