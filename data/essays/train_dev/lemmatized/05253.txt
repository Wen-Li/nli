enjoyment is not age or time bounded . its way of living joyfully , giving our best effort to life and extract whatever possible we can draw from life to make everyone around u happy . in different age everyone ha his own way to enjoy life , so i disagree with topic that young people enjoy life more than old people do how we define enjoyment , for young people riding bike at high speed , late night party , rock climbing and other adventur sport , movie , drink can be way to enjoy life , on other extreme of life basking at the beach , holding hand oh life partener and walking on send , memmorising the old day with photo album can be way to enjoy life . the way used by young people to enjoy life can be abhor by old people , and the path adopted by old people to enjoy life can be dull and monotonus for young guy . a young guy may enjoy to see a person sliped on wet ground , a old person may enjoy giving hand to guy on fell the road . enjoyment of young people are mostly extravagent show , full of materialism , lewdfullness , levish party that all show the adrenaline running in their vessel , it also lighten the impatince bound with the age concern , on other side enjoyment of geriatric person solemnly start and and in spiritualism . so i conclude my word by saying that both extreme of life ha there own way to enjoy the life and that cant be compare with the age .
