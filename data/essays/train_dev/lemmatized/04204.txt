life is full of diversity , not only of individual , but also of experience , subject and situtations . at the same time , it is also full of uncertainty , nothing is secure or granted ; which mean that no one know what is going to happen in the future or what obstacle a person may encounter in his or her life . people always have goal which are frequently based on their interest and belief . however , much people tend to concentrate only in their interest and never acquire knowledge about other thing in life . for me it is very important to have broad knowledge , to know something about everything in life , especially of academic subject . education is the basis of opportunity and the amount of subject in which a person ha knowledge condition his or her opportunity in very important aspect of life like work and even helping others . for example , if a person study only subject concerned with science and he or she need to work and there is no work available in a science area , but he or she know something about business then there is another possibility for work . at the same time if someone need help in something about history or even if there is a competition about historical fact you can be able to participate or help the person even if you are a chef or a doctor . i think it is important to be prepare for everything in life and to acquire the broad knowledge that will help you confront any challenge especially in education or work , which are basic for survival . lamentably a the old saying satets `` life is a box of chocolate and you never know what ysomethings happen unexpectely and if you are not prepare to afront them you are not going to be able to move on .
