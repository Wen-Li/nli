i neither agree , nor disagree with that statement . i think actually both is important . let me give a personal story that helped me getting a conclusion towards this question . the problem is , if these day somebody is only sophisticated in fact and ha not a lot of knowledge about the ideologically fundament among the fact he know about , he will probably always have big problem to convince anyone else for a project or an idea . the modern world leaf a lot of small niche to hide for people who pretend to have a lot of fact-knowledge and who in fact `` did not red the newspaper '' . both case are nothing to follow after . but , to tell this right at the beginning of the sentence , both case are more theoretical-types of being that in fact dont exist that way and i only use them to illuminate my point of view . for example the former german bundeskanzler gerhard schroeder wa often called a big actor , a pretender . a lot of people where concinced , that he did not have much specific knowledge about political programms from his party or important parlamentary decision . and in fact , i often thaught similary - until i met him one day . it wa a rainy sunday and some freinds of mine and me where walking through the bar of berlin . than mr schroeder suddenly stood at our table and asked if we knew where the toilet wa . it followed what always follows , we drank , we laughed and we where talking about politics , a soon a he wa back from the restroom . but my personally lesson from that meeting wa - if somebody is able to make a successfull carreer , where ever that happens , he need to understand fundamentall idea and concept at first - and than he ha to know fact . mr schroeder impressed u all absolutely because of his the huge flood of fact , that so called `` pretender '' could tell u about .
