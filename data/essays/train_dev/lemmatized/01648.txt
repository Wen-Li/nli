it is often said that percent of using car will be decreased with in twenty year than now . some people might agree with this statement because they think that there will be new transfortation which will replace car . however , i firmly believe that using car population will go up in the near future . this is because there are more people who want to buy a car due to develop economy and the tecnology of transper combience such a road will also develop . first of all , a far a i am concerned , a large number of people want to buy car because of breaktrough of economy . in other word , there will be more people who afford to pay buying car . it is commonly observed that economy became go up a time go by . for example , in the past , there are a few people who can buy car because it is extreamly expensive to buy . however , a econmy have developed , many people can have atomobile . this is because , the cost of car have been decreased and people richer relatively than before . therefore , i think that people who will have car will be increase . in addition , tecnology of transpertation infra will also develop with in twenty year . what i am trying to say is that it will be helful to people who want to use car . for instance , many infra 's development such a high way and local road and solving the problem such a car accident will give benefit to a great number of diver . so , from my persective , people who usually used other transfertation due to these problem will use more car . finally , car driver will soar . in conclusion , there are two main reason why i think that using car population will incrase . it is not only because there will exist more rich people who can buy car owing to economy boom , but also technology which related wiht car industry will develop .
