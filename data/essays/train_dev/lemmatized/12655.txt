although according to some people learning fact is more important for student than understanding idea , i believe that the latter one is the key concept in education . understanding idea and concept about lecture is very important in a student 's life because they teach the reason why something happens in a particular way . a person who memorizes or learns only the fact about a topic can answer many question about it correctly but when he face with a situation where he ha to modify , repair or make comment about something he would not be very successful . knowing fact only is not enough for making comment on a topic or explaining the reason for something 's happenning . in order to successfully do these one ha to know the answer for the question like what is going on or what are the underlying principle which can be learnt by understanding the idea and concept about the topic . think of business life where people are faced with many difficult problem . many of those problem can not be overcame by not knowing what really is going on . for example , in a software company which is designing and building a highly complex and huge program employer usually have to solve problem related to the algorithm used in the program or even create new algorithm to solve a problem . also , the solution that are made must be not only successful but also efficient . in order to create an algorithm which brings a successful and efficient solution to problem , the employer have to be able to understand the problem a a whole , think and comment on it and create new idea based on the old one or even from scratch . this of course can not be done by just knowing fact . as a conclusion in order for a person to be successful in his life he ha to learn the idea and concept behind a topic because from my point of view , this is the most important thing that help people developing new idea or explaining current one .
