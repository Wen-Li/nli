what advertisement want to tell u ? we can see a lot of advertisement everywhere nowadays . some is very serious , other is very interesting . however , in my opinion , i agree this opinion that most advertisement make product seem much better than they really are for the following reason : it give positive image , they are emphasized and they are not clear sometimes . first of all , advertisement are usually give u positive image storongly . for example , cosmetic company always use beautifle actoress or model for their product ' advertisement . thus , if people had positive image for her , they would also thed to have great image for the product even if they do not know quarities of the product . secondly , advertisement are usually greatly emphasized . for instanse , food company show how excellent their product are , using blilliant color or showing atractive picture . i bought a chocolete cake because a advertisement wa so atractive and it looked great , however it wa not a delicious a i expected from it advertisement . finally , advertisement are not clear at time , because the most important information is not stated in advertisement or even stated , it is hard to notice . for example , clothing company ' advertisement highlight price of their product . however , it usually do not show material of it product . in conclusion , it is true that advertisement are important for both company and customer . however . i strongly think there are many advertisement which show much better than actual product . the proper judgement for advertisement is essential for u .
