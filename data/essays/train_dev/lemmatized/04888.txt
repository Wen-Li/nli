unfortunatly this world is affected by a new hill called marketing : capitalism and it consequence had created an imperfect economy situation where industry need to change consumer 's will using the new method of propaganda a medium . so the phrase `` product that seem much better than they are '' is an hillusive assertion because we really do n't know what we are buying , eating and always thinking . so i surely agree with the statement but i think is not usefull to complain about a situation if you do n't work to change it . the real condition of many product are hiding to the consumer : we can find many example , from medicine to energy drink . . but i think is the same in fact even though mcdonald 's product are labeled on theyre nutritional value , pepople continue in the same way . so probably the only thing to say is that we are all blind ! the matter is about imperfection of market and information : with a basic economical study everyone can understand that there 's no needing of marketing for the right process of production and distribution of thing . in fact the problem born because of the presence of oligopolistic company needing bad device to sell theyre product on an highest price . i think that almost food have to be cheked with much attention : the true cause of all the sikness of our time { like cancer and so on . . } . although the modern century give to human population time of brightness , from the other side we are bound in a circle in wich { thanks to television and the million of spot every time . . } other tell u what we must desire . in my opinion an implicit { but with our avaliable information explicit ! } attempt to our will .
