the issue of advertisement may be considered in different way . it is often believed that the purpose of advertisement is only to make people aware of the existence of the product . however it is also true that , in some case , advertisement make product seem much beautiful or much useful than they are . taking all aspect into account , i strongly feel that advertisement make product seem much better than they really are . the first reason for my belief is that advertisement always show product in a beautiful environment with people who seems very happy , who do not have daily life problem . .. i think that this fake representation of life make people want their life to look like advertisement and to achieve it ... they have to buy this new product if they want to have a better life . another way to justify my point of view is that making product seem much better than they really are is consubstancial to the purpose of advertisement . indeed , the aim is to make people think that they must buy this product , a a result advertisement have to convince people that this one is better than all the other one . last but not least , i am firmly convinced that the aim of advertisement is not only to make product seem much better than they really are , it is also to brainwash people in order to make them interested only by material thing . all thing considered , i would finish by saying that , in my opinion , the result of advertisement are that people just want to buy more and more thing in order to lead a more happy life like people they can see in add but , actually the fact that they have more and more desire make them more unhappy .
