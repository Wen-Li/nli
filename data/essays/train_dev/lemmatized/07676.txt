fewer car in twenty year ? do you really think there will be fewer car in a time of a raising economy ? i do n't think so for 3 reason . firstly , the world ha 60 billion people and it wo n't stop raise . the number of people all over the world will increase . the economy will also increase . my personal infer is that more people need more car , and the graph of the world population supporting my opinion . secondly , people have to be more flexible , it 's a major point in every job . in today job for example you have to travel from berlin to munich daily . you do n't would like to fly because it 's to expensive , so you have to drive . in my mind there is a big importance in beeing flexible , therefore you need to have a car . if you do n't have one you could easily loose your job . do you like loose your job ? thirdly , the car manufacturer are aiming to sell more car a they are doing right now . that 's the goal of every entrepreneur . they are doing everything to increase there car . they will design and manufacture new model . perhaps a new brand will start up . they are reaching new potential customer in third world country . so for example lancia did , they produced very cheap car for poor people . all this lead into a increaing number of car . in conclusion , i say that it 's nearly impossible to decrease the amount of car . there is only one big problem , the oil ressources , but we have very good scholar to invent new alternative mobile without the need of oil . i am very excited how the future is going on .
