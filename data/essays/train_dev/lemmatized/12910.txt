i agree with this statement . because in these day we have a lot of advertisement and every day we have new product . when you watch the avertisement at the tv or when you see it in the news paper or on the street you are very impress . and i thing that most of the time the focus on the design , the way that they wrap the product , than the quality . and the reason that they do that is to attract the costumer . because if you see a product and the wrap is very attactive you will attempt to buy it and once you do , it is totally different from what you wa thinking you will be disapointed . for example when can see an advertisement of a naew product on the tv an you want to try it . let 's say it is a deodorant anti-transpirant . you saw the advertisement and they wa saying that if you use it tou will not sweat all day long and it doe not leave any mark on your clothes or you body . you decide to try it . you just go at the store and buy it . in the morning you put your deodorant anti-transpirant and you out. a couple of hour later you see that you are really sweating and there are some mark on your clothes . and you will ask yourself what happens i use the deodorant a indicate and i am sweating ' it wa not suppose to happen . this is how the advertisement work . people just want to make money trough the advertisement by focusing on the design , the color , how it look than the quality of the product himself . ans most of the time
