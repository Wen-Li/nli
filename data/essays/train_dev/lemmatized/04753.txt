i agree with the statment , advertisments make the product seem way much better thay they really are , acctually many time one feals cheated , a you realice the real characteristic of a product you just bought . i think there are three main kind of false statement that are usssualy done about product . they make you think you need them , a far a i know we do n't acctually need all the thing thay they promote , this is easy to observe on tv comercials , ussually it tourns out than they have just invented something that make a work that you never do , realy easy to do , well great but i never do that any way . the second common statment is , that their porduct is able to do some incredible thing , needle to say that most of the time they do n't do anything outstandinglly differnt from what their lest expensive subtitutes do , i have a perffect exaple for this one , ther wa a tv sale show , like ten year ago , that claim they have developed glass that can help you see a an eagle , i mean it is good enough to be able to see a a normal human , and by the way that is a stament that we will never be able to prove ether right or wrong , therefore many people found themselves disapointed by their new sunglass , because at least they did n't do what they expected , i am not saying that anyone liked them anyway . an other typical disguise is to make you belive that you might acctually become a better person , in many sences , by consuming their product . let say they are tring to sell you a car , they display a picture of a young , athletic , good looking guy , sorrounded by a group of beautifull woman , i can assure you that buying the car will not make you look like him or make you sudently irresitable for woman . or how about the mp3 player advertisments > they make young guy think thay they will fit better on their social group if they own one . finally i have to recognize anyway that there are some exeptions , but not many .
