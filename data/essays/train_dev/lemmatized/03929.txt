from my point of view , i agree with the statement that it would be better for a student to have broad knowledge of many academic subject rather than to specialize in one specific subject only . i will explain it from three aspect , personal interest , personal development and vanishing subject . firstly , not much student can realize their interest that which subject they like most . many of them , including me would get frustrated when we should make a choice among thousand of subject to study in university . however , if we no need to choose a specific one to concentrate on , we can expose to different kind of subject and hence develop our interest . it is really regrettable if we make a wrong decision is choosing it . secondly , broad education can nurture student to be an all-rounder . all company demand all-rounder instead of student with specific knowledge . of course , everyone should have his/her strength and weakness . however , broad education allows student to develop more comprehensively . for example , the art student may be weak in communication skill or the science student may be too rational . but if all student are put together and study more subject , a student 's personality may have influence on the others besides gaining other subject ' knowledge . last but not least , it prevents some subject to be vanished or even disappeared . sometimes , student choose subject that have good future career such a business . few people would choose subject just based on interest . therefore , this leaf some subject like chinese history to become vanished . but chinese history actually is worth studying and important for young people to familar . at this point , if we set broad knowledge is a must , the problem wo n't happen . in conclusion , studying in many subject is better than specialize in one a it allows student to develop more interest , to become all-rounded that can benefit their future career and also prevent some subject from vanishing .
