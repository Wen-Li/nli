in my opinion i am very much agree with that it is more important to understand idea and concept beacuse student are like bud they will blossom in future with some quality . if they stuck with fact they can never get what they want from idea and concept . the student follow fact will grow but le than the student who always learn from idea and concept . beacuse when we make something we are like god we create what ever we wnat our mind will be crative so with new idea and research we can get many new thing or invent something new . but who stuck with the fact never get chance to explore theirselves with something new or creative . for an example invention of vaccine wa not a fact it wa idea . how the mocroorganism will work against disease . so reseacher develoed a vaccine for untreatable or dreadful disease like measles , typhoid , dyptherria and many more . and now the research taking place is using the concept and idea . another example is newton 's law . . it wa a concept what are the reason that apple faal down not up , so he used some idea , research on them and got a result that the thing fall down because of gravity and his law is famous a newton 's law of gravity . like the invention of first steam engine observor wa watching that steam ha suffiecient power to remove the lid or it is easily pushing the lid . so he get an idea why not invent the thing which run with the steam and he invented train . we all know that we all have expression like our parent because of genetic gene . but daniel and waurik were the first who thought the idea that hat are reason that we look liked our parent and then they invented dna helical model . so the new thing only generated with the new idea and concept like tial and erroe basis . we can use the fact but upto which extent it will helpful we do n't know . we come to know only when we do something . may be one of the student get some idea so he/she can invent the medicene for the gray hair mean hair will never gray it will reamin black or invent some medicine to become always young . this all base on idea and concept . graham bell invented the phone just he wa sitted in yard and idea generated is there is any way to talk to distance people . he thorough worked on it and invented a telephone . so i 'll suggest that generate idea and make concept and try . definately you will get something new and interesting . research is the great field for the idea and concept . where we can use the thing to make our idea noticable . all the major invention are the result of idea and concept and thats why we are still progressing to achieve something new . may be idea and concept are not core but it is in our hand to make these into core like fact so that others can follow our idea . to make progressive make idea and work on them . so student have to make their mind active , alert , creative and imaginative . so thay can learn more about the world , science ang geography . and invent somehing new for future and for world .
