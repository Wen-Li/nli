i disagree , because population are increasing day by day in the world . it is connected with car also . car company pruducting a new car every year . when i analyse the traffic every car ha one people transporting . every family ha two car minimum . because car price also decreasing and people earns money moch more before . government must solve this problem but nobody dont do anything . government investigate to underground and bus system . for example istanbul is a huge city . there are 15 million people live in istanbul . also there are 5 million car in our city . but istanbul ha not a underground metro network . also bus is very old to transportation . also taxi is not chipher . because of all of this point people choose to buy a car and use it daily wok . i think this is a general problem all of the world . the another point that is old car in the traffic . there are lot of old car in the traffic that is more than 20 year old . these car try to work successfully and try to transport people . in this case it is need to establish new law for traffic on the county . for using a car , it must be prohibit for more than 20 year old car i think . also the scientist reserch that for trying to work a car with electricity ennergy or walther . if it will be possible , i think car population also grow up . in the world oil price very high right now . but electricity or wather is so free /
