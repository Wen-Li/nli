as my bos used to say me at the beginning of my career : < do not be afraid about the sperimentation of new thing , do more than others do : no one ha never been punished for doing more > . according to this phrase , i think that people who try to do new think normally have more chance to be successful during their own life than someone who silmpy do his/her usual job . what make a man successful is the plus-value that he can give to the society . a lot of men could do thing well , but only men who do thing better than others could reach an higer level in social life . taking risk is part of a successful person . someone who do not try to take risk could be seen a a coward by the society . for exemple , in cartoon , a superhero is someone who normally take risk to do something more dangerous than others normal people do . in the same way , this attitude , could be postponed in different realistic situation . in a business environement , for instance , a successful manager is in general someone who is able to `` manage '' riskfull situation ( like , for example , take strategic deciosion that could hugely impact company 's business ) . i think that taking a `` safe '' risk is something that everyone should do in order to make people more confident and more appreciated by society . this will certainly create more successful people .
