in my opinion succesfull people ca n't be mesured by the quantity of risk they take , because a man that doe not take any risk and focus on doing what he know he doe very well , can be a succesful a a man that focus only in taking risk and trying to experiment with new thing everyday . but using my personal knowledge i can say that each risk you take is an oportunity to win , while each risk you avoid is an oportunity that go away from you hadns . as an example i can say about a friend that owned a pizza store , he wa always trying new way of mixing ingredient to produce the best pizza his customer could have ever eaten . thanks to his perseverance , this friend invented the best pizza in my city , and after that , with the money he made with the pizza he invented , he tried to invent a snack everybody would buy , and now he is known a luigi , the father of the hawaian pizza and the french fry which ha helped him to open his own pizza company . another good example is my father 's life . he , a far a i know , wa the owner of a great company that used to produce the most comfortable tennis shoe arond the world . untill the day he went bankrupt . his company broke up because , one day my father had to take a very important desicion , unfortunately he chose the easy road and he did n't want to risk a lot . the desicion he had to take wa n't dificult at all , but because he wa a person that hate getting out of the road he know , and dislike getting into unknown road , he took the wrong desicion and it led him to the bankropt . after that he ha changed his behavior a lot . so , a a conclusion i can say that taking risk is the best way to live this life .
