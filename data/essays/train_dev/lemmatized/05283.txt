i agree that it is more important for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact because in the modern technological life you need to know the concept which are essential to complete a research , project or anything to be solved . the concept are the main fudamental point which would explain the whole process in a mehcanical way . ideas are the one which should be understand before going to begin the work or process . for example a i am being a computer student , to write a program in any program language i should have an idea about the concept of the programming language before start writing the program . i need not know the fact . because facts are result if we doe one work . if student understands idea and conecpts then only the student could step forward and get success in that process . in this computer modern life student will not give much preference to learn fact , which rather take up time . so every student want to first understand the concept and idea then be involved into the project . in the older day student are supposed to learn the fact and get grip on the subject before going to start the process . but after computer ha been introduced , the whole process ha been changed , because student are exposed to use the internet , which rather made student to understand the concept and swept away the process of learning fact . internet give freedom to student which pricely help directly to get the concept of subject with out much effort to learn fact . for example if a student want to do a project using any computer language , now a day student would rather use the internet such a google , with which he could get all the information in world for that project , automatically he finish the project by understanding the concept and idea with out learnin te fatcs . i agree this statement because student should grab the opportuinity of technology a we have inthis 21 century .
