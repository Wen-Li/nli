i agree with the statement . young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their community . in my opinion , there are several reason about this . the first reason that young people nowadays do n't give the time to helping their community . i think that young people do n't try to communicate with people who life in near them . young people tend to stay in their house or they are go out from house . but it is not only young people . nowadays people do n't often join the community . and people do n't communicate with each other agglessive . a second reason that young people do n't give the time to helping their community . they use their time for themself not for their community . they use the time for themself than they use for their community . because it is age that people priority identity now . lastly , why the young people do not give enough time to helping their community . there are no advantage if young people give time to helping their community . so they do n't feel requirement to give time to helping their community . nowadays young people tend to avoid communicate with people near them . people will be more isolated from community . that is why , young people nowadays do not give enogh time to helping their community .
