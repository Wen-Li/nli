i strongly agree with the statement , `` most advsetisements make product seem much better than thery really are '' for two reason : the purpose of advertisement to sell product and the great influence of mass medium . in order to understand this trend , it is essential to deal with the producer and receiver of the message and the channel which conveys the message from the producer to the receiver . first of all , it is important to take a close look at the producer and receiver of the message . for the advertiser , the main purpose of the advertisement is to sell product . in order to appeal to potential customer , it seems essential for them to make product look better than actually they are . in modern society , beauty is the principal quality that consumer pursue . consumers buy product to represent their identity . they buy fancy car and clothes because the product represents their value . in order to appeal the consumer ' desire , advertiser often exaggerate the quality of product . also , in order to understand the trend , the external social force should be considered . recent year have witness that mass medium have a great influence on consumer behavior . our societes become more and more commercial . mass medium reinforce this trend . for mass medium , advertisement are the main sourse in which they make a profit . as an organization which try to make a greater profit , mass medium solicit advertiser and allure them providing fancier technology than before . mass medium use special equipment that were not available in the past . in conclusion , considering the the desire of advertiser and consumer and the irresistible influence of mass medium nowadays . i strongly believe that most advertisement make product look much better .
