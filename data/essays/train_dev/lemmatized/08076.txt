recently , the product of advertisement have developed , so most advertiser advertise product much better than actual . is it really good for customer ? i disagree with the statement for these reason . first of all , when customer try to buy something , the advertisement are also one of the point that they chose which to buy . if the advertisement is too much better than actual product , customer will disappoint . second , it take much money to advertise . in order to attract a lot of customer , producer make advertisement wonderful , so when this situation happen , the cost of advertisement becomes much more expensive . if producer spend money to advertise more than to make product , they can not made real good thing . in addition , product may become poor . also , it is bad not only customer but also producer to make poor product . it mean that customer do n't want to buy poor thing although the advertisement is really nice , so product ca n't be bought . in conclusion , it is important to attract customer by advertisement , but it is not good to spend too much money to advertise . so , i think that the producer should make product better and spend money to improve product and invent new thing rather than great advertisement . therefore , i do n't prefer to make product seem much better than they really are by advertisement .
