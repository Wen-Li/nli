whethere most advertisement make product seem much better than they really are is a good question . the advertisement is made to increase the selling of the product . so , majour are the quality of the product that the people know , majour are the selling . then it can be that some advertising make poduct seem much better . an example are the figure of food product , in the image on the box they seem very beautifull and also very good to eat . but when you open the box and see the product inside , you understand that the pruduct on the box is very different . when i wa child and i saw the advertisement of a play i would had this play because in the advertisement it moved much , spok a lot and it had beautifull color . but when i took the play it wa static , spok only four or five word and it had bad color . in this case the advertising is used to increase the selling unsing the little child that when they see something that look like beautifull they want that . there are also some rule that say that the advertisement must respect the quality of the product , but these rule are not always used . to tell the truth there are also some advertisemets that make seem the product a they realy are . but these are not much because if you show in an advertisement a product that is not beautifull the people prefer to buy another product that in the advertisement seem more beautifull than the other , maybe also if it cost much .
