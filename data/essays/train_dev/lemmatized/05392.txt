i will agree with this statement that say `` in twenty year there will be fewer car in use than ther are today '' now a day car are came in to demand to improve the quality of the life and save the time and maintain the dignity every one are using the car . but after some time these are replaced by the other mean of trasportation . modern man invented airoplans with his great intensive knowledge . i think these airoplans replace the use of the car in the future generation . because day by day technology also improving to meet the greatest adanced thing in the modern life . with the help of the technology man invented differnt thing like computer and satillites and airoplan to save the time . a well a improve the standerds of living . time saving might help him work on the other thing like to invent the different advanced thing . i think after twenty year ther going to be a marked change in community like in food habit and transportation . in the olden day they are only bus , train . but now car are replaced these thing . i belive after twenty year marked change in the economy system of the whole community like in they can spend more money in tavelling and try to improve the technology more and more . now a day globle warming effect is really showing the affect on the environment . increase in corbandioxide in the air cause the deplication of the ozone layer . corbendioxide is basically comming from the using of automobile realising . they are the aggrements are made based on the use of automobile . they said automobils are using of the automobile are reduce to improve the environment condition .
