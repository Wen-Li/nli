i do agree to the fact that successful people do try new thing and take risk than only doing what they already know . i do believe so because of the fact that option in life shouldnt be ruled down to only a few . people should try exploring new avenue and try out new thing so a to master the very aspect called `` life '' . evolution , adaptation focus is the name of the game . when a person who is ambitious and an optimist try doing something innovative he usually strike or achieves a place where in not many people have achieved in life . today we thank people like thomas addison and james watt for their invention . such thing never came to their mind in second or two . it took them load of restless work and patience and teh ability to cope with failure again and again to give u what we relish or enjoy in today world a telephone or a steam engine . a man horizon of thinkin should be very wide open . he should be well versed with his idea and should carry the potential for acheivin what he thought of doin . he should have a vision in short . a strong vision is half victory . people like bill gates never hesitated to put their vision on paper and his hard work , dedication , aim ha given u a beautiful product called microsoft which is used by every one . his job never ended after he gave u `` window '' there were many other thing that microsft had to give u and is still giving till date . u should try to be innovative in life trying to explore what all nature ha to give u . risks are usually involved but i believe in the saying `` no pain no gain '' everything come at a price and u should be willing to pay a price . for example in india company like reliance which practically run india where just a man 's vision . ambani never ended his thirst for achieving till the time he passed away . they are till date trying to lay their hand on what all they can from clothes to elctricity to fuel to power the list is endless . according to me everybody life in this world but if u want to create a mark or achieve something or have that satisfaction within , that '' i am different '' and want to be remembered u need to try out all what u can rather than just sticking on to one thing and try to make something out of it. '' winner are not quitter '' . life ha kept a lot hidden there just need to be a thirst for exploring new avenue and tryin out different thing which can be only achieved by a good vision , aim and a very optimistic attitude . ( go getter ) attitude
