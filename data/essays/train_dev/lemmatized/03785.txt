i disagree with the statement that traveling in a group and with a tour guide is necessarly the best way to travel . i aconsent that there are benefit of traveling with a group , but i view these benefit a being very dependent on the type of person you are , the destination of your travel , a well a the actual purpose of your travel . if - for example - your travel objective is to experience the peace and tranquility of the german black forest , it is very unlikely that you would appreciate the constant company of your travel group member . if on the other hand , you are seeking to party at a ski resort , having a group with which to participate in the numerous resort activity may make your trip especially memorable . likewise the benefit of a tour guide need to be viewed in context of the trip you are taking . tour guide might help you to learn more about the historic and cultural fact of your destination , but they might make you complacent in exploring for yourself and interacting with local . personally i prefer traveling with fewer people rather than with a large group . also i prefer that these people comprise a small group of select friend , whom i know well and with whom i will generally share the same travel objective . i also prefer traveling without a tour guide and explore the place i am visiting without the confinement of a pre-planned tour , a i tend to value the opportunity for spontanaety , that vacation present . ( after all , is n't part of the joy of vacation being free to do a one feel ? ) . obviously this preference of mine doe not exclude the option of hiring a tour guide for select part of a trip . for example on a recent trip to india i did apreciated the little gem of information provided by the tour-guide a he led me around the taj mahal . nonetheless , i wa very glad not to have a tour guide constantly talking to me while i wa exploring the beautiful back-waters of india 's kerela . hence i think the expressed statement can be true for certain type of people , at certain time and in certain situation . as an absolute statement , however , i would have to disagree .
