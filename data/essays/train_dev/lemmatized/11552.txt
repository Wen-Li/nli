sadly , i do not think that in the future there will be le car in use than nowadays . although , i would really appreciate that , i really doubt it , because the possibility that people all start using the train or even that our government will prohibite car in the city , is quite small . still , i think it would be a huge achievement to reduce traffic on our street . the horriblest thing in city are the overcrowded street , the noise of the traffic and the pollution car cause . still , i am sure car will not get out of favour , because people are obsessed with them . i know several people , who buy very expensive car , they can not even afford to buy . just because it is an huge status symbol and everzone love to brag about it . people may argue , that oil prize will increase so much , that the ordinary man can not afford to keep a car , but i think that the industry already ha good alternative . natural oil , a gas or solar driven car are alreadz developped and fully functioning . but these car are still so expensieve or weird looking that people do not want to buy them . in conclusion , there is no reason why there should be fewer car in use than there are today . furthermore , several third and second world country ( like china and india ) are developing to industrial state and therefore , they will even need more car . in an utopian world there would not be any car and all people would have access to train , which would provide the transportation .
