these day , many people are willing to help their community through many way such a donating clothing or money , however , some people think that young people appears to be putting little time to help , but i disagree with this statement because of two reason . initially , since most young people are more active than the older people , i belive that they have better chance to help thier community . for instance , i saw many young people who are doing voluntary work in school . they sometimes teach poor people who can not afford to go to college , and also , they teach poor kid , too . also , many young people engage in demonstration to fight against some unappropriate regulation . from my experience , some of the young teacher tried to change the company that wa supplying for my school 's meal because the quality of the food wa not good enough for student . because of their effort , my school could change the company and had better quality of food for the meal . in addition , i think that the campaign are mostly launched by young people . for instance , in the church , there are many college student who are helping poor kid around the country by donating cloth . also they convince other people to donate by advertising their campaign . sometimes they make poster , or they cook cooky by theirselves to advertise it . in the conclusion , i think many young peope are giving enough time to help their community by several way such a demonstrating to fingt against some unappropriate rule , voluntary work , and donating for poor people . therefore , i disagree with the point that young people nowadays do not give enough time to help their community .
