nowaday , the compition between the company become more and more seriose . every company want to find the best way to reach the customer . one of the best way to reach them is the advertisement . in my openion , even though the advertisment is important to sell the product and to let the consumer know about it , i believe that most advertisement make product seem much better than they really are . if we take loosing wieght a an example . every day you will see diffrenet advertisement about the diet food or about kind of exercise or even opening new gym . you can see this advertisement almost everywhere . in the street , tv , and movie . .. ets . however , if this product like they say it is the fastest and the easiest way to loss wieght so why there are more and more product about loosing wieght ? and why the fat people are increasing everyday ? some of this advertisments are not honest . they present a person a an example in the advertisement about how is the product is useful . however , in the real life there is no related between the product and this person , and he is just an actor . for example , my friend ha a soft skin since she wa child ; however , many cream company tried to convinced her to show in thier advertisment and say her soft skin come from this product . in addition , the advertisment us a famouse person and how he us the product and again in the real life meybe you will find that thefamouse person did not try the product before . in short , the company in order to sell thier product or serf , they have tried whatever they can to sell this product . therefore , i really think many advertisment do not reflect the reality , and there is a difference between the advertisement and the reality .
