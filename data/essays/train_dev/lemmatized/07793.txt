i definitely think that it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subject , rather then specialising in one specific subject . firstly , in my opi it is necessary to have a broad view on a variety of subject in order to understand our increasingly complex world . secondly , innovation , whether in the field of science , business or politics , is often lead by people who have a cross-funtional view . to begin with , the primary purpose of education is to prepare student to face the world with the right skill and knowledge . the world we live in , it turn out , is increasingly complex . in order to succeed in this world , it is necessary to have a broad understanding of several subject . for example , an engineer can not rely only on it engineering skill but should also communicate on what he is doing , a most of the great technical achievement of our time rely on a team rather then a single person . then , a lot of innovation result from applying a principle or idea taken from one field and applying it to another , which can only be achieved by people who have a broad understanding of several field . the post-it is a good illustration . it ha become a popular and useful item in office but it actually result from the invention of a glue that did not fix well enough to be used in a traditional way ! another striking example is the bridge that wa created between computer science and biology in the invention of neuronal programming . neuronal programming simulates the mechanism of the nervous cell of the brain , enabling the programme to learn . as a conclusion , i think that student benefit from having a broad knowledge of several subject , because it help them to tackle with the challenge of our modern world , whether a leader or a innovator . of course , this should not prevent them from acquiring more extensive knowledge in a specific field .
