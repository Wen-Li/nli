in nowadays , people buy the products by only looking the advertisements . firstly , in those days people mostly buy teh products by the internet . internet is useful for everyhting , but you can only see the picture of product on the internet . you can not touch or you can not look all the purpose of the product . thus , you just see the advertisement so you can buy it if you like the advertisement . on the other hand , i would like to give an example . ikea is very famous . because you can find everything in it and also it is very cheap . and i like the advertisement of ikea . but when i buy a table from ikea , i was shocked . because it is so bad . i could only use that table one month . i think when people want to buy something , they should n't only look the advertisement , they shouk investigate the product too if it is good or not .
