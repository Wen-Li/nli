i desagree with the idea that it is more important for student to understand idera and concept than it is for them to learn fact . factors make student to face on the reality , help student to understand idea and concept better , and make student more attention about the field . one of reason i desagree with this idea is because student should know the reality . if student just study about idea and concept , they can never lean what is going on in the real world . for example , in business class , student will learn about stock . if student do not do a similation game of marketing stock , they will never know how it is diffecult to guess what is going to happen next one second . facts help student to learn the real world by themselves . in addition , if student learn many fact , it is going to help student to understand idea and concept more . for instance , in business class again , through a similation game of marketing stock , student understand what stock are about , why company have stock , and so on better . it is more effective than just learning idea and concept . finally , learing through fact can make student to be interested in that field . in fact , a similation game of marketing stock made me to be interested in business world . i had never been interested in business at all untill i did a similation game . i knew the fact of business world and it caught my mind somehow . besides , i am majoring in business in college now . there are more studets who had the same experience . in conclusion , it is better to learn more about fact than idea and concept . however , it is wrong that learning only fact are the best way to learn something . it is also important to understnd idea and concept . it is just learning fact is more important than understanding idea and concept .
