people have different opinion on whether it is more important for student to understand idea or to learn fact . i strongly believe that it is more important for student to understand problem than it is for them to learn fact . first , student should learn accuratly about idea . second , deep problem are required understand to solve idea . let me explain in detail . to begin with , many student are expected to understand concept from their teacher or schoool . teachers should have more responsible to teach for their child . let me show an example . if i have a hard time to study difficult math part , it is nessesary to solve time . but if i do not understand principle of that problem , i can not solve . that 's because why i think more to understand idea than to learn fact . next , we should know cause and result solving problem
