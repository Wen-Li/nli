the issue of that it is true young people enjoy life more than older people do is controversial because on the one hand young people generally are more likely to be healthy and have energy , and on the other hand older people in certain condition have more time and money to dedicate to their hobby and their relative . as far a i am concerned , i believe that older people enjoy life more than young people do , and i will demonstrate why . during the last decade , in modern country , life expectancy ha increased and generally reach 75-80 year . as a consequence , whether we do not consider very olde people who are more than 75 year old , people benefit from 15-20 year after the retire to enjoy life . in this lap of time , which is more or le long depending on the country and many others criterion a the social and professional background , old people have the opportunity to do whatever they want to because they have the mean . indeed , when you are young , even if you feel healthy and handsome , you generally do not have have or earn money to totally enjoy life , excepting very rare and dramatic case . older people do , therefore , they well and truly can do what they want to in our modern and expensive society , where every litte thing ha a price . furthermore , older people , when retired , have more time , more friend , their own family . in addition to this , they have more experience and thus better appreciate what they do . nevertheless , i am actually not trying to demonstrate that older people and forcefully and merely more happy . to enjoy one 's life is very close to experiment happiness but is not sinonymous with . to illustrate we can say that everybody doe not need to enjoy his life to be happy . as a consequence , i would say that i think older people have more opportunity to be happy because they benefit form both time and money , but conversely it doe not mean young people are unhappy . they just have more thing to do , going to work , studying , starting their carreer , and related to this a le confortable situtation . to conclude i would say that in developed country old people generally have more opportunity to emjoy they life . nonetheless it doe not mean that youger people are not happy .
