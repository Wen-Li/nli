people start leaning , observing and thinking at the early age . in school , they express their opinion and exchange their idea . some might have different opinion from others , while others tend to think in a same way . it is important to pay attention to other 's opinion and understand them . you do not need to accept it , but to approach other 's idea also can help you have variety of idea . i beleive that it is more important for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact . first of all , leaning other 's idea and concept prevents from becoming a self-centered person . in fact , how you interact with your classmate and teacher in school ha a huge impact on the way of thinking . if you are more likely to wonder the process of the result , you would be able to think a lot more than others who just want to know fact . knowing fact is also sufficient , but the point is that just learning fact can develop your knowledge and earn good score on exam , but you would not gain the ability to think more deeply . as a result , when you became an adult and worked , you would not be able to adapt to a society you belong to . it is valuable to know how to exhange the idea when you are a stude secondly , creation is more important that knowing fact . by understanding idea and concept would help you find new way , and create new thing . if you know only one way to think about thing , you would not innovate anyhitng . in conclusion , with these two view , i strongly agree with the idea that it is more important for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact .
