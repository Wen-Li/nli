first of all , fact are only short information given to someone . they describe something a easy a possible . this make clear that fact are easier to learn and to remember for a short time . in comparison , idea and concept come along with a description of a new invention or a solution for a problem . reading a book about the idea or trying to extract important information from le important statement are quite common . you have to understand the whole concept and try to look under the surface of the topic . students who are good at learning fact might also do very well in school . for them it is only learning by heart and reproducing it in a oral or writing exam . sooner or later they will have forgotten those meaningless number or short statement . for example describing the growth of a city lying in the middle of nowhere or how many offspring a fieldmouse produce ; quite nice to know but meaningless . a bigger challenge is to understand a concept or an idea . what is the theory behind it . on what other idea or concept is it based on ? for example is it much more difficult to learn the progress of an election . how doe the house of parliament interact with the house of lords ? how will my vote be counted and which party will gain how many seat ? all in all , i think , you need to have a good synthesis of both side . for a student who want to achieve something in is life it is essentially to try to gain a much experience a possible and to produce your own idea underlining them with fact . on the one hand you need knowledge of how concept work and of how idea can be realised . on the other hand you need to support those idea with fact you have learned and still can remember throughout your life and career .
