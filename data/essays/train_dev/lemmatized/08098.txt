i disagree the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide for several reason . in my opinion and personal experience , there are many disadvantage of traveling in a gruop such a time limitation , bad service atitudes and worng shopping location . the first important reason why i disagree this idea because time limitaion . there are many location in one day and never have enough time to spend . therefore , we do n't enjoy any location and also wast our time at some location are not necessary to stop by . furthermore , since the group trip ha so many location need to go , most time of the trip spend on the bus in stead of walking around and talking with local reisdents . also , a tour guide 's service atitudes affect the whole trip . i used to travel with a tour guide who is not thinking careful and rude sometimes . if any vistor in a group with a bad tour guide , this trip wo n't be fun . it 's sad that most trip we ca n't choose tour guide . furthermore , everytime we travel in a group led by a tour guide who always led u to a unreasonable department store or others shop where shop owner and tour guide can share the grant . this is the most reason i will not travel in a group . it happends a lot in south asia and china . whenever i want to travel somwhere , i will ask for people 's opinion and research any good location . it is the best way to travel . i will not recomand to anyone who want to trave in a group in south asia and china .
