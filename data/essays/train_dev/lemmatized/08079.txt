what do people usually use to guide them when they are traveling ? i remember two year ago , my friend and i went to new orleans , louisiana for a trip . before we left , we went online to find all the attraction in the area . however , we got lost so many time because we did not know the area ; nor did we have a tour guide . therefore , i agree with the fact that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide because having a tour guide will decrease the chance of getting lost , and it will be le likely to get involved in an accident . first of all , having a tour guide when traving will decrease the chance of getting lost . a lot of people , when they go to a certain area for the very first time , inspite of having a map , have the tendency to get lost . one reason for that is because sometimes the map that they got online are not updated . hence , they get lost on the road , which can cause them to be angry . i remember while my friend and i were on our way to a mall , despite the fact that we followed all the direction in the map , we still got lost . but , we had a tour guide , perhaps , we would not have lost . besides having le chance of getting lost when traveling with a tour guide , the possibility of getting an accident is also low . in florida , it is said that lot of people die when they go visit a place due to car accident . the reason why is by looking at the map while they are driving . but if they had a tour guide who know the area very well , they would be le likey to crash . thus , a tour guide would be very helpul when traveling . in conclusion , i am strongly in favor of the idea of having a guide when traveling . for , this will minimize the chance of getting lost and getting an accident .
