i do not agree with this statement . although i consider it to be very important to have a solid knowledge of academic subject in general , which mean a certain amount of basic knowledge of different topic , i think that one should have a specific subject in which one is specialized and on which one should set one main focus . long ago , in the time of goethe and schiller or newton and descartes , it ha been possible to acquire an amount of knowledge which offered the possibilty to take part in all important discussion about all scientific topic and even about art , literature and music . at that time it wa possible to be an expert in different area of science and culture and goethe for example even considered himself an expert in all science . but those time have passed . since scientist ha made enormous and unparalleled discovery and invention throughout the last century the amount of knowledge which is accessible today is overwhelming . according to a study by the beginning of the 20th century this amount wa doubling every seven year . today it is multiplied by seven every two year . hence no human beeing is able to deal with all of it and consequently it is necessary to have scientist go straight into one specific direction to create the possibilty to acquire even more knowledge . in mathematics for example there are topic about which only a dozen people in the world can exchange their idea because nobody else would even understand the problem those person are dealing with . so in order to make new invention and discovery a well a to enrich mankind 's amount of knowledge it is undoubtably necessary to have expert who are specialized in specific subject and who are constantly - or a mentioned before even exponentially - breaking scientific boundary . so in the end many an invention would not have been made without the necessary expert .
