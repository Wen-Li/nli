i do agree with the statement `` successful people try new thing and take risk rather than only doing what they already know how t6o do well '' . to agree , there many reason to say . for example , a scientist allways think better to invent something else that he observes . if he think to do that he know well he wo n't be able to discover new thing . he always concentrate on new thing that may be a task of risk . in that way he may fail for the first time but later he may get sucessin that aspect . the other way is that many great people get sucess aftter taking risk in particular aspect . if we go on doing what we know well , we may get sucess in that particular aspect but we ca n't see other part of life . we are good at one aspect but poor at other aspect . a sucess after a hard work & included with risk give more happyness than that we are expert in that . i doe n't mean that do only risk , but just try to do such type of thing sometimes . to do a work one should have the basic knowledge of it . then only he can move on . so , i finally conclude that people who try to do new thing & think in a different way may get more sucessin their career . not only scientist , many other people are getting popular by having this type of nature . now a day student are discoverring many thing by their own by thinking in a different way . so , their teacher should guide them in this aspect . this help their future
