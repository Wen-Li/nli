i strongly agree with the statement that it is more important for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact . while learning fact ha it own place in education , these limit the student to idea and opinion of other people rather than thinking on their own . where a learning fact give the student mere information on thing and is very specific information on any one subject , understanding a concept or an idea , i.e understanding the ` why ' behind thing or the logical sequence and reason for a paticular event taking place , give the student the abbility to reason out thing for himself when faced with a similar problem . this approach of learning to think logically which is aquired by understanding idea and concept applies a much to practical life a it doe to academic . a person with a strong sense of reasoning will be much better equipped to face challenge and find a solution to a problem than a person brought up memorising fact . also , after the student life when the person ha to start a career , and face and solve new problem that he ha never encountered in his life , the conceptual and understanding approach will help him find his way through a difficult situation . moreover , while fact may be applied to a specific area of study , conceptual skill and understanding ability encourage analytical thinking and sharpen analzsing ability which have application in all area of life , and aid in practical decision making . learning fact may improve the memorising skill of a student and improve his general knowledge about thing , but it might prove to be boring and can lead to a child disliking education alltogether . on the other hand , making student understand idea and concept is the key to originality of idea and innovative thinking in their future . understanding concept will lead to the brain experimenting on it own , toying with varoius concept and idea , and will light the fire of inspiration and ignite curiousity , which is the foundation for enabling a student to think towards invention and new technique . in conclusion , where a the method of simply learning fact treat the brain like an empty container to be filled , the method of making them understand idea and concept treat the brain a alive , giving it tool for construction and improvement , to make a new and better world in the future .
