i would say that i agree with this statement , because it is true that in our society markentig ha become more important and significant than the product self , but i am also a sort of victim of this kind of marketing business . i am studing marketing because i am attending a master in international managment and i can support that the buyer prefer rely on product that they know because they have seen them on the television rather than trust in produts that are well made but that are not sponsorized enough . i can say that i am also fashinated from this kind of product , and sometimes , when i buy a new product , i recognize at home that i have bought that just because i have seen it on the television or on the newspaper . it is a sort of subconscional imput that i can not take under controll . moreover i have to confess that i care the packaging of the product more than the quality , and i am keen on buying product that are colorfull or funny in their shape more than those that have a better quality . i have studied that it is tested that this kind of behaviour is quite common especially between young woman because they are more significantly attracted by advertisment more than men . for example , my grandmother doe not like going to do shopping with me bacause she doe not understand my way to buy unusefull thing , she is more responsable , and she used to spend her money just buying what she really need , because she ha lived in a poor period during the war and she doe not accept to waste money . according to this explanation i can conclude that i can not agree with the statement even if it is true .
