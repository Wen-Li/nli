learning fact and understanding idea and concept are the different way of learning and they also need different kind of attention . i am a university student and i prefer learning fact rather than understanding the idea and concept . i said they have different kind of attention and first i want to explain this . when you try to understand idea and concept you generally spend more time . you should cover whole issue to understand it . most professor try to use this method and while coming the important point of issue they are talking a lot . in my opinion , they are giving unnecesery knowledge . however , if professor just give the important part of the subject than student may understand better and it would't take much time than talking about unnecessary thing . the second important thing that we should talk about is that the human brain can also concentrate 25-30 minute at all . that 's why on the 35th minute of lecture the student start to daydream while the professor just coming the most important part of subject . if teacher want to teach better , they should stop talking and trying to cover the whole idea . i insist on just giving the important part of issue and then start to cover the subject while solving problem or debating for example . this is more succesfull way to teach and more convenient for student , too . to sum up , i totally disagree the way of undertanding idea and concept . that is a le of time and time is more important that student . teachers should use time conveniently and just give the student the important part not the whole of the subject .
