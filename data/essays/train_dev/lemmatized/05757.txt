i agree on the statment that it is more important for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact . i support this statment by giving reason and example in the following paragraph . firstly , student should understand idea and concept because it make them to understand clearly and accurately . understanding idea and concept of a particular topic make their work fast and perfectly . for example suppose a student want give a seminar on the topic spacecraft he or she must know the concept of the seminar clearly and throughly . so that he or she can generate more way of elaborating the topic which can be helpfull during the seminar . secondly , learning the concept make a person more perfect in the topic which he is about to work . so that he can generate new way and method . for example during the preparation of an experiment the scientist should know the concept of the experiment so the he can work well and aviod risk and harmfull effect . buy understanding the concept and idea clearly and correctly one devolop more knoweldge and data regarding the topic rather than learning fact . thirdly , fact are the material which have been devoloped already which can not be developed further . but understanding an idea and concept we can futher discover and invent new idea from the idea we have . for example using the water and it property scientist have developed the steamengine . famous scientist who had devoloped the concept of numbersystem wa clearly understood by aryabatta ha discovered the algebra using the numbersystem . student should understand main idea of the english reading passage so that they can answer the question in the questionpaper . fact may not develop and increase the student knowledge . so one should understand concept and idea of the material and topic what they learn in the class . quiz question can be answered correctly by the student if they understand the given topic for the quiz to be conducted . lastly , i conclude that it is more important for the student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact .
