traveling is one of the thing in life that almost everybody enjoys . everyone , however , ha his own opinion about whether nor people should be led by a tour guide during the trip . from my point of view , i think that traveling without guide will make u at ease and feel dependant . traveling wihout guide will help u to get more about the culture and get u to know the real people . i am not saying that having a guide is not good . it just will not make u know everything about the place you are visiting . tour guide always have a map showing place where tourist have got to visit . in other word tour guide tend to show people only the beautiful place and cultural one . for that reason people who visit place by themselves tend to have more knoweldge and information than those who have been led by a guide . those that go by themself , doe n't have to visit certain place but the whole entire place so they will get to see many thing than the one that have guide . in addtion people that travel by themself visit and see the whole place freely . the beautiful and the ugly one . moreoever , when you travel alone , you will have to ask people to show direction so you will get an idea on how people think and interact with foreigner and even you can ask them question about the culture and the custom that they have . whereas , traveling with a guide you would n't be able to interact with the native speaker and you always be dependant on the group . traveling alone is cheaper than traveling in group . because traveling in group you will have to pay a fee to the company that will take care of you whereas , traveling by yourself you will just need your ticket . in conclusion , i can say that traveling alone tend to be more fun and will help u to know a lot about the culture and will make u free to visit interesting plaves wihout rush or pression .
