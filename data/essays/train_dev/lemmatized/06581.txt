to my opinion young people appreciate life more than older people . the reason for this is towfold . first , young people are le aware of death than the older poeple . usually young people are in good wealth . they do not think about their own death on a every day basis , exept in specific case . there is no doubt that older people are more aware of their own death than youger people . most of them have already been confronted to death . they may have loose close relative : the husband or the wife for instance . not thinking about death too much is a way to enjoy life . as youg people fear le to die they can accomplish more thing . most of the young people do not fear to take risqs . the youth is the feeling that life is only at the beginning . second , being young envolves that the person is able to have child and to build up a family . having child is no doubt one of the most important joy of life . nowadays a woman is able to have child until she is 40 year old . in today 's society being 40 year old is regarded a mid age but still young in a way . a child is like a sunshine in someone 's life . seing your child growing is such a source of happyness . only young people can enjoy this great experience . one may argue that being a grand parent is olso a wonderful experience but this experience is undoubtly different from the previous one . it is commun place to hear old people talking about their past life with a nostalgic tone . after a certain age people tend to live in memory .
