there is a saying , `` knowledge is one kind of power . '' i agree with that phrase because you can use knowledge a much a you know . some people think it is more useful to have broad knowledge of many academic subject than to have specific knowledge that you know very well . however , in my opinion , it is better to specialize in one specific subject which you are good at . to begin with , they are so many people who have common knowledge . specifically , the knowledge they have are not unique or special . therefore , in this competitive society people would have to compete with each other for a job that anyone can apply . it is not efficient to have knowledge that everybody know . broad knowlege of many academic subject is not a merit . for example , suppose there is a graduate who majored three subject , history , business , and math . he would know many thing from learning all the content of three major and utilize all the subject he learned . because there is limited time , it is hard to learn all the three subject precisely and deeply . he would only know the basic of each subject , not the advanced thing . in addition , focusing on one subject will make you a an expertise . other subject that you do n't know well can be solved by an expert on that field . it is more effective to take advice from him and ask question that you are not clear with . it is better to focus on the thing a person are good at so the expert can share their knowledge in an advanced way . for example , people from different field , can help each other by combining their own knowledge . it is a win win game . in conclusion , for these unavoidable reason , i firmly believe people should develop and stick on to their own special knowledge .
