in my opinion i think that the old people enjoy their life than the young people . there are many example to show that . some of the young people in this world have taking drug or smoke . these two thing do a lot of damage in the body , if you take a lot of drug or smoke you may die . some of the young people may go to die because they broke up with their grilfriend or boyfriend , i think that it is selfish . there are many thief are young people too . do you think that a person who enjoy or like their life will do these kind of thing ? on the other hand i know many older people who study . i saw a lot of older people study in night school . one day i had asked aold man why he study in the night school ? he replid me that he did n't student good when he wa young and he feel very bad about that . he also said that he want to know a much thing a he can . i know a lot of older people who are leaning to use computer . i think that the old people are much more hard working than the young . many student in my high school is sleeping , chatting , or playing game during the lesson . most of them are waiting the bell ring they do n't know how important about student . the older people had lived in the world for a long thime , they know that knowledge is so important . they enjoy the process of learning . i know many older people know that drug and smoke are not good so they stop it too . i think that the older people enjoy the life than young people . they do a lot of good thing that the young will not do .
