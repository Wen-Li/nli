ethical marketing is very significant subject that should be studied in the some department of university . i see lot of advertisement in television or in newspaper which describe the product a a perfect solution to customer ' problem , but , in reality it is not . i believe that most advertisement make product seem much better than they really are . in all sector , we can see these type of advertisement . automotive , information technology or consumption sector , no matter which sector it is . all use advertisement way to convince consumer to buy the product by emphasizing some point generally but not giving detail about some unknown thing which can influence the final decision to buy it . to illustrate , a mp3 player usually announced in a newspaper a a product which is 1 gb and ha a radio . however , many people do not know that their radio doe not work well everywhere and they even do not know how may song can be saved to that wonderfull device . without thinking some of them buy it while others learn the reality when they go to buy it by asking question to the sale representative . another example is that some advertisement trick are implemented in price . prices are shown by excluding tax and when you are very happy since you have found your favourite product and you go to buy it . usually , it is too late to change your view and thus , you buy it . in this sense , it is certain that most advertisement make product seem much better than they are . however , by giving more importance to marketing lecture and to their content , this unethical situation can be prevented . also , these lesson should be must course instead of being elective .
