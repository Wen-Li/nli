i think that a person must ha a broader knowledg , that mean that you know something about every thing , but also he must to concentrate on a specific subject to know every thing every problem that this subject could have . when somebody start going to school he study different metter , and his theacher theaches you someting about that but not every thing about that matter . i think that this first step of child study ha a lot of importance becouse he can listen and study different lecture and after that he will decide what he will do in his future life . for exemple in the past when i went to school i studied different matter such a philosophy or latin that somebody could say that are futile matter . however i disagree with this statement , in fact , even if now i am studing architecture , this matter help me in my work . if somebody studied phiolosophy he read easier an architectural book because in some book you can find some concept difficult to understand . however it s also important that somebody specializes in one specific metter . in fact if you know every thing about a subject you can foretell the problem or the effect of something . this will became important in the future work where a person will have to decide himself . in particularly she will consider her konowledge and if she ha not the specific knowledge she could only fail ! . in conclusion i can say that the both tipes of knowledge are needed in our society and
