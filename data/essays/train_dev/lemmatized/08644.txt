learning fact is an event that will be discovered a a result of applying idea and concept . in order for a student to learn fact , he should first have to understand the main idea and concept than to know the result of this idea and concept . generally speaking , both understanding idea and concept and learning fact have several advantage . firstly , understanding idea and concept have several advantage . the first advantage of understanding idea and concept is the improvement in the ability of student to think and develop . this mean that when student learn the fact only without thinking of the main idea and the concept of this fact , they will never try to develop and improve these idea or concept . as a result , there will not going to be any innovation from any kind . another advantage of understanding idea and concept is the discovery of new fact . this mean that maybe some fact that result a a consequenses of idea an concept are not the only fact that exist maybe other fact result from the same idea and concept . these are few advantage from understanding idea and concept . secondly , learning fact directly also have several advantage . the main advantage of learning fact is that sometimes fact are not based on any idea or concept . learning fact directly in this case will be more convinient for student . another advantage of learning fact instead of understanding idea and concept is that the student do n't have to worry about where did this come from . and this is the most annoying question in my opinion . i think that these are the few advantage of learning fact directly . to summarize , i think that it is better for student to understand idea and concept in order to improve these fact but in sometimes it is enough for them to learn the fact directly .
