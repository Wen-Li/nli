in my opinion , the best way to travel is in a group and with a tour guide , because when you travel wtih more people is more fun and specially if is leading by a tourist guide , he will know the best place to visit . if you go to visit another country is important to by led by a tourist guide , because usually you will not know anything about this place , or country . he will know the most popular place and they way to get to them . if you go to another country , they people from this country maybe speak another lenguaje , in this case is going to be difficult to find the place were yo will like to go specially if you get lost . there is when the tourist guide will be helpful , he will know the lenguaje of the country making thing easier for the group . another reason is that tourist guide know a large amount of history , in this way when you are visting museum for example the tourist guide will tell you all the important detail of the hystory of the place you are visiting , making the trip more interested . in addition to that the idea of learnig the history of a country , is more fun with a group of people . in conclusion a group travel led by a tour guide it will make any trip more enjoyable , because the tourist guide will make the trip with le worry , and the group of people that you travel with , will make any trip a trip to remember .
