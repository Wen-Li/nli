i agree with the following . there are two reason . first , i think if they have broad knowledge of many academic subject , they would have a wide view point of see many thing than to specialize in one specific subject . second , i think they learn many achademic subject , then they can know what they like or doe n't like . and they know it , they would choose one specific subject . i think it 's the best way .
