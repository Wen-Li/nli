i agree that it is very important for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact for many reason . first , when they are understanding what they told , it is easy for them to keep it in thier mind and to memorised it . secondlly , they can compare and contrast between thing easily . also , they can pas what ever they have learnd to others easily . morover , they can create some new thing with practice with time . when they understand what they learnd it can help them to pas the next year of studdy without serious problem and diffeculties . in summary , it is a major thing to a student to understand idea and concept discussed at class to his/her own bebefit and to get higher grade . and to succses at thier work field .
