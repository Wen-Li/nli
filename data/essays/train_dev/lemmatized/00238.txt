cars in the modern world are one of the most essential object in life . cars have given many benefit to the humanity , by allowing people to travel to place they would want to go in a very short time , or carrying heavy load that can not be carried by human . however , in twenty year , car will not be a used a it is now , and it number will surely decline , due to the decreasing number of population , increasing pollution problem , and development of a new transport . in many advanced country where car are everyday life for people , the population is surely decreasing . for example , in korea , there were baby boom after the war in 1950 . many family consisted of more than five child . the family these day , however , tend to have only one child , maybe two at the maximum . there will surely be a population decrease in twenty year time , automatically resulting in a decrease of car usage a well . cars , although very beneficial to people , did not prove beneficial to the environment . the gas from the exhaust port of the car cause great damage to the environment . furthermore , the accumulation of this gas in the atmosphere is also harmful to people , especially to the elderly and the weak . there ha already been talk of reducing this car gas by reducing the number of car and using public transport instead . in twenty year time , this issue will be even worse , and the usage of car will eventually decrease . lastly , in twenty year time , there will be a new transport that will provide better service to human life than car will . in twenty year time , people could be attending work via a flying machine . or even use a small watercraft . cars will eventually fail to these other superior device , and give way to some other wonderful transport . cars have been in extensive use ever since it wa made about a hundred year ago by ford . but since the technology continues to improve , car will eventually give way to other wonderful invention , just like the horse gave way to car . in twenty year , car will stilll be in use , but surely a not a much a it is now .
