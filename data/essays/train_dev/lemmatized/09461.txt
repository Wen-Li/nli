i do not agree that `` in twenty year there will be fewer car in use than there are today '' , because car are most useful transportation today , and it is not easy to create brand new machine in twenty year , and nowadays there are more eco-cars on the road , and car driver care about the nature recently . the useful point of car are that there are many road to drive and they are more than rollways or subway , and you can go close place to far place individualy . because of the good point , when you go your family trip , the car make you more confortable , and it is easy to make your own original plan . i guess that it is easyier to make car easy to drive and confortable spase than create new machine . some people might say that driving is too rough and make them tired . however technical skill are growing up day by day , it mat be not far futhure that you do not have to drive a car . some peole are considering the effort of car to enviroment . they think it is good to use train and bus rahter than your own car . however , the eco-car can slove the problem . nowadays , the use og eco-cars are rising and considering about our nature . moreover , driving car will be easy and confortable because of recently the high technical skill . from the past , the car are the most useful machine for indivisuals and also pubric . i do not think car use will not down , people still depend on their car . cars will be still the most used transportation in twenty year .
