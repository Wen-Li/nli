at least i disagree with the statment saying : `` it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subject than to specialize in one specific subject '' . to support this idea let u explaine why it is important to specific in one subject . for example , when the student enters to the university he should select one major and he should be specific in that major . when the student graduted from the university he will get a job . as we know that in most of the jobes everyone ha specific assignment in specific field . more than this , when you get the assignment , you should know all detailes which are related to the assignment . if you are not specific in on major or you are taking brod knowledge you will not finish or you may face some difficulty to do the assignment . as a result if that , to choose one major or to be specific in one subject is better that to have broad knowleg to understant whay the student should specifis in one major . another example to illistrate the idea of being specific in one fiels or in one subject is in the researching field . for example , most of scintects are specify in one subject and no one can invent new thing unless he specific in one subject . fore instantce , the scintects newoen wa majoring in physic and he would not find his role `` newten role '' unless we wa in the phisycs fild . another example in thr write brother , as we knoe they are specifc in aerospace engineering and they would not invent haw to flay until they are search and specify in the aerospace field . as a concolusion to be specific in one fiels is very important that to be in others
