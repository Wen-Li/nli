i do n't agree that 's true . young people are just trying to enjoy their life . they can not enjoy their life easily . they olny enjoy a little in their freetime . there are a few reason why they do n't enjoy good enough . first , they have a lot to do . they have to study more and more . they have to go school for their future . if they do n't study , they ca n't get the garranty for the future . a lot of new knowlodge come up to the world everyday . if they want to win the compititions , they have to study more and more . that 's the way to survive . second , they do not have enough money to enjoy . in generally when they want to do something fun , they need money . if they travel their country , they need money . whatever they want to do , they need money , except the part-time job they want . the last reason is the ton of item to enjoy . now they have a lot of thing to have fun . some young poeple get confused among them . they do not even know what and how to enjoy . the flood of thing to enjoy can make them hesitate what to choose . if so , can older people enjoy their life well ? my answer is `` yes '' there are some reason to say that . first , older people have enough time to enjoy . if they retire from their job , they can do . they do not spend their pretty much time to prepare fot the future . they can just only enjoy their life . second , they have money . when they retire , they get some money from their company , or they can recieve money even from reverse mortagage . in conclusion , older people can enjoy their life more comforble and easily than young people .
