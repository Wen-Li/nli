the world is on a rapid pace . everyone is determined to try something new and employ larger and larger risk . it surely get result to some and failure to many . in my opinion , people who have achieved success can definately try and work on more thing and get involved with the element of risk . they would be better off doing thing they were into all this while but the crave to achieve more will not help them settle for le . firstly , successful people can employ better brain and skilled man power to help working on new thing and exploring better avenue . with their past success they sure start believing in more thing and are confident in their way of execution . eg : someone like bill gates can employ far better intellect in his business and afford more risk which isnt a trait for someone who is still striving to achieve big . another important thing one should think of and consider when getting into a newer thing is his past experience . a succesfull man stand more chance for better and varied experience and i believe can handle critical decision and policy better than someone who is a fresher or le experienced . coming to our same example , mr bill gates today with his hard work and experience is in better position to make new business work and employ risk . through his detemination he ha explored many more area since from where he started . moreover , there are lot other priviledges that follows a successful person . not to deny his achievement but he is socially and politically more sound and strong to stand for his new risk and adventure . the urge to try new thing might also come from peer influence . lastly i would like to emphasise and support my opinion for successful people but would'nt want to neglect or limit the potential of any candidate or person on basis of his success . he surely can make it big but a succesful person in my view stand a better oppurtunity and chance .
