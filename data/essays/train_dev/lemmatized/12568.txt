i am not agree with this topic because now a day there are many car in all over the world . since the use of a car is very common for everyone because with the help of car oru working process is doing very easy so i think that the use of fewer car will create many problem for everyone . in these day without the use of car many work will be stop and many new problem will be created . now a day when a person ha it also show his personality over to other . and in the twenty year i think that there will be more car than now . the use of car will be common because a person use his car to go anywhere like in the party in marriage ceremony and for his personal use like for office use so in the next twenty car will be more and more common with the help of car our petrol and fuel also safe because when we go in party with our family car is much more convinent a compared to other thing to go . and the car factory are making now a day many car day by day so in the next twenty year there are lot of car will be availablefor different use . the car are increasing day by day so in the next twenty year i think there will be lot of car a compared to today . now a day car is making a status symbol for every one . now a day there are many different type of car are available in the market . there is a very big competition in the car 's company so after twenty year this competition will also increase . so at the end i think after twenty year there will be many car available if there is not then we will face many problem like we will search for another thing which is more comfortable a on
