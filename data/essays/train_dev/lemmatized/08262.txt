in my opinion , travel in group with a tour guide is not a good way of travelling . duo to you have to schedule your time at the time that tour guide told you . and if you want to do others activity you just cant , because you have to go to the specific part that were assignated for you since you choose to travel with a tour guide . in one hand , you cant go to visit place that you are more interested to go , in first place because you are travelling with a group of people and have to be togheter all the time . therefore you can not live them and go to somehere else . sometimes , it happens that you are looking something good for you in a store while you are walking round there , and you really want to buy it , but the problem is that you will not make any stop there with your travel group , so you have to leave , because the tour guide have rush on time , and he is hurring you , so you dont have the chance even to go through the store and see if the stuff isnt good for you . as far a i am concerned , if you go on a travel with a group and led you by a tour guide , you always go up on the travel bus , and all that you can see is through the window , and sometimes you even cant see anything , because the bus going fast . on the other hand , you cant really know the real place you are visiting for , because in my opinion the best way of visit a city is going by your own or with a group of friend that they likly to go with you and agreed to the think you wanna do during the trip . in conclusion , it is possible that you can travel with a tour guide , but only if you are not interested in the city your are visiting , or if you are in a hurry and you just want to see the most relevant place you are interested .
