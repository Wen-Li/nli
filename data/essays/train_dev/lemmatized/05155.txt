the statement given to me is `` it is more important for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact '' i completely disagree with the statement because without learning fact it mere waste on spending time on idea and concept . learning fact help u to grow knowldege and to know what is right and what is wrong . .. fact is a powerful word used in this society . without knowing the fact we can not know or we can not take a step forward to start anything new until and unless we r told about that fact . it bulids the curiosity of an induvidual . for example recently we see that sunitha rao an astronomist went into space and she is residing over there for 6 month to know all the so called fact over there in the space . .. she stated that she ha seen the planet earth from the space a that of a small star . .. as such student they should know the fact about everything around themsleves . .. if a fact is known then we can understand the idea behind it bring out all the concept in that particular fact . .. they help u in bringing out the universal truth into light . they help u in buliding up our knowledge and our skill too . we get interest to invade most of the fact hidden in particular thing in which a fact is there . .. coming to the part of idea and concept of understanding a im aganist to it . they help in just bringing out the idea or concept behind that . .. thats all . but knowing the fact is very essential . last but not the least facts play a very imporant role in one induvidual life and curiosity is increased for a knowing the fact . ..
