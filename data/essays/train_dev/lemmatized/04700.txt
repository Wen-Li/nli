i do not think young people enjoy their life more then older people . i think they enjoy it in a more physical way maybe then older people . but i think older people enjoy life in a more contemplaining way . indeed when you are young you can do sport . i love horse-riding . in order to be able to ride a horse you need strong muscle . strenght in this specific case is associated with youth . indeed when you are 80 year old , chance are you will not have the strength anymore to hold yourself up on a horse . i believe that the shier capacity of doing something can make one happy , just a the incapacity of doing something can make one unhappy . as a consequence when i will be 80 year old and i will not be able to ride horse anymore , that might make me unhappy . or , i will recall the time when i sat on a horse and will tell my grand child about how wonderful i looked when i sat on a horse . which lead me to my next point . i am not capable of saying today that i look wonderful on a horse . i think about improovement , when i think of horse riding . on the other hand , when i will be older i will be able to contemplate all the thing , i will have done physically and experienced over my life time . in my opinion that is something just older people can do . which in my opinion is a good thing , because it show that nature is well made . younger people have different way to enjoy life , in what they are able to do for example . and then their other way they are not able to enjoy their life , because they are young . the same go for older people . they have their way of enjoying life , like for instance contemplating their experience over a life time . why because they are older and they have lived for a long time and they also have the time to think about it . just like i do not have the time to think about how i look when i ride a horse , because i am young and therefore i am thinking about improvment . so really there is a time for everything in life . there is a time to enjoy life , a a young person and a an old person and that make life probably fair .
