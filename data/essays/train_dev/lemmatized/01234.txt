altough the main aspect of the life is enjoyment and happiness , i strongly agree with the spekers statement . the enjoyment in the life can change many situation and most part of the life depends on happiness because of the result that come what we have expected . there are many reason and example to strenthen my statement that young people enjoy lot in there life rather than older people . firstly , the young people mostly enjoy there life in college education because there will be no burden on them and they try to spend most of the time to enjoy life . for example , they offen go to picnic 's or tour when they are free and another is there will no stress or tension in there younger life and most enjoyable time for youger one is , when the expected result will acheive in there life . secondly , the enjoyment will be more in younger people rather than older people . for example , they frequent go to the tour and go to the picture because they are not having any burden and responsibility like older people . since i am young i know the enjoyment of life in these stage . another example is that they enjoy a lot when there is any adventure or any thrilling work they do mean , by driving a car or rock climbing persists there enjoyment . thirdly , i state that the older people can also enjoy there life but not a much a young people do . because the older people will have many responsibility such a , maitain family , office work this excludes them enjoyning most part of the life even though if there is any enjoyment in the older people they will enjoy in much decent manner but the younger one will enjoy a lot . finally , the conclusion that most younger one are enjoying because they dont have any social responsibility like older people but the enjoyment and happiness in life will bring a lot of change to make a good life .
