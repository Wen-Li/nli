i agree with the following statementbecause all of these are risk while living . for example i'am a food engineer . i know food very well . but i mu n't work in food factory or deperment of food in factory . may be i am successful an other depertmant . in my family my uncle is a doctor . he is n't work in hospital . now heis working international factory and heis very successful person . so i take risk to be successful person . first of all you love your job or work . when you love , nothing is problem . finally look at life of succesful person , they take alot of risk everytime .
