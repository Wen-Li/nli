cars are the most important investigation in our world , and it is very usefull in all of our life way . we can travel by car for long distance and we can translocate our thing . in my opinion it make our world smaller than it is . for the privious benifites i disagree with the statment which said that `` in twenty year there will be fewer car in use than there are today '' . let u go to the past , befor car were be invinted , the man wa suffer from traviling because it wa lost his time and wa very sloly and very difficult . we can immagine for example if we want to travel for 1000 kelo meter what the time we should be taken to arrive or reatch our station . now adayes we can travel a far a we can without suffering or wasting more time . second example why i hold no confidonce with the privious statment is the fast development of car industry we can see today various kind of car differ from it use and which are le expensive or do not need alot amount of gas . although in the last few year car were became dangrous for human health because it can pollute the air , but recently new generation of car are appeared and it consider a a friend of the environment . what is more if we had not car what we will do return to the back and ride donkies or depend on our foot . i can not immagine life empty from car . the last reason why car will still for ever it provid some jops for the people , such a driver , mechanicans and worker in the car industry . therefore we can say that because of the many us of the car it will be found for ever and will not decrease and will be develope to be appropriate for any environment using many source of power which are not harm for human .
