in my opinion success ha nothing to do with trying new thing or taking risk . what is success ? it 's when a person is doing his best relatively to her or his potential . maybe it is not something new it is something what he or she always ha done . another thing is the learning-effect and beeing successful in that case . there i agree that you are more successful in the event of learning when you try doing new thing . for example a young guy between his twenty 's , doing always the same thing , let 's say , working a a printer . it would n't be successful when he would continue his whole life in doing this work in beeing in the same position and the same company forever . a successful person would try to go further . change company , learn from the best in the field , go to school , trying to take a job in the adminstration . maybe he will fail once or twice . but on the end , he will be successful , because he can look back and say : i have tried new thing and i have done my best . another way of beeing successful is by taking risk . it 's usually a small way between beeing risky and beeing stupid . most people know they are stupid after beeing risky . as an example let 's take a gambler which put his whole safings on one number in the roulette . the number turn , the ball jumpes and take place in another number than the gambler wished to . that 's stupid we would say . but if it had been his favourite number , than he would be immediately successful . therefore , in my opinion , to be risky doe n't mean you are successful . we probably can say that the more risk we take , the bigger is the success , but also the bigger we can fail . important is not be in a steady positon , where no success ever will occur .
