since car were invented the number of them circulating ha been growing and growing along with the improvment of technology . for this reason , i do not see why in twenty year there could be fewer car than there are today . however , one could say that car might be replaced by other very high tech mean of transportation , but i think twenty year would not be enough to do so . in my opinion , which is also a wish , in twenty year there will be more car or a much a today , but maybe they will not pollute the enivronment a they do today . in fact , a lot ha been already done to reduce pollution and i am sure there is still much that can be done . for example , italian city and other european city are making europeans buy euro4 and euro5 car , which pollute way le than standard car . this reduction ha been possible thanks to improvement of car technology . every month around the world there are show room that present new kind of car , le and le polluting , more and more sofisticated in shape , motor and accessory . some of these new kind of car are very expensive , depending also on the brand , while some are cheaper . industries are doing a lot for making people buy these car , from rich people to le fortunate people . not only industry and the most famous brand company are acting in favour of le pollution . in fact , government are doing a lot a well . for instance , they organize many information campaign ; they define calendar of day during which people must not use car in the city where pollution is over the maximum level permitted and they finance electric pubblic transportation . i think these are good reason to retain that car will not decrease in number for the next twenty year ; on the contrary it is common to expect them to be numerous but le polluting than they are today .
