i think the best way to travel is by alone , not in a group led by tour guide . in my country , there are a lot of tour agency to different country . however , traveling should definetly alone because there is not much time the guide give , traveling alone is more flexible to control time and place to go , and tour information they five can be found indivisual . in my personal experience , tour guide give not enough time to see something in one site . for example , i once had a travel to northeastern united states . i went to new york first . one amazing place wa broadway . those musical poster , commercial , and store attracted me . however , the guide gave me only one hour . i wanted to visit the store and see a musical , but in one hour , all i could do wa take photoes and buy a suvenier . if someone is going to travel , he must have flexible time to stay and do something they want to do . musical , cup of cofee or shopping is their choice . if people travel alone or by their personal group , they are more flexible in time and deciding where to go . when i wa in cuba , i wanted to go to the beach , but the day , it wa rainy , so i changed my plan to stay indoor . and at evening i enjoyed dinner on cool temperature beach . if someone travel in group with tour guide , you can not change plan , you may go to beach on a rainy day . also , you might go to somewhere you do n't want to go and waste hour in a bus . people find tour guide because they are not good in that place . however , inventon of internet , and so much book about that place , tell everything about it . people can find map , place where view is good , where to eat delicious food . then people can choose place to go by themselves . my parent , once went to italy , with only a book , and enjoyed everything without problem . for these reason , it is fun and also very practical to travel alone or in a personal group . flexible scedules and indivisual preference is the most important thing when people travel indeed .
