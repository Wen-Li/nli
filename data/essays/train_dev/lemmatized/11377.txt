successful people i believe do n't stick to one thing , they try to explore new thing since `` variety is the spice of life '' . if a person keep on doing one thing all the time it becomes boring . there are some people who are never happy even though they may have a good lifestyle . some people thrive on the rush they get from working , the excitement . my father is one such man . then there are some people who kust wanna earn more money because they are not happy with there current lifestyle , they want more , a better and more expensive lifestyle , these people are never content , they always aspire for more . one such person wa a character in the book by ` john ghrisam ' ` the king of torts' my father is an successful man he ha an amazing real estate buissness which alows u to live very comfortibly but my dad wa not satisfied he wanted to something new , something challenging , something he ha never done before . therfore my father decided to start a new buissness concerning exporting . in the beggining we had loos but still my dad would not give up eventualy the buissness picked up and it became quite profitable . but my father now wanted to open a new buissness , and the cycle continues . in the book we see a simple man who ha nothing but get 's a excellent deal and make million . he get to live a lifestyle he never dreamt of . a lifestyle with mansion and fast car . but he wa not content he wanted more . he wa becoming greedy his friend pulled out of the bussiness early so they already had made there money . in the end he lost everyting he lost his house , his job . he took a risk and paid for it in a big way . sometimes successrul people take risk because of the thrill like my father others take risk because they are greedy like the character from ` the king of torts ' . i agree we should take risk even though we are successful because a pridictable life style is never good . sometimes we are lucky like my father and sometimes unlucky like the character .
