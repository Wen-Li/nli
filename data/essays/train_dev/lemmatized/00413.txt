there are many way that the topic of the better way to gain knowledge can be approached . some people think that having broad knowledge of many academic subject is better , while others do not . i have my point of view a well . there are two reason why i am in favor of having broad knowledge . a key reason underlying my choice is that if we study broadly , we can be more competitive in the future . take my brother , for example . while he wa studying during university , he decided to have english teaching for his minor . although he lost a lot of time hanging out with friend , he got more choice when he graduated from the university . moreover , because of his ability of english speaking and his major , marketing , he got promoted quickly . such an example show that studying broadly can help u become more competitive . another important reason why i choose studying broadly is that sometimes , we wo n't be so sure about what we are going to do in the future . if we studying broadly , we can find out our real interest from all these subject and choose the one we want . take my father , for example . when he wa in college , he majored in history . as a matter of fact , it would be hard to find a job except being a teacher . unfortunately , my father doe n't like to teach at all . however , he took more class in other department , and try to choose one subject that he really like . finally , he choosed chinese and he became an editor in a big newspaper company in my country . without broad knowledge , my father may not be such successful today . of course , there is an argument to be made for other posotions . nevertheless , i think the reason that i have presented are stronger .
