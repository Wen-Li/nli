i have been working at a fast food chain for two year . because i have the most experience with the job than most worker , i train many of the trainee . as i taught , i made them learn the concept of making the product than to learn the fact . one day , when i wa on my break , an angry customer came to the store . he explained that the trainee gave him a drink with milk powder , when the customer wa allergic to milk . the trainee made an excuse that she did not know what the powder wa made from . then , i noticed the importance of fact rather than the idea and concept . learning idea and concept may be a great place to start the education , but fact are also very important for a student . for example , a curious student may be working on a experiment using acid . the teacher may tell him the concept that the acid in the experiment is dangerous . but , since the student is so curious , that he may try poring some acid on his finger , to see what happens when you get an acid burn . soon , he would be suffering from major chemical burn , and be taken to the hospital . as it is said in `` pandora 's box '' , we are born to be curious . once we learn the idea and the concept , we must satisfy our pleasure by learning the fact . i can not say that idea and concept are not important ; we need them to learn . but just stopping at the concept is not enough . we must proceed , and get better understanding by learning the fact . ever since the incident with the customer , i learned a lesson to teach my trainee the fact including with the product . now that i think about it , who would train the trainee the fact if i did n't share my knowledge now ?
