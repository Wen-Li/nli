i disagree with the given statement . according to me the statement is not very precise . i think that people should hold on to what they already know how to do . it is much more beneficial that trying new thing . the common saying `` jack of all trade but master of none '' applies here very well . the people who keep doing the same thing through their life are more successful according to me . the people who concentrate in the same field increase their experience vividly in the respective field . they can become more efficient by further training and support . where a those who are trying new thing every time can never be satisfied with one thing and can never be settled in life . their life is spent trying new thing and there is no particular job that they fit into . they are always changing job and are very unstable in their life . for example , a person who know all the job o repairing but doe not have enough experience is no better than a person who know only wheel alignment but is widely experienced . moreover , the employer are always looking for hiring widely experienced crew member . this type of experience in a certain field can be gained only by doing it for a long time and attending training session . the practice of doing only one thing over and over again can also lead you to become an expert in that field of work . this again contributes to an individual 's success rate . in today 's world of high population a person stand out only if he ha a certain specific knowledge . the chance of a person who doe the thing he already know are higher of being selected for a certain job . most of the company avoid risk-takers to avoid the chance of loss to the company . thus the people who prefer doing thing that they are already familiar with are , in my opinion , more successful in their life rather than those who try new thing and are adventurous . i completely disagree with the given statement .
