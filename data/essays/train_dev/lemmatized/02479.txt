taking risk could be good for some people , and could be the worst thing that they do for some people . it relies on faith . taking risk may be good for some pepole because many people think that where there is a risk there are a lot of opportunity . these people love to take a risk , and like to challenge with these risky thing . also if you get lucky when you take risk you will open a new door for yourself , and you may be successful , and feel happy . however , if you try somthing new , and you could not success you will feel mope , and everything in your life will distroyed . in addition , when you take risk you will be stressed . so keep away from taking risk , and do not try to do new thing that you do not know ho to do it . on the other hand , doing what you already know how to do well is better than take a risk in life becuase when you take a risk you may lose every thing that you take a risk for . furthermore when you take a risk you may not success , and turn your previous successful to nothing , so people will forget your successful . but you do what you know how to do well you will success , and feel happy . so keep doing what you doing is better than take risk for reason that you do't know if it will success or not . in conclustion , it depends on lucky , and nobody want to fauil . i think the effect of unsuccsseful is something that nobody can load . and becuase of these reason i do not agree with the statement that say `` successful people try new thing , and take risk rather than only doing what they already know how to do well '' .
