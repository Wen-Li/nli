i strongly agree to the statement that for student idea and concept are more important than learning fact . the following essay will illustrate this and explain why it is so . ideas come from the creativity with in aperson . a person who ha the capability to develop an idea of it own can do anything . he/she can produce many fact from the idea . ideas act a the source of many inovations . thus a person with great idea will never be dependent on fact but will always create thing on his/her own . concepts also play very important role in the process of learning . to work in any field one ha to learn the basic of that field . it is a very simple statement but it stand quite good . in any institution a student should invest most of his/her time in learning the basic and the concept of a particular field . a person with a strong base of knowledge can bring in astonishing chages in his/her field of study . in our histtory if we have seen that great invention , either by newton or an unknown scientist , always had a stong backup of in-depth knowledge of the field . if we see the painting of leonardo do vinci , those are based on the idea and imagination which he had and on which he had given remarkable belonging to the world . although , a small connsideration go sometime to fact a it help in strenthening one idea which ha been developed by using the concept of the field . but ultimately it your own originality which can bring flying colour . in the end i would conclude that idea and concept are more important than the learning the fact . so student should concentrate more on getting the concept and enhancing thier idea rather than memorizing the fact .
