i did n't agree with the statement that `` it is better to have a broad knowledge of many academic subject than to specialize in one specific subject. '' why mean it wa a known fact that `` knowing every tthing about something is better than knowing something about everything. '' and also it cause poor knowledge in the fild an individual ha to be choosen for sustainment . it will be clearly dicussed in the following line . firstly , what a person need is that the term `` profficiency '' . because it would be the thing that the modern world need . every field need the people to be profficient in that field and a little or no knowledge in other field . even the most famous scientist whose invention may stick to thir feild . so every individual need himself to be expertise in any particular choosen field . moreover the former would give him a lot of confusion towards the respective field . secondly , the process of broadening cause a lot of unemployment apart from developing inadequacy in the theory pertaining to his own field . on the other hand it give a sort of uselessness to him in his career objective . ofcourse it give the broad knowledge to the individual , it creates a lot of disaster to his family member and also to the country . nextly , knowledge of many academic subject may cause loss of individuality . moreover the development of any field depends upon the effective utilisation of the source and their research in those field . what it mean is that the person need to show his attitude and concentration for the development of the selected subject . because in the era of rapid growing technology the individual may get his identity only in his specialized field . finally , for the overall development and for the well-being of the individual , one need specialization in his respective field . this give him ability to promote his identity even in the most unfavorable situation .
