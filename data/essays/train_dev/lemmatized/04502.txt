definitely i agree , cauze life is an ever changing challenge , which is shown in many stage a you are growing old , presented itself with new obstacle that mostly come a new thing for you , and you will find yourself at decisionmaking circumstance where you have to choose wether yo dare to know and do new thing or not , based on my own experience and personal thinking , i am taking risk attempting to study abroad , even though i am sure that so far i ve got high quality and knowledge from my university to work in a local ecuadorian society , and i can develop in my sutdy field , but i also think that focusing on a specific issue related to one s study will make accesible new technology and method on the conservation of the environment , at the same time the opportunity of developing my skill in the area i ve chosen , will give me the chance to express my idea and contirbute to improve our society from practical point of view , i also think that i can enrichen even more my knowledge by hearing other perspective from sutdents who were raised under diferent cultural and environmental pattenrs , but regardles of this there will also be thing that i will not like too much , i mean shok culture , new currency , new lifestyle , new architecture and totally a diferent environment . so if i would not take these risk i would never know if i wa able to face new circumstance and even develop my personal skill , and to find out how far i wa capable to reach , at such point that it might turn out frustrating and uncomfortable in the future , so a a sum i think the more versatile you can be the better , let alone the possibility of distressing yourself , for example with activity involved in art such a music and painting , or making tour , cooking , learning language , working in farm , etc
