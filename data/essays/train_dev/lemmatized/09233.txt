i can agree to this statement but of course this doe not mean that there are no people that spend time - or enough time - to helping . the problem a a whole is a problem of the society being fast , anonymous and commercial . let me explain some of the reason for the problem in detail . first of all many young people nowadays do not even have the time to get really involved into a community for a long time . after school they go to a university far away and afterwards they will find a job elsewhere - and even that job can end soon and one will have to leave again . one point - perhaps related to the one before - is the focus people have . most do only look at themselves and do not want to handle the problem of other people - maybe they do not have the time or connection to the people and city the went to for their new job , for example . so , always looking for the own success make people blind for problem of their neighbour , classmate and community . furthermore the preferance of indoor activity a they are very common today - such a tv , computer game or internet - lead to loss of communication with other people . following helping other people or community get le and le , too . a girl sitting at home and watching her perfered afternoon soap and dealing with the problem shown there will no longer be interested in the problem in her community . in conclusion i can state again that i agree with that statement - but this negative issue is not only the fault of single person but - to a certain amount - the fault or problem of the society and our generation a a whole .
