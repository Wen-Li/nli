every people ha their own life , they can enjoy the life , or suffer their life . as the topic say , `` young people enjoy life more than older people do '' , that is wrong . i disagree with the statement `` young people enjoy life more than older people do '' . i think old people are enjoying life in their way . as most people know they are not healthy a younger people so we can think they are not enjoying life . enjoying life doe n't mean people have to move . they can read book , listen the music , or drink tea . it depends on the personality of the person . also on the television show how they think about old people . first , old people like to talk , it doe n't matter who is it . in the book , tuesdays with morrie , morrie want to talk to somebody , he just want someone to listen to his story . so the person who listens to his story is mitch albom , he wa morrie 's student once . like i said , people think old people are not enjoying their life because they are not moving , but they are enjoying the life that they have . old people are enjoying in their way to find happiness . young people are healthy so they can go where ever they want and get everything they want . but because they are doing what they want , they ca n't be happy . the real happiness is inside of our mind . second , the happiness of enjoy life can be changed by the person 's personality . for example , one of my friend doe n't like to hang out with her friend or doe n't like to talk to someone . but she is enjoying her life in her own way . i have no idea what doe she do when she go home , may be she read book , may be she collect picture , or may be listens to the music . enjoying life is not like someone say , `` she doe n't know how to play so she 's not enjoying her life . she is suffering her life '' , it doe n't mean she is really suffering her life , she is enjoying her life by doing her favorite activity . third , yesterday i watched tv show `` los angles '' , they had episode of old lady in the swimming pool . people can go in the pool with topless , so those old lady swam without top . so the worker at the hotel made them go out the pool . many people think old people are ruining their life , but not really . they are enjoying their life just like yound people do . therefore , everyone ha their way to live their life , to enjoy their life . for many reason , they are enjoying the life a same a yound people do . i hope prople in the world do n't have fence to the old people , because everybody 's getting old , and we will be the old people one day .
