i agree with the statement but i have to point out several issue . i believe time have changed therefore we can not expect young people to behave in the same way a young people from the past did . they might not give enough time to helping their community but this could be due to a lack of time and different target . nowadays young people are individualistic because we live in a society that focus on individual rather than on community . by the same token , young people focus on themselves and they prefer to invest their time in selfish activity instead of community service . i consider myself a young person and out of my experience i can say that i am not interested in community at all . furthermore , i have lived in several country and what really strike me is the fact that young people behave completely different depending on the country that they live in . for instance , in sweden guy are extremely independent whereas in spain are much le independent likewise spanish guy might care more about community than swedish guy do . so in order to understand the question it is needed to place it in a specific context . the responsible of such situation is the society because society is constructed around individual , rule are made according to what is the best for individual thus they became the most important thing . nonetheless , it is possible to notice strong nationalistic movement in europe that emphazises on community . if european community become strong , it would be a change regarding young people 's attitude hence they would give enough time to helping their community . to conclude , i agree with the statement but some aspect need to be considered before talking about young people and their attitude . young people behave completely different depending on the country that they live in and their culture , however , all in all it can be said that young people do not give enough time to helping their community .
