successful people try new thing and take risk rather than only doing what they already know how to do well . i can only support this statement , because one will never be more successfull than others , if one doe not try out new think . and for trying out something new one ha to take the risk to fail , or to get hurt . this implies the fact , that successful people have to be very confident . confidence mean in this case to be able to keep your head up and go on , eventhough something did not work . because this is what happes all the time when you risk something , sometimes it might work , sometimes you will fail . of course being successful doe not only mean having a big job career , one can be successful in sport , school , family , organizing life ect . but in everything you want to succeed you have to be open for new thing . if you always walk the same path like the others you will never step out off the mass . but walking new path asks for alot of courage , which people can get when they get older and more experienced . so finaly i want to say everybody ha the chance to be successful , they just have to be willing to take the risk .
