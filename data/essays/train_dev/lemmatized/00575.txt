i always believe that one of the biggest trait for a successful person would definetly be his ability to try out new thing rather than persisting doing thing he knew best . so i would definetly agree with given the statement . lets take an example to better illustrate the stand on the topic , thomas edison wa the one who invented the bulb . he would never have invented the bulb if he did not take the risk and try some thing different . what could the effect of this be ? we would have still be sitting with candle in between u for lighting . so it wa this ability of his to try new theores and thought made him successful . secondly i would like to take the example of the father of my nation mahatma ghandhi who wa greatly successful because of his new way to fight the british rule . he came up with what they call now the ghandian principle of non - violent way of fighting aginest the british rule . his new and risky way helped to win the independence to our country , much againest the more established way of using violence for freedom fighting . ghandhi for one an established lawer in south africa when he started his new non violent way of protesting againest the harsh authority . fur better understanding take for instance a student who is good at his achademics but not very good in his communication skill , if he want to get placed in a good company after his study it would be really hard for him to be successful . so here although the person is good at his achademicshe need to concentrate on his communication skill in order to be successful . this stament greatly work in the case of computer programmer , computer programmer are always confronted with the task of finding newer way to program in order to increase the efficiency and throughput of the target system , and so the most successful men for instance microsoft have always been one those who did thing differently . so to sum it up , though it is important to do well what you know , you always need to have the desire to try out new thigs and the pluck to take risk to come out on top and be successful . this ha always been the case with most of the successful men in history .
