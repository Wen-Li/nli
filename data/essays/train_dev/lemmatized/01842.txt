the bwst way to travel is in a group led by atour guide . i agree with that for many resonse . if there is a tour guide the group will be on control , there will not be any fight about the rode , and he will be the best known of the way . first , if there is a tour gide the group will be on control . he will control the stop by diside how much stop should they have and how long , and where should they stop . second , there will not be any fight during the tripe . they not have any space for each one to give his opinion about the way and which one is right and which one is wrong . third and the last , if they have a tour guide he must be the best known about the way . he must be know which way they have to go . he must know which way is right and which way is wrong . he have to realize which road is dangures and which way is not . and also he have to be good known which is long way and waist there time and which way is short and save there time in conclustion , traviling in a group led with tour guide keep the tripe sweet and safe . it keep the relastionshipe good by no having any fight between them . it safe the time by going in the short and safe way . and also be relax by going with person who know the road very will and have agood idea about the best way to get there with .
