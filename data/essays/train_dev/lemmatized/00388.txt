i agree . i think resently young people contact with thier communituies . for example they do n't greet with people . there is n't comunication . and they think contact of community is boreing . but , comunication with community is very important . becouse , this defend community 's sefty . resently , more and more commits incresing . expecially , comunication is effectiv for robber . if community 's contact hard , robber can n't aim at this city . in this way , comunities 's contact make sefty . next , if young peppe contribute their community , this city improve . young people have great power to change commuities . for example , using this power effectivilly , clean up this city . confatabule city enable to assemble people , so this city improve . and if people increse , commance deveroping . shops and department increse too . young people give time to helping their communitise
