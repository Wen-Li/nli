i feel that i do n't agree with this statement . first , the number of developing country is much larger than the number of developed country in the earth . mang people in developing country wil be richer and richer . so they will buy their own car in the furture . j ust like china . because i am from china , i know much more about the people in developing country . in china , the economy is much better than twenty year ago . the number of car is creased so fast in these year . more and more people are talking about the plan of buying a new car now . it ha already been an important part in people 's life . second , in my opinion , the number of car in developed is full now . almost everybody ha their own car , and some people even have two . but it do not mean that the number will decrease . in twenty year , people will update their car more morden . but do not reduce the number of car . so it will lead that the number is no changed obviously . third , although mang country 's government begin to limit the number of car because of the pollution . but i believe that the producer of car can find another way to avoid it happen . they can find out another energy to instead of oil . just like gas , electricity , and so on . maybe there will be more and more car using this kind of energy in the road . i think this is also our dream . finaly , producing a car can improve the technology in many field . we have no right to stop it . having a beautiful car is also my dream .
