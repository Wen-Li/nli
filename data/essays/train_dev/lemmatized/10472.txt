travelling by a tour guide or alone ? some people prefer the former while others prefer the latter . to each his own . however i am a person who like to travel alone , therefore i am disagree with the statement for the reason below . first of all , in these kind of tour , the guide usually give general or most interesting information - according to them of course - and do not state detail which i may like . therefore i like to have my own book about this certain place and travel with them and read detailed information which are interesting for ` me` . for instance , while i wa travelling around the western europe , i had these book which gave me extremely sufficent information about the place i have seen . secondly , you can take your time when you are travelling alone , however you do not have opportunity to spend your time efficiently when you are travelling by a tour guide . therefore you usually do not have time to examine the place that you travel , moreover you do not feel them since there is pressure of the guide because they just want to finish the tour and get their money a soon a possible . for example , in the same trip i mentioned before , i had an experience like that . the guide finished 30 minute tour in 10 minute , using the hot weather excuse and then i never attemped to go a trip by a guide . last but not the least , by travelling on your own , you have the flexibility of choosing place which you do not have if you take a all included trip . so you would not face to travel all over the place which you do not like or even hate . because it is waste of time and money . trerefore spending your energy for the place that you like is more sensible . to sum up , people who like to gain general information and like to see most interestingly claimed place in a time like blinking your eye , should prefer guide tour . however i prefer travelling alone because of the flexibility of time and possibility of choosing place and the detailed information .
