altough there are some young people who endeaver to help their community , it could n't be wrong to state that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their community . an old saying of my country say : `` exceptions doe n't make the rule disfunction . '' the main reason of my supportting this statement is the way the young live , the way they behave to each other , the only intrinsic purpose for doing something and their attidutes towards older and younger alike . nearly all the young live now selfish . they contemplate only the benefit for theirselves , which they can obtain from any activity . they are unaware of the term altruism . this is observed to be continuing in accordance with the technology . the faster the technological invention are made , the more selfish the people are . the computer , the television and same functioning facility are the prison of younger , but the difference is they are happy there . everything in order to be done for being beneficial to the community doe n't interest them , because they are happy in their prison . their attitude towards the others is really affected by the guardian in these prison a well . and everybody know who the guardian are . to sum up , the young are uninterested to the social problem , however whose guilt this is , is obvious : technological improvement and u , who could not obey this invention and who let them be the most important part of our life .
