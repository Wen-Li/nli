i have travelled abroad for more than five time . half of the travel i made wa with a tour guide , while the other half did n't . i have to admit that traveling with a tour guide in a group is really a easier way to travel . everything is planned by the tour guide . you do n't need to worry about where to stay in the next stop , how to get the next destination . however , if i have time to make travel plan in advance , i prefer travel on my own . i can take my time to enjoy the journey more when traveling alone than with a tour group . i like going to museum , seeing art display and savoring the exotic cuisine . i can keep my own pace in the journey and really have a good look at the city . the travel plan made by the travel agency are often too packed for me . i do n't like to be in a hurry . the other thing that i like to travel alone is that i do n't need to put up with other people in a tour group . sometimes i mett member in the tour group that really have bad habit . for example , i 've been in a tour group , and one of the member in the group wa often late for the scheduled time . as a result , the whole group had to postpone our next schedule just because of his lateness . compared with traveiing in a group with a tour guide , i enjoy traveling by myself more . in this way , i can really see what i want to see and i do n't have to face the inconvenience caused by some member in the tour group .
