i believed successful people are always try new thing and take risk rater than only doing what they already know it . somehow successful people are always try to create the new thing to let them to be sussessful . therefore , mony people are usually doing thing same they usually do such like jod , habies , even sport . first , people have jod are usually have the smalily then they were educaed subject in the college which they already perpared for the jod that they are going to do . however , people did n't change jod too much once they were get used to on they own jod , so that is why people make different type money and how suessful their will be . therefore , people were being successful it is because they knew how to change their life by change their own jod . often people try to go to school like counmmitry college again , either by learn themself from book even they were elder adult . in other way they might just by asked other people their own expenince make a ilttle change to fit in nowsday 's socity . it usually make them to be more postive to do it . somtines people change their habies because it is just papuler for now and it is not really sure about later day or another time what is would be . finaly , people were being successful or not is depen on what is your personal atetivies . somehow people sucessful just for their own good , but many of other successful people i think will probably pay back for the socity , so i still believed people suessful is not just for thier own good is for every one in the would .
