to begin with , i do not agree with the statement which is exposed . to my mind , i think that student must understand idea and concept ( absolutely ) because it 's a way for them to mature , and also learn fact . on the one hand , when they understand idea they can afford exposing their opinion . the best solution to it is to attend school because it 's a good way to attend different type of class and to understand different thing from each one . the fact of speaking with student can make one 's view . going to school allow you to ask question to professor if you do n't know something or do n't understand something . for example a student who used to believing that doctor kelly commited suicide and whose profesor explains him the real cause of his death will be more efficient after because he understands something . on the other hand it 's really important on a student 's life to learn fact . indeed , the best solution to learn fact is to be confronted by . you can read magazine , watch television , surf on the internet , in a word to put forward with time . when the unbelievable war in iraq wa declared and when people seen all that happened in this country , they learned something : violence is not the best solution to solve a problem . besides , someone who is closed to his parent and doe n't cope with the exterior will not be able to face situation and to leave the family nest , he will not stand on his own two foot . that 's why he had to read , listen or everything else that can help him to know what happen in the world and in that way learn fact . anyway it 's better if you are open-minded and not narrow-minded with the world 's fact . to sum up understand idea and concept are a important a learn fact because it not ban you of having a different vision and opinion of thing , and it allows you to create your own personnality .
