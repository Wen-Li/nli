i agree with the statement that it is more important for student to understand the idea and concept rather than to learn fact because firstly , the student ha a chance to improve when he learns the idea . for example ; if the student is taught about spherical mirror in physic class , he should not be given the simple equation . he should rather be told to prove how these equation are derived so in this way he can actually improve himself in spherical mirror . in this way , the student can learn better in further topic such a lens . secondly . understanding the idea can help the student look at thing in a broader way because by analysing the idea , the individudal can examine the life around himself in many different way . for instance , in my extra lesson the teacher always wanted me to memorise the equation in the science class but in the school my other teacher wanted me to look at the topic in a broader way and think on it and she wa actually right because i now know that memorising a fact in any science class is not effective for me to look at how the nature work scientifically . if i know where all the equation and main point come from , then i can examine the environment around me in a broader way so understanding the main idea effectively help . on the other hand , memorising a fact doe not definitely help me examine my environment because after a while i forget that ` fact ' and i may even never use it again . thirdly , understanding the idea will give the student a confidence because when the student achieves a goal in that idea ; he feel pleasure about it . when i first started writing my essay on sociolinguistics ; my supervisor did not teach me the main fact but he guided me about which book to use and which keywords have to be mentioned so in this way he did not want me to memorise but he wanted me to ` get the idea ' and eventually . after using the book and the keywords , i realized that i definitely understood what the topic is mainly about . when i handed my essay in , i wa very confident of myself and i felt joy and pleasure because i actually improved myself and i learned the topic all by myself . even my supervisor wa surprised because i wa not taking sociolinguistics class and the fact that i learned the topic all by myself made it much more better and interesting . to conclude , understanding the main idea are better for student to learn fact because firstly , by learning the idea they can improve and become more confident . furthermore , they can analyse their environment in a broader way by learning the main idea . in addition , if the student achieves a goal about that topic by understanding it , he will be happy to be successful .
