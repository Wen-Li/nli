i disagree with this statment , i think older people enjoy life more then yonger one , becouse older people have the money , the time the and health . as of the money older people have alot of money form their saving over the year , form down sizing a they dont need to be in big house so they down size a they move in smaller house and get alot of money from this , also they have their retierment plan which give them good money every month which they can relay on . as of the time mostof them are retiered so they have alot of time to enjoy so you will find them traveling alot engaged in social activity doing fancy sport like golfing , sailing and fishing which need alot of money and time . if we go through the economics magazine we will find alot of atrticals about the elderly people and the baby boomer and how much they spend on traveling , entertaiment and sport . also they have exelent health servecise they have the most advanced health facilitis in the world , you can see now that the avarage life span for the female in the usa is 79 year & for the male is 73 year , so they have every thing to enjoy thier life . on the other hand youner people have to work very hard to pay their bill for example if a graduate student is working in a good job and have good career he ha to work very hard in order to pay his student loan , if he dosent have a loan he ha to pay his mortgage on his house , if a young person doesnot have an acadimic dgree he or she ha to work in more than one job in order to live decent life so after a hard working day both of them donot have the time or energy to enjoy or do some thing else , and if they want to do any thing they have to plan it a year ahead charge it on credit card and then pay later over the year with the intrest , also younger people have to work hard and plan for their retirment . so after all these resons i think older poeple are enjoing their life more then younger one .
