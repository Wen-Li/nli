for a better community , every individual of that particular place ha to provide a helping hand to reach it success level . considering the young people nowadays , thay have to contribute their part to help out his/her community . i personally agree with the statement that , young people nowaday do not give enough time to help their community for the following reason . young people is a combination of college going student a well a recently graduated one from the university who spend most of the time searching a better job . the stress on the student is so high these day that they hardly get time to entertain themselves . that is , they are always tangled with their study and assignment they need to complete . in such case , they dont have time for other activity like improving their community . other reason is , whenever they get some time young people prefer to spend time with their family and friend rather than improving a community . this is the cause of the excess burden they are facing from their daily schedule pattern . for instance , i myself being a graduate student , whenever i get some time from my assignment , i would prefer relaxing at home than going out and improve my community . young people also feel that , if the community head and the corresponding head feel responsible and do their part correctly then there wont be a question to call young people to participate in such programme . young people have to concentrate well on their study and go on up to their satisfaction level because these are the people who are the citizen of tomorrow . young people have to mould themselves in such a way that they could become the role model for their younger generation . in the concluding note , young people dont give enough time for the improvisation of their community because of the above stated reason .
