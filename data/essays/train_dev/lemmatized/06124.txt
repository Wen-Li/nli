this question is really hard to answer , because both aspect are importend , a broad knowledge of many academic subject a well a a deeper understanding in one specific subject . however , in my opinion specialization is necessary to succeed in your future carreer . i mean , that is why we are going to university ; becoming a well educated person in our field of study . students are attending most course , that are necessary for their major . is this not specialization ? i think it is . furthermore , if we had not such a thing like specialization , everybody would be able to become a politician or a lawyer or even a doctor . can you imagine that ? i believe that this would be an aweful situation . i want a surgery to be done by a professional and not somebody who is also my lawyer or a carpenter . i think i made it clear , why specialization is necessary for an intact economy . however , a broad academical knowledge is not necessarily required , but it would definately be something one person can take advantage of . for example , an engineer would be unsuccessful to become self employed , if he ha not attended a certain number of business or economy class during his time at college . these class would provide him with the knowledge about economic relation and approach in business life . fortunately , the school system in germany requires that student have to attend a certain number of course that do not belang to their major . through this approach , graduate are going to be more flexible , which would probably be something business are looking for , when you try applying for an occupation . in conclusion , both aspect are important . but people have to be some sort of specialized to be fully integrated into society and economy and to find a job . as i pointed out , who want to have a surgery done by a non-professional ?
