i strongly disagree with the statment which suggests that young people nowadys do not give enough time to help and aid their community , because young people are currently much educated and oriented than other young people who lived in the past due to the advance in all field of education , technology , social service and becuase of the emergence of the active social charity and community all over the globe . young people nowadays represent a major part of the community , and they are aware of how hard and difficult maintaining a good life can be , they are noticing how the crime level is escalating severly , and how there are an increase in the number of homeless child , and that a lot of people are not recieving good health service . all of these mentioned example will cause young people to be scared and force them to ask question like : - how might we survive through all this ? - is what i am seing now will happen to me or to the people whom u love ? - whats waiting u next ? well , by asking all these question , another one come in mind and that question is : `` what can i do to make this place a better one ? '' and the answer right away will be : '' act now '' . young people can do a lot of thing , for instance they can participate in social activites , they can voulenteer in community and charity which are directed to promote and encourage people life , others can enroll in programes that focus on environment preservation . i truly believe that young people can and will be of great help , yet we must provide space for them express themselves , and provide them with all the mean neccessary to ensure the integrity of their work because , sometimes the problem lie in u , that is adult in really understanding what young people can do , therefore we must quit the idea that these young can not do any good , because they can .
