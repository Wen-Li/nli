i strongly speak in favour of `` young people enjoy life more than older people do '' . although older people who are successful in achieving their gaol and retired they always think to go back to their young age and still want to enjoy their life . the following sentence and example will further support my view . the younger people have always in a motivation to achieve their joy . they have the spiritual power and physical strength to reach their enjoyment . as they have n't seen the world a much a old people do they always look for some new idea and try to enjoy in what ever they did a it their new experience . even though young age is the time to decide about their future they always take it a a challenge and try to build their way to sucess . a person always want to hide their age and feeling of getting old to make themselves look younger . i want to mention about an experience in my life . i happen to meet a really good old couple who adopted me a their daughter . i remeber asking them whether they like their old age or their younger life , they answered me like this `` we are not old by our heart , it only for our physical appearance '' and they always want to go back to their younger life and want to enjoy more than what they did . they even encouraged me by saying that young age is the only time where you can enjoy up to the maximum and after that you will have lot of responsibility to do . on an all a person will get old in the near future but never can come back to their young age . i always want to go to my child hood day and play alot with innocent mind . so every stage in our life ha it own experience and enjoyment where we want to go back to experience it again . all of these stage young age is the best age to enjoy your life so i will enjoy my teenage life now .
