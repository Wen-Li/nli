the topic herein hold great importance a it ha to deal with the youth , future mentor of any society . i believe that the young people these day are not giving enough time to develop and upbring their community . the young generation ha become much more careless towards their community a they are already so occupied with several other thing which are of more importance to them . firstly , the increasing competition to earn a better living ha taken away all their extra time that they would have devoted in heping their community . these young people are focussing these day on the need of earning a better living , better education , better standing in the society and all the other related thing . secondly , with the increasing property rate , food cost and price of other daily living need , these people have become more money minded . hence , instead of giving free time for the upliftment of their community , they can devote that time either to earn some extra buck or to enjoy life with what they already have . the time given for community may not yield any instant benefit to them , hence , the time is spent in an activity which will give them immediate result . thirdly , in the upliftment of their community , they may also have to spend some money alongwith time , which make them bit more reluctant to indulge in any such activity . these day , such activity can be related to charity and if someone ha lot of money , the area of donation . lastly , i feel that the young generation nowadays are trying to adapt to the new economic situation which ha a lot of significance for leading their future life and creating a good environment for the future generation . they are a part of the changing world which ha changed a lot over a period of time and is changing constantly with a faster pace . hence , all their time is taken away by the activity with which they survive in this changing socio-economic world .
