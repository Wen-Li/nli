i do not fully agree with the statement that it is better to have a general knowledge over a specialized one . i believe this matter actually depends on wich stage of his/her career a person is and which his/her ultimate goal in professional life are . for starter , every person who initiate on a field of study should commence by assimilating the simple concept ; for example , an engineer , a person who is doing mechanical engineering and one who is studying aeroespace engineering will both study during the first semester the basic course of all the engineering carreers ; like : algebra , mathematics and physic . there is no way a mechanic can design a machine without understanding first the basic rule of physic . but this should not stop here , once the basic are built more detailed work need to follow to grow on knowledge . on the other hand , to have only people with broad or not specialized knowledge could lead to le development on society , it is crucial for a culture to have individual with a particular field of study , with focus in specific subject that can result on efficient solution to nowadays problem . that is why for example we need to have oncologysts , who are doctor that after completing their basic medicine school went beyond it to study on a deeper way cancer and way to treat and cure it . furthermore , if we take this subject again to the college environment , we will see that the concept of having first a broad knowledge to later specialize it is implied on the normal carreer path ; a person start with a broad degree , let say for example industrial engieneering , then after some good exposure to the work environment and experimenting with his/her preference , that person will pick a subject for a masters like manufacturing , then after more knowledge and practical exposure have been accomplished it is possible to go through a phd program which is even a more specialized vision of that particular path , in the case of our example manufacture of polymers research . in conlusion , i believe that the goal of every professional is to achieve certain level of mastery or specialization on the very subject that give passion to his/her life ; but , to acomplish so , it is crucial to acquire basic knowledge first that will provide the foundation for this development .
