i disagree young people nowdays do not give enough time to helping their communties , because of two reason . here are my reason . firs , if one person doe n't want to give his enough time to help other people that mean he is selffish . i jointed a interview process and new hired people training of my company . in my opinion , if there are two people at the siminar work position . the better man always be the one who pay more time to help other people . the god always help the one who love help other people . the one who love pay more time to help people . he will get the feedback of others . you never know when will other people feedback your help . once i worked in a local campany , but i always help people and do some volunteer work on patient group . till i want to work at a global company . some people help me to get interview and get a job at a worldwide famous company . give enough time to helping communtites not only give me peace , lovely feeling but also give me wild view to see the world . second , i can see the gap of salary in my country becomes biger and biger . this big gap brings some public security problem . the rich person affrid to be hostage , the poor people do n't have money to give their child well education . why do n't we give enough time to helping our community ? give the poor person help to educate , get work and resept . we will not have much more public problem . moreover we will feel happy and lovely . according these two reason , i disagree young people nowdays do not give enough time to helping community . young people are like sponge . what you teach them what you earn . moreover young people have to study and they have ability to care other community . give enough time to helping communtites is a win-win solution to make our world better and lovely .
