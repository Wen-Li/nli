there are two way to learn something , the first it is studing by heart and the second is to undestand the basic idea of the topic . i think that is better to lear the idea of a concept , and not to lear it by heart , although i think that studing a the first way it 's also important sometimes , it also depends on what a student have to learn . in my experience , i found more useful to understand instand of memorize some concept , for example take a mathematical topic . it 's pretty impossibile to apply some theorem or forumulae if we have not undestood what them are dealing about . mathematic it 's beautiful , because you have only to understand the concept , and after that apply all the rule that you have learned to a real problem . if a student study by heart these mathematical concept he will never be able to solve any problem that is n't but methodologic . otherwise , in my opinion , there are other concept that are very difficult to memorize only undesting their idea . an example my be a law topic , because student studing to became a lawyer , have to learn by heart many concept and many rule that they necessary need to know to make their future job , and not only to undestand what their are studing or what about is the paper that they are reading . in the end , i think that a person , or a student , doe n't have to make an absolute choice between `` understanding the idea '' and `` studing by heart '' , but he need to find the right tradeoff to get his culture performed and to improve a better his knwoledge .
