i dont ' agree on the following statement because it is essential for people to contribute to their society through volunteer work and youth in general , tend to be very active and motivated to offfer their help at any time . schools , university , hospital and many more present different task to encourage young people to help other people in their community through volunteering . for example , a person could volunteer to teach young child a non-native language , or others could organize a charity for the needy in their neighbourhood such a donating food , clothing , medicine and money especially during the holy month of ramadan . helping the environment can result in educating student the importance of recylcing and maintaning a healthy atmosphere to live in . we live in an age , where every person can be creative and can introduce new way to strenghten the bond between people and community work could do it , for instance the senior citizen need recreation so it is important for youth to find method of entertaining them a part of their dedication to help the socieities where they live in . students can also do their best to organize festival and gathering for child and the handicapped . everybody want to be part of a community that appreciates hard work and the enthusiasm of young people ready to make a difference no matter where they live or how they think .
