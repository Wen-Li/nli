it is a must-have ! who of u ha not been influenced once by a photo or a spot that leaded him/her to buy a product ? i think everybody wa blended once in his life and bought something that wa not that good than he/she ha supposed . in my opinion this is a normal trick by the marketing section of the company letting thing look better than they really are . but why do they do this ? the cause is that if you want to sell a product that you have designed or produced you want the attention of everyone for that product . it should be a must-have for the whole world . this is only possible when it is praised a a phaenomenal thing . because now the people are attracted to that and want to buy it . what could be more distinguishing than having a product that could work perfectly but noone want to have it because it is suggested a a boring thing in an advertisment . showing product a very interresting should work better for rising your selling number and that is what it is all about - selling thing for a higher profit . an other thing is that you must have a more specialized product that the other company have because noone would recognize yours if it is not supposed to be the best . a problem with making produkts ` shine ' is that these untruth information should not be too extreme because this lead to a bad picture of the producing company and the people that had made a wrong decision because they beliefed in the advertisement are not willing to buy future product of that company making thing better is a normal way of selling but the suggested information of the advertisement should not be so far away from the truth because this will not help you in the future .
