i disagree with the presented statement . i think it is better to have an specific knowledge about an academic subject than having a wide range of academic knowledge . to underline my opinion i would like to refer some argument and example . first , i would like to refer my own experience when i wa studying law at university . there wa a mass of student that started with me in my first semester . about 300 student had for several year the same course , so we were all taught the same general subject . there wa no difference between the student , though the number of student wa so high . is it possible that 300 people like to be taught in the same way ? this wa something that disturbed me very much . in order to get rid of that academic unity i refused to listen to each lecture and started to read book on subjcts i wa interessted in and got specialised by myself . second , you have to keep in mind that you need to get a job . i think most of the job are very specialised and you will need certain skill and knowlegde to get your work done . this is why you have to specify in one or two subject before . then it would be to late for you to specialise . a a result you have to conclude , that it is better to specialise early in order to get a good job . third , of course i have to admit that there are so many thing that are interessting to be dealt in class . in that general way it is granted that you also learn about thing you were not interested in ( yet ) . perhaps you find out more about other subject , that you did not get in contact with , because you were specialised . but neverless i would like to prefer to specialise myself and pay it tribute not to get into touch with other more general topic . i think when you are really interested in art , music or anything else you can still read book about that or occupy in any other way yourself with general topic in your freetime .
