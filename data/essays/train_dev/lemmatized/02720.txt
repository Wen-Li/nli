i agree with that it is more important for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact . first , student must learn what it is meaning . they totally understand the definition , concept and the idea . for example , if a student doe not know the definition , he or she could not prove the theorem . he or she could not combine the two different problem to solve . if it is not known what the plus mean , it can not be said one plus one equal two . second , knowing the reason or reason , show the path that go the fact . students always seek the reason beyond what they see . only the learning the result doe n't enough . they have to ask where is this coming from ? i think , to do something important we expand our vision and dig deeper than ever . we would expose undiscovered thing only when we do n't limited ourselves with the given fact .
