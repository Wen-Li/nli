i agree the idea that it is more significant for student to understand idea and concept than to learn fact . first of all , many of the student would prefer the easier and quicker way of understanding . understanding idea and concept is easier for a student to manage the information . if a student learns a new thing , she or he would first ask the idea and concept of the thing to realize the condition of the new information . this way always seems more practical to the student . i also would prefer this way , since understanding the main idea by explaining both idea and concept would make me understand more easily . facts are longer and harder way for most student . since learning a fact contains many detail in itself , it would be more complex for a student . learning fact also take longer period than it doe in understanding idea and concept . this is mainly because of it complexity . if i would be introduced to a new topic , and given the specific information by learning fact , it would take me longer and harder to learn that topic . because i have to analyze the fact first and then the related thing that effect the fact . however , to understand idea and concept would supply me in realizing the new topic by giving specific information by idea and concept .
