one of the most difficicult choice that a man ha to front every day of his life is about when taking risk is useful and when it is n't . i think that taking danger is important to reach an obiective but it must be done with intelligence , because acting without the control of the situation could be very dangerous . for example i would n't go on the top of a mountain if i were alone and if i had n't the mean to complete my adventure . i think that sadly a lot of people front the risk in a way like this , for example choosing to invest their money in financial action , whithout having any information about them , or because adviced by bank of other institute , which give to client information that he doe n't understand at all . obviously , on the other hand , there are people that remain fixed on their way of living and fronting situation and this is not good at all . in fact , whithout taking any sort of danger , how can they think to have the possibility to extend their knowledge to aspect that are not properly the one they are used to ? in a working contest this way of thinking ca n't lead them to discover anything , while people who take some more risk could find better way to complete a process or they could achive new tool for their activity . i think that the first way to live is more difficult but can provide much more satisfations than the other one , obviously if risk are taken always giving them the right weight . in fact this can help you to discover and accept more likely other opportunity , also completly different from the one you are used to . i think that people who behave like this are more likely to be open and so they probably gain more information then the other kind of people enriching their knowledge more rapidly .
