i agree with the successful people try new thing and take risk rether than only doing what they already known to do well . becouse ther are learn and try . the sienctiest are try to be successsful such that one of them wa discoverd the lamp in 1000 trying in tha last try he successed . he said that i did not fail 1000 time i just learn 1000 mistake . trying help u to leane and improve our self . the success will come with the hard working and trying . so we must try many time and learn from our mistake . but it is not why the people eho do what they known are not success . ther are also success .
