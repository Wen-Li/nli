i think that , the young people dont give enough time for helping their community . as the most people accept , the life ha changed considerably and this cause some change on people characteristic . the effect of this change can be seen on the issue of the helping the community . the following consideratoins can be accepted to a a cause of this change nowadays , young people dont have sufficient amount of time to deal with the social occurances . young people have to participate an educational institution and they have study for their course and this take a huge amount of time . for the sake of the success on the life , young people have to dealt with their education , after the school life , these people encounter a job life and again this period spends a too much time of people . as we see from this life condition , young people can not find enough time to take part in social activity and they try to participate more preferable activites in their free time , the second consideration is that the young people encounter a huge amount of competition at the recent time . as you guess , the high level of competition affect the thinking of the people and this make people to le aware to issue that about their community . in the school life and the job life , young people spend a big amount of effort to reach better position and this increase the selfish level of young people . these people only think abount better position , better education and finally more money and this is the opposite of the expected result . eventually , we can say that young people will be le involved in the issus about the social life at the future becuse of the recent life style . the people who lived in 1700 , le involved in education and the ecenomy . therefore , they were more involved in social activity , the level of the competition wa le at these year and so people respected more to other people and the issue that are anbout the community . we have to decrease the level of the competition and the working time in order to increase the involving level of the young people to issue about the their community .
