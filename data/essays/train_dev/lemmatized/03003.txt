people who try new thing and take risk are more successful than the other one because creativity , chance and work are the recipe to get success . people creative have most of the time idea more interesting and new than the other . to success in a domain you need to the first one or to be the better . for instance , when you open a shop you need to have a new concept to be the first one . in this case you create a new market . it 's harder for an artist the painting or reading must be totally new to be loved . who want to buy a product of all the day or see a painting already made ? but creativity is not enough to success . one important ingredient is taking risk . taking a risk mean go through the barrier imposed by yourself or by the society . the risk could be in anyone aspect of the life on different domain . for example , creating a new painting is be exposed to the judgement of people . opening a shop caused a financial risk for you and could imply your family . so the risk is enhanced when you have a family . but even if creativity and risk are linked one of the most important ingredient of this successful recipe is the work . without working the success is not guaranted even if you take risk or if you try new thing . of course you can succeed one time but we can measure the success only on period of time like the length of the life . you can have one mater-piece but it 's not really a success if you do n't have more than one . for a shop it 's the same . the first year could be really good but it 's not enough to judge of your success . the success of course need creativity and chance but it need beyond all of work . we can finally judge the success not only an action but more then on a life .
