nowadays when we see the movie on the tv we can see a lot of advertisement . generaly the adverdisements ha a connection with the sitcom or the movie , for example when we see a sitcom about a student life ( dawson , beverly hill ) the advertisement whose follow is the product for the student , and young people . the question is difficult because the goal of the advertisement is to catch the customer to buy the product and how the advertisement seem much better than they really are ? we can take some reason to answer to this question . first reason , in the most advertisement we can t see really the product we have for example two peolple whose kissing much better and the topic of this advertisement is to buy a car , i wonder what is the connection between the kiss and the car . secondly when you read your news paper there a lot of adverdisem ent not interesting . for example we have a picture of the lot of the men in the fuel appartement and just the name of the compagny we can t find the connexion it just to sell the name of the famous compagny . last reason the advertisement make the bad effect toward the child . when the child seated in front of his tv and when he see a advertisement with a fight or a gun , he want to do like the person of the advertisement . to contrast this reason we have most adavertisements to prevent to the people by teh danger of the car or the fire at home , in this case the advertisement make producs than they really are . finally i agree withs this statement because the bad effect of the advertisement is several and much dangerous for the child and for the young .
