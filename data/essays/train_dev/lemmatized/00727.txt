i think that a successful person is more focused on trying new thing rather than doing what he or she already know well . infact a successful person is a person who want to make the difference . let me explain . a successful person is a person who want to be different from other people ; he / she want to have some characteristic that can make him/her special in front of all other normal people . to do that , a succesful person ha to try new thing and not only to do what other people do every day . the history show u many example of men a woman that have changed the world by trying new thing . i 'm talking about inventor that , by doing new thing , ha introduced some important innovation . these men and woman had taken a lot of risk by doing that . the inventor that i admire most is marie curie , who developed the x ray technology . x ray technology is very important today . however , marie curie died because of intoxication caused by the big amount of x ray that she absorbed . without her sacriface , today we would't have one of the most important instrument to diagnose deseases and illness . however , i have to say that a successful person is a person that is able to take some risk only when risk are proportionated to the benefit carried by doing new thing . only a stupid person can take some big risk without the possibility to get some bigs benefit . for example , manager and brockers , who are the main actor of the financial world , try new thing ; for example they try to invest money and time in new area of the world or in new technology . they do thatt only when the risk connecetd to the financial operation is a big a the return of money waited .
