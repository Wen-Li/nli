last week i read an article in our daily newspaper about who enjoys life more , female or male . i considered about these piece of paper a very long time and came to the conclusion that it is more worth to distinguish between young and old people , than between female and male . but neverthelesse i am of mixed opionion concerning this question . one the one hand , you might get the expression that young people enjoy life more than older one if you observe from outside . but the onliest reason for that is , that young people live their life more active than older one . they try new thing , have fun whenever there is the chance to have and make their own experience in order to develope a personality . students for instance like to go to party or hang around at the beach playing soccer because they know , that in later professional life they will not have the chance to act like that . on the other hand older people have gathered a vast amount of experience during their life . consequently they do no longer feel any pressure to act like younger one . i believe that they also did have an active , excited life in their youth . but with a certain decrease in age , other thing like family , health or financial sercurity become more and more important for them . so in my state of view , they simple have a distict way of enjoying their life . they get their satisfaction by going for a healthy walk in the park or having a cup of tea with their husband or wife in the nice restaurant next to the beach . unfortunatelly these fact are invisble to people you observe from outside , so the wrong impression might come up that older people do not enjoy their life . all thing recommended , i would state that neither the young nor the older people enjoy their life more . both group ha it own way to enjoy their life . the youth often express more active while older people are satisfied by a calm and especially healthy life .
