when i think of tv commercial , catalog , and advertisement in a town , i certain agree that most advertisement make product seem much better than they really are . the purpose of advertisement is promoting the product ' sale . therefore , i think it is a natural sequence that advertisement try to make prtoducts seem better a much a possible . therefore , customer should be aware of the nature of advertisement and should carefully examine the product before purchase . however , this nature of advertisement ha become a growing concern today . it ha been for a while since catalog shopping started , and online shopping have been significantly increasing lately . customes can not look closely at or touch product before perchase on catalog and online shopping . if advertisement make product look too much better than they are really are , customer may regret the purchase when they have the product in their hand . i often see this situation happens around me . i think it relies on the marketing strategy and also moral of seller how much better advertisement are allowed to make product seem . sellers definetely should provide a detailed written information a possible other than `` a nice picture . '' sellers also may need to provide the information that customer often misunderstand about the product . sellers who are sincere about their product eventually attain customer ' trust , and become a winner in the field of product , hopefully .
