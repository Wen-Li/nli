i agree with the statement that successful people try new thing and take risk rather than only doing what they already know how to do well . i think success ha a great deal to do with factor of adaptation to the new environment , improvement of their own method and challenging spirit . people who have these factor tend to new thing and take risk . first , successful people try new thing and take risk to adapt the new environment . the environment around u ha rapidly changed recently . for example , the invention of internet make world borderless and email shortens the time to convey the information . under these circumstance , we have to adapt it to success . in order to adapt it , we should try new thing , or new environment , and take risk rather than only doing what they already know how to do well . for example , most related to the it industry are successful because they can adapt the new environment earlier that ordinary people . this is because they try to launce new thing which no one did n't . second , successful people try new thing and take risk to improve of their own method . i think that doing the same thing such a doing what they already know how to do well provides only the same consequense . there are no improvement and progress . in such case , we can not be success because success ha to do with something superior to otheres . in other word , even if the method are superior to others at one time , it is the same level or inferior to others for a while . for instance , ichiro suzuki , who is a major league baseball player , continues to seek the new butting method to improve it every year . needless to say , he is one of the most successful people . third , successful people tend to have challenging spirit . i think that it is important to do new thing . doing new thing brings u new skill and discovery . those lead to being success . in conclusion , i agree with the statement successful people try new thing and take risk rather than only doing what they already know how to do well for the main three reason stated above .
