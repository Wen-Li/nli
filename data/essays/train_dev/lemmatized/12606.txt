as going to the high technical world , you have many opportunity to attach various advertisement of product through the medium . besides , it is easy to recognize that most advertisement make product seem much better than reality , so sometimes most people do not believe inside advertisement fact . in my opinion , i agree with the following statement . there are three reason that i can mention , such a exaggerated fact , desire of audience to the advertisement , and result of best seller between product which formed by real fact , and other product which included some lie . first , most advertisement have exaggerated fact . for example , recently i have some problem with my skin , so when i watch the television or read some magazine , i am always fascinated some medicine to solve my skin problem . also , one day i watched miracl skin care product , but just few day after , i noticed that advertisement is using exaggerated way to attrat customer by getting real fact from my friend . after knowing real result of skin care product , i felt very disappointed . such these happens always exist around our life . in addition according to statistic of advertisement management department , most advertisement are exaggerated looking like beautiful , and efficient , even if there ha some rule how much company can add not fact in their advertisement . in addition , most customer have desire of the advertisement . the desire which is visually or attractive a way to present product cause that advertisement maker put more not fact . for example , if you watch the beverage advertisement , you can get colorful and beautiful scences , even though that is beverage . therefore , customer need to satisfy their desire of watch incredible advertisement even if that is not true . these fact affect symmetry between customer and advertisement maker . next , the result of best seller between product which formed by only real fact , and other product which included some lie help increasing amount of exaggerated advertisement . in fact , the product that include some lie or visual thing , that will be sold out in just few time . however , product which ha advertisement that formed by only real fact are not influenced customer to buy it . as look like ironically , customer need advertisement which is not fact , even though after buying product , they felt dissapointed . in short , these are three main point of supporting my idea that exaggerated fact , desire of audience to advertisement , and the result of best seller in mar
