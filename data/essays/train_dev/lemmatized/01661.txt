i do not agree that in twenty year there will be fewer car in use than today , because in western society there are a lot of resistences to the decreasment of car . first of all , the governmets and the car company do not support technological reserach on new mean of transport or on new type of car ( a electrical cears or hydrogen car ) . although some scientific research announce that petrol will finish in fifty yers or le , the car company continue to produce car and to sell them . besides , some government are supported by petrol company and so they had to defend the interest of these company . second , in a lot of developped country the government doe not implement the public transport service , so every person ha got one ore more car . third , the public opinion is not really interested in environmental problem . if people really fought against car pollution , government would have been obliged to develop other technology . in conclusion , i think that untill petrol resource are avaliable , the use of car will not decrease . only when petrol company really finish to expolit all petrol , and that could last a century from now , other technology will be introduced .
