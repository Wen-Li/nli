i do agree with this statement cause i studied business administration and i know that if you want to insert a new product in to your market you can not just sell a normal regular product that you just invented , you have to sell the salvation the their need , you sell a solution you sell something they have been desiring for all their life . that 's why is so important to show the product is defferent escenarios , to show example of how this product improved these people 's life and therefore invite the potential consumer to take the step of improve their own life . in marketing you learn three thing for any product that you want to launch to the market . product , place , price and promotion . for example , is important to be aware of the visual part of the product , is necesary to show that the first impression is the adecuate one , also that this product contains all the expectation of what the customer requires for their need . the place is also a master peace of this marketing strategy because you have to see which is the type of consumer you want to sell , either is to a very high educated class or to the non-smokers or whorever is the choise . youa have to find the right spot . in matter of price the product ha to be balance the cost of the good with the benefit that will bring the costumer , the relevancy of this point can lead to the success of failure in the market . it is highly recomended to make a deep study of the market you want to reach and ask then how much would they pay for these type of product . at the time you want to make the promotion of this product you really need to see wich is the channel you want to use for this , either is the tv or newspaper , wherever is the place you have to make sure that the product you are trying to sell will take the attention of the consumer you are trying to catch . that 's why sometimes the advertiser play very much with the emottions of the consumer and lead the people to beleave more thing about this product than they should .
