advertisements are everywhere : in the street , at work , at home on tv and on the radio . they intend to make product seem good and cajole the consumer into buying their product . however sometimes advertisement make product seem much better than they really are and betray the consumer . first , one should not forget that the purpose of an advertisement is to show the bright side and the advantage of a product . for instance a car company will show in it advertisement how fast it car is or how safe it is . however the advertisment will not mention intentionally the drawback of the product . the fact that this last proposal would sound ridiculous to anybody highlight the fact that we are all aware of the purpose of an advertisement . therefore if one advertisement insists on the velocity of a car it may not speak about safety because this is not a important characteristc of the car . it then appears that most advertisement doe not lie , however they only show the high skill or advantage of the product and sometimes it can make the product seem much better than it really is if the consumer doe not consider the possibiliy of drawback . moreover , some advertisement do not only lack information on possible default of the product , but they intend to make the consumer forget all those default by emphasizing so much on the quality of the product . there are many way to hypnotise the consumer . for instance some advertisement would repeat an incredibly large number of time the same moto , which generally say `` this product is the best '' or `` you ca n't be happy without this product '' . this is nearly lying since they the company generally can not prove it product is the best , maybe the more sold but not the best . a lot of advertisments for cleaning product are based on this principle . they compare the efficiency of their product with an `` unknown '' product , but we no nothing of this `` unknown '' product . thus in this case it is not difficult to be the best . in conlcusion , a lot of advertisement take advantage of the consumer ' naive belief and make product seem much better than they really are . their purpose in this case is not only to show the good aspect of one product but to incite the consumer to buy one product he doe not need or he doe not know about .
