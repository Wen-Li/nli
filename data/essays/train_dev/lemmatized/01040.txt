i belive that in 20 year the use for car will decline because there will always be new technology , more safer way to trave , and new fuel source . if you look closely in history , you will see that man ha always been trying to find better substitus to what he ha and for that reasone people are riding car now . for example , long ago people used to walk for transportation but thought that it wa n't practical so after much looking around they started riding domesticated animal , after that they began to try and travel in group the answer wa the envention of the carages , later on they began to find other mean of faster transportaion which ended in the envention of car . it 's true that car are fast and reliable but their are not safe enough . car accident might be extreamly damaging or fatal for that people started to make rule for riding car like buckeling setbelts , not leting child sit up frond , and sitting in the right position . although there are rule most people wo n't go by them and try to `` do it '' their way , so a safe mean of transportaion must be found . in today 's world fossiel fuel is the most important resource , many machine depend on them like car , plane , and train . if you look at my first reasone , new technology , you will see that because of it human will find another form of fuel , like cold fussion , to use other than fossiel fuel because it pollutes the atmospher and case disease like cancer . in conclusion , i think that car are going to be use le in the next 20 year becaus there will be a much safer , more hi-tech , and nature friendly mean of transportaion .
