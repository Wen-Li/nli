the best way to travel will depend on the particular character , personality and need of each person . however , when you are traveling in a group led by a tour guide you can miss the most real important thing from the place you are visiting . having a tour guide will defnitly take you to the most ` common ' area and you will be able to have a picture of yourself infront of the most known place in the world , nevertheless this you can also have doing a photomontage and placing yourself where ever you want to . what it really give value to a travel and what it make worth it to visit a new place is the people and the new cultural difference they can show and share with you . the people is what build a specific society and the people is the one that give the specific place it own personality , either shown by a building or even also shown by their particular dish . there are many example of the new wonder you can find if you really are willing to talk with the local . however there is not enough time to have several example to share , therefore let take one specific country like germany . this example can be narrow even more taking one of the area like the baden-wuttemberg . this area is known more to have the very famous castle known for almost everybody , the cindirella castle . disney wa taking this castle a his most importan logo and practicaly importilized it , and now it is being visited by people all around the world . however once you are there , eventhou the sight is beautiful and the walk to the inside of the castle show a very nice passage , there is almost nothing else to see there and almost no time to enjoy it since there is too many people on a queue infront of you and behind you . in the mean time you are loosing the great oportunity of visiting other castle , even nicer one in a more calm way . the food is another very good argument why it is better to travel by yourself and giving yourself the chance to relate with the local people . it is amazing but no matter where you go , you will find a mcdonalds . if you are with a tour guide and there is time , maybe he/she will take you to a very expensive restaurant and most probably will not have the typical meal of the area . on the other hand if there is no time and the tourist guide consider that there is not enough time , and let emphazise on the fact that this tourist guide is the one making the decision for you , there will be a high probability of having the famous hamburger mentioned before . if you take the time , the local will really appreciate it , you may even be lucky enough and have a meal at grandma place . there is nothing more delicious than that . there are many reason to say why it is better to travel by your own , which doe not mean to travel alone , than to travel in a group lead by a tour guide , but self experience will determine it at the end and it will give you the true reason to choose between them . if i have to choose , i will defnitly always try to have my own trip with my own itinerary .
