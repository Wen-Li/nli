i disagree with the statement , that it is better to have wide knowledge of many subject than to specialize in one specific subject . i believe that jack of all will never be master of none . broad knowledge over many subject will never make any person perfect . in the competetive world people are preferred with specialiation rather than with out any specialiation . broader knowledge in many subject is good but one should have specialiation in his major , so that he can find a good career in the particular subject . phd is the high academic degree , and those with phd 's are very specialised in a particular subject . they are considered to be the expert in that particular field . they have wide oppurtunities due to their expertise . most of the higher degree require to do a specialisation in a particular subject . it is because to make the student perfect in that particular field which will help him to build a good career . in the world most the discovery and invention are made by the subject expert , who have a good knowledge in the particular field of invension . all these invensions are possible only because of their specialization . usually in schooling we will be learning many academic subject to get familarize with them and to know in which subject we have interest . later we will be choosing interested subject and will do a specialisation in that particular subject . all the company require expert in particular field , a person having a broader knowledge in various subject will not be considered a a competent person for a particular job . i believe getting a broader knowledge in various subject is very difficult , and more over it will not fetch even . most of the university are preferring to produe student with higher degree who hava a specialisation . this indicates the importance of having a specialisation . in conclusion i believe a specialisation in particular subject is very much use ful for career and ultimately for the beterment of life .
