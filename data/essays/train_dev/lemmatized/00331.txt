this is a very diplomatic statment to say that the usage of the car would be decresec in the future . as the generation change took place , the comfort and the benifits also ha been incresed in the mordern society , so i would strongly condemn that the saying of number of car would be decresed in the course of next twenty year . there might be many adverse environmental consequeses due to vechuliar emisson of harmful gas and finding short of the resoureses of the petrolium product , but all these would not stop the usage of car in the mere furture . since , a the technology improves soures also will improve , and the next generation car would be battery operated or bio car . this would be best substitute of the car which are running today . the other main purpose for which , the number of car would be incresing that , the population on the earth is incresing day by day , it would be very much difficult for the mass transporation to transport a many a people who are there , therefore many people would be having an eye towards the car which would lean them towards it . in this fast growing society , car do play a major significant role , a they do be very helpful for quicker transpotaion , because time once lost can not be regained , and for the world twenty year from now , time would play a very prominent role . their are many experiment going on now to make the very best battery operated and bio gas car , which would would become a major resource for growing up the usage of car in the future . by using this type of car their many advantage like a we disscused the faster mode of transportation , which not only improves one only status but improves the whole economic development of the country . because to compete with the development of the country the citizen should be using their time to the fullest . and the other one is pollution free environment , which is very much important now due to gobal warming coming a a major consequence in the nature . in addition it really very hard to any citizen to wait for government mass transoptation , who is in an emergency , or planning to go for picnic with his family member or so and would be perfering to have his own car than rely on any others . the only thought which brings u to the conclusion that in the next twenty year the number of car would be decresed is the problem of pollution , traffic conjuctions , or scracity of petrolium product , but their are many alternative which have been taken a substitur to these problem . and usage of the mordern improvisation in this aspect would capture the imagination of the nation for the alternative use . and these have been proved through analysis of the last 2-3 year in most of the the part on the world . so , i would finally would say that the number of car usage would not decrease in the future but , the way in which usage would be changed , which would be very freindly scenario .
