in my point of view a a social worker , i disagree that it is better that people should learn and study a much and broad knowledge a they can . instead , i think people should specialize in one specific field . here are my reason . to begin with , each person ha a special talent and habbit which he / she is perfect than others . it is important for u to let every people excert their abilitis who only he / she ha . take my sister a an example , my sister like play guitar very much . but in my famiy my parent always think and put a strong emphsis on that child should spend all their time to study and it is secondary for child to learn others such playing music . from that time , my sister always live a hard time because she did not like studying all day long and she also again and again get a bad grade . by constant communicating with my parent , they finally knew that mabe it is a better choice letting my sisterplaying guitar instead keeping studing in addition to person 's the special talent and habbit , efficiency is also an important thing to our society and it is important for u to let our society more efficient . finally , the concept about that people should kow much and broad knowledge can avoid wasting the social resource . and then we can use the rest resource such a money to do other thing . based above those reason , although the opinion of that it is better that people should learn and study a much and broad knowledge a they can maybe be reasonable and understandable , i agree that people should specialize in one specific field .
