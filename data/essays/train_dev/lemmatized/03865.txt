all of u go to a market to make our daily shopping , choose what we will buy among thousand of product . how do we decide what to buy ? first of all , everyday a new product appears in market , waiting for customer . the first problem in this process is how a customer would know that a new item is produced . if the customer doe not see any advertisement , either on magazine , billboard or tv , the his chance of buying this product is very low . advert'sments are the basic and most crucial way for a producer to reach a potential customer . but is just a good advertisement enough to sell a product ? especially in recent year , advertisement is the most important tool used to make a product sell more . nearly all people who like the advertisement of an item or service decide to try it at once . this is the border an advertisement can reach . nobody continue to brush his teeth with an bitter toothpaste because he liked the advertisement of that one . for further sale , the product must be not just be good enough but also fit to need of the person who bought . everyday we complain about the item we used , think about how better they would be . it is impossible to design an item that would fit need of everybody in a society . none of the textile producer can make an cloth which fit body in all size . like a textile product , it is not possible to make an advertisement which everybody like . it will most likely cause some new buyer to appear a well a make some already buyer to stop buying . to sum up , an advertisement only help in the introduction part . we can not disregard the increasing importance of advertisement , but a good advertisement can not guarantee the continuing sale of a disasterous product .
