there are people who suppot the idea which most advertisement make product seem much better than they really are , and the others not support this idea . i would say that i agree with this idea that most advertisemnts make product seem much better . in following discussitons , i would like to explain the reason with some example . firstly , in japan , i have heard news that some people died because of using to reduce weight pill . recentlly , over weigt problrem is getting bigger in japan too . many prople want to reduce thier weight in easy way . this company inported this pill from other country and advertised it all over the country . it say that some person could lose her weight 5 kg in two week or le than week . many people bougt it and some of them had really terrible result . i am not sure that pill wa main reason of their death , but i had heard that it work to blood pressure . so some of them effected badly . secondly , i like to go restrants or bar . i can choose several kind of food from the menu . i decide food , because it look so delicious and it also ha great amout in good price . however , when i see the real one , sometime i am desapointed . these food are totally defferent from menu , for example , amout of the food , taste and price . whenever i see it , i decide i will not come here agein . i understand company need to have more profit from their product . they have to make people to want to buy . the advertisement role important part of their profit . however , if they show their product much better than reallity , they will lose thier trust from not only customer but also their comoany assosiets . and they also lose their position in their field . finally , i would say that the advertisement should not make product seem much better than they relly are . companies make thier business in honest way . i think the more honest business the more good profit .
