both type of learning support have advantage and disadvantage . i will name advantage for both idea but in my opinion to understand idea and concept is more important than to learn fact . first , earning fact and event present the advantage of beeing imaged and more easily understandable . learning fact is possible at every age . it is strong material to link different notion altogether . but alone , it can only make the student status on a particular combinaison of factor at a particular time . for instance , let 's take invention : it is nice to have book where all previous discovery are referenced but it doe not help you open your mind and search for something else , it doe not create a challenge or a necessity . you just learn from fact not from their reason , meaning and solution . second , history and fact play a fundamental role on the civic aspect of an education . it help interaction a you always learn from the past experience . but doe it always impact and modificate someone 's behavior ? of course , on the one hand , practice and real life example are often poweful learning material and self-explanatory . but on the other hand , it not possible for a human beeing and consequently for a student to learn all fact whereas understanding the related concept would help him to face any type of situation . as a result , it becomes possible to take measure risk . the student becomes better prepared for both : his personal life and his career . the ` knowledge in youth is wisdom in age ' proverb well sum up my point of view . it is more important to understand the concept than to know their application .
