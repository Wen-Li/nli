knowing idea and concept form technique to understand a subject or topic . facts are true statement about the subject or topic . when it come to deciding which of these are better for indepth knowledge of a subject or topic , then i completely agree with the statement `` it is more important for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact . '' my opinion is influenced by certain factor which include ; need to analyse a topic to learn better , better rememberance of fact and having a grip on the topic so that new fact can be easily understood . when we think of learning , the first thing that come to mind is how to understand the content . to understand the subject , we need to analyse it content . for example , we are dealing with a fact that all matter is made up of atom . its very simple statement , but we must understand why it is so to appreciate the fact stated . here come the requirement for analysis . as we analyse the topic , we could also understand the need for stating this , which could be that we are studying the structure of some material say benzene . next we need to remember some fact of a subject . the example quoted earlier wa a simple logical fact . but , some complex fact like the einstein 's theory of relativity is not very easy to remember . it need understanding of the content to memorize the fact . without a proper understanding of the concept involved which made the scientist to propose the theory , it is just impossible to remember the fact propose a it is very complex . lastly , when we are learning something , it should not be mere memorizing of the fact stated , but , it should be a concrete base for furthur developmental study . in simpler word , learning something should be like a foundation to a building . the building could be a research or knowing newer fact to be understood . suppose , while experimenting , we make an observation , then without a understanding the idea of conducting the experiment and concept included in the process involved in it , we will not be able to conclude from the experiment . so , even to state a fact , understanding of idea and concept is imperative . in short , understanding of idea and concept will help u analyse the fact presented to u . besides , it also enables u to memorize the fact and other content of the subject . finally and most important of all these is that , without a proper understanding of the idea and concept , we will neither be able to understand nor conclude anything . so , understanding enables better learning that mere knowing of fact .
