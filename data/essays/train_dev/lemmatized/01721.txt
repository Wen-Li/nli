in twenty year there will be fewer car in use than there are today . i agree with this statement . the reason is simple . now there is too muche pollution . if we want to save the world we must reduce the pollution and one way is the reduction of the car in use . we must implement ecological alternative . earth is collapsing , too much pollution . one of the most important factor of high pollution is the presence of many car . car are becomed a mass way of transport and in many city it is used in the wrong way , for example one car is used only by one man instead of three or four . we must change that . it is not difficult . we must improve our behevior toward ecologic problem . one way for example is using public transport . by using pubblic transport there will bw fewer car in use . fewer car in use mean le pollution . i 'm sure that is one of the reason that there will be fewer car in use in twenty year . i see a world in the future with le car , le pollution , more attention to the environment . i can see happy kid in big city park , running and screaming , people with large smile on it face . may be it is only a dream , may be it is only a hope , it must be our future . changing way of life is difficult and it ha high cost but surely this is the straight way to follow .
