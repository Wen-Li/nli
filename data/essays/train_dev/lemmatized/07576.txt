i totally agree with this statement , although it is rather simplistic . i think in fact that it is true that most advertisement make product seem much better than they are , but maybe this is just due to the location of the advertisement ( for example a beach or a wonderful house ) or because of the short time they have to present the product , so sometimes a thing is shown really fast , when it is actually not . nevertheless i think that these are the only aspect that could be justified , but they are marginal aspect , not the core one . it is a shame to make something seem fabolous when it is absolutely not or when it doe not function at all . i believe that the medium company should avoid this kind of `` false advertising '' . many surround the product or the brand with fantastic characteristic , implying that the people who wear it or buy it are cool and special . i strongly believe that this is extremely dangerous for the young spectator , who are particularly sensitive to these aspect and have not a defined personality yet , so they are easily convinceable . moreover some could be dangerous even for adult : for example the advertisement on diet product , which are provided with false witnessing and interview , which explains how many weight they have lost in so little time . i am personally particularly against this type of advertisement , because it is no more a matter of buying a television or a fridge which doe not function , but rather a matter of health , which is much more important and ha to be avoided . in conclusion i think that the only function of advertisement should be that of making the consumer aware of the creation of a new product and not to overwhelm him with false and useless information , although the consumer should be however critic .
