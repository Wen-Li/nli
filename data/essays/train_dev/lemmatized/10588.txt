in my point of view , to travel in a group led by a tour guide ha two main advantage : - first , traveling a a group one ha the opportunity to easily meet new people which i consider a part of the fun to travel . the experience that is shared combined with the proximity in which are kept the member of a traveling group will render the exchange really easy among them . - second , when one travel , by definition , he doe not know what to see nor do in the place visited . a lot of people find it more convinient to take a tour guide rather than gathering this information from other source such a internet or travel book . the tour guide is generaly a local that , according to his experience , know depending on the amount of time his group ha , which site will interet it the most . although those two argument can be true , i disagree that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide . even though it is of course more easy to meet people within a group you are traveling with , the interest of traveling is to discover the culture of the place visited . the best way to achive this is to travel alone and therefore be motivated to go and meet local people . those personal exchange teach a lot about a local culture and can create long lasting link between people . also following a tour guide ha more inconvinients than advantage . first , you can not choose what you want to see , this choice being taken by the tour guide . with the information now available there is multiple cheap source that can let you decide what to see and do . second , unfortunatly , even more in some foreign country , the tourist are only considered a a possible source of money . therefore , very often the guide will be partly paid by local building , shop , restaurant , ... to make you come to their place although they are of minor interest . in conclusion , i would recommand to travel alone without a tour guide .
