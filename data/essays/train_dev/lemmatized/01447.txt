in general , to master of lot academic subject is a good way to have a broad knowledge and might have a good carrier starting in the future . so many people like to broaden their knowledge in taking many academic subject , but others do not want to . i prefer to make more subject to advance my knowledge for a few reason . first , it is not a knid of easy to enter a university , once entering a university , it provides a good chance to get more subject than others cnnot have a chance to enter the university . if you take more subject you would become more respomsible and more organize the timing . i took many subject on the same semester so i make a wise schedule for myself , and i fell kind of satisfiy by myself . thus , i think it a good way to take more subject to broaden knowledge . second , i could advance by meslef in other object and help people in taking more subject , for example , i do not need to take a course of medical beacuse i am major in agriculture , but i encourage myself to brave to take it , and then , my roommate got a bacteria infection in the midnight and i immediately to get a right medicine to help her to reduce the pain and then sent her to the hospital . miracially , i finally became a nurse because i love to help people and make them good healthy . for all of that , i do not mean my though wa totally right , but i really enjoy and happy by myself in taking lot subject in university . it is a good way to obtain knowledge and have a productive life .
