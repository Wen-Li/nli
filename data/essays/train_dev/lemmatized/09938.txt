the issue statement state that there will be a decline in the number of car in the next twenty year . i strongly disagree with this statetement . moreover i think that the number of car being used is going to increase in the near future . first reason i would like to give is that the cost of car is going to decrease gradually . if you obsereve the past trend previously it used to be a luxury to posse a car . but now it ha become a necessity . also the cost of car when compared to the past rate is very low now . hoping that the the same trend continues in some 5 or 6 year even the common man will be able to afford a car . so everybody will be rushing to own a car and hence the number will rise exponentially . second thing is that car are thought to be more safer when compared to other two wheeler . this feeling is gradually spreading in country like india where the two wheeler dominate the road . if this notion becomes stronger present two wheeler owner will replace them with car and again the number of car will increase . third idea is that car can transport many people at a time when campared to bike and scooter . so these bike or scooter owner also will be trying to purchase car . also a the price of petroleum product are going to increase people will think of spending money on car and have combined transportation rather than investing on individual tranportation mean such a two-wheelers . last but not the least many people thik that owning a car is a kind of prestige issue . in this modern world where people are constantly trying to show off it wont be a surprise if more number of car are purchased . hence in the near future more number of car are going to land on the road throughout the world
