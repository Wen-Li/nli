life is so diverse , that a much a a person learns throughout his/her life , there is always more . there doe not exist a limit for learning , and new discovery and creation pop up daily in our everyday news , growing in a parallel mode with the ever imrpoving technology . as a matter of fact , a successful person is not one who know a lot , but one who know how , when and where to apply his/her knowledge in the best way available . a person who ha mastered something ( x ) he/she doe , is automatically better qualified to do and improve ( x ) than someone who ha never seen or heard about it . each human being ha specific characteristic and environmental culture that bound his/her ability of the thing he/she ha learned . sometimes , these limit are highly disadvantageous , yet they would not make this person specifically unsuccessful , because with the right knowledge at one specific task , he/she can sublime in a way even the best educated person on the globe could not . on the other hand , trying new thing and taking new risk are very important in today 's world , but it doe not yet make it more successful a person who doe it than one who doe not . in fact , innovation and risk should always be tried for newly developed idea and for the person to improve his/her skill and learn about most thing a little . this concept is very well illustrated when compared to how the agricultural revolution evolved a an example . imagine if a farmer would have to plant all type of fruit and vegetable , that at the end would barely be sufficient for his family survival in contrast to every one farmer specializing in a specific fruit or vegetable and than barter and trade with the others . like that , each one farmer would definitely profit more with the specialization , and a a result also consume the best quality good altogether . this show that sometimes it is also benefitial to specialize in a specific ability to have the best result , because if everyone would like to do everything by himself the world would not go on . now again , this doe not mean that having some overall knowledge would be harmful . in conclusion , a successful person is a rather relative term . because success can be attained with hard-work and loyalty to a goal . no matter the amount of risk and innovation taken , specializing yourself can be equally granted . have you ever imagined if professional athlete stopped playing basketball , football , or baseball , would they still be successful ?
