it all dependswath enjoy life mean for people , live or live in excess , a much the better . i belive that young people enjoy life if that is go to park or beach and practice extreme and dificult sport . young people can stay late at night , drinking or dancing but the also can wake up early in the morning and go to work . they do n't have limit in how much risk and danger they take . much young people receive economic support from their parent and that give them more time to enjoy . parents always try to give their kid the life style they never enjoy . the society and the process of evolution in technology give also an advance to joung people for experience new way of enjoy life . young people do n't focus to much in the future , they just want life and enjoy the present . in the other hand is the old people who is feeling the weight of life in their body . even if they take care well of their body , older people ca n't practice sport or social life from long period of time . somentimes thats not really important because everything in excess is bad . older people see life from other pont of view . they do the same than joung people but not in the same intensity . they discover the beauty of life and develop the quality of look for the detail . the detail give you the hability to recognize when someone or somenthing is special . seeing the quality versus quantity when you give or receive is an art that need to be cultivate . the precious reality in this situation is that everyone is going to experience at some point of their life both side of the human nature . i am a 37 year old male with a latin tradition . i love my lord jesus and believe that at this point of my life , i stay with the old people . i prefer quality versus quantity .
