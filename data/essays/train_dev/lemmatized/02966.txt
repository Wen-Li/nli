i disagree with the opinion that there will be fewer car in use that there are today . at time when there is a severe crisis of energy from fossil fuel , new invention for alternate energy are coming into being . use of cng gas a an alternate fuel ha already started in 3rd world country . bio fuel are considered to be a nice alternative but all these fuel alternative doesnt stop u from using a car ! . every man dream nowadays is to posse a car of his wish irrespective of the fact that there is a growing concern about the environmental hazard caused by the vehicle exhaust gas . some country are trying to reduce the individual usage of car by improving their public transport facility . at the same time corporates are busy in designing car which are more sleek , fashionable and fast only to attract more customer . with the increase in population and economy boost i think the usage of car keep on increasing day by day . solar car are coming a big way these day . with the increase of science and technology , newer technique to improve the efficiency , durability of car are being discovered . developing country like india and china with their booming economy might be responsible for an increased usage of car in future . even though these country doesnt posse enough knowledge base to produce more car comprising of new technology like solarfuels and biofuels , they might have the economic capacity to import the technology from country like us and europe . also with the increasing population and job opportunity people are very much concerned about the time factor . busy life are forcing people to be very punctual . cars being a personal thing can be used at any time and come in handy at the time of crisis . so a person who want to attend an important seminar would prefer a car instead of a public trasport system like a bus . hence i am of the opinion that the usage of car keep on increasing for the time to come .
