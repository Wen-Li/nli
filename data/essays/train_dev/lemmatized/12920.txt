i agree with the statement wich say it is more important for student to understand idea and concept than learn it a fact . also , i think they have to learn how to use the idea in thier life not to deal with it a fact . there are many reason support my opinion . first of all , when a student deal with the idea a fact he will be not able to use the idea in his real life , and he will be act with it like fact with out understanding . for example , when i learn some idea in the chemistry lap i feel interesting and i can use the idea in my life . on the other hand , when i study some idea in my book without understanding the concept , i feel boring and i feel that i cant use it in my real life . secondly , when you study some idea without understand the concept will do very bad in the test . let me explain to you , my friend ali just memorized the idea a fact and he did not understand the concept , when he took the final test he did very bad and he did not pas the subject . thirdly , many researcher prove that knowing the concept help you to understand the subject more than deal with it a fact . becuase when you understand the whole idea you can imagine how doe the theory work . in conclusion , we can say that understanding the idea or concept is more important than deal with it a fact . so , when you understand the entire concept it is easy for you to use it in your life also it will be easy to unerstand how doe the theory work and you will feel enjoyable when you study the subject . many people think in thier that learn idea a fact is more important , but i think my opinion is the right one .
