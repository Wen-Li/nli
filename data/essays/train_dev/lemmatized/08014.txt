by many experience that i have had when i travel , i have learn that there are to kind of traveling . some time you go with your family and whant to have a nice time . and some time you just travel with some friend or your own . i really enjoy traveling with my sister and other menbers of my family . but this kind of trip are the one that you wake up early , and go tothe musseun or to any historical place . this kind of treeps is when you will like to have a tour guide with you . the one owhere you enjoy time with your family in a healthy way , and also learn alot from them . there is also the trip that you plan with ypur friend . you do not whant a tour guide with you in this trip , this are the anventures one . the one that you do not even have a place to sleep until u get there , the one that you go and just party , the one that you do not learn anythim from them , and just remember have of the think you did there . this summer i whent to costa rica with some friend , we had the trip of our life . something that you will never forget , an experince that is going to be with you wherever you go . and laf tabaut all the stupid think you did while you were drunk . i just love this kind of trip . but i cant tell you if i agree or disaggree with the statement you are giving me . is all in the experience you will whant to have , and what you will whant to remenber about that trip . if you want to go in a nice trip with your family i will get a nice and good tour gide . but if i am going just with my friend , i will just go with out a tour gide . ps : the repetition on paragrahp # 3 , i put it there because i like how it sound , is not an error . i learn that methot in my art of the essay class .
