advertising consists of convincing potential customer that a given commodity or service ha some positive quality that make it worth buying . in some case the advertised feature of the product either exist or not . for example , it is relatively easy to verify whether a claim stated in a commercial that - under some condition - a car run on some amount of gas per 100 kilometer can be true or not . in this case advertising can make the commodity seem better than it is . however , to my knowledge , these form of advertisement are mostly forbidden in developed country , since they essentially represent scam . in many - perhaps most - other case , the quality claimed in a commercial can not be univocally defined a true or faulse . for example , a company could advertise a drink it market a , say , the `` drink of the coolest people on earth '' . in itself , this statement mean nothing and can not be verified . however , if the advertising campaign is well designed and a number of people accept the view that drinking that specific drink make you `` cool '' , then advertising - to some extent - creates the feature it claim . in such case , advertising change the product itself and is part of it . that is , a given item without advertising is in fact a different product than the otherwise identical item which ha been advertised . therefore i would not agree with the statement that advertising make product seem much better than they are in fact .
