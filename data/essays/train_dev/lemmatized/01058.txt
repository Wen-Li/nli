despite the fact that each people ha his own way of learning and understanding , in a general point view , i think that best result can be obtained by focusing on idea and concept . that doe not mean , however , that fact should never be dealt with . the best way is certainly finding a compromise between the two approach . ideas and concept are , to my opinion , the most important part of learning , like the foundation of a building which is growing bigger and bigger . theory is the first brick you can build on . moreover , idea and concept tend to be universal - i think a good theory is evaluated to it degree of universalism . in a way , we could say that theory precedes the fact in that it aim at explain , and sometimes predict them . therefore learning and understanding idea and concept is important because it permit to think from a general point of view , without being tied by circumstancial condition for instance . it give student ability to adapt to a broad range of situation . on the other hand , i think it is not possible to only rely on theory . facts must be used to endorse - or refute - theory and , to my mind , theory alone is worth nothing : everyone can build theory but we should be only interested in one that have direct link to observable fact , one that use those fact to give more credibility to the general statement they posit . facts are essential in testing theory since they represents what ha actually happened which give them strong credibility and thus they are key element of a theory 's validation . as a conlusion i would say that both are importants - idea and concept on one hand and fact on the other hand - because they are part of a general process , they do not exclude each other and one without the other is worth nothing . however , i think there could be a chronological aspect : it would probably be more effecient to work on idea and concept before dealing with fact .
