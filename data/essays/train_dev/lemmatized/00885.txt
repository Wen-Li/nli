i totally agree with the statement of `` young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their community '' . why i agree with this point of view , and how do i feel about it ? i think there would be some good reason for getting young people nowadays can be more invoed with their community . first of all , i think why the young people nowadays do n't like spending time with their community , because in the morden day a we are now , there are lot of interesting thing and place that young people prefered to take . such a video game , internet , travelling , and meeting new friend these are the reason that take lot of time from the young people nowadays than the young people at the past-time . another main point i think will be the industry revolution . in the past time they need a lot of body work that mean everyone have to get involed their community to help each other . but at nowadays , we are living in an very different form of life than the early day . that everyone just have to take care of their own life and no need to rely on the others . how is it effect to our nowadays community by the young people do not give enough time to helping ? i think it affect in many way of our socity . one the main effect , i think , is the relationship between people live in community . as the result of this problem the relationship get colder and colder between each others . so i think if we can encourage the young people to helping their community in many different way that will bring people close of their community . people will start knowing each other and helping each other , and it can also help the young people to do more valueable thing than just waste their time on the other thing .
