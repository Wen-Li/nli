a broad knowledge of many different subject give you the ability to face much more situation , understand them and how they inceract , make you more flexible and give you a more complete view of the world urrounding . a specific knowledge allows you to interact in the best way possible with one subject , but your scope is limited to it . personally i prefer to have a broad knowledge , because the world is n't a serie of sealed room , so the ability to deal with more than one situation is vital . a too specialized competence laks in the whole-view , fourthermore it hold you in only one context .
