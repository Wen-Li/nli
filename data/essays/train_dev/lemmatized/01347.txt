i would disagree with this statement for many reason , main reason that are to be explained in the following essay . first of all , i believe that concept and idea are barely understandable if there is no fact to illustrate them whatsoever . indeed , let 's take pavlov 's animal conditionning concept saying that you could make anyone make anything simply by making him repeating the task that you want him to achieve everyday , several time a day . well without his experiment , you could n't think that it 's actually true , however the concept could have made you think that it wa applicable to anyone , however , scientist have proven that it 's not this simple , regarding human in particular . besides , fact allows you to set `` real '' reference to your belief , reference you could keep for the rest of your life . this `` real '' part is another drawback that make concept le important for student . simply because a concept is an overall general idea about one topic or common acknowledgement to something theoritical , it make it lose it sense to a student 's eye . you need proof and fact to build your opinion . this is what we call the proof by evidence . a fact can not be a concept since it 's too singular , however , to me and to many student , a concept is nothing without fact . if we talk about the relativity concept established by albert einstein few decade ago , it still undergoes a lot of controversy and is still being tried to be broken down . finally , according to history , because fact make people moving on more than concept , they are more important to a student 's eye . for a long time , everybody have been knowing the concept or idea that energy waste could result in serious consequence for our earth , everybody ignoring it and not taking a seriously a it should have been taken . nowadays , the alarm ha been triggered because of fact happening such a weather issue , environment concern . .. probably too late . to conclude , fact have proven their efficiency more than concept , and this is the reason why i truly believe that they are more important than them .
