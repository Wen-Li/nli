`` in twenty year there will be fewercars in use thanthere are today '' . i agree with this following statement , there may be people use le car now they are using . because each and single person buying a new car for his own travelling , in this way each and single person use one car it may crowed in the road . and traffic joms may happen . it is very risk to clear the traffic . after some day when the people want travel in single they use public mass transport . so that people will not to pay intrest to buy a car . there are some othere reason are there that in few more year the people can not use car . in that one is that , in the prasent day the petrolium rate are growing by every year . this is also one of the reason that the number of car used is also decrease . how it influence is , if oil rate increase the maintanence of the car is more . so that the common people not intrested to buy the car . and another reason is we can not made petrolium product artificially . these are availlable ground . but mass usage these petrolium product also decreased . but we can provide artifical fuel . to make these artificial fuel are more costly then natural fuel . this also make that buying the car in future is decrease . from the folloing reason we can conclude the in few year there will be le car in use than there today used .
