i do not agree with the statement . this can not be said . because i think that every age ha it own taste . so everyone at every age can enjoy life . but this is related about being pessimistic or obtimistic . what is enjoying life . what is the meanning of this . this chance people to people . for me enjoying life mean being happy . and to fell happy there are a lot of reasson . but if u try to be unhappy u can do this it is very easy . if u are young that mean your body let 's u do a lot of thing that u want to . because u have more energy . u can make sport , go out with your girlfriend , go a lot of entartainments etc . .. u can do whatever u want illegally . and all of these make u happy . also young people have not much responsibility . and they feel the life endless . when u get older the taste that u get from life chance . if u have a wife that u love , if u have good son and dougters u are the most happy person in the world . u get happy with the good thing that happen to your son or dougters . your vife 's worm hand make u happy . beside all of these if u have grandchild and if they like u that make u happier . maybe u have not the same energy a u were young but now u have more reasson to fell happy . so we can not say youn people enjoy life more than older people and we can not say older people enjoy life more than young people . every age ha it 's own beauty . everything is in your brain , if u teach it to enjoy life it always enjoys life in every age . so be honest to yourshelf whatever your age is raise your head u can see a lot of thing will make u happy ,
