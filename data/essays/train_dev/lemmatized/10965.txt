i strongly agree with the statement `` young people enjoy life more than older people do '' . young people enjoy a lot than older people . even older people not have patience to enjoy . the young people enjoy their work also but not the older people . as the older people are too week they are not able to go out side , even if they stay at home also a they are older they are not able to enjoy a young people . a the people become older they may get lot of health problem , if they want to enjoy also they not cause of their age . but unlike th eolder people young people enjoy a lot even in work also . for example if there is a party going in a home , let u take the older and younger people attend the party . the young people look more sharp than older people . they can dance , sing and able to participate in any program unlike older people . the young people also have so much knowledge than older people , so that they can participate actively in educational programms and they can enjoy the program . as the people become older they lost knowledge what they are earned when they are in young age , so they are not able to participate even in th eeducational programes . not only that one but also a the people becoming older they have so many tension about their follower , their work and also about thier health , a there is no tension for the young people nothing than the work tension . even though the young people have the work tension they can enjoy the tension also . as the people become older they loss knowledge , they loss patience , and also they are having the lot of tension and disturbences . so the people in the young age that is young people can enjoy a lot than the older people .
