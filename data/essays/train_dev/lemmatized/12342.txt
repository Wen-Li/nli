i think that learning fact and understanding idea are both important to know everything you could possibly know about a certain subject . but when it come to what is more important i think that understanding concept and idea is the reason why there is fact for example if a scintest didnt try new experements and went to knew plases and learnd new concept he could never come up with a fact that everybody study and know . usually a fact is more respected than a concept because the fact is certain and it there to see or to check but the concept may be a littel frightning because it hard to predect wether it is going to be a fact or the people will simply forget it therefore the people rather to study a fact-full major than a concept major at the university . all the new car and the new building start a a concept and the engineer modify it a they want and when they are all done they start doing the project , after the project is introduced it becomes a fact for everyone who doesnt know about the concept in the first place . denying that the fact are important in our life is wronge but i think that they are le important than the concept . for example the fact is a result of a long-time thinking and studying ready to read and learn in a number of line , so it is much easier to learn an existing fact than to think about one using concept and idea . finally if a person want to get the best possible of knowledgment he should consider and study both fact and idea becaus the start of every fact is to prove the idea and introduce the concept .
