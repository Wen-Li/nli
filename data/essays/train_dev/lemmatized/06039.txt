i disagree with the statement that say it is more important for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact . there are several reason why i disagree . the first reason is that if student only learned the fact than they would not be a creative a the other student who actually understand idea and concept . people have the ability to think so that if they just learned the fact they might memorized the fact and not understanding . for example , i have experienced that situation . i studied for my test and not understanding but memorizing all the fact . so i could not think of anything outside of the box . i failed that test from that now i usually try to understand idea and concept . the second reason is that if you understand idea and concept you will eventually get the fact too . like i kind of said at the first paragraph , understanding help you study more . it stay in your head longer and you will not forget easily . on the other hand , learning fact , you will forget easily because you just memorized it and did not understand . the third reason is that understanding idea and concept are the basic step . if you want to use anything you have to understand idea and concept first . for example , if you want to use a computer you have to understand idea and concept of how to use it , like reading the direction . it is not just learning the fact . to sum up , i do not agree with the statement . i seriously think that the more important for student are to understand idea and concept and not just learn fact . i think that learning fact would help student for at the moment but not for the long run .
