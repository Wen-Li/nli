i completely agree with that having broad knowledge of many academic subject is better than to specialize in one specific subcject . i have allways been someone who interest into on several academic subject such a politics , astronomy , byology and phsycology . it wa not possible in my unioversity to study all of these subject art the same time therefore , i choosed the politics a a major . i believe in that i would be able to be quite succesfull on all of them at the same time . choose of major at univ. depends on person individual interest besides other le influental reason . however , it can not be restricted by only one subject . a person can be succesfull on several subject rather than one spesific one , such a most of the scientist in history . da vinci wa not only a paint but also an inventor of his age . on both of these field his succes can not be ignored . specialize in only one spesific sucject allways sound me boring . sometimes working on a person having phsycologic problem can be more enjoyable than study a physical promblem . likewise , study for politics can be boring than working on a person 's phsycological problem . therefore it can be said that we can rest while working on a different subject than the subject we had to work on much . business life in my country doesnt shape with the science indeed . you can be a good phsycs resarcher but that doesnt help you to make your life easily . in order to earn money knowledge on several subject is more useful , especially in my country . thats why most of the student try to make mba in all around the world besides their own major . consequently it can be said that knowldge of several academic subject is definetely better than specialize on only one specific subject . even though many other of the reason to work on several subject can be added so , only three of them described above . we can gain more benefit with the broad knowledge on many subject rather than one academic subject .
