the seller always need to advertisement to buy their product to human therefore the advertisement is a very important aspect of the seller . somebody thing that advertisement show the reality of the product to consumer , the others think most advertisement make product seem much better than they really are . i agree the second idea . these are my following reason . firstly , advertisement may have visual game . for example , the cosmetic company use much beatiful model to attract woman to buy their product . they think the product will increase their beauty a the model . moreover , advertisement may show unrealistic detail of the product u . for instance , the shampoo advertisement say they have lot of positif benefit to hair and they show a woman whose hair is so atractive but they are not full of these benefit , in addition to this , advertisement are everywhere so we are influenced about thinking they are good . in my street there are lot of bilboard and when an advertisement about a product is on these bilboard , i see them everday and the result of this i think it is better to use . i mean that our opinion about a product are influenced by the advertisement . finally , although some product doe n't worth , the advertisement increase the price of the product . so we buy something which is le quality than we expect . all in all , a i said before , most advertisement make product seem much better than they really are because of having untrue visuality and being everywhere and they are cause of high cost . the advertisement company should be honest to improve their quality and profit because people easily understand the reality of them .
