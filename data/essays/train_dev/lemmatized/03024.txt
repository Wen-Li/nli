some people say that trying new thing is high risk , so they prefer staying safely without any adventrous . however , i really do not agree with this opinion , if i am supposed to choose between risky life and safe life , i will choose the risky life without any hesitation because adventrous life is more exciting and le boring , and most successful people took a tremendous risk for succeed to their job . above all , every successful business men/women always tried do a creative job . for instance , bill gate who is the owner of microsoft company is really creative and adventrous person because he built up the huge software company using his own creative idea from tiny company . when bill gate started his business , he had a just one idea such a window , or more convinient software , and nobody expected that his business wa going to grow up . also , even though he owns a huge company now , he still create a new software . in addition to the case of bill gate , people are able to come up with many historical person such a columbus . if he did not have an any curiousness about unknow land in new area , american could not had lived in north america now . after his high risky effort to find a unknown continent , there were numerous people who also would like to find a new land . thanks to their effort , people are able to travel , do a business , and immigrate in all over the world easily . nowadays , people can see many program and news which are about the adventrous people , and they look like living a exhilirating life . to sum up , there are various successful and historical people who incredibly creative and trying to do new work , and i really prefer to live like them because taking a risk and trying new thing are extremely exciting and much le boring for my whole life .
