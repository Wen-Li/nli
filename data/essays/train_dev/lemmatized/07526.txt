specialization a opposed to a broader knowledge base is an argument that ha been long debated and ha produced diverging opinion throughtout the course of recent history . personally i have an ambivalent opinion on the subject . in fact , while specialization , and in particular scientific knowledge related specialization , ha probably given a major contribution to the pace of scientific development , it is also true that scientist whom are overly specialized often fail to see the larger perspective of their work , which is also detrimental to scientific development . another point in favour of the broad knowledge base argument is that it determines a greatly flexibility in the employment of the person in question . in fact , being already aquainted with the rudiment of many discipline , the learning time is greatly diminished . the learning time is not only diminished because of the previous skill aquired in that subject area , but also because a broad knowledge base increase flexibility in the brain process . if a nuclear scientist were asked to market a new product , he would probably spend more time learning how to do it than someone with a le specifically oriented education . on the other hand economic theory tell u that specialization ha a positive effect on overall welfare . the example of adam smith is clear and simple . if for some reason we were in need of nail we would have the choice between buying them and making them ourselves . the fact is that by making the nail ourselves they would probably cost u more than buying them . on the larger perspective it is clear that specialization benefit the whole comunity , because each person doe the job he is most efficient in . the reason why my opinion is ambivalent is that in today 's world there is both a need for specialization and flexibility , and it is still unclear which one of the two need will dominate .
