i will support the idea that young people are more happy than older people . the first reason is that people in their twenty for example usually have le health problem and more energy . they are at their physical height , strong , and beautifull ! they can go out late at night and wake up early the next day without feeling too much pain . another reason is that young people still have hope . hope in a brighter future for the world , hope in a brighter future for themselves . they beleive , and they are theoritically right , that everything is still possible in the world and in their life , and this contributes greatly to their happiness . every day a new life can begin . as a counter example , i have a friend , 40 year old , who ha been a technician for the twenty first year of his career , despite the fact that he didn n't really like technical job . he always thought his job wa just for a living and that he would n't do that all his life . but recently , when he wanted to finally change job and work in business , he just could n't find a single employee that aws interested in his profile . he wa very depressed about the idea of spending the rest of his life doing something he did n't really like . whereas for young people , it is easier to change job . finally , young people have le reponsibilities than older people , therefore they are le likely to suffer from stress than older people . their job , their familly life , and their belonging are not a important a they will be in their future . plus , their decision usually involve only them , therfore increasing the satisfaction that they can get from life . they can more or le decide according to whatever they feel is good for them , without having to find a compromise with a loved one or childrens . for instance , if they do not have a family , they can decide to go and work abroad if they have a great opportunity , which is not so easy to do for someone that life with his wife or husband . as a conclusion , even though there are many benefit to growing old , young people enjoy more life than older people . but after all , being young is in people 's mind !
