i agree with the statement which is `` successful people try new thing and take risk rather than only doing what they already know how to do well . '' why do i agree with that statement ? first , because of population . many people try to success in one subject so the rate fo competition is very high . if people who ha knowledge a well a general people , they can not be on top in the major . second , if people who want to success is afraid of taking risk , they mentally or tequnically can not move from the point where they are now . they should take risk and get knowledge and experience from risk . they have to grow up with their knowledge and experience . that 's why i agree with the statement . there are a lot of people who want to success with the same major . even in one school ha a lot of raivals . when they can success , they whould make effort more than any other people . and they should get knowledge and experience while they make effort . the imformation and experience would help them .
