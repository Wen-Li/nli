yes , i agree with the statement wich say the it is more important for a student to understand idea and concept . i think thet it is right because i have never had so much memory for name , date and fact , but i had more memory for concept and idea . i think olso thet if one person can understand the concept of a problem will be able to describe the fact . dates , name and fact can be remembred reading many time the tex , but the concept no . concepts must be expleined very well by a teacer , and it is important thet student can ask him some question if the concept is not so much clear . another very important thing is thet the teacher must be very able to explein the conjcept : he must speak slow and he must be shure thet all the student have understood whot he wont to say . to be shure he should ask his student if the concept is clear every time before go on with his explenation . the fact thet it si more important for student to understand idea is more valid for logical and scientifical discipline , were the most important thing is to understand the method . disciplines like story and geography need thet student can remember fact and name , but olso in this case it is very impotant thet student understand the concept a , for exemple , the way for an historical fact ha happened , wich are the motif thet make it to happens . for the study of geographie it si not important to know just where a place is situeted , but it is impostant to understand the culture of thet town .
