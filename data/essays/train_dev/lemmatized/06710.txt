i agree with this statement . understanding idea and concept is more significant than learnig fact because undertanding idea and concept affect on the skill of remembering and explaining thing , and it also help to learn other information . understanding idea and concept mean that understanding thing deeply . if you understand detail of thing which you want to remember , you do n't forget it easily . also , you can explain about it when you are asked some one about it . if you learn only fact , it is good for remembering for short time to answer tomorrow 's quize , but you may not be able to remember it for long time . you ca n't also explain about it deeply in the class . therefore , understanding idea and concept is more important than learning just fact for studernts . another reason why understanding detail is more important than learning fact is that it affect on learnig new thing . if you perceive detail of thing which you learn perfectly , you can understand thing which you will learn next easily . most of the thing which student learn in school such a math , chemistry , phsyics or english tend to relate to each other . when you learn new thing , new thing are came from old thing which you have already learned . therefore , if you understand idea and concept deeply , you can understand new thing easily . in conclusion , understanding detail deeply help to remember and explain thing which you learned and to learn new knowledge easily . for all these reason , understanding idea and cocepts is more important than learning fact for student .
