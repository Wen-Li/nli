i agree with the statement which say that `` young people enjoy life more than older people do '' . there are different type of reason and example i can give for agreeing with the statement . there are many common reason , such a we can play for long hour in the playground . but the old people can not play for long hour a they do not have suffecient energy . young people can work for long time and lift the thing that ha more weight . but where a the old people can not work for long time and they can only lift thing that are low in weight due to thier le strength . young people can have a lot of food when compared to old people . young people enjoy life by travelling to different place and staying there . where a old people can not walk for long hour , so they can not visit many place but rather sit in home and enjoy watching tv . young people can drink beer and dance in disco contuniously . but this type of activity can not be done by old people due to thier lack of energy in them . young people enjoy thier life by attending party , game , culture program and many more . but the old people dont prefer this activity . young people do lot of exercise and build thier body . they have the capabaility of doing anything . as older people have no enough energy to participate in any event like game and compitions . there are many reason and example for stating that young people enjoy a lot rather than older people do . young people have lot of courage in them to participate in any event . so the young people enjoy the life more excitingly than older people . its a common thing that young people enjoy a lot rather than older people . so i agree with the statement given .
