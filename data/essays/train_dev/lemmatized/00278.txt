i strongly disagree with the quote . the quote seems to be a typical statment that elder make . the young people nowadays do give enough time to help out their community . the amound of time that young people spend on their community is small compared to the young people in the past . however , this doe not mean that the young people nowadays spends little time to helping their community , which can be their school community or local town . compared to the past , student are usually given relatively more work today , causing the indvidual student to have le time for their community service . the amount of homework and extracuricullums that the student do almost reach the limit of some student . as a high school senior student , i ca n't break my weekly schedule because if time period of one of the activity that i am enganed change , i ca n't afford to change my whole schedule . this is very common in my school . during the school day , i devote my free period to study and review the previous class . after school , i have activity that i would like to do such a volleyball for every monday , wendseday and friday , math team for every thurseday and model united nation for every tuesday . on weekend , i rest and prepare for the following week . these activity are difficult to stop because they help the student to learn the skill that are essential in the real world such a time management , responsibility , team work and so on . also , there are large number of homework and test that i must complete and study . with a deluge of these important activity and academic work , student nowadays can not devote themselves to their community a much a the young people did in the past . today , the majority of the student spend equal proportion of their time such a weekend to be involed in their community . in my school , we organize habitat for humanity and visit construction site in rural area of the city , warsaw , in order to help the homeless people to build their house . we physically help them through laying and cutting brick and digging ground . also , a a treasurer of the high school , i organize a fundrasing event to send some money to the local hospital ; the turn out are great , proving that the young people still care about their community , and the only problem is that they do n't have enough spare time to help the community everyday . the student try to support their community physically and financially . the young people , student nowadays spend eneough time to helping their community . although the quantity of the time of helping is smaller than the past , the percentage of the helping time is equal .
