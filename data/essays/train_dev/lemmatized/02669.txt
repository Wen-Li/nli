even though it is quite important for student to learn fact a well a idea and concept , i would like to insist on the importance to understand idea and concept before analyze fact because otherwise student can not keep right on truck . there are a couple of reason why i emphasize for student to study idea and concept first . one is the fact that studying idea and concept first would work for student to learn fact efficiently . the other is the fact that learning fact doe not make sense without a study from any perspective based on concrete idea and concept . first , if student understood idea and concept before learning fact , they could apply thier knowledge to focus on what the essence of the fact is and how those fact occur . this is one of the most important ability for student to learn in univerisity . they can not analyze any fact without fandamental idea and concept . for example , student can understand economic phenomenon much more effectively with a number of concept than without them . second , fact themselves do not make sense without any background infomation . if student did not study idea and concept at all , they would understand fact a just what happens at that time . however , they need study idea and concept to understand fact from different point of view . for example , when terrorist attacked building in new york , some people might say that it wa totally isram 's fault while the others say the united states is also contribute to this incident . in sumarry , student should understand idea and concept deeply before they learn and judge the fact . although it wa not really easy for them to study idea and concept because sometimes those concept are very complicated , they still do this because fact do not make sense without any basic idea and concept .
