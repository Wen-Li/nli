i do not agree with the topic that it will be fewer car in use that there are today . day be day , more and more people want to get a car , and people wish to have their own car . it is same to me , too . i also want to get a car . there are several reason to explain that more car in use that there are today . now , enoughly , there are many car in world . actually , i live in shanghai , china , every morning when i go to school , i always take school bus . however , everyday if the bus only 5 minute , it take over one hour to go to school . i meant , many people have their own car . also , i wish i have a car . because , if i have a car i can go everywhere in free . some of my friend have their own car . thus , every morning , they go to school by driving their own car . sometimes they come to my house then pick me to school . i meant , sometimes , i go to school to gether with them . it is more comfortable than school bus . by using own car is really comfortable and can move or go somewhere freely . thus , i wish to have my own car . second , every morning , it is too crowed . because in rush hour , many people go to their school or office , bus or subway are too crowed . i heard that before , in seoul or tokyo , there is a unique job which is called `` push man '' . in every rush hour , in bus or subway is too crowed and all people want to them first . and bus or subway is too small to take all people . thus , push man help to people . push man push the people before the door is closing . in human society , people are busy to go to their office , there is unique job too . anyhow , if people use thier own car , it is more comfortable to go . also , in china the population are getting increase . of course , a the rule of china , there should be only one child , populatins is increasing . thus if chinese have their own car , it will be more car in the future . in conclude , by using car is more comfortable to go to somewhere and more and more people wish to have thier own car . thus , in future , there are more and more car .
