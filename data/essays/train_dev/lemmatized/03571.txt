i agree with the statement that a lot of the advertisement spread across our society are trying to make product look better than they are in reality . actually , the reason for this development are rather obvious : firstly , the steadily growing amount of product of comparable function and quality cause the need for customer to distinguish between these otherwise equal product . taking into account the enormous exchange of information nowadays , it is quite understandable that evolving a product is not a common a it wa in the past ; most of the related product are on the same level of invention most of the time . therefore , advertisments have to come up with a individual way of creating an incentive to favour a particular product among others . secondly , the average customer is actually looking for something superior to the content of his or her 's everyday life to enrich it . he or she want to be special instead of comparable and is thus looking for attribute that make a difference . ironically , this is what make these people most indistinct , since a lot of them are motivated equally by these unconcious desire . as a result , the author of advertisments compose their creation servicing a well the wish of the producer a the wish of the customer , making product seem `` larger-than-life '' . in some aspect , advertisments are a replacement or addition to religious or spiritual desire : the irrational longing for a special importance of the own existance , the wish for immortality through extrinsical approval rather than intrinsic satisfaction . in my opinion , this development is something rather annoying - at least , if you are a questioning person . i would not go a far a to call it intimidating or even dangerous - from my point of view , this development is more likely a symptom than it is a disease and therefore not the issue itself but a consequence of it .
