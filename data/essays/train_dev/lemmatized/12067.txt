someone think it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subject than to sprcialize in one specific subject . in my opinion , but i disagree it . i think it is better to specialize in one specific subject . to have broad knowledge of many academic will cause many negetive result . firstly , if you want to have broad knowledge of many academic subject , you must spend much more time to work hard . you will hvat to give up many other important thing . you will not have enough time to play sport and your health will be worse . otherwise , you will not have enough time to communicate with your family and friend . you will fell lonely after a long period . secondly , even you have spend so many time to work hard and you have broad knowledge of many academic subject finally . but probably , you only know some common information of many academic subjedts and are not good at one special subject . for example , a physician who know many knowledge of history , computer , plant and so on . he must have not enough time to study his medical knowledge , so he will not a good physician . otherwise , if everyone all have broad knowledge of many academic subject . in the result , they can do all kind of job but they can not do them very well . in a conclusion , i think people should have special knowledge in one specific subject and review broad knowledge of many academic subject but not spend too much time on them . because broad knowledge can give you more idea of your special subject .
