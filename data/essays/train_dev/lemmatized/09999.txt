according to carl marx : '' a person older than you in one minute is a hundred time wiser '' . nowadays learning is a priority in every civilised man 's life . no one could live in th 21st century without having a minimum of khowlege . to be a succesfull and wise person your khowlege should be widespread in severlas field and deep in one of these domain . in this modern way of living , working in any field oblige you to be knowledeable in many domain . for example a person that is managing a juice industry should khow about plant managing , mechanical engeneering ( to fixe the machine ) , finance , marketing . .. that show hoe knowlege ha no limites and every one of u should seek for learning a much a he can . a broad khowlege increase the number of field we can work in . that 's the only way we could developp our potential and increase our chance to succed in this challeging and competing woking field . on the other hand if a person is not specialised in a specific subject she ca n't be a leader in any working domain . every one of u should have not only a broad khnolege , but also a deep study in a certain field . for exmple this same plant manager should show to the employee that he is superior than them in a certain field like marketing . that knowlege will help him to find new advertising trick that will increase the sale . in the marketing part of this industry he will be a leader and will be respected by every won . in summary , both broad khowlege and specialisation are important . the first provides a bigger choice of working field and the second give u the oppurtinity to be a leader in a certain domain .
