i definitely agree to the statement , and i think the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide for three reason . to travel where i never visited before , it is hard to choose where to see around . when i visited italy , i had hard time scheduling where to go . there are many church , cultural architecutre , and famous concert hall to visit . i could not choose where to go first or where i defenitely should go . however , when i travel with a group and a tour guide , tour guide planned everything and scheduled in efficiently . i do not have to loose time to make decision , and also i never missed famous place to visit . sometimes it is hard to find a restaurant when i travel by myself . usually , the place to travel is where to travel first time . so i have no information about price of food , what to wear , and it taste good or not . when i wa a student and travel to italy , i wa a a backpakker . since i wa young , i do not contain much money to eat expensive food . i usually eat cheap pizza , pasta , and snack . but one time i choose a restaurant which served delisious food but very expensive . when i seated and look at the menu , i wa surprised about the price . in this situation , if i go with a tour guide , he or she will suggest me about the average price of the food this restaurant serf . furthermore , i have more chance to take many picture if i travel in a group . sometimes , i find hard time taking picture when i travel by myself . because , i need to take care of luggage . but if i travel in a group , i can ask others or a tour guide to take a picture . also , i can ask a tour guide to watch my luggage while i take a picture . as i mentioned so far , i agree the statement , and i will choose to travel in a group with a tour guide .
