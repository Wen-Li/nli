i certainly do not believe that young people enjoy life more than older people do . by the time people get older and more mature , they tend to enjoy life in a different way . they appreciate certain think which young people might not . moreover , do such statement depend on the circumstance people live in when they are young compared to those when they get older . beginning with the last arguement , the most important arguement , is enjoying life very much linked to the personal sitation . do people have a good family life ? how is the financial situation ? at this point major difference can occur . when people grow up in unstable family circumstance with a lack of money and le perspective , life is not a enjoyable a a life a an adult , when people are able to influence how they want to live , how they want to study or how they want to live with their family . young people certainly do not have many choice concerning those matter , because they are dependant on their family . additionally , doe an adult enjoy life differently . other think are much more appreciated when people get older . they might not be able to experience new thing a much interesting and entertaining a older young people might , but they have other opportunity . thinks like going to theatre , balletts or opera are good possibility to have fun and more enjoyable for adult than for young people . art in general is differently perceived by each group . moreover , can more mature people go on holiday or trip alone and generally don not need any kind of supervision . the aspect of freedom and the opportunity linked to it is probably one of the most important arguements in contrast of the above statement . although this freedom is linked with more commitment and responsibility , such a the need of earning money and caring for a family with child . taking all these aspect into account , i can not support the arguement that young people enjoy life more than older people do . firstly , is the statement not detailled enough to be applicable for every situation and secondly is it a question of possibility how to have fun .
