i defenitly agree that it is more important for student to unterstand the idea and concept they have to learn than just to learn fact . there are different reason for my opinion and i will point out 3 of them . the first point , i want to mention is that it is easier to learn and remember thing , when you understand what you learn . for example if you study without understanding the idea there is the probability to fail in an exam because you are not able to reproduce the problem correctly and you can not be good in test about transferring different information to a new point of view . so it is not very useful to learn fact by heart , it is more important to get the whole situation . another point is that you should be able to connect diffferent information to understand the whole problem and i think this ability is not improved by learning single aspect of a problem . facts can change but the main idea , for example the theory of milton friedman will be true even in ten year . and you will need these thearies to understand different process . my last and most important point is that you learn for life and not for school or university . that mean that the lecture and text in university are important and the knowledge which you should aquire are necessary to succed later in your job . university education prepares you for yours task later in your work life , but if you just learn stupid fact and do not use the offered knowledge , there is a high probability that you will fail . you must be able to solve a problem and i do not think that fact and figure will help you at your job . if you need fact in your job , you can use primary and secondary data , for example to launch a research , which will get you the fact you need . so all in all i prefer that student should learn complete thories and no single aspect . on the one hand that is more difficult but on the other hand you will aquire much more timeless knowledge
