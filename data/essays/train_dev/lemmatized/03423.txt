when facing the question of whether to grasp more than one specific subject , people always are divided into two group , one of which agrees to learn broad knowledge of many academic subject , however , the other of which belives that we should concentrate on one specific subject . in my opinion , mastering broad knowledge is the better choice . my reason are presented a follows . first , learning various knowledge is beneficial to an individual in modern society . now we live in a changeable world , in which technology rapidly is developed . this change generates the change of our life style . for example , computer ha entered our normal life and we hardly work without it . but some year ago , people did not know what it wa . if we just stay on one specific subject and fail to learn knowledge about computer , how can we live normally in this society . so , the current society situation requires u to grasp many useful knowlege of different subject and keep to refreshing them . second , people that own broad knowledge always look smart because they may be enlightened by another subject knowledge . holding different knowledge can enhance the thinking ability and raise the way in which people think and act . when a person encouters a big difficulty on a subject , he may obtain some inspiration one day through focusing on another subject that he/she conduct . admittedly , focusing on one specific subject may cause someone to research more deeply than dispersing one 's concentration on various subject . of course , researcher should pay their attention on the specific subject . but , rearchers still learn other subject that are useful in their life . in all , comparing the advantage and disadvantage between having broad knowledge of many academic subject and just having one specific academic one , i support my idea that people should learn various subject knowledge rather than own one .
