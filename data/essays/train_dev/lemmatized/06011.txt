this statement seems to be true at a first glance . but having a closer look on this topic one should differentiate more precisely . first of all these type of statement can not be generalized . thus it should at least be mentioned that we can only speek of majority . second one should be aware that an answer to the question whether or not young people enjoy life more than elder is highly subjective . from my experiance i would even oppose . admittedly younger people in most case bring along a higher level of physical fitness . thus they have a broader variety of entertainment opportunity . in turn this opportuny might raise the confidence of young people . but what really matter is time ( actually my opinion ) . as i define young people to be something around 20 and older people to be retired , i think elder have signifacantly more time than young people have . this degree of freedom ( in the sense of time ) allows for much more activity . while for instance student have to learn and work hard to fund their study retired person might meet with friend , travel around , go out and drink some , visit opera , go shopping or whatoever . this lack of time is a crutial thing that count against a superior fun-level of young people . secontly i think young people are exposed to more stress . old people do not have to make decision like `` should i join this or that university ? '' or `` should i apply for this internship ( respectively job ) ? '' . this type of decision - someone in the beginning twenty have to make - cause an inherent stress situation , which again lower life quality . thus i conclude from my personal experiance that this relationsship doe not hold . i think it is actually the other way round . again , one should not neglect that this answer is highly subject to the definition of young and old and must not be true for each individual .
