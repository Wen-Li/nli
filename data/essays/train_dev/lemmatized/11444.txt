yes it is true that successful people bound themselves in such a way that they are always inclined t do new thing and do traditional thing in innovative way rather than adopting the same old method . i had been working with a lawyer who is very ambitious and at such an age i.e. 60 yrs. he is so energetic and filled with idea that rare can challenge . there had been various example in indian history where people employed new technique and tok risk and succeeded . one of such example is sunil bharti mittal ( airtel ) in the initial day when he wa struggling , an idea of key pad phone clicked him , at that time india wa not used to key pad telephone instrument . there were boring round mechanical instrument with out any feature except to connect people . then there came the era of key pad phone and it wa a revolution for india , many faclities were provided in those instrument . though it wa a hit and trial effort but it worked and it wa the risk that this person took and made life comfortable . then the era of mobile phone came and now lot of player have come into operation and competing with each other . there is another success story of maruti car . initially in india , i.e. after independence the car available in india wa ambassador of fiat no other car wa available in india except for the imported one and that can be afforded by people with big pocket only . this problem wa solved by mr. sanjay gandhi who is the key person fr entry of japanese cars into india . maruti in collaboration wth suzuki wa ntroduced in the year 1984 and people welcomed it with great respect . though it wa a risk taken by that person , it worked and today it ha superseded all other car available in india . this is how success story begin and continues . they say sucess is a journey and not a destination .
