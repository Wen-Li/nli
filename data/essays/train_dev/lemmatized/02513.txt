opinions might exists over whethe most advertisement make product seem much better that they really are . personally , i agree with the above statement because advertisement are a method to maximize company profit . as well , the time for advertisement is dramatically short . to start with , the purpose of making advertisement is to attract their customer . today 's society , many company exist , and many product are made by them . as a result , the company tend to draw people to buy their good . in this sense , advertisement are one of the best way to increase selling rate . to illustrate , everyday , people are surrounded by the numarable number of advertisement . to hold the people 's attention , the function of good in advertisement are different with original function of it . my mother is a case in point . she often suffers from bad flu and buy medicine after watching medical advertisement . however , she always failed to find effective medicine for her flu . this is because every good in advertisement seems increasingly perfect for her , but they did not cure her pain . as a result , she ha no choice but to buy new medicine . as illustrated above , most advertisement fake people in certain degree of function for more profit . what is more , the time of adverisements is dramatically short and company have to give people impression about their product in the short time . therefore , they have no choice but to make product seem much better than original .
