with the development of tourism industry all over the world , more and more people will choose to travel in their leisure time . however , the first problem the tourist will be confronted with is whether to travel in a group led by a tour guide or to travel alone . while some people may appreciate the advantage of travelling in a group for it convenience and experieced guide , i tend to choose to travel alone . the benefit of travelling alone are listed a follows : when you travel alone , you can meet new friend during the journey ; also , you can find that travelling is much more flexible than leading by a tour guide ; last , the price is lower when you travel on your own . first in first , when you travel alone , chanced are that you will make new friend during your journey and thus share your experieces and knowledge about the destination , about the world and about the real life . for example , once i travel alone in beijing , the charming city in china , it so happened that when i wa trying to climb up the great wall , a stranger lent me his hand and he helped me to finish climbing the wall . after we reached the top , we were already good friend and communicated a lot on our tourist experience . up till today , he is still my best friend in my life and we keep in touch with each other by mail and share our journey . the next point of travelling alone is it flexibility . just think , if i wa led by a guide , i will be forced to leave or go to a place i do n't like very much and have to go when i really want to stay for more time . while i travel alone , i can figure out my favorite place and to select the nearest routine to the destination . whenever i want to stay for a while , i can just enjoy my time . there is no restriction for me to travel . last but not the least , i found that travelling alone can be much cheaper than travelling in a group led by a tour guide . as we all know , every travel agency must make profit to support their business . thus , they may be overcharged on the payment . however , if i travel alone , i can save money for the sake of my own . for example , i can choose the cheapest hotel rather than the expensive one . also i can choose to travel by train rather by air , which mean a lot more expenditure . as the reason mentiond above , i prefer to travel on my own , not in a group . the opportunity of making new friend , the flexibility of my travelling time and the economic fee i have to pay for my trip are all the factor that contribute to the reason .
