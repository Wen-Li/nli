there is an arabic saying that say `` understanding the the question is half of the answer '' .. i agree with this opinion because the main deffrints between human and computer isthe mind . any computer can memorize , any flass memory , memory card or any other electronic device can store information . on the other hand it can not understand these information , but our human brain can understand them . it is very importan to search for fact , because while searching you learn other thing . you read book , article and web search , you will gain more and more . when you learn a fact you are not doing any thing new . you are just getting what others accomplished . i am not saying fact are not important but we do not have to relay on them . we have to understand look for more so we can then built new fact . bill gates for example developed him self he thought and thought , and he understood idea then he invested microsoft . he stared for nothing and reached the top by his brain ( thinking and understanding ) we wont gain any new if we did not understand whats going on . if u memorize there will always be poeple above you . japanese developed themselves because they understood and thought . while other third world country are remaining the same because they do not think , they only get the information from other poeple . before 100 year ago no one thoght that a human will walk on the top of the moon , but understanding the idea made u think and now day we have nasa . u can learn fact sometimes but u have to understand them . the deffrint between a smart student and an oddnary student is how he think and understands . physics doe not depend on memorizing . niether do math . they need understanding and they need thinking . on the other hand learning hestory reqires to learn fact . i prefer going for siencebecause it like a compatition . you need to think and use your brain . thats my opinion and again my choise is to understand idea .
