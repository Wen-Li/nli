on the first part , we have to know what is an advertisement , if there is many type of them . what they may product ? let begin with an exemple of advertisement that we can see every day : smoking kill . this is a good advertisement cause we do know that it is not healthy to smoke and however , there are a lot a person they do that . so , if we continue with this exemple we can proove alos that the fact of reading on your box of cigarette that it kill gave the opportunity to a good number of person to stop it . the problem with that word advertisement is it type , the destination of the advertisement , who make it and what should be the effect on people . in the foreign affair , a crisis situation can conduct to advertisement from a country to an other . we can read that everyday in the newspaper that the un are giving advertisement to a country like iran or north correa about their own nuclear program . the message ha been delivrated but did it help , this is an other question . on the other hand , there is a familiar expression wich is : an advertising man is like two men . it mean that when you have been advertising of something by someone , you are that much cleaver than two of yourself . it can illustrate very well the question . to conclued i can say that i do not agree with this sentence cause i think that is the experience that can make product , real product .
