i agree this statment , because if they do noy have a risk. , they wo n't grow theriself . if they do n't grow theriself , they wo n't success . if you do just what you know now , your skill for everything wo n't change forever . and to challege to other thing is to make success . i think that the successful people took a risk . if they do n't take a risk , they do n't succseed about everything . in my case , i took a risk of luaguage . i 'm studying abroad in canada now and go to the high school same a canadian . that wa hard for me . i could not speak english very much and wa afraid of speaking to canadian and useing english in front fo canadian . but i diecided myself to come here and study english . i realized again and i became to try to speak to everyone though they are canadian . finally , i could make friend and got good relationship between my host family . and to try everything wa changed my mind like kindly and more positive . second , in my opinion , if somenody do n't want to take a resk and challeange anything , they wo n't grow theriself . to grow yourself , you must do something for you . i guess that something include some risk . but if you do't grow , you can not be successed . bucause , your mind is same a before you do n't callenge anything . in japan , i did not take a risk and challenge to anything so i did not grow at all . but i came here i did growed a lot . bucause i did challenge a lot and to grow myself . so i got a friend , good relationship and confidence to everything . finally , i think to challenge is to make success . if you do n't challeng , you don'y have anything even gad mark or result . you do n't get anything and you do n't successed . for these three reason , i agree this statement ; successeful people had a risk for challenging .
