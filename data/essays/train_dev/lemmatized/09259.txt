people who have success in their life , very often try to push their limit to the test . having had the sweet feeling of success , they tend to know that else is possible . like so many people in our material society , they first wanted to have success . so , success automatically come along with money or respect . being an individual member of this society , but still seen a someone special because of his achivements , the successful man ( or woman ) try to stay on top , proving to himself and the mass that he could achieve everything , being someone special . so , the thing he used to do are n't so special anymore , what mean that there must be new , more exciting challenge waiting . so , knowing that he is a `` winner '' , the successful man ha the power ( wherether it is money , influence or popularity ) and can do what he plan , which is giving him the kick he need . i think you could compare successful people with junky . not in a selfdestructive way , but in the way they always need more and more to be satisfied , which is a phenomenon that can be proved by looking at the world ' top manager nowadays . earning more in one month than an average worker would earn in one year , still not satisfied and greedy . i have the opinion that successful people often do not specifically realize that it is greed , what is driving them to push their limit . they tend to ignore that fact and take risk more easily than a `` normal '' person would do . in the end , i do n't agree with the statement above , for i think that trying new thing and taking risk is just a needed prove for these people , that no matter what they do , they will always be someone special . these people are just bored by what they achieved so far and need to find something more satisfying for theirselves . but everyone for himself is special , so there is no need for taking the risk to prove it .
