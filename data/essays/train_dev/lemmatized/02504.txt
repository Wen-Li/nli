i must confess this is a tricky question to answer . i agree to this statement only to some extent . in fact , i strongly believe that people can enjoy their life always during their lifetime and the reason why they do so is much more connected to their personal worldview than to their age . however , i think that there are some ineluctable element that are closely related to age and that help to enjoy life more , but they are equally distributed between young people and old one . i will try to use a very simple example in order to show it . on one hand , young people are usually healthier and have more energy than old one . for these reason , they can do more activity and spend le time resting . secondly , they are a bit unaware of life , so they often face new challenge with more optimism . thus , they plan very adventurous trip , for instance . on the other hand , older people maybe have le energy and health , but they can afford trip better because they have more money ( at least in my country ! ) and they have learnt a lot from life . their experience help them to know what is really precious in life and what you had better to do in some difficult situation . as i stated before , life ha it own cycle and each part of it can be deeply enjoyed by everyone in different manner . i am actually wondering if older people enjoy life more than younger one because of their experience . they might have get aware of what are the most important thinng in life and so they are supposed to suffer le than young people because of silly reason . however , i think that this can only depend on each person different experience and especially on what he or she believe in . in fact , some people that have everything someone could desire are actually rather sad and others that keep having tough time turn out to be the happiest one . .
