yes , i believe that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide . tour guide are often more experienced and more familiar with the place of travel and they can show u the speciality about that place . travelling in a group alone or with friend in a foreign country without a tour guide is like getting lost in a maze . we wouldn not know how to communicate with local people , how to buy thing and even get the food we want . also , it might be hard to travel to the landmark without understanding the way transportation work in that particular country . on the other hand , if we have a tour guide with u , he would probably have some connection with the travel agency and it would be easier to communicate with local people and also bring u to the local attraction that we want to see without any problem . tour guide are meant to be hired for people travelling in foreign country and need a person to guide or lead them . tour guide are professionally trained and experienced with the country they are guiding in . they are often from that particular country and they know how to speak the local language and they understand how thing work , so that you would feel more comfortable and would trust them a being your leader . although you might not get to do certain thing that you had in mind , when travelling in a group with a tour guide , you would definitely have a great time and it would be the best , and the safest way to travel . with a tour guide , you get to experience or see the local life style , local food , and local attraction , much more easier than travelling by yourself blindly , not knowing where exactly you are yourself . in conclusion , in my opinion , the best way to travel is indeed in a group led by a tour guide a you get to experience a wider range or variety of sight-seeing place without getting lost and to experience different sort of local culture .
