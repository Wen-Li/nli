i certainly agree that travelling in a group with a tour guide is the best option . travelling outside of the place where you live is one of the most exiting and enjoyable thing to do in most people life . people tend to take vacation to get away from the rigour of daily life . most people would certainly like to go alone or with an individual family if the choice existed . however most place that people consider are far away and exotic in nature , not to ignore the fact that they could be dangerous too . take for example the bali in indonesia . the recent terrorist strike in bali killed a lot of people , mostly vacationeers . going in a group offer a lot of benifits to a traveller . most airline and hotel offer group booking discount a well a preferential service . travelling in a group also make you feel secure rather than travelling alone . travelling in group would be specially advantageous to people with kid a i believe kid are better behaved and more entertained when they are in a group . going in a group with a tour guide would also help people with disability . also , why do something when you can have someone do it for you ? this is the type of question most people would ask when going out on a trip . instead of spending time and researching about a particular destination , it would be better to employ a local expert ( tour guide ) to guide you to the right place and explain the history and culture of that particular place . a tour guide would also be helpful incase there is an emergency and you might need to contact the local authority or need any kind of help . also with their experience most tour guide are able to guide u to the right spot and destination , making the most of our vacation .
