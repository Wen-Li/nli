some people say that the group tour is the best way for safe and convinient tour . however , i dis agree this idea for two reason . first , we do n't have free . second , group tour need more extra money . to begin with , how many people like to be controled ? of course , it will be very few people . however , when people travel with a tour guide they should be controled . people will have le time for their own free time because they are group so they have to follow the rule . it will be very annoing . let me take my experience for example . two year ago , i went to the tiland . at that time , i could not set my own sckejule because i did n't have much time before depart the tour . when i arrived air port , i wa very angered because a tour guide guided more than 50 people . so she could n't care abot each individual . also we have to conduct a sckedule which made by the guide . so , it wa really bad experience . next , if we travel by onself , we can save money . many people expect that a group tour will be cheaper than nomal people 's tour . however , the group tour usually need the mandatory shoping so it is definitaly not cheap even expensive . a few day ago , a tv program covered about the exaggerated group tour . these tour dcampained their item is the most cheapest . many people enrolled but when they arrive the place . they have to buy and buy and buy . if you tour alone , this will never arrise . you can spend your money economicaly . in this sense , group tour is not good idear in conclusion , i disagree that the best way to travel is in a group tour for the reason that i mentioned above .
