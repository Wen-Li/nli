this is a hard question , because succes mean not the same thing for all the people , and also because both way can take you to succes . in my case , i am a tennis player . for me succes would be to become a professional player . for this to achieve there are no secret formula , there are no new thing to try , nothing like that , but doing what must be done , and what ha been done since the early year of this sport , working for it . also when playing tennis there is something you always have to have in mind `` if it is working and giving you result do not change or try something new '' , so succesful tennis player do not take great risk , nor try new thing , they just do what they know they do best , and stick to it if it is working . so this make me think thing should work like this in every other subject , if something is giving you succes , why changing it ? maybe if you are just in search of that `` success '' in other subject rather than sport you should try new thing , for example in pizza , we have dominoes , pizza hut , peter piper pizza , etc . .. so maybe thinking in subject like this it is hard getting success following the same step others did long ago , beacuse of all the competition , maybe it would be easier thinking of a not so compited subject , so maybe here it is when you will have to try new thing , explore new market etc . . but if you find success with something do n't try to change it , a long a it is giving you what you look for keep doing the same , or if you something well , no matter there is a lot of competition , keep doing it , because if you really do your thing well , people will notice about it and result will arrive sooner or later .
