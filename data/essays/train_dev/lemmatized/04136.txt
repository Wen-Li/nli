in my opinion , i would agree with the statement that say , `` it is more important for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact . '' but student have to learn both concept and fact . then they have to compare between them and decide . and sometimes fact change with the daily increase in science feilds like physic . for example people used to think that earth is like the sphere then it wa found that it is not exactly a sphere but ha an oval shape . and fact too that dinasours were just myth till they found the bone of real dinasours . so when a student understand cocepts and idea , he can think and used his brain and maybe discover something that can change fact . but this still doe n't mean that they should n't learn fact . they have to learn fact but concept and idea are more important . lets say for example the law of motion they are concept but they were used in may discovery after that . why the first fact wa that when you throw an apple in the air it fall back . therefore fact are important but concept and idea are needed for student and well after that scientist to discover thing . on the other side fact are very important too . for example the fact that if you jumped out of the window of the 7th floor , you will die . if someone doe n't know this fact in the end he is going to die just because he want to know what will happen if he jumped but thats a far example because in our day this would never happen . other thing is the fact that human ca n't just disappear . but by studying concept and idea and doing test . you find that you can trick someone and you can not be seen if you walk slowly and walk in the dark part without making noise . illusion too is that you use concept that human mind ca n't explain so you trick people by doing that . so in the end both concept and fact are important . but concept are more important .
