i clearly disagree with the fact that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour . i will explain you why around three main point . first of all , in my opinion , i trully think that trip preparation is a complete part of the travel experience . if you follow a group led by a tour guide , you will not be able to discover the country or city you will visit in advance . reading , the lonely planet , spending hour on google watching for some advises on the best place to go is a great time . secondly , in a group led by a tour guide , you have to follow . for me , it mean that you are not free to do what you want , when you want . the worst thing is that they are telling you when you have free time ! in a trip , i go through a lot of different mood . sometimes i like moving quickly from one place to an other , but sometimes , and it happens quite often , it is real pleasure to relax , take time , and enjoy the moment . from my point of view it 's essential to follow our rythm . last but not least , the departure and return flight are most of the time scheduled in the middle of the night and in unknown airport . we all know that tour guide want to reduce cost and get a better rentability . that is the reason why , they prefer to chose big airplane charter with small seat to put more people in it . in addition they use small airport which are clearly cheaper . the travel becomes painfull , and it affect your trip appreciation . that is why , i disagree with the idea that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide . there are many other way to have a better time in a trip than this one .
