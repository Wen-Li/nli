there is a very popular saying in english which go `` a jack of all trade is a master of none . '' a person who ha limited knowledge of various topic but little or no specialized knowledge of any one particular topic is generally referrred to a the above mentioned saying . while it is good to know a little bit of everything that surround you , it doe not harm to have specialized knowledge of one subject . based on my personal experience , i strongly disagree with the statement that it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subject than to specialize in one specific subject . excellence in any field can be achieved only when one ha specialized in that specific subject and reached it pinnacle . by having a broad knowledge of various academic subject one can only achieve mediocrity . an individual who ha specialized in one specific subject is respected by society and his peer and looked up to by his junior and subordinate who aspire to be like him . he is often approached for advice and resolving certain issue pertaining to his subject . a indivdiual can use his specialized knowledge in a specific subject to make new breakthrough , invention and discovery in that field . the entire society ha benefited from the research work of scholar and learned men in various field of science , history and art . society ha evolved due to the innumerable invention and discovery which were a result of this extensive research . thus specialized study have given a forward thrust to mankind a a whole in term of technological advancement and evolution . a specialzation in one subject is also an indicator of the dedication and perseverance of an individual . it show his sense of commitment to a particular task . thus it is the reflection of the quality and character of an individual .
