typically , it is a common misconception that young people would enjoy life more than older people do . it is infact true that younger people have more potential to enjoy life , although it is the sad truth that some do not . some of the more older people in the world probably enjoy life much more than younger people . i believe that with the right mindset , enjoying life is not a matter of age . younger people have more capable body to play sport or do very difficult activity , such a mountain climbing . a child at the age of five would not have many worry with almost no responsability . they would continue running around , thinking of nothing but their next desire . a teenager would exhibit realization of responsability . they would have to keep up with their grade , and their social life , etc . although , a teenager still doe not have a goal set for their life . some have a theory that they have the so-called `` teen angst '' in which they rebel against many different situation and/or person in their life . this is an example of how a younger person may not enjoy life more than an older person doe . an older person should be wise enough to do the right thing and act the right way . another example could be if a person wa put into a very bad situation . for instance , if the teenager or child wa living in the more disease prone area of africa . they probably would not be having so much fun , especially with the political instability and the little amount of food around . an older person , on the other hand , usually ha a foot in the direction they would want to follow . they would not have the ability to , for instance play ninty minute of soccer in one of the major club of the world , although they could still enjoy such past-times a golf . an older person would probably have had the resource set around himself/herself to be in some way succesfull . it is up to them whether they want to follow that path or any other . in conclusion , it is only ourselves limiting the enjoyment of life . it is true , with some situation , there really is not much you could do , although we have to make the best of what we have . so once again , it is not true that young people enjoy life more than older people .
