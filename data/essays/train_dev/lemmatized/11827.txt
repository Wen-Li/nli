youth is often considered a the best part of life . youth mean energy , project , entertainment and happiness . is it a reality ? i think that , in order to answer this question , young people 's problem must be showed . youth is a period of tremendous stress and fear . stress can be infered by responsabilities , in front of study , social life , or study . for example some cursus are extremely hard and stressfull . it is the case of medicine study in france , or some business study in japan for example . social life infered fear , because of competition for example . young people want to do their best , but are often disppointed by life . for example , student social movement that france knew in the beginning of the year two thousand six show that young people , even when they have project and are highly graduated , can feel fear about their future . my opinion is that young people often are more interessed in politics that their parent , because it is about their future . they understand their own situation , and their country 's situation . on the contrary , old people can enjoy life . more and more , old people can enjoy life , because they do not work anymore . they can do what they always dreamed to do . as a matter of fact , old people more and more travel , have good standart of living and entertain themselves . it is proved by sociologist that , in some region , old people are happier than young people of the same region . besides , it is now proved that old people help young people , by giving them money or allowing them to stay in their parent 's house whereas they already were living alone when they were young . it is an important evolution of society . young people do not longer help their grandparent , it is the contrary . all those element tend to show that young people do not enjoy life morethan old people do .
