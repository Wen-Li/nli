there are two type of people in the world in my opinion : who is brave and who is not brave . the brave are that people who can look at the future and take risk , the not brave can not take important decision for their own future . i believe that in his own life every person must risk and fight for the thing that he or she want to do , without think too much time if his or her is right or wrong . for example , i did not want to go to university after the secondary school and i began to work immediately . after some year , i have think that i would go to the university , but without stop working . since that moment , i am studying and working in the same time , without think that it is more difficult that to do only one thing , becouse it is a target whose i want to arrive . i do not agree with the people who want to have a quiet life without any kind of risk , becouse that people do not have the capacity to think about their own future and they are happy to remain at the same level of life for many many year . another example that i can give is that i would do the engineer after the university and not the employee for the rest of my life , becouse in my opinion is better the life of a free professionist , who can spend his time and his money in the way who he can think is right , than the life of the employee , who is not indipendent and ha the same condition of life for many time . sure , one employee do not risk to do not have his payment , but the life of a free professionist in more exciting and can give to me many satisfaction , altought it will not give to me the same rassicurations to have the payment every month of the year . to finish , one life without risk is one life without target .
