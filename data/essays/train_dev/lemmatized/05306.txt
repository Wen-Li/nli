i agree to the statement that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their community for three reason ; too busy to participate , priority in helping their community is very low , and fact that existence of community itself is questionable . first , the young people do not devote their time for helping their community becase they are simply too busy . there are thing they need to do in order for their dream to come true . for example , i put in a time in my acadmic work in order to achieve enough grade to be accepted to the university i wished for . on top of this , i participated in three different sport team , so that the universities knew that i wa an active member of school . and on top of this , i had attended to the sat prep course to maximize my score . i just did n't have time to spend time in the community volunteer . secondly , the young people 's priority are usually in different direction , so that they do n't even pay attention in helping their community . i sure wa not a kind of teenager to give up my time to help communitity instead of going out with a girl who i liked . the range for the definition `` young people '' is some what ambiguous , but it very likely that people in their teenage choose their private and personal life over helping their community . the reason is very simple ; they like private life better and feel excitment . lastly , the young people do not give enough time to helping their community , because young people ca n't find the community itself . it 's not just young people , who ca n't find community , i believe people nowadays do not rely on community at all , that their existance might have been forgotten . especially in the city life , it 's possible for someone to not to interact with anyone or anything to retain your lifestyle .
