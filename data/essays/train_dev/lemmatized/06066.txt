the concept of learnig from fact is moor importent than understanding thing . practical observation is moor importent than theoritical knowledge . byexperiance we can learn moor . we can lean driving a car bu practicing not by understanding idea how we can stsrt and how to use tha break etc. , not only in driving a care riding bycical . one of the most importent thing is how learn math with idea or else with fact . without understanding idea we dont ge math by practicing thigs that have more and more . by learning fact we understand the depth of math . some time we can use tha idea . for example in my school day my teacher gave one priblem to find out the area of our class room i know tha formula for thar but i dont know no how to use that one . after that my reacher lear to me how to calculate of our class room by taing it lenth and breath . finaly i thought that with only knowledge of idea u dont find any use . when we are learning computer subject the manual give some information abouthe the computer and we can aderstand the basic of the computer . at that time we have le knowledge about that but we learn from practies this is the keyboard and this is the monitor otherwise we have some confussion about that . thus we can undrestand the conceots of anything notonly driving acar , riding abycical , learning math , and computer in our life everything is understood by fact or by practical .
