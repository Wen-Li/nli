when we turn on the tv , or the radio , or when we read a newspaper we can see or listen to or read a lot of advertisement . the advertisement is the process that show a product and try to convince people to buy it . mass medium are full of advertisement , sometimes we can say that mass-media are maintained by advertisement ( a factory can spend a lot of money to buy space on tv , newspaper etc . ) . expecially from the 80 's / 90 's spot 's campaign became very very important to promote product . .. there are factory that spend a lot of money to study how a spot can influence the mind of the people , and how the spot can be an advantage for the selling of the specific product . the phrase that i 've red is about that most advertisement make product seem much better than tey really are . i completely agree with this statement . as i said before , in these last year the promotion of the product became obsessive . a lot of product , in tv for example , are shown like the `` perfect product '' : they are clean , positive , beautiful and expecially very very attractive . when i wa a little child i remember that i 've seen a spot about a game , i do n't remember the name , but this is not important . the game wa a plastic man with a lot of blade , car , gun , enemy . .. when i saw this spot i praid my mother for a lot of time to buy me this game , and when she bought it i wa really impressed . the man wa smaller , poorer . .. there wa only 1 blade and not all the gun that were shown in the spot . the problem of the spot is not about child ' game , but is about the lie that are inside of it . you can lie about a game it doe n't matter , but you can not lie for example about a food , about something that can cause danger to a person ( like mcdonald 's for example , if you have seen the film `` supersize me '' you 'll understand this ) ... now i do n't pay attention to the spot , ` cause i know that they lie a lot . .. but all people do this ? or i take part to a minimum percentage of people that doe n't seem to pay attention to the advertisement ? as i said before advertisement are really strong and can conditionate the decision of the people . .. and this is a factor that ca n't be left behind .
