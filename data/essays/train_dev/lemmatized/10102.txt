for me , it s important to have broad knowledge of many academic subject because i want become a manager so i must be able to have a good how know in different subject to be efficace whit a group and understand fastly what i must do or not . i must have experience and how know . but i thing also that is important that have one specific subject , one thing that we like , we love more than the other activity . for my part it s not better to have broad knoweldge of many academic subject , it s only very important if you want become a manager for exemple , but it s more important to have a specific subject that we can enjoy about it . for my part , i will work on a factory who create travel and manifestation . .. my specific subject are the sen of organisation and my creative spirit . but i need to work with different service , finance , the rule ... and i will be apple to check the work of the other service so i will have knowledge of many academic subject . in fact , i can organise nothing if i don t know what i can do or not or how i can do it . i think , first you must have broad knowelgde of many academic subject and after you can specialize on what you want . morever , i think that the most important thing to do is doing what you really want . so , i prefer
