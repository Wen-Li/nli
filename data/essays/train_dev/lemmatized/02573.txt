no , i do n't agree with this statement . because , now a day present technology is improved a lot . peoples are introducing four wheelars with different modles and different infrastructure . not only this four wheelar two wheelars also . now a day buying a car became a prestige issue . so , every people going to buy a car if they had enough money . most of the people in the society feel that if they have a car then only people respect them . now a day there is a no person without a car those who had enough money . people now a day only using car large in number . so if u consider the future day-to-day technology is improving a lot . so , people are crazy about buying a car , especially recently setled people . in olden day people were craze about buying a bike when they got settled . but the present situation is not like that , people are paying more intrest on car not bike . i want to share my one of the personal experience . consider my uncle , working a an advocate only . all of his colleague in the court are bought a car . so , inoder to show his prestige issue he simply applied for a loan and he bought a car . he consider it a prestige issue . not only my uncle people in the society are consider it a a prestige issue . i want to share my another example , i had a friend . she is younger to me . she got a job in software industry when i am in b.tech first year . before she got settled she always told me that `` i like bike very much , so when i got settled i will buy a bike '' . but two year back she bought a car . then i asked her , sister two year back you are crazy about a bike , but now you buy a car what is the reason . then she replied me `` ohhhh , where are u my dear now a day people are more crazy about car not bike , that 's why i bought a car , it also a prestige issue for me '' . so , what i conclude is according to the present technology and thought of a person ( he/she ) definitely after twenty year the usage of car will be increased a lot .
