i agree people should take the risk in new thing . it is the path to the great achievement . a new busness requires a new and unique idea . the reason is people already make the benefit from the idea that have been used . if the new businessman doe not come with a new idea , the customer and bank would not be interested in that . therefore , i agree a new businessman should take the risk in new thing rather than doing what people already know . in 1970s , steve jobs start his own computer business . in that time , no one believe computer would enter everyone 's life and become part of it . steve trust his prediction to the furture and spend his entire energy to improve computer . he doe not use dos systerm ( use word to control ) that people generally use in that time and create a new systerm that us picture to control computer instead using dos . this innovation make him successful and let computer becomes easier that general people to use . right now , steve is the chairman of apple company which is one of the larest computer company in the world . steve 's successful story becomes the modern new entrepreneurers ' goal . follwing the past idea to start a new business ha only a few chance to survive . surveying all of the past business story can give lot evidence to support it . therefore , taking risk in new thing ha lot chance rather than doing what wa doing in the past .
