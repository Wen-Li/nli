to be a broad-knowledge person or to be a specialized person depends on a case-by-case analysis . when one want to be a leader , it is better to manage a much and a broad a knowledge , while if one tends to be a technician , specialized knowledge is a better choice . having broad knowledge of many academic subject mean a person holding variety of capability . thus leader always need such ability . take the president , who is the leader of a country for example , such person always hold knowledge in many realm , from politics of course , to economics , law , management , perhaps history , psychology and so forth . since with such broad knowledge , one can understand how the society is formed and know a lot about the world . the most famous person of such kind is aristole . the broad reading and studying enable him to manage most of the subject and to be a wise man . on the other hand , since most of people who have broad knowledge often can not specialize on any subject , our sociey also need the person who ha specialized knowledge . in many industry , specialized person is more welcomed . for example , in stock market , the person who specializes on stock or finance is preferable ; in company like dell or microsoft , student who major in computer or computer science will be chosen ; also in some scientific research area , having specialized knowledge will benefit the person a lot . in one word , if one want to work in specific area , it is bettere to manage specialized knowledge . from the analysis above , it can be easily concluded that whether to have broad knowledge or one specific subject knowledge depends on the interet of a person . from my point of view , i prefer to manage deeply on one specific subject and broad learning knowledge on other area . from doing that , i can be a person with broad knowledge which may do good when i make friend since they may come from different subject of knowledge . also , with the knowledge of a specific area especially what i am most interested in , i can have a specific skill which will do favor when i apply for a job . in conclusion , the choice between these two rely on a person 's own plan for the life . to me , the combination of them is the best solution .
