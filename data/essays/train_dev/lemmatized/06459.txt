i disagree with the statement that `` young people enjoy life more than older people do '' when people were young , they have a lot of dream . `` i wanna be an astronamer , a teacher , a musician , a painter '' , and so on . they have a lot of dream . so , they make effort , compete with others . in that age , they have no idea to die , even though commit suicide . their life is fullfilled with joy , delight , hope , or the future . for financial ground , they have not to feed their child ( of couse , they have no child ! ) , they have not to cook , they have not to , they have not to , ... they can only do what they want !! when they get adult , they must work . this is the most important , and relactant thing . people say `` enjoy working '' , but they say that because they have no way out from boring life . get old mean know what who do not want to . so , i agree the statement `` young people enjoy life more than older people do '' thanks for toefl ibt !
