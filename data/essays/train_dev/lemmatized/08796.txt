yes , this right . most advertisement make product seem much better than they really are , because most product think they are better than the other . like two people play a game , some time , the loser will think the winner doe n't better than him , just because he wa lack . even the winner win the game so easy , the loser think the winner just same leavel to himself . so they always think themself is better , so they would n't listen to any body . they think they are always ture , becaues they are better than the other .
