i agree with the statement . first , nowadays there are many car in use , you can see everywhere , we use them instead of by foot , because it 's easy and fast . but the air pollution problem is became a strong problem . most car-gases be taken into the air , and we breath dirty gas into our body . when twenty yea past , i think our air will be destroyed badly . so the govement must be reduce the car production and the car will be fewer use than there are today . second , people today use car instead of by foot because they are comfotbal , but they have n't realize that step by foot is a body exercise for our health . we can stronthen our body and do more exercise everytime . third , use fewer car can reduce our traffic jam . today big city are all have terrible traffic , especally in rush time , and more traffic jam happened , whenthe car became fewer the problem will be sloved . and we are more safty when we out . became the population grew more and more , this method must be a good one . above these three reason , i think in twenty year there will be fewer car in use than there are today , and our life will be more comfotbal and safty .
