it is very difficult to think about a situation in the future like this , thus it is impossible to state undoubtly an opinion infact one should only try to imagine a situation . after thinking about this statement , i do n't believe there will be fewer car in use than there are today ; instead there will be at least a much car a there are today . i am not sure of that but i try to prove my opinion with some supporting point . first there are n't reason for thinking the cost of new car will increase and thus there will be fewer people wanting to purchase new car . infact the car factory in the industrialized part of the world produce an amouont of car that ha been constant since specialized robot , meccanization and automatione were developed . secondly , think that in the car of next generation hidrogen will be used in the car instead of oil , also with the purpose of make possible a decrease of pollution . in this way new car moving by hidrogen will be promoted and a lot of people will want to buy one .
