in my opinion it is very important to combine both the situation and i do not think that one fact is more important then the other . every education program should involves theory and then support the theory with a large number of fact to confirm the previous . i would like to give an example on what i am trying to explain . in history we can find and evaluate how idea and concept can not be separeted from fact . the second world war wa a result of the idea that the white race wa superior to any other human being in the world . the nazi idea of being superior wa supported by intellectual people scientests , propaganda and mass medium . as a matter of fact the germans were convinced that they nation wa the strongest and powerful nation in the world . now the consequence of that period in history are well known around the globe , and the fact demonstrate that the idea wa wrong and dangerous . so i think it is very important to correlate idea and fact because it is not necessarily true that an idea that seem brilliant paceful and fair ha always positive consequence when we try to put it in practice . i talked about the germans but i also could talk about the communist theory and it application in several country . a doctrine that seems fair and just reveald not to be a good economic system . as a result million of people died because of this idea . it is very important to understand the consequence of what an idea or a simple concept might lead to . it is also vital for student to estimate what exactly a concept is in the real world . an idea it is in fact something abstract . in my opinion it is always better to compare something re
