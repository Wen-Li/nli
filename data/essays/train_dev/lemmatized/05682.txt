i agree that most advertisement make product seem much better than tehy really are , and it is definately a requirement for company to sell it product more . the company ha to introduce it product in a best way to attract customer , and to make most profit . what will you do , if you have to introduce yourself in a interview at the colleage where you want to go ? i can tell most of people introduce themselves in a best way that they can get into the colleages where they want to go . this is same a why the product are different from the advertisement . the company ha to introduce it new item in a best way to attract people 's eye . did you ever go into clothes shop , which ha only looking bad clothes ? because people usually think from what they see , the company put it best effort to make it product look great . for exmaple , the advertisement of boy 's toy ha great background and sound effection , so when i wa young i used to buy after i saw adverstisement of toy . how about the food 's advertisement ? from the advertisement , everysingle food look great , because the food are colored with special ink , so they look much better than they really are . as i mentioned with two example , the advertisement make look much better the product on tv show , and i can tell everysingle adverstisements is made up for making look better company 's item . there are many people who blame about the advertisement because of the difference between real product and product from the tv , however , we need to understand the difference . therefore , making product seem much better than how product really are ture and understandable .
