i disagree with the statement that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their community . many youngster today volunteeer at hospital , old age home , or participate in animal care center and nature club . young people surely care enough about the community to help out , for the simple reason that they also belong to this community and are proud of it . many people have a general impression that young people just do n't care about their community especially in the present day . on the contrary , many young people are aware of the various problem faced by the community . there are a variety of are where you find the young taking part . many student help out in hospital where they are required to do simple thing but which make a world of difference to the patient . it show them that some one care . students join nature club or animal protection club . such group always conduct activity which benifit the community in some form or other llike building tree or caring for injured or homeless animal . the young also join community which help take care of orphanage . a lot of youngster visit old age home and spend time with the foks there . sometimes rally are held for the betterment of a certain cause in the society . this could also be thought of a a form of helping out the community . most young peole do care about their community and help out whenever they have spare time . this is because they are introduced to the problem faced by the community early in their life . in the present day , the young have a lot more responsibility to give back to the community . it is very important for young people to think about the community and come up with solution to help the problem faced by the community . the young will always help out in the problem faced by the community a they are the future of that community .
