a lot of young people i know want to live their life in a very intense way while they are still young . they think that when they get old they will not be able to enjoy life a much a they do now . but is this really true ? well , first of all young people normally are healthier than older people . so they are able to be active every day and do all kind of sport or to travel a lot . they can also go out at night till very late , have fun in bar and club . by doing so they get to know a lot of people and make a lot of friend . while still at school young people are most likely to have more free time than adult in which they can do whatever they want . they are le responsible for others than older people are and can therefore try out more thing . on the other hand older people do n't have to find out what they like , they already know it . maybe they have le time because they have to go to work , but they have enough money to afford their hobby . also other thing in life get more and more important . like family or the job . most people who enjoy their job also enjoy their life . all in all i do n't think that young people enjoy their life more than older people . i think that they have just different way to enjoy their time . and none is better than the other . it s just a process that we all go through . what we mean by `` enjoying life '' change a we get older . and older people already had their `` wild time '' - when they were young .
