in the past there were no television , pubblicity , no advertisments and so on . . nowadays are changed a lot of thing and the invention in this field have producted a lot of effect : positive and negative effect . for example . . the invention of television ha allowed the possibility to show everything , to explain , to understand and learn thing of every kind . but there are a lot of aspect that we must consider to understand clearly the situation about the advertisments that are made . i think about these question . .. if they are effectivetly connected to reality , if is all true what we can see on the screen . . or not ? first i make out that the producer that ha a specific farm , like food farm . glass farm or something else , surely want to sell his product and so i think that he pay someone that ha studied about pubblicity design to creating a sort of slogan , or to invent a way to make his product commercial and not unknow . he have to sell and make profit so he must find the best way to do it . secondly i think that people are quite interesting about `` new-entry '' , so everithing that represents something of different from before is well seen . for example new pc game that advertisment explain like a game that will change your day , or new television program , or new chocolate drink that can make you more stronger . in a sense i try to say that i agree with the statement baceuse i think that the final work of advertisments is to convinced people about the characteristic of it , to make sure them that they will see result ( like a gym advertisment , but . . do you remenber that you have to meke sport and no one else do it for you ???? ) they will change or they will be better . and how the advertisment is made is not total under controll of someone : truth and false is together and often product really seem much better than they really are . finally we must pay attention about what they really give u .
