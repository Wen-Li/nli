i agree with this sentence , because of alot of reason the first thing is that advertisement help show the new product to peaple so they can decide to bye it or not . for example i wa searching for a new tredmil so i can exercise on it and decrease my weight , and i saw one that it is so unexpensive and verry effective . but when ibought it i found that it need a lot of personal power to make it work , the thing that idid not recognize from the tv . in the other hand advertisement doe not give the taste of different food and meal , and just leave it to our imagination w hich make our mouth watering and that is faraway from the real thing finaly it make all of our dream is possible by finding every thing we thought about before , but this is not true becouse we dont have the money and even the warantee for all these thing . in short i beleive that advertisement are a very powereful way to make people bye product and some of them reflect the real thing about the putchases .
