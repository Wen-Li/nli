it is debatable whether young people do not give enough time to helping their community or not . some people say that they can not find the reason why they have to care about their community . however , i firmly believe that helping their community is quite important thing in their life . first of all , we can not live by ourselves . we have to help each other . of course that is an option and we can choose whatever we want , but nowadays , it wouldl be harder and harder if people try to live themselves . if we tring to spend our time in the community , it can be a good way to know many people who can help u when we get into a hard time . for example , i wa trying to have a my own piano recitle in my communites . and i heard that is not so easy . but fortunately i wa a volunteer in my community last summer and throught that experience , i had a chance to know lot of people who can help me. so i could have a recitle very easily because of their recommands . second of all , we can improve our social skill . nowadays , people tend to be isolated . but i dont think that is the best way to live . for example , i have a friend and she always try to be alon in her room . i thought she enjoyed her time herselfe but onday , she get a disease and it wa dipression . if she try to life out of her room , she woulnt get sick . from that time , i learned that social skill can be the most important thing in our happy life . to sum up , even if we are young and their is lot of thing what we want beside help our community , we would better try to spend more time in the community . i can say that would give you a great experience you ever had before .
