i tortally agree about this issue . in these day , the youth are extremly busy . i mean they have no spare time to help their community . the society want that young people become a perfect person . nowadays the rate of jobless people is more and more increasing , moreover it . spread wide that the entrance exam to college is most important in one 's life . because of this situation , school and their parent require them just ` studying ' . this is a middle-school student 's time table . she wake up at 7 am and then go to school . after the class ' over at 4 or 5 pm , they go to institute learning math , english , even chinese every day . they are always stressed out for their life without a chance to do something . so the reason is why they can not have time to help their community if they want .
