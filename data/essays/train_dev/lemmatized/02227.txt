in my opinion it is more important to understand idea and concept . students must deal with this mental building , a i would call them , all the time . they have to be flexible and have to know how to use them . if a student , or later a an employee , is short on fact he or she could always look them up . of course a base of fact is needed to understand idea and concept aswell a it is important to be flexible . if you do not know anything about your task you can not be flexible without a certain knowledge . but this should be just the basis on which one ha to act . students have to know and understand the idea and concept with which they are working . for example in history you have to know what happend when but if you know what happend why and you do not know the date you can put the date in a propper order because you know the idea behind it . you do not have to know the propper date of the boston tea party but if you know who did what and why it had been done you know that it wa one of the crucial point to american independence . or if you can understand the difference between to idea you can make up your own opinion on them . learning by just learning fact give you big knowledge but no own opinion or own way of dealing with idea or developing idea or concept . if one just know the key fact one could still deal with the idea . you just have to know a little about the crucial point a for example marx and engles picture of human being to know the problem of communism . the fact of the way the communism devloped and the idea differed are helpful later on but not necessarly . to sum up fact and idea have got their place but the empasis should lie on the idea .
