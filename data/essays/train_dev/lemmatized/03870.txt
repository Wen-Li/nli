i do agree that there will be fewer car twenty year from now because of quite a few reason . the population is incresinng rapidly , fossil fuel will soon be exhausted , pollution level are increasing at an alarming rate - this could be a threat to humanity if it continues , recycling all the car waste is already a big issue and there are many more reason for why car would be le used later on . these day population is growing rapidly so are the number of car . this could prove fatal to humankind a burning of fossil fuel cause tremendous amount of air pollution leading to global warming . so , it would be better to use the public transport , or actually have a car pool . with the growing technology , we could also make cost effective car that use solar power to run , hence reducing the problem of air pollution . fewer car could be a reason because of the exhaustion of fossil fuel too . this is sure to happen because of the high rate of consumption of these fuel . so , with no other alternative , it is human tendency to discover another source of energy , which look like a probable event . the awareness of the harm caused by different type of problem caused by usage of automobile is spreading like a fire . so , a time is soon to come when people are going to realise and take descions to control all the disastrous effect caused due to careless usage of automobile people will probably cycle to close destination , use the metro to commute between their home and office , walk down to the nearby store instead of driving to that place , take a local bus to travel in their city , use electric or solar powered car which would actually prove to be cheaper a they run on non-exhaustible resource thereby reducing the number of car . finally , i just hope that we become wiser , reduce the usage of car , do whatever it take to save earth from all the dangerous threat it face today and make our world a better place to live in . after all , it wa we who have ruined it , so let come together and strive hard to make it a safe place .
