some people may think knowing the fact is more important than knowing the idea and concept . some people may think in different way . what i suggest is that let student to understand idea and concept it is more important for student only to learn the fact . refer to the subject i had study in high school , some of them i can not remember it clearly , some of them i still have the class picture in my mind . the different between these subujects is the subject i still have picture in my mind is what i had interest in . when people learning something having a interest in it is more effective than having a good teacher in the class . it is not because teacher is not important but because if someone have the interest in something this will help this person learn better . to understand the idea could help the student to understand the subject more . like learning the language if someone have that language background already , it will help that person learn more effective . knowing something 's working the idea like the background that person have . knowing the concept like a person ha some experience before him to study something . everybody know have experience before then to start something could help that person to really understant the subject alot than the first time . it is a same a someone had study a subject before , this personwill ha more chance to earn a better mark . therefore , knowing the concept can not be ingored . it is the basic step to get upper level . in my opinion , it is more important for student to understand idea and concept than only for them to know the fact . usually for student fact are boring , like the meat other person had eaten before , student can not learn much about it . however , idea and concept like the fresh meat it is health and student will got a much interest in it .
