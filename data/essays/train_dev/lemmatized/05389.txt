how do you make a travelling ? quite a few people prefer travelling in a group led by a tour guide . they believe that it it time saving and more effienciet . as to me , i do n't think it is the best way to travel , to be frankly , i prefer to arrange a travel by myself . i do believe travelling is a kind of way to enjoy life , to spend sweet time with the family , the lover . it is such a time . you can make schedule yourself , the destination , accomodation , departure time , everything you like , a flexible a you want , no need to catch fast pace arranged by the tour agent , do n't worry about to rush to next destination , everything is so flexible to under your control . i love that feeling . another good benefit of travelling alone is , i think , it is possible for me to know more about the place , the local culture , the people , the special custom , etc . because i do have more time and opportunity to do many thing i am interesting . i can manage the time to stay , the place to go , so much funny thing . one more important benefit of travelling alone is the economic aspect . i can manage the travelling schedule by myself , choose the flight , the hotel at reasonalbe price . everything is under my budget control . in a word , i prefer travelling alone .
