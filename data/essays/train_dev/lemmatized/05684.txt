first of all i think that both knowledge , specific knowledge or many knowledge have both advantage and disavantages . when you specialize yourself in a specific subject you can study every single aspect of this subject and you will be very consatrated in it . for example when somone want to study business in college and he know that he want to specialize his study in marketing , it would be better for him to start directly with marketing study so he would learn every thing about it in specific way . when you study many subject you might be lost and you will have a lot of information going true your head wich could be a bad thing . you might then find yourself lost in what you want to do . for example when somebody want to study business in college but he doe n't wich major he want to do , it 's better for him to study 2 year of general business wich mean to study every subject of business like marketing , advertising , finance , international business , etc . . actually i find my self in this situation right now , i 'm doing my last year of school and i 'm going next year to college and i would like to study business but i love finance . i decided to study 2 year of business in college where i could learn extra subject and then i would specialize my self in finance . this way i would have learn other subject then finance . in conclusion i think that broad knowledge of many academic subject and broad knowledge of a specific subject have both positive and negative point . a person should decide in the best way wheter he want to study a specific subject of a lot of them .
