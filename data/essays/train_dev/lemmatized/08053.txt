in an advertisement , `` dior '' , everything look like perfect and beautiful . however , the truth is , it 's the same a you thought when you buy the product . like this , many product look better shown in the advertisement than in reality . so , i agree that most advertisement make product looke better than they are in real . the effect of this phenomenon is negative . the product are not that good such a shown in the advertisement . and also it sometime lead to a waste of money . first , the product which you saw through tv or internet and bought it because it seemed really good is not that good . for instance , one of my friend bought a mp-3 which wa publicised on tv . on the advertisement the mp-3 looked cool and it sound system sounded very good . but when he got it , the product 's shape wa not that cool a shown on tv . and also the sound system wa n't really good at all . so , he really regreted the fact that he bought it . secondly , since you buy the product which looked good on tv without checking the information of it , it 's a waste of money . often , when you turn the tv on , a lot of advertisement about movie are advertised . and it make the movie really good . so , when you go to see that movie , you might be disappointed . one day , i saw ` national treasure '' advertised on tv which looked really exciting . so , i went to see that movie with my friend and watched it . it wa really boring and i even slept for a moment . the advertisement looked exciting with action it got , but in the real movie , there were few action and the story wa inaceptable for me . i think not all advertisement make the product look better than it is in real , but most of them do . and i think that advertisement should make the product look a it is in reality .
