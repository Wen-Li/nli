what a personal statement for an advertising man a me ! i absolutely agree with the initial statement , especially for two practical reason . the first one is that advertising is a marketing arm , and we know that principal marketing mission is to place the product in the market , giving the consumer the most wicked detail to buy them , which mean a right price and many other benefit . the second one si techincal . today , photo , tv commercial , web site and promotional activity are delivered by very high digital techiniques , and almost perfect resolution . actually , we use the most effective computer program , our sofisticated machine and medium opportunity . we are also professsionals , so we use word and body copy in order to attract the client . finally , it is obvious that any product is presented in a better way . we can work on a simple still life photo for long time , reaching the best image with perfect light and colour . and again , we post-produce each film we realize , setting the most emotional point of view , the right song : you will experience few fantastic second thinking to . .. an insurance company ! i mean , we represent the `` dream machine '' , an industry that help firm to convey their own product in the better way . we are making this since one hundred twenty year , and day by day we improve ourselves . but in my opinion , the real important task is to be always honest , communicate with a cute , catching method with ethical sense . we are just giving a special make up to chocolate , car or beverage . when we will do this , we will aim all our mission : make the company client happy because of selling and say the consumer the truth , with fantastic word , far beautiful landscape , fast image on the screen , incredible solution through the net !
