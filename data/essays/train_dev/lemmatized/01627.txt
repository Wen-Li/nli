according to my personal experience i can say that it is true that sometimes advertisement make product seem much better than they really are . i agree with the statement because i think that producer are interested in selling their product even if they know that product they made are not a good a they are described by the advertisement . i think that producer spend a lot of time ( a lot of money too ) trying to create advertisement that make product much better than they really are . if an advertisement is well done , you will probably buy a product in order to try it , even if this product is not really necessary to you . you simply buy the new product althought you do n't need it at all only because the advertisement impressed you . and when you try the product you bought , or taste it , or use it , you can discover that sometimes it is quite different from how it wa presented or described by the advertisement . for instance if you are looking for something to clean away an oil 's spot from the floor and you see or read about a new product wich is the best in solving problem like this , you 'll probably buy it . but , once at home , you 'll probably discover that the product you 've just bought is not a fantastic a the advertisement said . something like the situation i 've just described occured to me . i wa searching for a new type af nail and i saw on a magazine an advertisement of a new nail with a great brigthness . for this reason i went to a shop and i boutgh one of this nail . when i tried it i discovered that it wa identic to a nail that i have before .
