for the following reason , i personally agree with the statement that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their community . first of all , young people , including myself , can not afford to spend their time for the sake of their community , because of their hard work . for example , in japan , where i live , economy remains good and stable . sumitomo electric industries , ltd. a leading manufacturer of automotive part where i work , need to produce more and more in order to satisfy tough demand from toyota motors , co. , ltd. , a worldwide car manufacturer . as a result , my colleague and i are forced to work like a dog every day and night . at weekend , we have to take a rest in the dormitory so a to prepare next week . as the example demonstrates , young people do not have extra time to help their community . in addition , nowadays , there is little opportunity for young people to help in their community . for example , in the middle of august , my community used to hold a summer festibal named a '' obon festival ' . when i wa a child , i took part in the festibal together with my friend . however , a few year ago , obon festibal wa ceased to be held because the number of child had been dramatically decreased . although i thought that i would help obon festibal when i grew adult , now i do not have an opportunity itself to support . as the example show , young people do not have an opportunity itself to use their time for their community . in conclusion , for the reason stated above , i strongly agree with the point of view that young person do not provide enough time to help their community . i believe that young people want to give sufficent time to help their community . unfortunately , a stated above , young people do not have time and opportunity to back-up their community by spending their time .
