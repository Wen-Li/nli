i think that the following statement `` it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subject than to specialize in one specific subject '' because this is a very important function . if you have broad knowledge of many academic subject you have the possibility to have a panoramic scenary to all over situation you have in your `` hand '' . with this conoscence you will be prepared to every situation . you will have a answer for every moment of your professional live . i think that many academic subject permetted at all person to be able to take all over profession . in stead of one specific academic subject do not permetted to be able to take any professional job . in end i think that this selection is prefered for me , but this is not equal for every other person .
