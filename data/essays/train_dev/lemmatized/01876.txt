today 's youth is a dynamic one , everything is instantaneous and at a rapid pace . as much a i agree with the amount of work load the people of today 's generation have , i still feel that the young people nowadays are not doing enough for the betterment of their community . people especially young people complain about the problem faced by them in their city such a traffic , corruption , crime etc . but rarely is there a person among them who is ready to jump into the system and take step in solving the problem . in my opinion if you do not have the capability to stand up and take the matter into your own hand , you should quit whining and live with what you have . the youth nowadays doe not understantd it responsibility towards it community . they maintain a very laid back attitude , caring slightly about the problem faced by the community . it is the young people who should step up and take control of a problematic situation , a it is they who are brimming with energy , have fresh idea and will be responsible for the future of their community . for e.g. in a country like india where the average age of a political leader is not le than sixty year corruption is rampant but none of the youngster feel the need to join politics and improve the condition , they feel that joining politics would mean a waste of their academic degree . for today 's youth helping the community is a very unimportant thing , for them their personal success come first . they are very self-centered and selfish and would rarely waste their time and energy on a project for the betterment of the community . they seek personal advantage first hand . seldom after a natural disaster or calamity do we see the young people helping the affected people . it is always the older people helping themselves or the young school going child collecting fund . in such condition it is the youth of the community that should step up and bring back the much needed stability . whereas instead of helping in disturbed condition today 's youth doe not bat an eyelid about it . they feel it is a waste of their precious time . an ideal example of a responsible youth would be bhagat singh a revolutionary of india 's freedom struggle who fought and even sacrificed his life for the freedom of his nation . i think that today 's youth should follow in the step of the great bhagat singh and realise their duty towards their community , and also take whatever step necessary in improving their community .
