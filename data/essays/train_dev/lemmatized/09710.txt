the most common belief that is learning and educating is the most necessart thing today 's world . learning take time and in that time there are several thing that student should be careful about them . there are many way to teach thing to student . actually there can be a debate about which learning way is more significant for student . understanding the idea and concept than to learn fact is more acceptable because of the fact that student shuold focus on getting thing in logical way in their brain , pay attention the solving problem and learning thing in detail . the first reason why the understanding idea and concept are more important is to focus on getting thing in logical way . this is really important issue because while student try to learn fact they can ignore the main point which is estabilishing the logic set . moreover student should be involved into the subject . if they are get solved the main idea and concept that can be more efficient for them . they should not waste their time by learning fact . the second reason is to pay attention problem solving . student can solve the problem or trouble that they face by understanding the idea and the concept . if student focus on the fact than the main problem this is not a useful thing for them . problem should have the priority which is the first to solve . the third reason is to learn thing in detail . this condition happens only by understanding concept . if the student doe not get the concept he \ she can not learn thing in detail . furthermore to range thing in detail need understanding the whole concept except learning fact . in conclusion it is more significant for student to get known concept than it is for them to learn fact . all the thing were considered the final decision must be that the student should focus on detail and concept to get thing done . it is more necessary for their education .
