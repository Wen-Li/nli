the issue state that there would be fewer car than there are todayin twenty year . i do not agre with this statement , moreover i feel that the use of car would be doubled in twenty year than they are today . fifteen year ago computer have been rarely found with the software industies and only with the manager of various institution and industry . but now each and every software proffesional , many student shopkeeper of various store use it . in a similar way the usage of car also rise since the car with le cost are also available in the market a person with an average annual income can afford to buy a car for the service rendered by it . a car is used a a luxurious commodity for the modern man . also it can carry many peoplefrom one place to another unlike a motor cycle . cars have been developed to run not only with fuel such a petrol , diesel which pollute the environment heavily but also with the gaseous fuel which are environmental friendly . cars using gaseous fuel are also economical . cars have also the advantage of safety carrying of diseased person compared to motor cycle . cars have also been designed for a single seater which is more economical . cars using solar radiation a a fuel is under research . such car would benefit u more . they give u more comfort to sit and even facility of air conditioning are possible in it . everybody is now used to such luxurious comfort . so people work hard to make themselves more comfortable and make his travelling easyby adopting a driver to the car where a this facility is not available with other vehicle . though bus have this facility , they may not be readily available in need of time . so in order to save most of them prefer car . people have the idea of deciding what is right or what not . they know how well a car would benefit them . many of them instead of preferring a motor cycle wait for some more timeand then have a car . so i feel that car use would be doubled in twenty year and not reduced .
