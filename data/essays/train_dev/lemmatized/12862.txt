knowing about the place you are planning to visit is an important thing to do . having enough information allows you to be more confident when the time for you to travel is coming . i usually do this thats why i 'm not so sure about travelling with a tourist guide a the best option for me . it can be a hard situation for me to adjust my time to a schedule plan , being under pressure make me feel unconfortable and with not energy to be part of a group even if that group is great and nice . i love being with people i love in a pleasure trip for example , and if i have to be with the time on my back the whole time , i would feel horrible for not enjoy the trip a i wish . i know that a tourist guide give you a lot of knowledge and experience but i 'd rather make the travel by my own and be able to know about the thing i 'm interest in . making everything i want and going wherever i want . step by step , not in a rush . that 's what i mean by saying that knowing everything i can about the place i 'm going to visit is so important . also , it feel like a boring situation to me being with a group i do n't even know , i do n't have any idea of how they are and that could be a problem when it come to share situation and happy moment during the trip . i admit that it can be exciting if i do the trip only by myself but not if i 'm travelling with the family or a large group of friend . being in a travel with a group is not an option for me in most of the time , but i can say i wo n't do it in the future .
