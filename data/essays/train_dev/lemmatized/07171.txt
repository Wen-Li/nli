of course i completely suuport the idea that most advertisement make product seem much much better than they really are . let me talk about an experience of myself , i have followed the adeverements many time in making decision and after that i found that i wa mistaking . for example , i watched on the television about a new kitchen tool which wa very nice and very cheap . in that time particulary i wa preparing my apartement and i wa looking for such thing . in the first i thought it wa very nice but after buying it i found it wa a big mistake to buy it because it spent onle one week and after that it completely destructed . another thing which happen to me while i wa looking for a insurance company for my new car , i red an announcement about a new insurance company , that advertisment wa like a dream , it said that if any small thing happened to your car it will be fixed totally free , and if the car is completely destructed , you will have a new car , when i red it i decided that i will join this company to insure on my car , after one year of joining that company and paying all my money , i made an acciedent with my car , and when i went to the insurance company , i wa astonished to hear that i would not get any money because i wa mistaken . another one more thing , when i wa look for a nice place to spend my honey mool there with my new wife i heared about a new tourism company . i went to it and i asked them for a nice place to go and they advised me to go for a certain place . but when i went there i found that every thing is very bad . so that i think that one should not follow the advertisement when shearching for any thing because many company try to sell it bad product by making a very incorret advertisement and they pay atremendous amount of money in it and spend alot of money to make it look like what we see .
