i think taking risk is a must in real life since we can not determine everything in our life . risks can lead people to earn much a well a to loose much . in fact people should consider on loosing something if they want to obtain a success . people can choose to keep on doing the thing they have been already good at , but i think by that way people force themselves to be happy with the current situation rather than trying to find out something better . for example owner of a small pizza restaurant can earn enough money to look after the family and to afford the rent of a house and a small car . on the other hand if he chooses to extend his business , he can earn more money and he can use the money for the other thing he want such a going on a holiday or buying a summer house . i am one of those people who take risk . last summer i went berlin for my summer training in stead of performing it in my country . it wa a risk because i did not know german , i had no friend in german also the company did not afford me a place to live . i believed that having a trainee in a such big company will help me soon since i would gain so much experience and also i would have the chance of working in an international company . it wa really hard for me since i had have to live in a hostel for two month with little money and i had some difficulty in communicating people . consequently i converted that disadvantage to an advantage for me . the company made an announcement that they look for engineer that can be work in their istanbul office and i am the strongest candidate for that job now . to sum up there is no limit for upgrading the situation , but it is up to people at which level they stop to upgrade . also it is up to people always ask for more invest sometho \ ing to h \ get more
