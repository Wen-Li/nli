nowadays the number of car is increasing day by day . for instance , traffic jam are becoming more and more usual not only in big city , such a new york or london , but also in small one , such a lyon or bilbao . it is known that the car is the most used way of transport and all of u use it to go every where , although gas price is getting higher and despite the polution that it creates . that 's the reason why i believe that the amount of car in twenty year wont decrease and , actually , i think it will increase for several reason . firstly , the amount of people who belong to the labor force is increasing and the unemployment , on contrast , is going down . so more people working mean an increase of fund in that people and more people who need to go to work . maybe not all of them will buy a new car but many of them definately will do it . secondly , living standars are becoming higher a time go by in the developped country . then , although some year ago there wa just one car for each family , nowadays there are usually two at least . and a living standard are going up the number of car will go up too , a parent will start buying car for each of their son and daughter . last but not least , we are living the economic explosion of some developping country a china , for instance . the economic growth in china is huge , and the increase in car sell is huge too . all the international company are going to china for both , selling and producing car , a their past production are not enough to cover the actual demand . attending to the opinion of the most famous economist , they that this economic period is expected to last many year more . moreover , this phenomenon doe not affect only to china but also to the other developping country a south america and so on . in conclusion , i sincerously believe that all of these factor to explain clearly that the number of car is going to increase , and it will be biger in twenty year then .
