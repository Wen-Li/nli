succesfull people always are researching for new thing and taking risk rather than counting only on what is dominated by them . the first reason that support this statement is the fact that `` family business '' are condenmed to disappear . if the family member do n't do something to capt new market , or to introduce new technique that make their business more effective ( reducing cost , and avoiding the competence take the leadership ) the family business will end . one example of this are the family that have been involved in a traditional bakery company . new oven technique make the bread le expensive to produce . new bread flavour make the business more attractive for old and new customer . the second reason are what i call `` the living experience '' . i can mention several name on this essay , but i will mention just only two : bill gates will not have the company he ha at this moment if his motivation to explore new market and new technoligies wa n't big enough to take some risk . he took a big risk developing `` windows '' instead keeping the old way to run program . the dos wa leading the operative system market during that time , but bill gates thought further and explored a new way to show infromation , windows wa born . donald trump would not became multi millionary if his quest for new business research , and the evident tendency of taking risk wa n't part of his attitude . his diversity go from casinos in nevada , to golf resort in california . there is a spanish saying `` do n't put all the egg in the same pot '' ; this saying match perfectly in to trump 's business vision and the need of looking for new horizon . for these reason succesfull people is always trying new thing and taking risk instead only doing what they they already know how to do well .
