i disagree with the statement that in twenty year there will be fewer car in use than there are today . instead , i think the number of car will increase . there are two reason of my opinion . first , the cost of the fuel for car will become low . in these day , many scientist are studying about alternative energy source . there research are largely supported by government and moreover , the automobile company who are anxious to meet their customer ' demand . what people want is clean and cheap energy . and twenty year is long enough time to discover or invent the alternative energy . if it is invented , people will not hesitate to change their car from high-cost , gasoline-using car to alternative energy-using car . and gradually , the number of car will increase . second , nowadays , people are becoming more self-centered . i think internet and technology made this phenomenon by providing an enviornment that people can work , play and rest alone . human being love to enjoy the individual value and riding their own car is the perfect condition to be alone . technology is progressing and after twenty year , public transportation may be incredibly faster than now . however , taking a crowded subway or bus is not a comfortable a riding one 's own car . it is hard to be ` me ' in such a crowded place . people need to feel comfortable and act unique in their own space . for example , in one 's own car , he can sing , dance , yarn , talk loudly on the phone , etc . i think people will prefer buying their car and enjoy this kind of freedom . to sum up , i do n't think there will be fewer car in use than there are now in the future ( within twenty year ) , because of the possibility of lower cost of fuel and people 's tendency to enjoy their freedom .
