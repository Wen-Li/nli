in my openion , i do n't agree with the statment that mentioned in the question and i belive that studnets should undertand idea , concept and also learn fact . all fact were started a an idea , concept , hypothesis and theory then after many research and study they become fact . incontrast , many fact and thing that we belive that they are true , they become questionable and adoubtable . for instance , i once read an e-mail that talked about the fact that americans were the first people who went to the moon which becomes questionable when a proffessional photographer provide a paper that analyis the picture that were taken on the moon by the american and political issue were involved . however , in the science and medicin feilds , many theory and idea which were under study and research become a fact and solution to many problem and disease . also , in the past day , they belived that the earth is flat and stable which wa a fact . nowdays , we all know a a fact that earth is not flat and stable . finally , i would say that student should understand concept and idea and learn fact becouse no one know what will happen after day , year or century becouse life is progressinf and science is devoloping
