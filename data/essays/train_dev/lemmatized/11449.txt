i totally disagree with the statement saying that in twenty year there will be fewer car than today . i think that there will be even more car in the future , e.g. because of the economical progress and growing wealth in some strongly populated country like china or india . the more money the people in these country earn , the more comfort they will like to have . and car are one of the most significant symbol of comfort and status in our life . so the new rich and middle class people of china and india will try to achieve this certain level of comfort and status by buying huge amount of car , meanwhile the demand for car in relatively wealthy and developed region like europe or northern america will stagnate at it 's current level . as a conclusion one can say that it will be the developing country that will rise the demand and the number of car in the world by their growing wealth and the wish of their inhabitant for more comfort . another argument to prove my thesis is the globalization and enlarging infrastructure worldwide . it 's quite common to say that our world becomes smaller nowadays . the reason for such thought is the rapidly growing infrastructure , which make it easier for many people to travel around or to send good to foreign country . in our globalized world , you need to get from one place to another in a short time , e.g. to lead a succesful business . and for moving around , you need street and car . therefore , the more our world becomes globalized and connected , the more street and car will be built . one aspect , that can influence the production and use of car in a negative way , could be the growing price for natural gas and petrol . but i 'm sure that scientist will be successful in their aim to create car which do not depend anymore on gas or petrol supply . in my opinion , in twenty year there will be much more car that are propelled with alternative or natural ressources such a electricity or ethanol made out of plant . that 's why i peronally do n't expect the high price for oil and gas to have some serious effect on the number of car .
