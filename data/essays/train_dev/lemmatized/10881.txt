currently , there are more people who help the others than before . at the beginning of the century my country suffered a civil war . people had big problem and they only tried to survive . they did not want to solve the problem of the others , they only wanted to eat and to care their family . however , right now , all the people do not have big problem and they are more implicated with their community . in my personal expericence i could explain these argument with several example . when i wa young , my teacher at highschool encouraged student to help other people in their subject , even if that student were in an other school . i felt very well because i coul help a lot of people who do not know how to speak or how to write . i remeber two girl that they were 8 year old and they didnt know how to read . i helped them twice a week during for year and they finally learn not only how to read , but also how to write . furthermore , when i wa at the university , i created with my friend one organitation that prepare conference in order to obtain money for poor people . we could collected a lot of money by doing these conference . on the other hand , right now , i usually go to the church in order to serve food for the people who do not have nothing to eat . more or le i often go to the church once a week . in my view , the people are more implicate in their community than they are before . the society ha changed because if someone explain in an interview for finding a job that he help in his community , he probably be hired because all the company want honesty in their organisation .
