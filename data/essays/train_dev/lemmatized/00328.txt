people come to life once so they might a well enjoy it a they live it . both the young and the old people enjoy life . some assume that young people enjoy life more than the older people do , in the contrary , some people think that old people would enjoy it more than the younger people a the time pass . i totally agree with the first idea . i think young people enjoy life a lot . first of all , young people tend to have fitter body . many of the activity that young people do such a to go to club , dance like crazy or ride a horse can not be done with an unfit body . for example when i make a tennis match with my mother , she give up after sometime . i definitely beat her in every match because she doe n't have that much energy . in addition to this , younger people do have healthier body . they can drink and eat without counting the calorie . they do n't have to think what would be bad for their calosterol or heart condition . hence , young people would be able to go any restaurant or cafe , and enjoy the terrific part of life which is composed of eating and drinking . the last but not least , since young people have n't experienced many thing in life , they try new staff all the time . for example i have n't done bungee-jumping before or have n't visited japan . young people enjoy life by doing new and exciting thing whereas older people have nothing great to do anymore in their life . besides , young people tend to do more dangerous thing than older people . that 's because a a person get older , he or she start to think of dying . old people do n't want to die therefore they would n't try all the fun thing in life which are most of the time more dangerous than the other thing . all in all , a i said before , young people enjoy life more than older people do because not only they have fitter and healthier body but also they have the courage to try new thing and they do so . the long and short of it all , although i would like the older people to enjoy their remaining time a much a the young generation , they do n't enjoy it and they ca n't enjoy it that much .
