looking at the rapid increase in the science and technology i feel that there would be certainly much more car on road than there are today . automobile industry form a big part of the gross domestic product for any country . a reduction in the production of car wich are the main component of the automobile industry mean a dwindle in the gross domestic product which can be a huge loss to the nation 's per caput income . no country would ever risk upon it economy and living standard of it citizen . cars reduce the distance that seem to be far off by public transport . with internet , telephone , radio and all other mean of communication and facilties such a a small pantry and air conditioner being available in today 's car travelling by a car is much more comfortable . the multinational company attract the unemployed by providing perk and facility which include providing them with car for transport . since most of the multinational company are mass recruiter so a mass recruitment every session mean a huge increase in the number of car . cars are used to provude cab facility to people who can not own one and these cab are particularly helpful to the tourist or people who are new to a place and are not aware about the mean to commute . almost all the country have specially assigned car for their government official . with the increase in the population and the consequent increase in the government official governing these people the increase in the number of car is certain . with the innovation and new scientific research being carried out everyday new car are being developed that offer a higher mileage at much cheaper maintanance cost . they are definitely better than relying on publictransport which is not really convenient at all time . owning a car mean you can move to any place at anytime along with your family so people would definitely prefer going in for the better car that are introduced into the market everyday . owning a car ha become a standard for some people that consider it to reflect their lifestyle so they will definitely prefer buying car . the people todat are much more intelligent than ever before they are earning handsome amount of money and want to flaunt with the best of car and the most modern one with the latest technology . personally i would say that i would rather going by a car instead of the public transport . not only will it more convenient to reach my destination on time it will simultaneously provide all the facility on my toe .
