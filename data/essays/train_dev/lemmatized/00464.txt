`` young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their community . ' i agree and i desagree with this statement . first , i desagree because we can not generalise so quickly what young people do or not nowadays to helping their community . instead , no everybody ha the same difinition of `` young people '' and furtherwards we have to make difference in `` young people ' : some of them are very interesting in what happen in their community and invest time in it and other young people do n't worry about it ! second , i desagree because not only young people do not give enough time helping their community , adult too . actually , i assume that young people are the most concerned with this problem but i will speak about this later . i agree for a large part with this statement . in my opinion , a lot of young people just do n't matter about what happen around them . they enjoy their life but they do n't think further than their own life in their little town ! we have to inform people about their community and encourage them to invest time to helping them ! instead , you can do both being happy in your own life and having interest in the other member of your community . and , in my point of view people do n't open their mind enough to the world . a lot of people thing about the best way to gain a lot of money and are very individual what i can understand too . but the world can not keep turnig if it is only an addition of individual people who do n't understand the importance of their community . an individual person is nothing without community around him . an other important point is that young people are the most concerned with this because they are the future member of our community . but what is the best way to senbilise young people to spend time to helping their community ? i think that could be a good subject for an other essay . ..
