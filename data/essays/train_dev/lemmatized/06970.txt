based on my personal experience , i agree that it is more important for student to understand idea and concept , than it is for them to learn fact , because the understanding of idea and concept prepare the student to use this knowlege in furter situation . fact learning may be usefull too , but is not a effective a understading the main idea . for example , there are many student that learn the fact to take a test . they might get a very good grade , but they do n't hold the information for much longer , because they learned almost every especific detail and tempted to repeat them exactly a they read it . on the other hand , student who understand the idea and concept of the topic do n't eassly forget it and can not only get a good grade , but also use this information later in a conversation about the topic or an exam where the student are tested for their general knowledge . if is more effective , for example , in a math class for the student to understand where the formula come from and how it applies , that only to learn it . in my personal experience with diferent math teacher in my school , i retained the lecture in my brain of those teacher who made u resurche and understand the formula , than those that just gave it to u and gave u a lot of excercises to practice . another reason would be , that the student that learn to understand idea and concept are also learning to think on their one , not like student who learn fact , they tempt to be more insecure , because they learned to register the information exactly a it ha been given to them and they do n't develop the abbility to agree or disagree with it .
