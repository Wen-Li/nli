in the past , young people used to help their parent and their community . but nowadays it ha changed . i agree with the fact that young people nowadays do not give enough time to their community because of many reason . helping the community is a very important thing to do but nowadays young people do not give enough time to helping their community . firstly , nowadays young people have a lot of activity . they go the college and after that they have homework to do . a lot of young people have to find a job during their study because they do n't have enough money to pay them . and after working , young people do not have anought time to do anything else . for example i am doing an european mba in a management schoolm and to pay ; y study , i have to work all evening and all week end . i also have to do my assignment and it 's a huge work . i think that in the past young people had more time to help their community . they did n't had a many thing to do a we do nowadays . i am sure that the problem is the time because young people often want to help their community but they ca n't . to conclude the fact that young people nowadays do not give enough time to their community is right . nevertheless they have many thing to do and when they can , they like to be helpfull , for their community or for their parent
