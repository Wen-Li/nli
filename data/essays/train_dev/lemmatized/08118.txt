i agree with the statement that it is more important for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact . i have two reason to support my opinion . first of all , i believe an understanding of a concept will lead to further understanding . for instance , without the primary understading of how muslim is practiced and worshipped , one will not be able to fully understand why a certain ritual exists in that religion . by understanding idea of a fact , one will also be able to develop his or her ability to think , and to interconnect different aspect of numerous information on various topic . an example will be understading the concept of darwin 's evolution theory . through this understanding , a student will not only learn a new biological fact , but he or she will also be able to connect this information in a history class when a discussion on the industrial revolution ( the time period when the theory wa first introduced ) . the student will learn that the revolution had allowed quick spread of the scientsit 's idea than before . with the combination of the biological and historical aspect of darwin 's theory , the student will be able to recognize the difficulty the scientist faced when he had informed the society his new idea , and had received many criticism about it . secondly , i am against simply learning fact , because i seek no point in merely memorizing a piece of information . even is one wa able to answer a question correctly , if the person wa unable to explain the reason for the answer , not much credit can be given . let 's say a man knew that mixing an imputiry in water will lower it melting point . even if he did know that fact , if he did not know how this could help him in a real life situation , how much would this knowledge mean to him ? what would be the point in knowing such thing ? on the other hand , if the man had the understanding that an impurity lower water 's melting point , his understanding will allow him more thinking , integrating this fact to the other knowlegde the man posse . the man will incorporate his knowledge that salt is an impurity , that snow is also a form of water , and that the ground becomes slippery when snow melt . as a result , he know that he can pour salt over snow to prevent it from melting quickly , preventing people to slip . with these reason , i belive it is more important for student to understand idea than to learn just the fact
