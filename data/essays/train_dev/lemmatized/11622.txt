i think that successful people are often people trying a new thing . because i think successful people are people who are in action , who are doing a lot of thing . and so more you are doing , so more you can change . on the other hand , successfull people are most intelligent , so that they are able to have good idea and so they try new thing . so i still agree with the appointment that successful people try new thing but i think that successful people do n't try everything . they compare the risk of the new thing with the chance of it and then they decide if they want to do it . i 'm not sure , if successful people take more risk than other people . of course , some do . but there are people that have take more risk than other and they are very unsuccessful , like hannibal with his elephant . a man who try a new thing wa henry ford , he started up a business and paid his employee 5 dollars a day , that wa a realy high sold . but it work . he wa very successfull . other very successfull men trying something new and take risk are bill gates or gandhi . i think if you want to be successfull you have to try new thing and to take risk a well . but risk is n't risk . to buy stock at the stock exchange and have n't money on the bank is not the same risk a if i have it . it 's important to make it clear what 's risk and what is really stupid . i 'm not the person who agree or disagree with such a statement , because it 's too unspecific and too common .
