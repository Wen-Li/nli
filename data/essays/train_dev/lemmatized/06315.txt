i do think , that successful people are tending to take risk and trying new thing . if one is successful in working , then he or she get work faster and more effective done than others . what doe this one do with the remaining time , while the others are still working ? first the one would try to redo work to do it in a better way of quality . second he would tend to do different thing like gathering with collegues or flirting with a woman . in this case he would loose the enhance of flirting or gathering , because it would not be , what he is satisfied by . third thing that would happen , is one would tend back to his work and do what he is payed for . evaluating his work would lift him up in a position above his collegues and in conclusion the one would be miscredited . at the end he would spend at least a part of his time in doing new thing and in taking risk . in my example , a person is automatically brought up to try new thing and to take risk , because he is better than the others . it could be a member of a company . thinking about a more daily term make the statement common . everywhere in the world people tend to do thing that make them different to other people . if you take a group of child for example , that are playing with a doll , then after a while of being involved , one of them leaf the group in the meaning of playing with a ball . ther is and there will always be one out of a group , who is leaving or who is going to take a risk . almost everyone in society ha got a special thing of doing . people are bungee jumping or are holding on to a farm with ten horse although it a lot of work to do . these are supposed to be example of people privacy . they all tried something risky in time , when they started with this special kind of sport or private activity . probably there have been relative in any of this example , that were wondering about the risk part of the activity .
