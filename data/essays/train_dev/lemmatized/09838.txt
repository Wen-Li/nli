i agree the opinion . it 's because i have really experienced such case . i love a model of the fashion magagine . besides , if she wear something cloth , it encourages me to buy the same one , only by seeing the shot . however , actually when i visit the shop of the cloth , it doe n't suit me at all . some of my friend said to me that they have experienced such a me . therefore , like this , it is common for advertisement to seem much better than they really are . we can say in other occasion . like my experience , people is easily made to want product that popular and famous people for example , artist , model , actor or actoress , used . companies use this method . therefore , today , we can see advertisement in many case . these are commercial in television or radio , on newspaper or magagines and finally even in train or bus . take an example on online shopping on tv . the buyer show u his/her pleasure after using the product on the screen . or , the clerk or famous actor appear on the screen , then they insist that the product be good . then , people that saw the tv program make their mind into buying the product . until we touch the product directly , we do n't know whether the comment on the screen is true or not . besides , the clerk emphasizes that the product is cheap , or with some present only now . it is the way of showing good by the clerk . so , the more effectivelly they introduce the product , the more people want to buy it . therefore , i agree with the statement .
