in order to contextualize an specific academic subject , there ha to be a broad knoledge of many academic subject . the balance between the general knowledge one gain and the specific knowledge one pretend to obtain is an important one . both knowledge are co-dependant and inter-related with each other . in my personal academic experience , i could say that the general knowledge in the hummanities department , the physical education department , the antrhopology department and the social sciences department ha led to a more profound and mature understanding of my specific field of study . my undergraduate proposal wa to combine all these field in the performance art , thus enhancing the possibility of a more organic and interdisciplinary approach to them . by combining physical training ( in theatre art and physical education class ) with physcology , anthropology and humannities class , one can achieve a more integral view of the human being within it ' s context . by expanding knowledge into various field , the being can enhance theatrical and creative performance in a self-concious way . the body can therefore express it ' s integration in society by developing a language that articulates racial , academic and social background . in other word , the body becomes a didactic space that express it ' s knowledge and transmits it to it ' s public . the spartans believed that a healthy mind in a healthy body is what made an integral citizen . my undergraduate program reiterates this position and expands it by incorporating the body in the `` wholeness '' of academic development . if one want to be an instrument of knowledge for it ' s society , then one ha to acquire a certain general knoledge of all academic field , in order to transmit a concient and integral discourse to society . my specific knowledge field , performance art , is a great tool to transmit this discourse , using the body a a `` connector '' with it ' s society .
