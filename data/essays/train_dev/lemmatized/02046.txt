i am in complete agreement of the statement that it more important for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact , due to several reason . first , understanding of any concept or idea or one can say the concept behind the idea will ultimately lead to the `` fact '' . at this stage student will be able to figure out the underlying principle behind the fact . in other word they will be able to understand the principle governing a fact . for example , if you throw anything upwards it will come down , this is a fact . now in other word we can define this phenomenon by first introducing the concept of gravitational force . moreover if add a little detail to the concept that if something is thrown at it certain velocity will not return to earth , it becomes more interesting . now at this stage the student ha understanding of the concept fo gravitaion . he will be able to understand the rule guiding the fact and he would move one step further to understand that critical `` velocity '' . this make learning more fun and open door for exploring idea . secondly , learning only fact without their understanding will invoke sense of mugging . the student will not bother about the hidden principle and this will restrict their scope of education . in the general situation also we hardly bother about other rout to a destination if we have a shortcut , if it fullfils your requirement , even though it congested and polluted . so it a general human tendency . finally , if we limit our scope of knowledge then what would happen to the billion of book in the liberary ? isnt it worth thinking of ? access to the knowledge is a fundamental rite , limiting learning to fact only will definetely hamper in one or the other way of a person fundamental rite .
