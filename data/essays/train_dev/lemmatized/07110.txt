due to the convenience of the transportation tool nowaday , people have more chance to travel to a different place or country which teny do n't live in . there are several way of travelling . you may plan a trip by yourself or led by a tour guide . it is hard to determine which way is better since it depends on the place you want to travel and the budget you have . the most obvious adventage of travelling in a group led by a tour guide is the le transportation and living charge . you can book the flight ticket and hotel room with speciall discount because of more quantity of people . this is a very attractive reason to those people who do n't have enough budget but still want to relax after a log hard work period . furthermore , you do n't need to worry about which place should be worth to be visited with a touring guide in an infamiliar country beacuse the guide will summarize all visting site for you in your trip . you definitely wo n't get lost in a city once if you have a tour guide . however , you may not have the oppertunity to know a city or country in advance if you join a travelling group with a tour guide . the tour guide can lead the group when travelling but that mean , in the same time you probably ca n't go to some other place which are not in the schedule you personally want to visit . you have to compromise with other parterners in the group and miss several sight you want so that everybody can travel to the same direction together . for the person who really want to explore a city , the travelling group is not able to satisfy his requirement . from the above argument of travelling in a group led by a tour guide , there are still several disadvantage of this travelling type . therefore , i do not agrre with the statement : `` the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide '' .
