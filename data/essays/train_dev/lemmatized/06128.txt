i agree with the statement that said `` successful people try new thing and take risk rather than only doing what they already know how to do well . the reson why is because nothing is fair . life itself is n't fair because if life wa fair why there are a group of people that are suffering and a group that is rich . in my view to be successful in this type of life we living on today take a lot of risk because to me being a successful is that when a person finish with school , have the type of job that he or wanted , and have a family . for example school is n't easy there are so many step a person need to finish with school . that 's is the reason why today most teenager are dropping out from school . i believe in myself a lot i know that to be successful a person ha a lot to go through . according to an article that i 've read said a lot of freshman dropped out from colllege because the course are to diffcult or they get drunk and get kicked out from there . however i think the statement based on the article because successful is just word if the colllege freshman step up than they will be successful which is they can get their college diploma . the article and the statement touch me a lot the people that get kicked out from college could have been me , my family , or you . as long a we know what there for nothing could step on our way . successful people try new thing and take risk rather than only doing what they already know how to do well is just a sentence everyone can achieve it . if you or me is n't afraid of taking risk .
