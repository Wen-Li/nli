the young people in any community are the base of future if they are work will for their community the community will be high class . the aquition is the community give these people the appurtonity to helping in developing process ? i think no . the community did not give the young people the appurtonity to helping in developing process . becouse the comunity today is just thinking to collect money by any way . one of the dagerous way is collecting by drug which is channeled to young people like puim and heroin . also the comunity today looking for anjoyment regardless which type of enjoyment is clear and dont have problem for young poeple like sex movie or by enternet . in some country they let young people work hardly long time under no safe condiotion like in some industry in some country of asia . to say the trouth some country give the young people a big chance to educate from first year to graduate of unversity . and tese country have some club for improving the thinking of young people but these country are not much . finally the young people need more and more appurtonity to helping their community in developing process .
