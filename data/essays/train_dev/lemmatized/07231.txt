in my opinion , i agree with the statement that said most advertisement make product seem much better than they really are . in my passage i am going to explain why i agree with this statement . also , i am going to explain why some company do this kind of advertisement . i accept this idea because i saw many kind of advertisments that make the prodoucts better than real . they are dozen of reason that make the company make this kind of advertisment . but in my opinion i think the main reason is the compititon spirit between company . this spirit make the company try to interduce thier product a a best product in the market , and some time those company do n't have the quality to produce this product then they have to produce an advertisment make customer think this product or this offer is the best choise , but in real this is wrong and the advertisment make the customer chiose this option . in conclusion , the advertisments is an industry and company use this industry to show thier product in the best way , even if this product doe n't have the quality .
