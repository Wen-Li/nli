i agree with statement that the best way to travel is a group led by a tour guide . there are two reason why , trovel is in a group led by a tour guide is cheeper than private and we may know tour guide recomend place first of all , in a group led by tour guide is more unexpensive than private travel . for example , in private , an airplaine cost 3000 dallar for america from japan . but use the tour industry service wichi can dicline the cost of plaine to 15000dallar . however involve the food and hotel . it is very cheep . second , we could visit a wounderful place if i joined the tour group . guides know a lot of good place in there country . tour guide must study hard about sightseen to become . so tour guide is professional of travel and sightseen . all of there reason i sustain that the most good way to travel is a led by a tour guide .
