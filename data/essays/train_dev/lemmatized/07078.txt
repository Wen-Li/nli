with the rashly development of the automobile industry in the 1950 's the use of car increased exorbitantly . by the following year to date most of every household posse at least one car or sometimes more than that . after this explosive growth of applying a car the awareness of polluting and damaging the environment is also increasing . this ha been happening in the 1960 's when the hippie movement wa on their peak . this mean that up from then the people begin to think about the consequence of using a car and particulary using a car for movement for which a car is n't necessary . they also started to consider what kind of aftermath their behavior will have for their child and the child of their child . they recognize the impact of the using a car for the environment , for example they receive that the high use of pollutant like car can be harmful for the ozon lawyer . the turnover of conduct and so the try to treat the environment more carefully can be also found in many politcial strategy or in new law for protecting the environment . but in my opinion this changed thinking can be only found in industrialized country like in the united state or in germany . most of the far east continent like asia are the contrary . at this time they are getting through their industralizing process . there the car use will be increse for the next twenty year . independing on this situation in asia i finally agree with the statement that in twenty year le car will be used for the reason that some part of the world have noticed the influence of using car for the environment and necessitiy for acting now against the alreadz done damage . due to this awareness the decrease of using car will recorded in twenty year .
