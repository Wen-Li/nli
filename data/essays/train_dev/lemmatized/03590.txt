today 's youth is a busy and stressed one . too busy to interact with their community and their surroundings . young people have responsibility such a school and afterschool activity a well a the desire to have a social life . it is because of these element that i agree that young people nowadays to not give enough time to helping their community . as a highschool 12th grader , i must admitt that the mayority of people my age to not have time to help their community . school is a hectic responsability and homework is increased throughout the year . when i have time off , i need to work on future homework assignment or on organizing my time for the other responsabilities that i have prioritized a more important than my community . another element in young people life that take away from helping the community , is afterschool activity . as an avarage highschool student , i take swimming class afterschool or help the student council set up school event . if i am not working for the school or for my physical being , than i am in town practising for my sats . i spend most of my weekday worrying about my grade and my reponsabilities a a grade representative , than wondering what i could do to help the community . once school and afterschool event are over , i use my weekend to relax and go out with my friend . young people nowadays do n't really care about the community and rather worry about their own problem . if you ask young people what they find most important you will realize that their answer is selfish , in that it only think about themselves , because they only have time to worry about themselves . in conclusion , young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their community out but , it is only because we lack the time to do something about it . if our life were more organized and le occuppied , perhaps an interest in helping our community would surface .
