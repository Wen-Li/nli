i think that we should have broad knowledge of many academic subject instead of specializing in one specific subject for many reason like : people will know more about life and about who thing work , also , they will be more prepared to serve their society better because they know more , finally , they will help in developing thier society because they are more educatied . first , when we give people broad knowledg , they will know more information then if we only give them one specific subject to study . they will be know a lot of information which they need in their daily life but if you specify your subject , there will be a lot of thing you dont know about or have not heared about . if people had broad knowledge , they will be mor prepared and will help and assist their society . during thier work time , general iformation which is gained through broad academic studying will help the worker a lot to do their job in a better way . unlike specifing which will lead into a narrow stock of information . when you train people and teach them about everything , they will becom a great help in developing thier society . there will be more thinker and inventor who can connect between large sum of information and that in it 's self will help society to develop and will benefit future generation . but if we only studied one specific subject , people will not be a helpful a if they studied more and gained more knowledge . finalley , for those reason , i think we should give people a broad range of academic subject ineasted of specializing in one specific subject .
