`` concepts are never change '' according to this concept and idea behind any material or immaterial thing never change just they modify but fact will change so in my point of view i would go with to understand the idea and concept are ippmortant rather than fact . in my personal experiance , when i wa in a school , taught by a techer how to operate the machine learned about the basic princilpes and concept in operation but that time i wa not used when i grow young accidentally i have to operate it but i done it , so this show how ipmortant uderstanding concept . it lso imporant in moulding career of student , once they get acquiented with concept and idea they will never forget for example in college they conduct demonstration , powerpoint presentation these are all driven by concept and idea fact may change in addition to this practical experiance which also come under the category of understanding concept if we learn on ourselves never forget . for example in demonstrasins they they demonstrate how to use a particular thing but topic may varies like fact here the demonsttion is ubnderstanding learning fact are not always desirable in some case , for example galelio proved that earth resolve around the sun this is fact but according to christian thoery this shoudnt be for he wa exceuted but later on year it proved the same . so fact always change never worried about the fact we should understand the concept and idea
