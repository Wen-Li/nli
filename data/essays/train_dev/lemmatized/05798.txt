`` in twenty year there will be fewer car in use than there are today '' i completely disagree with the above proposition due to the following point technological innovation : the above proposition actually take a backward step with respect to the world which is evolving technology at a breathtaking pace . in the next 20 year the technology would be so advanced that car would be more efficent , more cheaper and environmental friendly . with the way automotive innovation are progressing , a time would come when everyone in the world would opt for a car . industrialization and development : till date the majority of car are found only in the developed country . but with aggressive industrialization and development taking place in the developing country which constitute a major consumer base , the scenario would completely change . in the next 20 year , the developing country would reach a stage where people in these country would have more earning power and a raised standard of living . this would naturally translate into more buying capability which would mean that , 20 year from now , majority of the of car would be driven in these developing country . this in effect would increase the already existing number of car . emerging markets : it ha been estimated in the next 20 year , developing country like india , brazil and china would increase their economical prowess to the extent comparable to the like of u.s and the european union . as these 3 country constitute a major chunk of the world 's population , they would naturally form significant market for all kind of consumer good which would also include car . with the explosive and continuous growth of these developing country , there is no doubt that there would be a high growth trajectory for the number of car plying on the road in future . hence the above 3 factor are the principal reason why the above proposition stated is false .
