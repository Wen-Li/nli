nowadays the student are based on the believe that the know anything , they do not listen their parent , and a bad behavior is noted by them . i think that student preffer understand idea and concept because for a student that is frecuenly a teen agger it better lear the idea and develop that idea and concept . in some case the student preffers the fact , because like i said before student are teen agger and we have to know that is the basic of anything . i said that are another case because like she used to said my grandmother `` we learn of hit '' . we can say that a student is know that he ca n't pas one subject he start to worry about and until this happened he is not really that he ha to study a stay in class . the fact in some case are needed to , thats the reall test for the student , if he ca n't do what he want to do , what can he do ?? , for other hand are some student that are very applicated and they do not need the hit to understand the main idea and concept that a teacher explain . when i wa 15 year old , i always wa the kind of student that know everything and that i can always do anything and i always believe that i wa the better , one teacher , put me back on earth , because i have to graduated not happy , for all the work that i had to done , that subject take me 2 year to pas , and then wa when i noted that for the university i have to understand concept an idea and not hited me again like i did when i wa a kid .
