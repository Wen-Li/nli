i disagree with the argument that it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subject . actually , it might be helpful to have many knowledge but objectively , that is unnccessary than to specialize in one specific subject . anybody have many other knowledge by useing some time . but if to specialize in one specific subject . than you will get more specific knowledge that other people do not know about it . it is more useful to have the knowledge . for example , let say you are the owner of the company and you want to hire some one for marketing section and there are two people who went just a university and aother went a specific business college . who do you going to hire for your business ? i am not saying that the just university person is bad but , objectively , i will hire the specific business college . because i want the person who have a idea of a specific section , which is business and who have lot of knowledge at the field . and not only my question but also the real world is like that . there are lot of people who are achieve at their field such a ceo of microsoft , not only he wa good at but also he wa ti soecializ in one specific subject . may be to have broad knowledgeof many academic subject will help you to decide your field but if you have your goal alraedy than i suggest that to have knowledge in one thing . and eventhought you think it is waste fo time but do not stop . because no body will going to have that your effort and you will get the golden age for your appreciate .
