before i begin to write about my opinion i would like to axplain the statement within help of some example . to me idea are the basic structure of behaviour . before you act you always have an idea . for example if you want to become a succesfull lawyer , you have to have the idea to attend to a law school and graduate with good grade and also you have to be socially alive . i believe that understanding ; even knowing the idea and the concept do n't help u to reach to the fact all the time . sometimes whatever we do , wo n't be enough for living the fact . facts are learned by living , not by idea or concept . for example imagine that you know what an orange is made of . or let 's say that the thing that we know about orange is - it 's colour , that it 's juicy - is it enough for u to tell about it 's taste ? of course not . our idea about orange ca n't make u think about the orange 's taste . in the end taste is the fact here and the only way we can reach to that fact is by tasting it . i believe that not only student , but also all people can learn the fact by living , not only knowing the idea and concept . in the world we are living now , all that matter in the end , is the fact . we need money to survive = that is a fact . i can earn money by working a a barmaid = that is an idea but what if the idea do n't work ? there are some thing in the world that we ca n't learn them only by idea and concept . what we need is the one hundred percent fact . facts hurt people , fact make people happy , fact even kill people . another example , when we steal , the place we belong is jail . that is another fact . it ha nothing to do with idea and concept . people learn from fact and fact make people avoid from making mistake again . as i briefly stated above , to me learning fact are more important than understanding idea and concept .
