`` the object of travel is not only seeing other scencery but also experience a lot of thing . '' this is my opinion about the travle . thus , i do not agree with the topic . i will stated briefly the two reason supporting my opinion . first , the reason why it is better to travel without tour guide is that people can feel foreign people those who live in that country . actually , in my experience , i went to the uk with my freind few month ago for enjoing hollidays . we just walked what we want to go , during going to other place , we needed to ask how to we get there to someone . during this , i did talk many people , also i made a foreign freinds . however , if peole in group with guide , there is no chance to meet and talk to foriegn people . second , the reason why it is better to travel without tour guide is that if there is any limit to travel , people could enjoy your trip freely . there is no time limit , so people can go anywhere what they want . for example , i went to snow festival in seol ak mountine with tour guide . there are so many routine in mountine but i should fellow the guide . and there wa always time limit to comback somewhere if i go someplace what i want to go . it wa bad memory to me . if someone go to trip , so , i will recommend enjoy travel without guide . it let them have a time more happier trip . to be encapsulated , the 2 reason which i mentioned above make your experience abundantly such a making a freind who live in other country , going to a lot of place what you want . thus , i think travling without guide is better way .
