i disagree with the this statement that there will be fewer car in use in next 20years . i think people drive more car than nowdays . in the future , people will have more money than now , and there will be many place to go to enjoy life . also people will think privacy so important . so they would not share the car . many kind of car also effected that there would be more car than today . as time go by , world is becoming so convinient place to live in , and technology improves fast . people will have more money than now , for example my father boughts first car when he wa 30 , but nowdays many university student have car including me. many young people prefer to buy car when they grduate highschool , because they have enough money to pay the car . also there are lot of place that people can play . as economy is developed people prefer to go to outside in the leisure time . because of young people ha many chance to earn money , they go to lot of place with family , girl friend , and friend . so they want to have their own car . because it is easier to go there when they have their own . in the future , worth of privacy would become more important . the socilal life would be very complex and stressful , people want to go somewhere alone in their free time . as for me , when i have so much stress i drive alone to beach . also people doe n't want to somebody interrupt when they want to rest . for example when i wa dating with my girl friend i hate to somebody is wathing me or talk to me . if they have their own car they do n't worry about somebody disturbs them . last of all there would be various car to drive . there would be various desings of car . so if soomone who ha lot of money , they world try to many car , such a sport car . in future , people would have more money , and have many chance to spend thier money . they will buy their own car to go to many place easily and doe n't want to share the car . also various type of car would make rich people want to drive that car . for these reason , i think there would be more car than nowdays .
