i agree that young people do not give enough time to help their community in these day . people have to work individually , but they also should work for the group that they are a member of . not a spesific group i mean , they have to participate in public , for example in a school , or in a family . teenagers are not familiar with their responsibility a a student and also a a family member . usually , people start learning to be a part of community in a family . children should study lesson , show respect to older member , when parent should work for the family , and help their child to become a better adult . besides the general idea , they also have to love each other and should have a good relationship . unfortunately , young people avoid to be closer to their parets . they do n't listen the advice an experienced adult can give , instead they start getting away from their home . teenagers even want to be with their unknown friend , rather then spending time with their brother or sitsters . another example where young people show responsibility is their school . they have to participate to class , study for exam and also study for the future to get a good job . recently , student think school is somewhere to get away from home , or have fun without any preparing for lesson . they see the rule a challanges that they have to break and get attention . then school diciplines have more strict rule to control them . so the community they try to work fell apart . teenagers should give some of their freedom to have a peaceful school life . to conclude , young people should sometimes act like a grown up to control their life better . if they can be a good student , friend , sister/brother , daughter/son , they can create a better community and they also can enjoy where they are and what they are doing .
