when we turn on a t.v. we always see advertisement which look good and useful to u . it is so common to see advertiseements from anywhere and it is true that advertisement make product seem much better than they really are . people know this and they know product is not that good and not needed , they try to buy this because of famous person advertising it or it fake view change people 's mind and people are greedy and advertisement use this people 's mind to make there 's look better than they really are . teenagers always love famous star and who they see a a roll model . even adult think they want to be like a famous star . when they see advertisement with their favorite star or roll model , it make people to buy those thing so they could be like them . this is fact true because there are many brand succeded from this advertise . product wa actually same , however they changed their model for their product and they began to have a great success . this happened because many girl like this star and many boy want to be like this star . this resulted childern to go to this brand and buy thing . this example tell u that eventhough it is same product , it depends on advertisement and who advertises it . people always believe what they see and believe in it . when people see advertisement in tv or newspaper , they see the product which look and work much better than it really are . for example , there wa a advertise which wa about clay which stiks all thing to wall and never droped even heavy thing such a ballingball . this gave an effect to people to buy it because it holded heavy stuff and it could be removed easily . however when people bought this they could not even put picture on to it because it fell out so easily . this show u that what we see in tv are thing that are overacting product and it look much better than it is . all people have greedy mind and that is just human . advertise always use this to sell and make their product look popular . in advertise they always say they are going to get sale order for 10 minute and they will be done . however you can see this advertise next day also . but people think that they are really going to get sale order for 10 minute and they order for it because of they want more benefit . for example , if i say to people who ha not been to empire state building that ` empire state building tour will be closing in one week ' , than they will say ` i should go there before it close ' . this is people 's mind and people are greedy like that and advertise us this inorder to make their product popular and good . as mentiond above , people always see advertisement when they are living because advertisement is everywhere . people always try to do same thing a what their favorite roll model or star doe and star always advertises . also what they see in tv is always over described and what they say is kind of a lie such a being saled for 10minuntes and there are only 100 product left . this is all trying to make their product look better and it make the product look better than they really are . therefore , we should not depend on only advertisement when we are buying product .
