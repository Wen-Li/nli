i disagree with this statement . first , we can approuve this kind of opinion because we often heard about successful people whose success wa a response to an new idea . for instance , people who develop the chain-work in the industry of automobile used to take a lot of risk . they did n't know if the demand wa big enough to develop this kind of mass production , but they choose to take the risk and they were successful . that 's why the statement we discus is not totaly wrong , but i think that it 's not true . my point is that i think that trying new thing and taking risk are two of the key factor to be successful , but are not caracteristics of successful people . there are other factor to run well a business , like good opportunity . sometimes , you have a real good opportunitie and you choose to try , and that 's the key of your success . moreover , there are a lot of successful people who had a good idea at the beginnig , but who do n't take new risk for year . for instance , bill gates is a realy successful person , but he doe n't take risk nor than he try new thing . he had develop the most famous firm in computer engineering , but he did n't try to diversify his activity . moreover , a lot of successful people based their success in a very particular field . they choose to become the best in what they do , and they do n't want to change their image by trying new activity . so , they do n't try new thing , they do n't take risk but they are successful because they know exactly how to do well what they do . this is exactly the opposite of the statement we have to discus . and i do n't think it 's wrong . to conclude , i think that there are not only one way to act when you are successful , and that 's why it 's really difficult to run a successful business . every successful business manager is different , and take different decision than an other manager in a same situation .
