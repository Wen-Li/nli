i disagree the statement that the best way to travel is in group led by a tour guide . recently even one tour package is becoming a product of commercial society for fun . i want to define that traveling is experiencing new space . unfortunately , current people are attracted in luxurious or expensive tour package . there is a reason why i do not agree that statement . the reason is that if you travel alone or with your friend without a tour guide , you would experience something exciting or new definitly . for example when i wa in high school , i and three friend of mine went to travel without money or any availible item . we had to deal with most difficult situation . we caught fish in the river to make our dinner and gathered wood for fire . we felt that it wa very terribile and hard but now the only thing i can remember about travel in my life is that no money travel . after the travel , i can have more positive attitude and strong capacity . it is a valuable gift that the travel give to me . so i recommand that if you want to experience something exciting and interesting , you must leave now alone or with your friend . do not worry about money or hardship . the travel would give you more valuable thing than money or comfort from luxurious tour . in conclusion , i disagree that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide . if you try to experience new , leave now . the only thing luxuriuos travel can give you is reducing your money . take a risk and you will achive something .
