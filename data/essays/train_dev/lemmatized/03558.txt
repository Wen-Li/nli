i clearely disagree with this statement above for the following reason : maybe on a first impression , young people often seem to have more fun because they are able to take part in activity like doing sport , going to party and traveling . clearely , some of these activity ca n't be done by older people mainly for physical reason . but on the other hand , there are still many activity remaining that are even more suitable to be done by older people : first of all , there are characteristic way to engage in sport for older people , like hiking , swimming and playing golf and chess . they even may have the advantage of perhaps having practiced this kind of sport for several year and can now acchieve greater , more satisfieing success . second , there are a lot of opportunity to meet other people in several club or on bus tour . in these occassions they may even meet people that share the same interest . finally , a lot of old people start traveling all after the world once their done with their career . at this point , it is important to mention , that in an older age one ha a much greater amount of freetime he can use for any of those activity he like most . that 's due to the fact , that in childhood and youth one ha to go to school , to study or to work in a job . i personally know older people , who really began travelling all over the world because they finally had the time to do so . so it is obvoius , that there many possibilies for older peo so finally , one can conclude , that you can only answer this question for yourself , depending how `` fun '' is definded and how it can be measured in your eye .
