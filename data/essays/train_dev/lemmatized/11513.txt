i strongly agree with the idea that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide . there are three advantage for this : cost , time , and good place to visit . first , it is much cheaper to travel in a group than travel alone . in group travel , i can take discount . for instance , if i try to go to sydney , australia , the return ticket may cost me more than 200,000 yen . however , if i choose the travel agent 's plan , it 'll cost me around 100,000 yen . it is ridiculous to pay such a high price to travel alone . there are many fee for trip such a accommodation , meal , or entrance fee . if i join group tour , i can take discount all of them . therefore i can save a lot of money . second , i do n't have to worry about schedule . tour instructor always know about location , if some trouble happen , the tour instructor always cope with to adjust the plan . and they well know about history , so they simply and kindly explain u about the sightseeing spot . if there are some trouble during the trip alone , who can look after me ? third , i can travel a lot of good and nice place to visit . if i travel alone , it is much more difficult to arrange bus , train , or plane than joining group tour . if i went for a trip by me alone , sometimes i might take pain to kill time , and sometimes i might about to miss the transportation . however , if i join a group tour , i do n't have to worry about it . i 'll have more time during the trip , and that mean i can visit more good sightseeing spot . in conclusion , i strongly agree with the idea that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide .
