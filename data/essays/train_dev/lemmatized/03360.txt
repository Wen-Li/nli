in my opinion , it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subject than specialize in one specific subject . my reason are a follaw : first , a a student , a young person just specialize in one specfic major is not enough for she or he to face the competitive world . nowadays the glloballizition is coming ture the difference about work abality between employee from different country are le and le but the devoloping county worker ask for le paiment . so when we want to get a good job we ought to manage varity knowledge of many field to improve our interrior value . second , knowledge from all kind of sudjects may give you new view piont when you look at something , especialy something you are fammilly with . for example history can tell you how thing happend many year ago and even can give you some usefull advises when you aregoing to make a important chiose , while math will tell you someone is just a formular person are hardly able to change it we just use it . that make you clever so i think broad knowledge are better .
