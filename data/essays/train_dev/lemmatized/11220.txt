the future ha always interested human being , a well a technology . we happen to wonder about several topic , like guessing if there will be fewer car in use in twenty year than there are today or not . we could agree with this statement and think that there will be other way to move around in the future , but we are not sure of anything for now . this is the reason why i believe in car rather than in future technoligies , such a flying ship or so . we can evoquate the presence of the train and the plane , which have a rather good success among people nowadays than in the past . this would be a good point , because people take them a lot more than ever . this is due especially to their efficiency and safety . they are faster than a car and safer , for example . some of u might prefer to travel by train or by plane since we do not have to drive or to focus on what is going on , and that we can fit a lot more people in these mean of transportation . however , it is rare to arrive exactly where we want to by train or plane . that is , we will still rely on someone to come pick u up at the train station or at the airport . to my mind , i do not think that there will be fewer car in use in twenty year . indeed , people are buying more and more car , a in the united states . other country are beginning to do the same . everytime we need to go somewhere , it is becomimg automatic : we take the car . this is faster and easier for un since we do not have to walk or do some physical activity . human being are becoming dependant on their car . this is another reason why i think there will be more car in use in twenty year . in conclusion , i do not agree with the statement given , but in the pursue of the car industry . the car ha become a part of human ' life ( for most of u ) , therefore i believe it still ha good day to come .
