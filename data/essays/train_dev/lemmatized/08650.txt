getting to know many academic subject would be helpfull in life to know different thing , but knowing one subject is also a good thing . the advantage of studying one major subject help you in applying in a job and concert your mind in one subject to get a very good mark in collage . example to make you understand more , if you want to work a an engineering for car you would study physic and math topic , but if you studied in everything wonot help you because you wonot need all that knowledge in this specific work . the disadvantage of studying one major subject , is that if you changed from engineering to pilot work your study wonot help you in that section and you would go again study more in that section so that is the advantage of studying in more academic subject , and if you open a supermarket and you donot have the knowledge in running business that would make your business fail . in my opinion i would prefer to take study in many academic subject so it would be helpful in managing your life , if you tried to change the way of life , but studying in many academic subject will make you feel tired in our collage year but you would rest in the last , and having a good knowledge in everything that happens in your daily life . plus in university you my would take different type of subject that would variy in many .
