in the past 10 year , i have traveled in my own country and in all over the world . the best trip wa going to australia by myself in my early 20 's . it wa my first traveling oversea . and i enjoyed to experience the new world . there wa only once that i traveled in a group by a tour guide which wa one of the high ivents . i had a lot of fun with traveling in a group though , but now , a i am looking back to the old memory , i do not agree that the best way to travel in a group by a tour guide . there are two reason why i would rather traveling by myself than taking a group tour . they are feeling freely to plan my own trip and spending time and expence a i want . first of all , i do not want to go a place where i am not even interested in visiting . i would like to plan my trip for just for myself , to visit how , or where i want to go . another reason why i want to travel alone is that i do not want to spend time and money to go , or to watch thing . it is a very precious and limited time when i decide to travel . for those reason why i do not agree with the statement are feeling free to plan my trip and spending time for myself that the best way to travel is in a group bt a tour guid .
