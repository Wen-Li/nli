facts are the core of life . with out fact you can not draw conclusion , build a hypothesis , or even dream of a different course . you can say that a fact is the basis where idea and concept emerge . lets take organic chemistry for example . a mighty complex subject that many student , the one who are dreaming of medical school , pharmacy school and the like stand hand tied to understand what is a really easy subejct in it core . only if you know the fact . to undrestand what that mean you have to know few basic fact about the carbon , the hydrogen , the nitrogen , and the oxygen atom . for example the number of bond each must posse in order to be stable . carbon need four bond , hydrogen need one , nitrogen three , and oxygen two . another fact is that each atom will always search for it stable state , and chemist call that , the le energy state . knowing what we know about bond and atom we can explain organic chemistry in a new light . its the strive for the atom that make the molecule we have arround u in the air , the ground the sea and so forth to stay stable with the least energy possible . and from that we can introduce the idea of atomic orbitals and the concept that ha been used by scientist to show how these orbitals strive to make the atom stable and functional , in other word survive . and using the concept of atomic orbital we can draw an extended concept for the molecular orbitalsfrom the concept of the molecular orbitals we can take it further to understand the way the molecule react with each other to form new molecule and so forth . from the fact you can project hypothesis and idea that can be proven right or wrong a time go on . but there is one thing that you can not change and thats the fact . the water color will stay colorless , the fish will still swim in the sea not the land , and the carbon atom will have four bond till the end of time , and that is a fact .
