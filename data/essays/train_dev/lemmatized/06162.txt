i think young people definately enjoy life more than old people do or ever did . in the olden day , there wa a lot of responsibility on the shoulder of the younger generation . however , the more laid-back lifestyle of the 21st century allows youngster to have more than their share of fun . nevertheless , there are always limit a too much of a good thing is also bad . with all the responsibility on the older generation , the younger generation doe not even feel the need to be role model for their sibling . children , with all their innocence find joy in the most mundane place . a tiny chocolate make a child smile ear to ear whereas an adult striking a million dollar deal is overcome by greed instead of being proud and happy . children can enjoy the little aspect of life which go unnoticed by the older generation . i would like to illustrate an example from my own experience . when my family visited thailand in june 2004 , we were all very enthusiastic a the entire family would be meeting up after five year . we all had a blast jet sking , parachute sailing etc . it wa only later that we realised that our parent did not get this opportunity a they did not have enough money at that time . in our merriment we had forgotten about them and they , not wanting to disappoint u did not say a word . this is a very trifle example but for the first time i realised how much elder do to make our life more enjoyable than theirs . as we grow more mature , our definition of fun keep changing . initially fun wa synonomous to ps 2 's and partying but a we grow older we mellow down . we realise that fun and responsibility are a package deal called life . when you are dependent on someone , it like your insured and you have no cause for worry . when you get past being a teenager and people start depending on you , you are their insurance and therefore have responsibility . this is not necessarily a bad thing a it instills in you a sense of independence and pride . a little fun is always necessary for anyone - young or old to lead a happy , healthy life .
