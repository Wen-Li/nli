i totally agree with the statement that successful people try new thing and take risk rather than only doing familiar thing . in my opinion , successful people , especially in a business world , usually can imagine thing that will happen in the future . they can also see the trend of life therefore they can prepare for the change of life and try new thing that may lead them to success . on the other hand , people who only do what they are familiar with do not have this kind of sight and ability to create thing . to be a successful people , you have to be a pioneer to try new thing . in the business world , `` time is money '' . people do not only compete with others , they also fight for time . time is the factor that determines success or failure . therefore , trying new thing is the key to success . people who do not take this kind of risk can never be success . they are just follower following the trend that the successful people created , which make them always a few step behind the successful people . risk taking is also an important part to achieve success . taking risk doe not mean not caring about the probability to success . as i mentioned , successful people have the sight to see future thing . the risk taking is based on what they see in the future . some people just do not have this kind of talent , if they do not think thing over before taking a step , they will never be succeed . therefore , risk taking is blended with the ability to notice how the world is changing , not just taking risk randomly . based on my knowledge , i totally gree that the difference between successful people and the people that will never succeed are the gut and knowledge to try new thing and take risk . those are the key to success .
