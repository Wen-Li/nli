i agree with the statement , i think that for the student is more important understand idea and concept , because when a person understand idea ( he or she ) can applicate this in real life or can teach to ather people that concept . but i think also that for understand better idea or concept a person must learn fact , bacause fact rappresent a great example about idea . at school student study a lot , for example , history because this subject is very important for understand a lot of today thing from the past mistake . if you know the human history you can do the best choise , but a lot of student stady the history but sometime they ca n't understand the real meaning of thing that they have just read on the book . for this reason , for me , it is very important learn idea , because not all people can interpretate in the right way the fact . it is much faster study a fact then understend correctly concept . the real problem about this learning metod is that there is n't a single way to interpretate fact , all people have a different mind and not always they give the right sense to thing . a professor can interpretate in wrong way a fact and tell to his student wrong thing .
