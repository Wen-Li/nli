i agree with the statement that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide . now i am working for a japanese company in japan and usually the holiday i can take is really shorter than other contries . to travel efficiently , traveling in agroup with a guide is the best way . i do n't need to spend many time to find a resturant and to worry about the losing way . and the other good point is that traveling in a group , i can meet many people who i can share the atmospere of the place . i will explaiin more detail a follows . the first reason is that traveling in agroup with a tour guide help me to travel effeciently . as i mentioned before , i can not take a long holiday a a usual japanese company . therefore , i do n't have enough time to stay the same place . to visit many place in the short term , i need a guide to help me to go around . in addition , i do n't so worry about emergency situation such a losing way , traffic jam , and train delay because a tour guide usually know how to handle the situation . the second reason is that i can share the impression of the trip with group member and exchange our opinion . even though traveling alone can make more free time , i would like to share the atmosphere of the place with others . for exsample . i will go to a resturant during the trip . if i eat alone , i can not enjoy the meal . i will miss someone who can talk to me . consequently , i agree that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide . i can travel many place during my short holiday if a guide lead me . moreover , i can share how i feel in the place with other people .
