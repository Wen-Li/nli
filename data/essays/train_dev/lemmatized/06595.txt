many people may think that young people do not give enough time to helping their community . on the contrary , i believe that many young people give a lot of time to helping their school mate , family , and other citizen . my reasonning here is built on the two following argument . first , i think that many people just doe not see the young people 's help to their community . i will give two very relevant example from my own experience to support this idea . i spent my summer vacation in california , volunteering in the '' trail maintenance crew '' at redwood national park . during the two month i spent over there , i met dozen of young volunteer , but i met only one volunteer over the age of thirty . thus , many young people are volunteering for free worldwide in national parks and forests , but only very few people realize how much time these young people gave to help preserving the world 's natural ressources . another relevant example are beach lifeguard . many people lie and rest on the beach without thinking about those young lifeguard . these young people spend their day watching for endangered swimmer , and sometimes risk their own life to rescue them . then , i think many people still focus on the damage that young people can cause . i will again use an example from my own experience to illustrate the fact that young people who feel responsible of the well being of their community still exist . for instance , there an association in my school , whose member clean the facility and repair broken item after party . thus , i think that many young people continue to give their time worldwide .
