lot of poeple think that young people enjoy life more or better than older people . in one way they are right but in the other hand they are wrong . for a moment let take the word enjoying life a having fun and doing lot of thing . young people are active because of their age . the age is a big advantage . they have the energy for doing lot of thing . for exeple , traveling , riding a bike , running , and sex of course , thing most older people dont have much energy to do . and ofcourse they have kid maybe even grand kid to tie them in to the life they currently have . this is maybe their only satisfaction in life . to be able to achieve lot of thing that younger people did not achieve yet . because of this satisfaction they maybe have no need to really experience different thing . on the other hand i can not really say that young people can enjoy life much eihter.21st century really doe not allow lot of u to explore . with the need of a succesful job ; the need of a diploma appears . with the need of a diploma money come in to the story . well we all know that we can not grow money on tree so we start working part or full time at an early age . on top of working we have to study in order to graduate . even after all of this the only time we will enjoy life seems like retirement . well again when we retire we are considered older people . so tell me who are the people that really have fun . younger or older people ? having fun is not about age or activity . it is about being able to enjoy life at it most . we are the one who determine the term `` enjoying life '' for our selfes . at any age if we are satisfied with what we are doing and who we are and how we interract with people then we are the one who choses to enjor or not to enjoy . let ask this question to our self : to enjoy or not to enjoy ?
