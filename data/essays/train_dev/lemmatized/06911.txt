there are so many successful people in today 's society . these people can be student , business man or even worker . generally , all area have successful people . i agree with the opinion that these kind of people always try somthing new even though they need to face risk . however , they wo n't do the thing they already know quite well . i think this is a kind of spirit called enterprise . i want to ask a question at first - how can people make success ? can people always do the same thing which he is already professional on succeed ? the answer is obviously - no . we can not deny that people should make great effort to improve you own skill . is that enough ? you just focous on one thing , and you make it then pefect . you can be proud of it . but one skill is not enough espacially in today 's society which is quite competitve . you always need to improve yourself . otherwise , you will not be able to catch up with the development of the society or other people 's step . everyone ha the desire to be successful , but actuary not everyone ha been successful already . why ? the differnce between successful people and common peole is whether they are brave enough . a successful people must be unfaithful to take all kind of challenge . these challenge will come out once you face a new thing . maybe someone ha already tried a new thing but they dare to face the risk . they go back to the place where they stay before . successful must be happy to take these risk then they can make perfect . everyone know bill gates , he is very successful , he is still working on the new program . that is why he can be the no.1 do not envy the successful people in the society . they have their own way to succeed . in other word , they can do the thing others dare to or can not do . undertake a new thing out of your scale , without faith , you can succeed a well .
