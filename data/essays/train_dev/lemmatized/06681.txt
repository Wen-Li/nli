in order to analize this statement we should first look at the definition of the advertisement . then according to the information we should put the right and the wrong part of this statement . how the advertiser make the product seem better and if they dont what would happen ? in this essay i will try to answer these question and explain my idea about the subject . the advertisement is made for show the new product to the public . like all the product , this particular one might have some good and some bad quality , advantage and disadventages . however the advertiser dont have to show the negative side of the product . they usually only emphize the positive one adn adventages of the product . this bring u to the second question . not showing the disadvantage is the same thing making the product seem much better then it really is ? i think no it is not the same thing but it is a little bit hypotrethic . since it count a a crime not mentioned about the negative effect if it harm people , advertisement also should consist both negative and possitive side of the product . the amount of the showing each side should be up to advertiser but people should informed all aspect of the product before buying it not after reading the tiny little warning which pop up after opening the box . however , since every product in our life ha a side effect , it might become paranoid if every advertisement talk about how harmful the product is . to sum up i agree with the statement . yes the advertisement make the product seem much better than they really are by showing only the good part of the product . however it will be more caotic if the start to tell the whole truth about everything about the product .
