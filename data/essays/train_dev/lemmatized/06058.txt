my personal thought is that it depends on the situation of the student to understand the idea of a topic or just learn some fact about it . i have some good example for both of the thought which explains why i think that this statement depends on situation . i have several reason to thin that a student need to understand a topic completely . my first reason to think like this because of the kind of the topic . there are different kind of topic . some are not important for any part in our life ; some are the base of the complex topic and some are significant topic which will come up in your life . the student need to understand the topic that are base of some complex and significant topic in order to understand the upcoming main topic . the reason is clear in my opinion . if you understand the base of a topic clearly ; you will not have any trouble in understanding the complex and important thing about that topic and will not have hard time about some simple thing in hard and complex topic . a student need to understand the significant and hard topic too in the sense of being succesful a both a student and a bussinesman . when you are a student ; you need to understand the topic inorder to do well in the exam about the hard topic . so the student will not have any problem when he is working professionaly in a company when a task about that topic come up . on the other hand ; i would suggest the student to learn the fact only if the topic do not have any importance at all . by this way , the student will succeed the exam because he know the basic fact of the topic , but will not lose some important time by understanding the topic . in conclusion ; i can say that my opinion is in the way that a student should understand the topic except than the one that do not have any importance in life and only for the period of classtime in the school .
