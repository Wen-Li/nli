these day , many company make an advertisement because they want to market their compnay or introduce their product by using tv , news paper , magagine etc. some people think most these advertisement do n't have affect product seem much better than they really are . however , in my opinion most advertisement make product seem much better than they really are . nowdays we have many kind of skill . i mean we can change everything such a angle , color , height , apearance on tv advertisement . actually , when i wa in korea , i worked at some composition company . at that time i controled background color , and around actor 's color or form . the other team also changed another thing - for exemple actor ha a spot on face , we erased that spot , or sometimes we made more length . when we gave to order , the oreder did n't reconize their actor because the actor had changed many thing , more beautifully , pretty , sexy . also magazins chang easy and we can make beter than really are . most magazin 's ad is picture . picture control is more easier then tv ad . maybe , in these day , many people know software that is photoshop . this software can control picture - more blur . finally , people who make advertisement know how to make it well . i think they are expert of tricker in making advertisement . for example , picture is different how to take a piture-an angle . surely it is different with actual . they just are wrapped product by their skill-an angle , changing color , erasing a spot , using software . enery thesething make product seem much better than they are . in brife , many advertisement different with their really product . it is using some trick skill when makeing ad . so be careful when you buy some
