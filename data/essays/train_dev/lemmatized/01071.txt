generally for all the student it very important to understand a lot of thing . it can be inferred that are a lot of way of how a student can understand , that are learning from idea and concept , or understand by fact . there are a lot of disadvantage of the three kind of situation already mentioned . for example understanding by idea it mean that they do n't have the main experience to make straight the definiton and it 's more usually , difficult to understand it by this way . for the other hand student can also understand by concept , this mean that the student are going to learn from a definition , something more concret . and also there is another way of how a student can learn , and this way is understanding by fact , it mean that the student is not going to learn a concept or have the main idea , it 's that the student is going to experience and learn from something that he lived . these type of how a student can understand thing can be something unclearness , but it doe n't mean that each student use the three option to learn something , but eventhough there are some of them who really us the three . for the other hand there a some student that only prefer one option , because they think that it the best way for them to understand thing . for my conclution i would say that it 's more important to all the student learn by fact , because it 's not the same thing to say that each person understood by reading and having the main concept of thing , or that having just the idea . also , i think that it would be more clearfull to understand thing by fact , because the student will not only get a good understanding , they also are going experience about a lot of thing and that is going to be somenthing usefull for their life .
