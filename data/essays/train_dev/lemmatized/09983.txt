with this essay i will try to explain why i disagree with the statement that there will be fewer car in use twenty year from now . when one look at consolidated automobile market such a the usa or europe , one find that even though the number of car in use ha not increased substantially over the last decade , neither ha the number declined . even though other type of fuel might substitute the gas used nowadays , there is no sign of another , more effective way of transportation . therefore it is very likely that the number of automobile in europe and the usa will remain constant for the next twenty year . on a worldwide scale , i think that the number of car will increase drastically over the next two decade . emerging country , especially in the asian region such a singapore are showing two-digit growth rate in the number of car used . even though this development will eventually slow down in these country , we will still see substantially more car in these region in the future . while only looking at consolidated or emerging market one can already imagine , that the number of car in use will not decline within the next twenty year . there are however country such a china or india , that will be the major driver of a stark increase in the number of automobile . these two country alone make up a great part of the worldwide population , while the majority of people in these country do not yet posse car . in china we can slowly observe what will happen in both country in the future . namely an immense increase in vehicle . the development in these two country alone will lead to a dramatic increase in car used worldwide . as a wrap up i can say that i do not only disagree with the statement that fewer car will be in use twenty year from now , but that coming two decade will show an increase in automobile used worldwide .
