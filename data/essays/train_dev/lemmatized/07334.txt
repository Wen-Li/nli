today we live in a world where everything is fast and in movement . to attract the consumer attention often the advertisement made by the productor , or a company , is better then the product itself . i totally agree with this statement because we can have example of it everyday ; it is sufficient to go in a supermarket and have a tour to see that it is full of similar product , and the only difference between one and another is made by his advertisement . another example can be taken from the television : there are a lot of advertisement made only to catch the consumer attention . there are a lot of way to catch the consumer attention : some product and , obviously , their advertisement look to the history of the company who made it , like a `` design '' object , others tend to be new and innovative . i think that an advertisement should show the real potential of a product , without exagerations , in order to prevent unhopefull case of recrimination and also a bad notoriety of it . the failure of a product must not be a stymulus to create a false advertising in order to selling it : it must be a motivation to improve it . because now our life is , for the most part of it , in movement , advertisement had begun to be greater and greater . when we are blocked in the traffic of the city , big advertisement try to catch our attention with provocation and funny phrase . but not everytime what is showed is good a his advertisement . in conclusion i think that who made an advertisement should be sure of what he , or she , want to sell and what is the real potential of the product .
