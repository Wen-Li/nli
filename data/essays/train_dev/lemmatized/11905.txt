`` young people enjoy life more than older people do '' . i would agree to the statement aforesaid although i donot doubt the fact that the older one have already had their piece of cake in term of enjoyment since they have had their own lovely moment when they were in their adoloscence , when they were youngster or can be said when they were parent . now gettin back to the point of my favouring the notion here stated , the youngster have every thing at this particular span of time that they are in be it health , look or entusiasm to do variuos thing , the quest to hunt for the unknown mystery of life that surround them and lay unfolded in front of them . coming to the first point , health of the youngster is perfect enough to keep them raring to do thing and to experiment which sadly is not the case with the aged people since with age the human body cell begine to retard and there are enormous problem to be mentioned that keep age old people to be active . for instance , my grand father is 80 year old and i along with my parent had to go on a hill station to celebrate the new year 's eve and i really wanted my grand father to accompany me and sadly he couldnot because of a respiratory problem he would suffer being at a high altitude . talking of enthusiasm i would say that with no denial to it youngster have gallon of it stuffed in their nerve . another perspective that i would present is that not only age old people instead people who are only a few year older are le likely to enjoy themselves since the maturity level keep on increasing with time and what i imply by this statement is that even a five year old would enjoy more than a 20 year old person since because the five year old would enjoy to the fullest only by a mear endevour of meeting a friend whereas the same thing is not likely to attract a 20 year old . summing it up wiht the notion `` the older you are the wiser you get and le likely you are to be happy with small thing '' .
