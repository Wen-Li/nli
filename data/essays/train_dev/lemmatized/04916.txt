although some people say that they best way to travel is in the group led by a tour guide , but i cocnsider that the best way to travel is traveling alone because of several resosns such a spending private time , and can plan the best suitable tour for myself . actually . there are few positive aspect that people should travel a a group with a tour guide . the tour guide know a lot of information about the place where we visit : therefore , we can know a lot of interesting information though the tour guide , which the outsider can not be told usually . for instance , when i visited canada , i traveled with tour guide and we could get a lot of local and interesting information about canada , however , to great extent , traveling by myself is a lot of better than traveling a a gourp led by a tour guide . if we travel with a tour guide , we can not usually decide where to go , but every single travel plan would be decided by tour guide . therefore , we can not get free time or spend the time for something we want . even though , we do not know much about the place , we can easily use internet or book to make the plan , and prepare for our trip by ourselves . therefore , we do not really need to have a tour guide for trip . aslo , traveling a a group might bring some problem , when someone in the group ha a disability on their physical strength . for example , if some one very old is in the group then we might need to spend extra time for them because they might not be able to move a fast a young people do . also , if someone get injure on the way of the trip , we need to go to hospital or need to spend time for them . on the other hand , individual traveling doe not have these trouble a much a traveling a a group . therefore , i prefer to make a trip a a individual rather than led by a tour guide . moreover , i prefer to have a lot of private time rather than spending time with such a huge group . therefore , i prefer to spend the private time with myself during the traveling by the car or transportation , based on my oppinion , the best way to travel is individual traveling rather than travel a a huge group led by tour guide . even thoug , tour guide well-planed our tour , i prefer to spend my private time for only myself . moreover , i can get a lot of help by reading the book or using the internet , in order to make the most interesting tour plan for me . therefore , i disagree to the idea that the bestr
