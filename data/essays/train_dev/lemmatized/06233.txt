i completely agree with this statement because only by trying new thing and taking risk people can improve their knowledge and prepare for a world that is constanly changing . besides , the only way people can discover their capacity and limit in almost every aspect of their everyday life is by trying new thing and facing the risk associated to unknow situation . my own work experience ha allowed me to realize the importance of trying new thing and taking risk in order to be sucsesfull . over the last three year i have worked a an advisor of the president of federal electoral institute , mexico 's electoral autorithy . during this time i have been constantly confronted with many new and unknow situation . althought i have had the opportunity to avoid this situation many time , and remain doing what i already knew , i soon reallized that the best way to learn new thing and improved my self wa to face them . as a result , i have not only adquiered a lot of experience in my field but i have also achieved the recognition of my bos and colaegues , a well a a salary promotion . in sum , because of the argument presented above and my own experience i am convinced that facing new situation and taking risk is the only way to be successful and to improve every aspect of our life . as an old mexican saying state `` if you do not face risky situation , it is hard that you will ever win '' .
