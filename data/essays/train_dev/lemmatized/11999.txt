young gun of today are more determined then ever and the courage , the determination shown by this generation is by far greater . i dont agree with the statement that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their community . times have changed , but the will to be helpful to fellow community ha definitely not withered away . take for instance the various political party both regional and national that have over the time being completely overpowered by youth domination . the youth movement like nsui , and various ngos have been recruiting bright student from top university like jnu , delhi and the pace at which the student participate in the social activity is heartening to say the least . all these organisation of international stature involve community service that are more or le dominated by the young people . its a misconceived notion that youth dont give enough time for their community but a deeper analysis show that there are very good and educated people who have devoted to making their life of some consequence to others . a study at the grass root level namely the village panchayat and the muncipalities have gradually been the foundation ground for future leader of immense potential . many new ngos are being started by young people who are at time educated at top notch university , india and abroad . they sacrifice their attractive career option to serve the people and make a difference . the youth have gradually tried to do their bit in the field of literacy , improving sanitation , and provide better social and economic amenity in collaboartion both with government and private sector . in today 's world globalisation is the word , what with the private sector and software boom providing immense career growth and are highly remunerative , inspits of this many young people are opting for a career in the civil service . thus , people especially youth are devoting adequate time and it high time the society take note of it .
