i disagree that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their community . in my high school in california , lot of student form the small tutoring group in order to help those student who have questio in perticular subject or who live in pool family . they meet everyday after school in the library , not only studying their homework but also helping other student . yet there are some student who could n't pay the money to the test-prep school or the college-prep program in community college ; those who formed the tutoring group would answer almost all the question those helpless student have . i wa one of those helpless student because i just arrived from foreign country ; however , they helped me improving my english ability . now i participate in the group and teach other student in math and chinese . as young people , i think my classmate and my friend all did a good job in helping the community . i believe that there are other student group in other school that are doing the same job . in summer time , most of my friend would participate to take care of the child or old people . some of those child have no parent , some of them were abandoned . once a time i participate in the service , i read story to them . at first i wa thinking of practicing my english reading ability ; however , i cry after i went home because i feel i want to do more for them but i could n't . i asked more of my friend to join this service , and we all learn different thing from it . one of my friend she had once participate in a service in a hospital . she talked to the old people , and then she read the book and newspaper to them . she told me that , participating in a community service wa a really different expericence , and it would lead you to lear more about life , about helping other people but not asking the reward of it . young people do participate to help their community without speaking of it loudly ; they chose to help the society silently . once they join it , they would continue the service .
