of course i agree to the statement that we have to be well aware of many academic subject . first , the information nowadays are organized each other too complex . likely the system of education are altered , the form of information and the shape of business are becoming difference from the past . for exemple , the soho shop are emerging prominently in internet , we can see the tremendous of shop in there also a lot of so called ceo exists . they started their business a a whole company even if it is too small to have one employee , not subordinated to big company . the ceo must know a lot of knowledge not restricted to the good , he or she made . she need to know how to make the money . then she need the skill to manage the schedule , make the strategy to sell the product , and how to pack and so on . he or she can get that information in the internet nowdays easily , even if it is very professional like expert but this could be the good exemple . second reason is , the world is turning so fast and young person doe not persist to stick to one company , or the same job . this tendancy is not the subject that we can tell the right or worth . it is enduced by the difference thought of the new generation . so as we perceive the market we involved is corrupt , young people would have no atitation to leave and might want to move another job or might search the utterly diffrenent filed where they 've been . in conclusion , it is good to expose u to all the circumstance that we can confront , maybe it could be the issue of aquainting and assembling the knowledge not the knowledge itself if we probe it discreetly . anyway the reason why i prefer to choose the prior statement is because we must be ready to the uncertain next society .
