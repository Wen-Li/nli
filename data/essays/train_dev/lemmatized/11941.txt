as the present world is a marketing world the employer will be recruiting the talenteds but not the learner . this mean that it is better to understand concept than learning them . my dad always say that `` understand the concept but never try to learn them a it will be useful if i were not selected in campus placement and decide to start a firm to make money . '' i thought what he said is right but after looking at the placement in my college i thought they will only select the learner . the company who are coming to recriut the final year , they give first preference to the the one who got 9/10 but not to the one who got 7/10 and having all a grade in his branch subject . but after meeting them after two year the one who got 9/10 and not having any knowlege about the concept are in the same position and some gave up there job for doing there master and the one who got le gpa but understood all the concept are in a high post . i experienced the same in my twealth . i leant the concept and idea in physic and scored distinction . but when i am doing engineering first year i faced lot of problem to clear the subject . then after i realised it better to understand the idea and concept than learning them and never failed in doing so and made my core subject easier .
