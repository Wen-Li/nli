in the modern society , many thing have change comparing to the past . the korean trdition for hleping other have dissapered but instead we developed a new way of helping our community . so i disagree with the opinion . there are three reason why i dissagree with the opinion . first , the traditional way of helping others have changed into various type . for example if you dial a certian number you can donate small amount of money or there wa this event i went . it 's the program to feel the starvation , uncomfortable house and all the pain that the child in the third world country are giong through . i donated some money and starve for 24hour . by doing this i help a child to eat three month of nutritious meal . so even though i did not visit a orphanage and did the cleaning and reading child story i helped my community . second , the student have nowadays have to serve their community at least 20hours to go to high school or university . many people say that the true meaning of helping other is what come out from your heart not the grade . but because of this system i learn the joyful feeling of helping others . after than i did more of the helping community more than the school required and i stared to get involved in many charity group and jion unicef . third , because of christianity , many student donate their money when they go to church and participate in activies to help the other in their community . for example , my friend go to church every weekend to give food for the homeless in park . it is not only christianity that encourage helping others many kind of realigion encourage student to serve the community . just because some tradition ha chage it doe n't mean that the young people do not give enough time to help the others . so because of these three reason i disagree with the opinion .
