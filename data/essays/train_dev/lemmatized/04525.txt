i will agree with the statement that successful people try new thing and take risk rather than only doing what they already know to do well . success depends on the proper planning , the amount of effortness , taking the right decision at right time . there are many successful people that they become successful by taking risk . for example thomas alva edison who invented the electric bulb by doing almost one lakh experiment by trying the new way and by taking risk finally he succeed . there so many scientist are there who sacrified their life the world by inventing the new thing by taking risk . in politics there so many succesful person are there . for example abraham lincon the america formar persident who came form poor family became the president of america . in the early stage he wa also unsuccesful but by perseverence by taking risk he became succesful . another example is mahatma gandhi who sacrificed his life for freedom fight . his weapon is non-violence . he took several year for getting the freedom . by taking risk and try the new thing to fight agaist the rule of british government . finally he wa succeed . according to bussiness the most successful person whom loved is dheeru bhai ambani the former chairman and managing director for reliance industry ltd . he came for a middle class family and he started his carrier with small petrol bunk with a little money . after that by taking new thing and taking risk he became the most successful person . because of the hardwork and the perseverence taking the right decision in right time he became more succesful . however by taking too much of may cause so many problem . some people think that doing what they already know to do well . by that way the successful people try new thing and take risk and get success .
