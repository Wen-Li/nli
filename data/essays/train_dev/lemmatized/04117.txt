i think understanding idea and concept is much more important than simply learning so-called `` fact '' . history ha repeatedly proved that past `` fact '' turn out to be false . for example , people used to think that all specie on earth were created by god and they remain the same all the time . today , almost all biologist believe that evolution is the driving force behind all specie , past and present . as environment change , old specie extinct and new specie emerge . god ha no role in evolution . consequently , learning the fact may leave you with wrong information . if remembering fact is not good , will understanding idea and concept help ? definitely . if we think about the above example , people believe god a the only creator of specie because they do n't question the claim and never ask for valid evidence to support it . the idea behind such claim should then be `` how do we know ? '' well , in 1859 charles dalwin gave many evidence in his historical `` on the origin of species : the theory of evolution '' . as time go by , many scientist found more and more evidence to support the theory . such evidence lie in fossil , similarity between living plant and animal and their ancient ancestor and even dna of all organism . we now know all living thing share the same universal hereditary code , i.e. , dna . some people may argue that learning fact help a lot when you do n't have access to information you need . like when a nurse want to know how many gram equal to an ounce . however , in the modern `` information time '' when internet is universally accessible and most fact are available on you fingertip . most hospital unit in the u.s.a. are equipped with computer connected to the internet . a nurse can simply `` google '' `` gram to ounce '' and get the conversion rate right away . we no longer need to remember all the `` fact '' . ideas are more important than fact .
