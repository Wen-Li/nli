there are a lot of advertisments in society , and i often see them . i like seeing them , so i agree with the follwing statement that most advertisments make product seem much better than they really are . i have some reason . first of all , it is often possible for most advertisments to make product seem much better than they really are because they often have a lot of coments and picture . for example , a lot of advertisement have many user 's coments , and they also have a lot of picture . the a lot of coments and picture influence on reader . if advertisement ha nice coments and picture , the good is bought by a lot of people . second , the advertisement having a lot of picture and coments can make reader happy . for example , if you see advertisement which do not have advertisement , you maybe think the advertisement is very boring . but , most advertisement have a lot of picture and coments , so you can enjoy seeing the advertisement . therefore , you feel that most advertisement is very good , even if the advertisement is not better than they really are . for these reason , i think that i disagree with the following statement that most advertisement make product seem much better than they really are .
