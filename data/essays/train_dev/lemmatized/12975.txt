some people might say that learning lot of fact is more important than understanding idea and concept . however , i think understanding idea and concept are more essential . there are two major reason : to be confident and to be logical . to begin with , student could get confidence through understanding idea and consepts . you might say that learning many thing can make people more confident . however , you may not deny that without understanding them , nobody can use it confidently . moreover fact are usually so common . by contrast , although idea and concepsts are notperfect , people can get deeper knowledge by flowing the idea and conpet . as society is getting more complex , the competition is getting fiercer , therefore , the meaning of export ha changed . it wa to know many fact , now it is to understanding whole idea and concept . moreover , a far a thinking logically is concerned , understanding idea and concept are more important . i took the history class when i wa a freshmam . i learned many important fact in the class and i got a great score on it . however , i forgot most of them immedietly after a final exam . in comparison , when i took a physic class , although it wa chalenging to me to understand the idea and concept , but through that proccess i could learn the way of thinking logicaly . this logical approach helped me to get better grade in other course , too . in summary , to understand idea and concept is necessary for student to get confident and a way of logical thinking .
