yes , i agree with the sentence because the most of advertisments are false and they induce people to buy them when their quality is very low . the producer should think le to the sale than to the wealth of the people that will buy the product for example , if the product is food . the advertisement ought to be more strictly to the reality to show to the watcher the real characteristic of the each product . in this way a citizen can choose the best . in my opinion , all the producters will make their think better and all the word said in an adverstising space will be perceived and listened better . by the way i considered the advertising space a lost of time and i do n't listen them because , according to me , they are all make to seem what they are n't . unfortunately , in my life , i have bought a lot of product that seemed much better than they really were , but after one purchase i did n't bought them another time . instead , if the advertisments were real and described exactly what they show , people would believed in them yet . so , in conclusion , all of u have to try to show the truth of every thing because it is the best way to make the other trust u .
