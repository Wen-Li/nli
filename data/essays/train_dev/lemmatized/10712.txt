teaching ha arisen debate that are still today difficult to avoid when one ha to deal with education , learning or training . one of these debate could be summarize by the following statement : ` it is more important for student to undertand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact ' . somehow , this debate recall the fight which opposed montesquieu and montaigne during the french renaissance on education : the first one willing a ` full brain ' for student while for the latter prevailed a ` well made and shaped brain ' for them . it is , i think , of a high importance for student to understand and to have a very clear and precised conception of idea or concept they deal with at school . the more you understand , the more you will be likely to explain to other people the subject you are currently working on . consequently , the basis of any learning should lean on a good and clear understanding of idea and concept . indeed , fact are just a matter of memorizing , which is not a proof of a good understanding , hence , it is possible to know by heart the important date of the wwii without being able to seize the meaning of this particular strategy nor the consequence of that battle . facts must then be secondary for student . fact , which doe not mean that they are unnecessary or useless . as i said above , fact are secondary which mean that they have their importance in the learning process . students must rely on fact to better understand idea or concept they are dealing with . for instance , it is impossible to have a good comprehension of marxism or african decolonisation in only bearing on idea or concept . facts are here to confirm or infirm theory . facts are helpful in the sense that they provide a pragmatic approach to something which ha so far only being taken into a theoretical way . a good combination between concept and fact must thus help student to have a global understanding in what they deal with .
