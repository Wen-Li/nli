to be more successful in your life , you have to take a risk . no matter how it cost and how it pay to you . i think in your life you have to take risk to suceed some thing . life is all off risk , you dont know what is going to happened with you at time in your life . so i am agree with this statement , which i want to express with supporting example and reason . first example , taking risk is noting but a part off the game , if you suceed then you win if you did n't then you lost . consider and example off the person who had just started his carrer in any field . he is not paid good in his first job , if he get a chance to work in some other company where he could find a good salary and facilites , but he did't fine the job security in it . well by taking a risk he will find a good paid job and facilites . second example , mr billgates who is the richest man in the world , well he started his careerer in 90 's . after his first success off first operating system he did not stop and , done some other research in some other field like a programming field , at that time many company occupied their position in the programming field but he had taken a lot off risk and come under the programming market and the also get success in that field . in this way he hold many other field and get in to the bussiness very well . finally i think it is good to take a risk in you r life and in your growing futher , but you have to be careful by selection your important decision of life .
