according to what is illustrated , i agree that fewer car will be in use than there are today . almost every evidnece is implying for such occasion where the economic , pollution , politics . .. all such situation will have an influence on such phenomenon . the first reason , many study and reaserches emphasize that the exceeding number of car is promoting the increase in the greenhouse event . so , a a challenge for such case am sure that many government will introduce new law thats will extremelly restric from the expanding of such danger event . despite the advantage of car , in the near future we will be under tremendous challenge due to disadvantage of car on environment and social life , so we must search about something substitute such danger transportation . furthermore , civils all over the world will be unable to fullfill their car with the needed fuel due to the increase in price of such material . this future aspect will force government to rasie the price of fuel , simply from the decline in the amount of such substance in it origin place , a such event is occuring from the excess supplying and the carelessness for the accuarte foundation of such materail . am not stating my view , a such fact are being implyed by many scientist . finally , the overuse of such transportation way and the increase of population around the earth lead to a miserable and conflict operation in human movement , here government will interfer to decline such overuse and put law that reinforce such duty . anyone can touch the evidence for the restriction of such familiar man-made . thus we will be forced to leave away such transportation and will try to find the new technological invention .
