after world war ii , one of the bloody battle of history , a more pacifist community appeared by the important and helpful assistance of international organization . since then , society were naturally wanted to live in peace without any conflict therein . moreover , this perception wa supported by economics and particularly 1980s wa a significant corner for young people who were educated by their parent closely lived the damage of war around the world . hence young people started to feel themselves isolated from the society and their major purpose wa the ocuupation and money making a much a they can . nowadays , young people do not give enough time to helping their community . i complety agree with this statement because of several reason . young people want to enjoy their time before computer screen and video game and they wish to realize their career goal without paying attention to society . no matter how the percentage is , it is obvious that young people love video game . an increasing number of video game are experienced and young people avoid from being with their family member , friend and even the member of community . yet community handle various problem which are to be resolved without losing time . for instance , unemployment is a major event for today 's society . young people appreciate playing video game instead of searching for solution to unemployment . since young people are more energic and active , they can be involved in project looking for solution to unemployment . besides , young people are much focused on money making istead of fundemental social problem of community . it is doubtless that career golas are important for young people but major community problem would eventually effect the large number of individual soon . in the last decade of 20th centuty , foundation played a great role in society because of their supportive function and weel organized structure a weel . be that a it may , regard is to be had on the fact that a widely participation of young people led to this success at that time . in a nutshell , i strongly believe that young people nowadays do not give enoung time to helping their community . probably it originates from misleading of youngers both in school or family but whatever the reason is government should definetely bring a detailed insight to this situation and product solution otherwise whole of the society will encounter different problem . this is because younger people are those on whom the society is being built .
