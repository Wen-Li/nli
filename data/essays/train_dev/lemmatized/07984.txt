i personally agree with the statement that `` young people enjoy life more than older people do '' not only beacause they are physically more fit to do so , but also because their outlook on life is full of illusion and great dream . young people 's first advantage is thier physical condition due to their age . they have a vigorous body and therefore a vigorous mind . mix these with a good moral education and a spirit for adventure and the result can be a young adult that truly and deeply enjoys his life . on the other hand , older peple tend to be limited by their deteriorating body and have to deal with a limited diet and activitiy plan . they can have the moral base and the unbreakable spirit of a young person , but thier body will not keep up with these for a long time . it is obvious that the range of physical activity available to young people in life is much greater than that available to old people . sky diving , snowbording , rock climbing are some example of activites off-litimts to older person . the second advantage young peopel pose is their fresh outlook on life . this view of thier life ha not been tarnished by mistake , torn relashionships , of failed attempt . their emotion are strong and every new detail life brings to them is embraced with passion . older people tend to carry around old memory of lost loved one , of failed attempt , torn relationship , mixed feeling , which in turn drane spiritual energy that would otherwise be used in more effective way to enjoy life . a younger person ha a better of acomplishing his life goal because he doe n't waste valuable energy in regret , or regret . in conclusion , young people have a better chance than oler people to enjoy life at it fullest , because of physical and emmotional advan
