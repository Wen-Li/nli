we are living in a particular period ; we are hitten by advertisement : when we walking along the street we can count a big face with same product on his/her hand , or when we are listening to the radio we can listent to a particular voice that try to convince our to buy something , when we switch on the tv there is always some spot with a funny music . .. in each place , in each situation we are covered by advertisments . it is easy to ask ourselves if the product that are presented are so brilliant . i think that a lot of time it is so : most advertisement make product seem much better then they really are . i can say this for different reason , first of all because the obiective of the company is to sell their product , and so they use all the way that are necessary to convince people to buy it . second because a lot of time people buy a particolary product not for it quality but only for it mark . for example we can think about food : what are the differents between one biscuit to another ? a lot of time the difference is the price : the prodoct that is well-known is more expensive than the other , but if we taste the quality we can ' t understand the difference because they are equal . another example that i could consider is about clothes . there are a lot of people that want wear only one type of , for example , trausers because there is a littel spot on it . probably it is only to be faschinable , but this trausers , that cost a lot , isn ' t different from another . the last consideration that i can do is that advertisement hit our unconscious attitude and so a lot of time we choose prodoct that is pubbliced in unconsciously way . i
