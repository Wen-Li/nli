some people said that teenager do not spend enough time on community nowadays . i agree with it first of all , the most important reson is that heavy burden of their studying . especially in some asian country , young people should take part in a large number of exercise class and a great number of test , so they spend a lot of time on their book . some of them think it wasts time to take part in community . if they spend more time on their communties , they will lack of time to prepare their test . futhermore , if they could not study in famous university , they would not have a bright futhure even if they take part in some community . second , young people have various kind of thing need to do . for instance , it is a very popular idea among young people that they hope to independence . many young people choose to do part-time job to earn more money and buy anything what they want . they may feel tired to take part in community . of course , some student hope to get more work experience and social experience on their free time . they think it is more useful than in community . after they graduate , they are confidence in their interview because they have work experience in some company . third , young people have many different kind of entertainment , . such a internet , television . some young people are reported to stay in front of computer all day and play game . they belives the computer bring more fun for their life . some young people just like to go shopping . as a result , they are all lack of interest of taking part in communites , in conclusion , i think there many reason lead this result . it is a negative phenomenon , so i suggest the society , their parent and teacher should pay more attention on resolving this problem .
