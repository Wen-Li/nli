younger people enjoys life more than the older people do . i will go with this , although it is said that one should be younger at heart rather than by your age . another saying say that you should be younger at heart to enjoy the life to the fullest . young people are always envied by the olders that they are having more fun . it is true since younger people ha all the time , enthusiasm a well a the energy to enjoy the life till maximum . the younger generation involves themselves into lot of extra-curricular activity . the younger generation have all the time for all the enjoyment . after their study they do not have great responsibility to take care of . thus they are free to do all the stuff what they want . the younger lot ha got all the companion in the form of friend to enjoy the time they are having . enjoying or having fun becomes more when you are having a friend . moreover the younger people are a lot energetic to carry out the adventurous stufs of camping or touring . while youger lot are able to get away with anythiny they do . they are not responsible to any of the action or to say they are not bothered what others have to say . as the person grows older he is bond into varuious social ritual . he is now married and having family . the life of a older person is distributed into various phase like private life , family life , professional life etc . now the man is carrying various family , professional and social responsiblities . after all these thing he is left with a very limited time or resource to enjoy the life . although it much needed to say here that they meaning of enjoyment change here . but keeping the fact that younger people enjoys the life more , it should be taken care that they do not run on to the rough patch . the younger lot is very much vulnerable to get spoilt , so it becomes duty of the younger people that they should \ take care of these thing and thsy also should be the part of the enjoyment along with the younger generation .
