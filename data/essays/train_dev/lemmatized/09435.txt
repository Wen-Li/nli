although i understand why some people think it is more important for student to learn fact , i think that it 's more efficient for them to understand idea and concept . to my view , there are three reason why idea and concept prevail . first , idea and concept enable a student to understand not only one fact but also plenty other fact because fact happen once and idea can explain many fact . for example , you can know how to cook a specific cake but if you understand how cake are made in general you will be able to cook every cake . it mean that by understanding a fact , a student would be able to anticipate only this precise fact next time he experience it . instead , if a student understands the concept he will be able to anticipate the outcome of many related fact . secondly , idea and concept are the first thing that you learn at school and i think it is efficient . for instance , in mathematics , you always begin by learning the rule before applying them . moreover , theory is something that gather information from the experience of other people . that is exactlwhat the teacher is teaching : concentrated experience rather than a fact . last , according to my personnal experience i think it 's more important to understand first idea and concept . i created a fashion company but i knew only a few thing about this industry . thanks to my knwloedge that i have learned in class i wa able to adapt and anticipate thing a i already knew this industry . for example , marketing concept can be used for every industry . by using them i wa able to cleat the hurdle which wa my ignorance of the industry . to conclude , i think that idea and concept prevail on fact and that is why . still , a i said at the beginning , i understand people who think the opposite because you need to fact to understand how to apply the theory .
