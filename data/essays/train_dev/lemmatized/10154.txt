i agree that successful people try new thing and take risk rather than only doing what they already know how to do well . first people who try new thing can have more chance to make a success . i have seen the tv program showed how one of korean business man got succeed and able to finally export electronical device to us . he used to be a engineer in a small electronical company . his salary wa good and economically stable . however , in spite of negative opinoins from friend and family , he decided to leave company and make a new one because he had lot of idea and experience for the electronical device . initial period , he failed many time due to lack of experience in marketing and so on . however he tried many other thing like change the design of the product and collaborate people who know marketing and business . now he is a ceo in the big company that earns $ milions per year . people who is willing to take risk can have more chance to succeed . my mom wa poorly educated . she always ha passion and will in her mind for further education like going high school and college . though she ha two kind and family that she ha to take care , she decided and started to search what she ha to do for further education . she took many lesson from the private institute and took exam to obtain the graduate certificate for the middle school and high school . now she is trying to go for the college to study what she wanted to study like english literature . she gave much more chance and opportunity to herself by trying new thing like learning thing from different place .
