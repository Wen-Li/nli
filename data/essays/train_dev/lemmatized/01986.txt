i agree with this statement . young people enjoy life more than older people do becouse they have no problem , or at least very small one to compare with olders , that make them tired . in fact , if we stop now thinking about their simple day , we can observe that they have no other thing to do enjoying themselves . on the contrary , older people have too many problem and thing to do during their simple day a work , child , parking , traffic and a hundred else . in my particular case , i live alone in milano and i have to do a thousand thing all the day so i can-t leave time to relax myself with the consequence that i-m often tired and i never smile . i clearly remember when i wa young and how the day run speedly with no problem , but it is live . i think that we have to re-discover the young there is in all of u because it is the only way to become a smily person < and i believe that it is possible staying closely with young - life . i think that they posse the correct kind to live the life , the only one we lost when we are young .
