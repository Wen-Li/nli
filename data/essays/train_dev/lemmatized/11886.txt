nowadays , anybody can tavel anywhere and i think that choosing to travel with a group is a personal chose and it also depends on where you 're traveling and what you want to do while your traveling . if you are planing to travel to europe , i think that going with a group led by a tour guide is a good chose . the main reason that people travel to europe is to visit and to learn about all off those town , musems , castle , bridge and monument . the tour guide will probably satisfy your willing conserning those kind of subject , that 's his job . using a tour guide is when your taveling to visit . you can also choose to travel with your family or wife just to relax , get away from town and have a good time . for that kind of situation , you do n't need a tour guide . you take your vacation in nice resort to relax , to lay down on your back on the beach . what 's the use for a tour guide if you plan to go on a trip under the sun to just have fun and to chill at the pool with a drink in your hand . also tour guide can cost a lot , you 're already paying a lot of money to travel , why pay more fore a tour guide . i think the chose to travel with a group and a tour guide will always depend on where you are going and what you want to do in your vacation . what 's the fun of getting in a groupe with a buch of people that you do n't know and not have all the right of going where you want and do what you want . traveling is to have fun and for me , somebody that tell you what to do , at what time to get up and that decides for you where to go is not having fun . choosing the way you want to travel is personal and choosing whit who and whit a tour guide is also a personal chose . it 's for those reason that i disagree with the statement .
