it is often asked , wheter student should get a wide range of knowledge during university or just specialize on one topic . in my eye , the specialist is much more appropriate than a generalist . in opposite to a generalist , who can do nearly anything , but can not do something really good , a specialist is able to , a the name tell , specialiye on one concrete thing . therefore , he ha a good , deep and great knowledge about this topic . like in school , you learn a lot of stuff , you never need again in our life , because you are not interested in this thing . also , you are only good in lecture you are interested in , student are le motivated in this class . this is why they wont get good mark or point in this topic , and therefor are more unmotivated . but if you need some knowledge from other academic field . like business knowledge for a physican who start his own company , you have the opportunity to get this knowledge `` learning-by-doing '' or in an autodidactic way . also , if you only provide general knowledge , some student were not able to start at university , because they are not interested in such a wide range . they maybe visit private university which support this special thing . the most important thing is , that you will need a very specialised knowledge , to invent and progress thing . so , only a general knowledge is not enough for research and development . this could lead society into a world without or with only few progress . for example , if you know , how the engine in your car work exactly , doesnt mean that you are able to build one up by yourself . or make some thing better on it . so , without specialist , a progress of society is nearly impossible . because of this , specialiced knowledge is very important . general knowledge can received from book , but special knowledge is hard to get to know on your own .
