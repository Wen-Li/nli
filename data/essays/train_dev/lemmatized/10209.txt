after recaptulating the experience in my life i found both understanding and learning the concept are usefull but understanding the idea and concept more usefull and scietifical . i found understanding of conepts more benificial in many field and way because by understanding the idea we know how to apply easily and effctively . for example in solving a physic problem if you understand the concept you can do it easily and accurately with in lee time compared to others . another example if we understand a surgical procedure thoroughly we can perfom it le complication . understanding concept also make u remember the concept for a long time . for example i still remember the dissection of frog which i learned in my school day becuse i understood the step of dissection well . another example is that regadding the differant process that take place in the human digstive system . analyzation of the subject is increased when we understand the concept , this can be supported with the example of apersonal experience regarding the case which i saw in the hospital i found the symptom of the disaese icould diagnose a tough case easily . i wa able to do so only because i had better understanding of the subject . understanding the subject also increase our depth and the the command of the subject for example in organic chemistry we should depth of the concept in order to judge the correct the reaction . thus with the correct understanding of concept is essential for all these to occur .
