i agree with the statement but only partially . education is termed a the path to overall development of a person and since childhood people are trained in a variety of topic and after a certain age when they can decide for thmselves the person can chose a topic or subject of his liking and specialize in it at the basic childhood level the school circulum include all the knowledge rquired for the child to view the world in the normal sense . subjects such a social and natural sciences tell the everyday movement of the earth it location and how and why of many aspect of nature which interest the child at that age . at high school level the subject are dealt in detail and a fewer subject are dealt at that stage so that the in depth knowledge of a few selective subject is stressed . this lead to the development of a personality and the young adult now can have a subject of his liking at undergraduate level . the subject learnt so far will also assist the person his or her chosen field of specilisation for example the use of concept of physic like gravity and momements of earth and other object in space in the field of rocket science and design engineering . at undergrauate level of education the person get to decide about a specific subject and specilize it at his graduate and doctrate level of education if he choses to do so . for example , consider the case of engineering at undergraduate level an electronics engineer can convert into a computer and electronics engineer at his graduate level using his computer knowledge on his electronic basic . in conclusion , i have to say that although specific knowledge of an academic subject is important the need for knowledge on a variety of subject is all the more important to attain an over all developed personality for a person . particularly in this day and age when a knowledge of variety of topic is needed to survive in this technologically submerged world .
