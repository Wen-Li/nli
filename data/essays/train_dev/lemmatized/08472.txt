young people enjoy a life more than the older people do . i dont completely agree with this statement . but to some extent it is true . young people have a lot of energy and their brain would be very active seeking for adventure in thier life . this would help them plan there life and lead in an interesting way . they mostly hang-out with there friend , play a lot of sport , chat throughout the day in the college . they can even actively participate in various cultural activites held in there college . having a lot of capability and strength to learn new thing they usually update themselves a per the growing technology . for example using the computer , dancing listening to music and many such activity . people in the old age can not handle them properly and can not easily mingle with them . young people can easily learn thing or grasp thing thing than the older one 's do . this would help them get used to new culture and adopt new way of style and tradition and even the food habit of various area . all this would be a problem for the older people because anything new in style may deviate from their tradition like the change in clothing that younger generation adopt a per the fashion , it may be even the food that cause indigestion problem or someother illness . the drawback that the younger generation mainly have is the stress , due to the work load imposed on them . this burden may even lead to boredom or may even lead to a state of depression which would be very difficult for them to handle and even come out . all this is due to the lack of experience they have . it is at these situation that younger people come to the older people to seek their advice in handling or dealing such situation . it is the experience of the older people , which help them to come out of these difficult situation many time and get into their routine life . the only thing appreciable about the older people is that they enjoy their life at these stage by playing with their grand-children would would give a lot of pleasure and happiness for them regularly . illustratung all these event i would like to state
