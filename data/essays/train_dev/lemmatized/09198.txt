it is difficult to become an expert in one specific subject without a good knowledge in other different subject , but it is unproductive and unuseful towards society to have a general knowledge but not the possibility to get a specific role . attending the architectural university i have realised how many other discipline this subject can refer to , history , geography , medicine , astronomy , math , physic , chemistry . .. and many more . so my profession will be one and well defined , but it will be the result of differents study . in conlusion i disagree with the statement proposed , but i disagree even with it opposite , i think the truth is to be found into the middle .
