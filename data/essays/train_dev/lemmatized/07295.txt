i agree with the statement , i think successful people try a lot more thing , because of many reason . the most important one is that they have nothing to worry about , because if you are successful , you are good in what you do , so you probably gain a lot of money for this . that mean you do not have to worry about how you can feed your family for example . poor people mostly have to worry about that , which mean they have not much freedom in what they can do . so , if you are successful and rich you have the opportunity to do the thing you want and do not have to worry about financial problem , so you can risk a lot more thing . besides , successful people often need stress and drill , because they probably work a lot of time and put themself under pressure to motivate themself , so they always must do something to get the drill , which also force them to take risk and look for challenge . i also think that those people are bored after a certain time if they are good in what they do , because they always work in this field . so they need not only a challenge , but also a change in their life . this is , of course , something , that fit for everyone . everybody want to have a change when he doe the same thing the whole day , even if he is good in this . but , a i already mentioned , e.g. poor people do not have the possibility to decide whether they want to do this job or take any risk with stock exchange or whatever . to sum up , i would say , successful people are not the onlyones , which rather try new thing than do what they always do , but in contrast to the others they have the possibility to do so .
