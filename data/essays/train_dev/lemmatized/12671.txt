for me , traveling is always good and pleasant . every time i can , i go to a many place i can afford to go . but if i had to choose , there would be some point to review in order to make a decition . sometimes or some place are more likely to be visited alone , with your own itinerary . you can eat whenever and wherever you want , you can spend a much time a you want in an attraction and you are entirely free to visit all the place you like . the statement made before may seem a great idea , you are free to decide evertyting ! , but people may exceed the limit of this freedom so the whole trip can result in an unpleasant experience . when thing are not appropriately planed , you may spend a lot of time in only one place and at the end you might skeep some important place that you would 've like to visit . when traveling in a group with a tour guide you have the whole trip planned and , for example , if you go to europe alone and you get so excited about the eiffel tower that you spend almost two week in paris , when going with a group the time to stay in such a beautiful city is a week , you have already lost a complete week that could 've been great in italy . that kind of thing make the group tour more effective for long trip . another advantage of taking a tour is that you will be explaind about all the detail of the place you visit . when you go alone you may not know for example , that in the mayan pyramid in chichen-itza you can draw a snake by walking around it . personaly , for short trip or trip i do with my boyfriend it 's best to go alone because of the freedom of time i get to have . but if it is a long trip and i want to visit a many place a i can in a short time , a guided tour would deffinitely be the best option .
