i agree with that successful people try new thing and take risk rather than only doing what they alreday know how to do well . many people of successful in business have a goal like bid dream . because of that they knew how exciting when got tha goal from before success . therefore , they need to feel more exciting and advanture thing . there are two example why they need more and what they have differ than others who is not successful person . first of all , they have more confidence about everything . because they have many experience than others . beside they have pride also . therefore , they really want to win in business in other hand they rearlly hate lose from somebody . this is morovating them to try and try . second , they realized this `` no pain no gain '' therefore , they can accept many kind of risk to get their business like more money . there are no money and no success without risk and danger . they knew this fact , it make success them in society . in conculsion , successful people try new thing and take risk due to get more success and money .
