i disgree with the point that it is more important for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact . of course , no doubt understanding idea and concept is very important . we need to apply idea and concept to reality . ideas and concept are basic stuff . but it is a littile bit haste to conclude this result that understanding idea and concept is more important . the objective of understanding idea and concept is to practice . then the practice yield many fact . i think no idea and concept is perfect which is alway impeccable . though learning the fact , we can complement idea and concept . take an organic chemistry lab for example . absorbance of the solution . at first , we must look at the manual of the lab and grasp the principle of the lab . then we began to do the lab . sometimes we found it wa not true that the absorbance wa proportional to the concentration . it seemed against the rule . that wa a fact . we need to find the real reason leading to the result . last we found absorbance wa affected by many factor . temperture and humity can control the result . ideas and concept are very deep and hard to understand which are forgotten quickly . by fact , we often easily understand idea and concept . facts are vidid . most student are tired of lot of study . facing to textbook is a hard thing for a long time . but fact give u a direct feeling which inspire our interest and imagination . sometimes it is amazing that we grasp idea and concept so easily and quickly . and many new invention are generated by fact . for instance newton principle . if newton did not see the process of falling down the apple , newton principle will not exist . we do not deny the importance of understanding idea and concept which is most basic . if we do not understand idea and concept , we can not learn anything from fact . facts , idea and concept are indispensible . if we can do well by them together , we will do better .
