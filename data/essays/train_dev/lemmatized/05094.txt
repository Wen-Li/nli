i 'm not sure about the real meaning of the word succesfull near the word people . so , in order to try to answer to the question , i can try to look to my experience . throughout new thing and take risk you can obtain more beneficts but , in the same way , you can easily go to the bankrupty . however , actually , if you search the success you must try new way a well a our parent do . the standardization and the globalization made all of u at the same level and so for emerge you will find many problem because there will be always anyone that make your job better . in the other hand i think that if you know well your job and you work with attention and expecially with passion you will recognize by others that , for example , will prefer spend more money with a quality or traditional product instead of pay the multinational that producu your product at a lower price . we can think to the `` made in italy '' in opposite to `` made in china '' . why the people continued to buy product with a higher price ? in my opinion you will can be a succesfull person both trying new thing and doing well what you already know . the main feature that you should have is the passion for your job . if you had this capacity you will be able to continuing to do what you already know how to do and to try new way or new thing with le risk . in that way you will be a succesfull person . the reality is that you are a succesfull person when you feel so .
