i disagree with the statement that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide . travel to an unknown destination can be challenging and maybe even intimidating to some . but i personally believe that exploring and discovering the unknown is the real thrill in travel . a tour guide would take his group to all the popular tourist destination , following a set schedule and give them a brief history of each place . when you travel on your own , you are on your own schedule . people are most likely to travel when on vacation , and you certainly do n't need to abide by a schedule when on vacation and away from work . when you are travellling on your own , you can get a map , scout place , get recommendation from local and visit all the place that seem intruiging and appealing to you . you can read up and learn about the history in way that you would like and not have some guide rattle it out to you . if safety is of concern , you could always travel with a group of friend and still set your own pace . memories of place visited would have more excitement , a it would not be just the history of the place that you would take with you but also all your effort in getting to the place and other such experience . on your own , it is more likely that you would visit a place that is not a common tourist destination but one that definitely meet your taste and expectation . when travelling or visitng new york , a tour guide would definitely take you to see the empire state buidling , times square and the statue of liberty but for a complete expereince of a new yorker , you would need a lot more than that . to summarize , i would like to say that travel on your own is definitely more rewarding than travelling in a group with a tour guide . i seriously doubt that a tour guide showed columbus the way . and what a loss it would have been for america not to have been discovered !
