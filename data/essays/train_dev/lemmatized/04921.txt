basic concept and learning fact are two impotant way to judge difficulty occured in life , which can be obtain to judge that what are the need of a perticular circumstance or situation . and those idea can be generated only when a person is gone through or learned the perticular fact . therefore , i completely disagree with the following statement . that concept are more impoertant then learning fact . their are two way to learn the fact that is firstly , we can say that fact can be learn through the history and secondly , by experiancing on it own . students learning from the histroy would give them knowledge upto certain limit , but student experiancing on it own can get the complete lesson of the fact . to make you understand , let take one or two example to make the statement clear . firstly , if the student would hear the story of a person who ha travelled allot in his life . the student would get the complete idea of the difficulty faced by the traveller through concept but the fact of that traveller is not imagined by the student . instead of it , the student himself have travelled allot then he would get the complete idea of difficulty faced by him and then he could ultimately learn some lesson through the fact while travelling . secondly , if he had heard about the practical exam but never yet practised it in the lab then he definately going to face serious problem in exam because of unaware of direction and therefore , it is necessary for him to do practise for practicle exam before it is going to held . on the otherside if we would go is that there are some aspect which can not be experianced by everyone in that case student would definately go through the concept . likewise , if a student want to learn the dishaster caused to the earth after second worldwar . the student shuld not create the war again . to conclude that both are equally important for a student to understand idea according to the requirement of his interest .
