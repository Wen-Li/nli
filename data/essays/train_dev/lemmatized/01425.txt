i disagree with the statement `` it is more important for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact . '' because by learning the fact of something , student will really learn the experience and the knowledge . also by learning the fact of that thing , student can understand the idea deeply and clearly . when student are facing something , if student only think about the idea of that thing , student will only think about how to solve the problem . but by doing that , student will forget to think about the reason . why doe it happen , how doe it happen . if student learn the fact of the thing , they will get the answer , the how and why and something else . and by learning the fact of the thing , they will really learn experience and knowledge from the thing , not just do it . i have a friend who is in the yearbook team of our school . she is not a good a other student in the team because when she got a problem , she will ask the teacher how to solve the problem , which is right . but she never think about why the problem appear . when the teacher gave her the idea of the issue , she only follow the idea and solve the problem without thinking . by doing that , she doe n't really learn the knowledge and skill . when the same problem happen next time , she still ca n't solve it . so , learning the fact is more important than understand the idea . also , by learning the fact of the thing , student will get more chance to learn about the thing , therefore , they will get the idea of the thing easily and clearly also deeply . because they learned about it . after we learn the fact we will know the idea very easily and deeply . i have a friend who go to art class with me . when the teacher talk about the idea of a piece of art , he always ca n't understand . that 's because he doe n't study for that art . he doe n't know the background of the art and who the artist is and so on . so it 's very hard for him to understand the art only by looking at it . so learning the fact of the issue help student to understand the idea and concept . after all , learning fact is more important for student than only understand the idea and concept . students will gain lot of knowledge and experience by learning the fact .
