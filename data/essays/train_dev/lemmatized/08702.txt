i agree that young people do not give enough time to helping their communties . there are two reason a below . first , young people need to communicate with someone who join communties because they can learn many thing to become adult . second , young people can get good experience and advise to grow their charactertistic . for example , they talk with elder people , then they have different thinking , so young people can get different view of thinking . in conclustion , it is very important for young people to join their community . they can spend good time in their life .
