i believe that concept and fact are pretty related each other , so both of them are necessary during the student 's learning process . in many case , concept are the result or the inference made on study over fact , like for example pyshics law of gravitation that could be inferred after year of observation on planet movement , or demand and offerts law , that summarizes the behavior of the buyer and factory seeing for many year . so , to get a full comprenhension of a concept , it is neccessary to review and study the fact that are involve with the concept , and then try to undestand or infered what the concept is summarizing patter or similar behavior that you found . many professor and student just like to take a bounch of fact and review it , but this kind of learning approach is meanless , because you use fact only a supportative information , so you can really get a full understanding of what the fact are showing or what are happening . for others is more likely the approach of trying just to understand de concept without reviewing or analysing the fact , making very difficult to get a full understand of the concept and even making very difficult to applied it in real situation . for my the perfect convination of learning from the fact and undertanding the concept , is the best path to a succeful learning process .
