although peole may think that there will be more car in the world a the year go by , i hold a different view . i strongly believe in 20 year , there will be fewer car in use due increasingly high-maintance cost and better alternative . first of all , i hold this opinion because i believe that the increasingly high - maintance cost of car will discourage people to drive car . during the past few year the oil price have increased more than two-fold , which is making it difficult and unreasonable to keep up with automobile maintance expense . although , having the luxury of driving and owning your car may seem more glamorous , it just ist'n practicable nor reasonable anymore . as such more and more people are being discouraged to use car . in addition , i believe that there will be fewer car 20 year from now due to the fact that people now have better alternative for transportation . 30 year ago , using a car wa essential , a a mean of transportaion . if you needed to go on a business trip or visit family , there wa not much alternative method . however , nowadays , a car is n't the only method of going somewhere , there are various alternative . in place like new york or hong kong , you really do n't need a car to move around , you can use the subway or bus a your main mean of transportaiton . these day , in the major city of the world , i believe rather than owning and driving your own car , it is more wiser to use public transportaion . in summation , due to surging oil price and reasonable alternative , i would have to diagree with the statement . though driving your car , whether it is on a date or to work may have many benefit , i do not believe those benifits will out weigh the rational of choosing a different mean of transportation .
