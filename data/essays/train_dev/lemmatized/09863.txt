yes , i agree to the statement . there are many reason and example , i would like to cite in support of my opinion . generally , in everyone 's life success come through hard work . by taking new risk , trying new thing one can achieve success in their life . only successful people try new thing and take risk than doing well which is already existed . for example , in consideration of my life , firstly `` i will always try new thing and take risk '' . the reason are by taking risk and try new thing - we can know more thing not only on the subject but also on the practical purpose . it is always beneficial to take risk which help to work on our goal , it improves our talent , briskness , stability , strength , curiosity to know the thing . secondly '' when i am doing my project in my college lab - all lecturer , friend told that it is impossible to continue on that project . but i had taken it in a challenged way and lot of risk is taken on that project , i read lot of book for that project which helped me in gaining more knowledge on the subject and even some thing are know for me which are not told by my professor . in this way , i finally succeeded in my project and all are praised me a a successful person . so it is always better to try thing in new way and take risk to become successful person rather than doing on the existing . therefore i suggest to try new , learn new thing , and to do risk . however , in some case successful person are not taking risk and they are doing work on the existing thing to the advanced level . it is also an achievement to do the work on the existing thing . it all depends on how we approached and succeded towards to that aim . but some people success or not , it help to enhance in their individual thinking and creativity . insum , i would like to reiterate my opinion that the statement is agreeable from the above reason and example .
