athough people enjoyment differs from stage to stage , youth enjoys more a compared with the older people is definitely reasonable to agree with the statement . i observed in my life at part , that young people enjoys more . in modern world , due to the development of technology , they are more fascinated to new kind of object , such a mobile , computer , internet , etc. , and by using them that were available enjoying life . youngers are more affectionated to the day to day development of technology , by using those thing they enjoying more . older people are not that much aware of these technology . because technology is developing rapidly in these day to day life . younger one are more energetic than older people , they can go and do whatever they want . they make their friend a a part to enjoy in most of the public place , they usually attends party and meeting , and have capability to think and improve by adapting new technology they enjoys more . older people are mostly feel that they enjoyed in their younger stage , let u allow their child who are in younger stage would allow them to enjoy , because most of the life ha come to end . while coming to oldage , people think that they can not enjoy because they usually suffers with most of the health problem like heart attack , blood pressure , sugar , bone problem . today , the development of industry and factory a well a increasing pollution with people making them to live life upto an extinct , get affected to many disease make most of the older people think to that they can not enjoy their rest of life . in most of my experience , older people allows them to enjoy more a well a to get awareness of the social life .
