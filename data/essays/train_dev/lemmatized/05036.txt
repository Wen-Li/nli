many of the people in the world think that young people enjoy life more than older people do , some of the people think that older people enjoy life more than young people do . i aggre with that older people enjoy life more than young people do , because of that they know time is very fast and life give people only one time . young people always have problem with their life . they never think time is very fast . they only live without scare of death . for example i and my friend always have problem . because of our promblem many of time we dont want to do any thing . we often speks about our problem . we think to go to holiday for reducing from stress . nonethless we post pone it to other summer and other summer never come so we never go to anywhere . on the other hand , older people think time is very fast . for an example my grandmother always tell me she didnt understand how wa she be a older woman . she say that ` i fell myself a a young girl if i had a change to live life again i would travel all over the world` . she always go cinema for to watch movie . she go abroad often to visit other country which she did'nt go before . moreover my grandfather is too interesting old man.he is a good tenis playe . he play tenis every day . he take lot of interesting photo to tell life . to sum up , like my grandmother and garadfather older people lenjoyl
