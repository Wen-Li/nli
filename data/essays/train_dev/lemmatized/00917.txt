i disagree little time that young people nowadays help their community . there are two reason i think so . one reason is that it is important to think what others do think . communities consists of many people . if people participert their community , people can talk with others . so , people think of others . if people do not pertisipert their community , they do not think of others . so , people think of theirself . what people do not like happens , they quarrel . but , people can not live alone . two reason is to accept many people 's idea . so , people can think many idea . when people dissolve their problem , they might be able to solve them with other 's idea . therefore , i think young people shold help their community .
