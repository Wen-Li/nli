i disagree that young people enjoy life more than older people do . it is because i know that there are old people enjoy life more than young people in japan , and old people think that the time is very important because they hane fewer time than young people . however , not all of old people think that . who can enjoy life more than yong people ? firstly , the people is that they have always their purpose and they can always make an effort . for example , he is 65 year old and retired his job , but he wanted to work . of coruse , he can not be hired be any company . therefore he desided to build his office . he is very energish . he achieved that . next , the people is that thery have positive thinking and mind like child . in oter word , they can enjoy with yong people . it is because they think child themselves , and they do not warry about their age . therefore they play the tv game . climbing tree , and a lot of sport . for example , she is 75 year old , and lost her hasband and child . she is a old lonley woman , but she can enjoy her life . she began volanteer with high school student . she ha also childrens mind , so she could . recently , young people forget active enargy and lazy . if young people want to enjoy life more than older peple , yong people act with the older people . never give up .
