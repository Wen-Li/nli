i disagree with the statement which say the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide ; instead , i would like to travel alone or with my friend and family without the tour guide . it 's true that sometimes it 's more economical to travel in a group led by a tour guide . for example , for those people who are busy with their work and hardly can they spare their time to take a trip , find a travel agency and with a tour guide is a great idea . because they do n't have any time to plan their own trip . but they may not have so much fun a those people who travel alone . traveling without a tour guide may be a challenging for me . because i am not a person who are afraid of challenge . as a teenager , i am fond of challenging myself and like to take advertrues a well . as far a i am concerned , traveling without a tour guild can provide me with more pleasure . by traveling alone , i can also learn how to take the responsibility and be independent of my parent . i had this experience when i wa in elementary school , i along with my sister took a trip to hawaii without my parent 's company . at first , i wa so scared to go to a totally strange place . but after a few day , i found myself enjoying in it . i thought language would be my biggest problem . to my astonishment , i can chat with a foreign . moreover . i made progress by leap and bound . i also learned the history their by reading the book . i never knew traveling alone allow me to learn so many thing . i also had the experience traveled in a group led by a tour guide . but i found it wa not an active way to travel . in other word , they maneged everything for you . besides , i almost had no free time . although i really liked those people who traveled with me , by the time we arrived at the airport , everyone had had their own life to go on . in conclusion , i disagree with the statement not only because i find it 's much more fun without a tour guide but because i learn much more than a tour guide can teach me .
