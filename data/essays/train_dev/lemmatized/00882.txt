i feel that it always better to understand thing and not just mug them up . understanding idea and concept can lead to a better understanding of the topic . also if you get to understand it completely it can help you better in understanding of it related topic . you would also be benefited at the time of the examination . understanding help you a lot for future . if you go for research work later in your life then this understanding of topic would help you to take your research easily . secondly when you understand a idea then you dont commit mistake on that particular topic . for example , if a doctor dont care to understand concept about the human body , then in future he would be prone towards doing error . also he wont become a successfull doctor in future . and by destroying a case he would end himself in prison . so , the example clearly show how important it is to understand thing . we can also take an example of a computer engineer , where every fact and concept about the machine count a lot . and if he is unable to understand idea then he would just end up in choas . he would just damage the machine , and we all know how costly these computer machine are . thirdly understanding of idea in a younger age help you a lot when you go and pursue your higher education . for example , the understanding of concept at bachelor level help you a lot in understanding of the concept in your master . however , when it come to the examination , when you dont have time to understand concept it always advisable to learn the fact . at time crisis it always better to learn than wasting time in understanding it , because you are never sure that after spending so much time in understanding it , will you really be able to understand it . also at the time of quiz only learned fact help you win the game , and not the understanding of it . because there are so many thing in the world to know about , and you dont have time to understand there concept , and only option is to learn it . as reinstated in my answer understanding is important , it can not be compared with learning . both have there own standing .
