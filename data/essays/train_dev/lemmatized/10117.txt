although it may vary for each country , i do not think that young people nowadays give enough time helping their community . in the past , the sense of community wa much stronger : people , and especially youth , were much more commited to their community , and perhaps had a stronger sence of belonging . but nowadays , this sense is fading , and young people are becoming le and le attached to these group . in my opinion , this growing indeference in our society is related to the phenomen of the extension technology and mean of communication . with the developement of these mean , people no longer feel a real need to take some of their time to help their community , therefore accomplishing an act that used to be considered a a social reunion . instead , they - and especially the young one - have found an alternative in technology : cell phone , computer , and especially internet , by which young people perform most of their social interaction , and therefore , although having a perhaps infinitely larger number of people in their new community , have a more and more restricted and limited contact , or even no human contact at all . indead , if we consider le developped country , where technology is comonly used , but ha not yet become a full part of people 's life , we can see that they are much more comitted to their respective community , and give a lot more of their time to help them . therefore , the sense of community is being little by little shrouded by the modern and more and more dishumanized world we live in . but this is not necesarily a negative fact : the people have evovlved , and this evolution , a usual , especially touch the younger one . maybe the sense of community will , in the year to come , be redifined to be adapted to a more modern world , and to different way of thinking and acting .
