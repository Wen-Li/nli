the issue in hand is about the idea and concept understaing or fact learing . this issue is improtant because it can diectly affect the result of what the student learns . i believe that the understandinf of the idea and concept is the better opinion since it can make it easlier for student to learn . the first reason that i choose understanding of the idea nad concept because it is the easiler way of memory . unike remebering the fact , the uderstanding of the idea and concept is a lot easlier to transfer into long term memory . thus , it is able for student to remeber much longer . base on the easlier way of memory , i believe that the understanding of the idea and concept is a better opinion than the other . the stable foundation of the study is the second reason that i choosse the understanding of idea and concept . a deep understanding of the idea and concept is similar to a building which ha a stable foundation . only and only if the foundation of the building is strong enough , it is able to build up higher and higher . since the stable foundation of the study , the understanding of idea and concpets is better choice . finally , the ability of flexible use make me choose the understanding of the idea and concept rather than the other . the remebering the fact is just a remembering , it will not allow to create something new . however , unlike the remembering fact , a deep understanding of idea and concept not only allows the student to create something new , but also provide the ability to use it in any area . thus , i belieive that the understanding of the idea and concept is a better opinion . in conclusion , i believe that the understanding of the idea and concept is a better opinion rather than the other . it is because of the easlier way of memory , the stable foundation of the study and the ability of flexible use .
