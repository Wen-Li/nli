the issue at hand is , whether there are more car in use in twenty year than there are today or not . this issue is very important because of the global environmental pollution . i beliefe , that there will be much more car in use in twenty year than there are today . there are several reason why i state this meaning . at first , almost nobody who actually ha a car will sell his or her car or reduce the number of car or will change generally on the public traffic . even if the car is crashed , people normally make it repared or buy a new one . the reason for this behavour is verz simple : people are comfortable . using the car is the most comfortable way to move . furthermore , china and india ( emerging market country ) are country with a huge citizenship . actually , in these country , there are not a lot of car because most of the people living there have not enough money to purchase car . these country are emerging market country , i.e. the economy in these country will increase enormously . therefore , the people will get richer and in some year , a huge number of indian and chinese people will have the ability to purchase car . even if a lot of europeans and americans change their behavour and get more sensible to the environmental problem arising out from the individual traffic and sell their car or will not pruchase new one , the number of car will increase in the bext year . a third reason is the world economy . the production of car is an important economy subject with al lot of employee . futhermore , also the gaz industry is important . these two industry together will show that the number of car will not decrease beacause of their business interest . they will also take influence on the politics that they can sell their car and their gay cheaply ( e.g. no high tax on these product ) . as argued , i believe , that there will be more car in use in twenty year than today . but i am also sure , that the car will pollut the environment in twenty year not a much a today . in cinclusion , in twenty year there will be more car in use than there are today , because of people behavour , the people in the emerging market and the car and gaz industry .
