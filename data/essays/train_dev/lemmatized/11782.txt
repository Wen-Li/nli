by virtue of this text , i would like to express my opinion regarding the given subject . as a student in research , i consider this question mind-boggling to say the least . for year now , people have been debating on the subject in an attempt to decide whether student should learn fundamental or pragmatic knowledge . moreover , institution are also pondering the issue ; wondering what is the true essence of learning and mandate of scholar institution . considering my experience a a student for almost 16 year now , i truly believe that the learning of concept and fact are tantamount in importance . as for many thing in life , homeostasis between element is always the essential resolution in case of doubt . somehow , both are crucials to the attainment of a solid education and mental representation of knowledge . on one hand , learn facted served a an empircal visualisation of our realm ; on the other , concept and idea help u to conceptualize the invisible such a the atom or the creation of distant galaxy . it is my profound impression that one can not appreciate the richness of reality and a deep phenomenological experience without both perspective . to illustraste my point , i could use the analogy of a student wishing to comprehend psychology . it is in my opinion pretty simple to know a a fact that self-esteem is an important key indregient in child development . but in itself , self-esteem doesn < t exist a tangible matter , only it mere conceptualisation guide u in knowing one particular phenomenon . therefore , when we look at it we can observe a fantastic process happening before our eye . our conceptualisation help u identifying new phenomenon which in return , help u to establish new fact . thus , when we consider education a a way for student to be competent and autonomous we inescapably have to promote the acquisition of both through the learning of fact and concept .
