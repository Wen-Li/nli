from my point of view , a successfull person is someone who succeed in his life , someone who hit his goal , his objective . for my concern , i vote for the safety , that is to say that to if you always do what you already know how to do well , you will get more and more experience in the sector you 're working on . you 'll specialize yourself , become an expert , and so a a matter of fact , will be successfull . let 's take an exemple , someone who ha just started to work , he 's just started his professional life , generally he is going to do what he already know , so , if he keep working in his domain , he 'll become an expert . but on the contrary , if he start trying new job , specially in something he doe n't know anything about , he 's taking too much risk , and he may not succeed a well a if he would have stayed in his domain and specialized himself . this previous exemple implies someone who 's just started to work , but let 's talk about someone who had already a wealthy life and a good job . he decides to vary his occupation by trying new thing , thing which he is completly unfamiliar with . suppose that he manages to succeed in all of his new occupation , we ca n't deny the fact that among all of his activity , if one day there is any problem that pop and that he ca n't find any solution . from one little problem he could lose lot of money by trying to save his affair , or even selling it . so , through those two exemples , i disagree completely with this statement . the only situation where i could agree , is that the person concerned , can afford itself taking those risk by trying new activity . i mean if he ha a really good business and a safety bank account that ca n't be going down . but the safety is my priority for a successful person .
