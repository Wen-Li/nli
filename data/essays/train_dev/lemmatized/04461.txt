this statement typically reflects the fight between idea and fact . as far a i am concerned , learning idea and concept is much more useful for a student than learning fact . if i take an experience of mine , that will examplify what i mean . i am currently a student in a great french business school , and particularly focused on corporate finance . i attended score of theoretical class , mainly about great financial concept . for 6 month , i have been a trainee a financial analyst , in merger & acqusitions , in hsbc . i have quickly come to the conclusion that all the course i attended were really usefull . i mean that , professionnally , fact concretely do not teach anything , whereas idea and concept create those fact and explain them . it is obviously more important to have learned how to valuate a company than to have learened how much coca cola is valuated . moreover , idea and concept make one 's mind more open . they make one 's mental boundary broader . from a combination of idea may stem a lot of new idea , innovation and creation . but hardly nothing stem from fact , except fact and history . facts are worth in themselves , whereas the worth of concept and idea result from the innovation they allow . eventually , some fact are clearly important to know and understand thing . but to really and fully understand the french revolution in 1789 , for instance , one must have previously learned all the idea and concept prevailing in the revolution , such a the absolute monarchy or the emertging philosophy of `` le lumieres '' . the revolution is not just a succession of fact , and just learning the very date of it is obmitting the true essence of the revolution , what it really implied , the consequence it had for the life at that day , but also fur u , french people , today .
