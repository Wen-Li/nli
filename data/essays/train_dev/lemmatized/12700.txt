i think there are many way to trip . but i think travel with just a few people is much better . there many reason can support my thinking . one of the reason is travel with group led by guide , people should adapt their thinking . the travel in group can be contrast to working in company . working in company i should follow my leader , so i ca n't do what i want to do very well . also it just contains my opinion little bit . but working in own business or small business , they can share there opinion , and they can have dicussion , they can find best way to solve . the trip with few people is same case a working in own business . trip with few people , they can share there idea also they can choose best way to enjoy there trip . another reason , travel with tour guide , i feel not comfortable . i should follow the trip route which planned by tour guide , also i should be part of the group . for example , i trip the france for have great time in effel tower in paris . if i trip with group led by a tour guide , the tour guide will set up the schedule for trip but there are just 3hours for touring in paris . so i ca n't have enough time for effel tower , and i tour in another region that im not interested in. and it can cost much more than travel with few people . because you should pay for tour guide , and the hotel which chosen by tour guide . last reason , people can develop their responsible and ability of independence by traveling with alone or just few people . and it can be more exciting . because you should have to ask to the people in that region and search about that area . sometime it make you cost money and time but it can be good experience to you . therefore travel with few people or alone is the best way to trip and have fun in trip . also trip is not just for fun , you can learn the culture by searching that area .
