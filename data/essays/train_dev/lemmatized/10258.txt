some people think that young people enjoy life more than old people do . i am totally agree with this openion on condition that you are in good health . when we examine the the reason behind why old people usually can not enjoy life a the youth doe , we can find the answer for why the youth enjoys more . the young people are usually in good health and still have many hope for the future . they usually have le to care about life a they are not still engaged in real life trouble . they can easily spend money for fun and do anything for amusement . personally , i am in good health and i do whatever i want provided that i have enough money . i can go out anytime at night or stay at friend a i am away from my parent . but a for my father , he come home every evening for dinner and spends the whole evening at home watching tv . he wake up early in the morning and work all day . he ha to care for anything associated with our family in addition to his occupational responsibility . at the weekend , he prefers staying at home while we want to go out and do shopping or see a movie . he ha no pleasure of life and life in a very pragmatic way . young people have their own dream , own hope and they have expectation from life . they think , thing are more entertaining when you are young than when you are old . in addition to these , young people are not experienced about life and it pleasure . they can not think of possible result of temporary enjoyment . the old are more careful about life and always think twice before doing something . therefore , old people usually miss their past irresponsible happy day when compared being ill and troubled at home . besides , young people like seizeing the day , my personal concern is that anyday repeat itself , so whatever i do today is a gain not a pain for me . noone know what the future brings . life is meaningful when you are young . the older you get , the le happier you are .
