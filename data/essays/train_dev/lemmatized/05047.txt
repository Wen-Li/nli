first of all i do n't agree with this argument because think there will be more people on this planet and people need transportation . but what i do believe is that there will be fewer car that need petrol for their motor . i think that we will run out of oil sooner or later because there is limited oil on the earth and at the moment we are wasting the oil we still have . this will be the main reason why there will have to be other motor in car . another argument why the use of oil is going to decrease is that people start to realise what impact all the pollution of the air ha on our planet . the pollution result manly from burning oil and a lot of oil is burnt in motor of car . the pollution of the air cause climate change and natural catastrophies that allready effect people im an amount that make them change their thinking towards a more environmental thinking . the car industry is one of the most powerfull industry in our world and they wo n't just give up their position . therfore there is allready a lot of research beeing done to find alternative to oil a the energy source for motor of car . alternatives would be motor that run with hydrogen or motor powered by battery that can be recharched . these alternative are not competitive yet but a soon a we run out of oil a lot of progress will be maid in new technology . so in twenty year there will be more car in use than today because people at least in the first world can afford to by car and people need car a a mean of transport . but mayby there will be many car that do n't need petrol any more . our scientist find out new thing every day and mayby not to far from now we will all be flying around in our car and we will use clean energy to pwer them .
