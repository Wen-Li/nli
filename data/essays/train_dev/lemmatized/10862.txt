well , it depends of the kind of person , i think we all have sundry of answer and thougts about this statement , in my personal opinion i think it is more important to student to understand idea and concept than to learn fact . however i am not saying that it is not important to learn fact , but for me the most important is to developed this idea and concept in usual life . in the first place , when student learn in a classroom , most of them studied for the exam and no for life . for that reason i think it is important for the teacher to developed some outside class excersises , in that way they will be able to practice and really live this hypotetical situation , i am totally sure that this will be more efective than to be inside of the class talking and talking about the theme , because you not also will understand the idea and the concept , you will also remembered this maybe for the rest of your life , if you have a good memory of course . in the second place , when we memorize special concept in class and we have a final test at the end of the year , we usually do n't remember this special fact , because during the year there are so much activity , exam , quiz , and practice that are very hard to remember all , we only keep the idea and the concept in our mind . meanwhile , if you do a research of your work , maybe asking some student all around your college , or university you will find out that they prefer outside activity , in that way they can get the idea fastern than to learn the fact . on the other hand there are some student that prefer to learn fact because for them it is easier to understand and asimilate . finally i think that this is the world were we live , we will find a variety and several person with different opinion and concern about life , study , and whatever is in our mind , but in this speciffic answer now you know my opinion , for me it is easier to lern idea and concept , maybe for you is the same , or maybe not . but now , you can understand me a little bit more .
