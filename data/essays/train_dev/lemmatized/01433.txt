there are some people who like to go with tour guide in a big group when they travel overseas and even in domestic tour . it is not the case for me . i like travel by my self . there are three reason why i like travel by myself and i disagree with the statement above , the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide , because it would be impossible in group to go place that i want , delay the flight , and not buying lot of suveniors . first , it will be impossible to drop by the place that i wanted to go . if i go in a tour guided group , group ca n't go wherever i want to go but where people in group agreed to go . it is impossible to get out of tour guide ' itinerary too because of the safety reason what they call . for example , i will be really sad not dropping by at the most famous cholate store in san francisco when other might think it is waste of time . second , it is impossible to delay my flight . groups move by itinerary that have assigned long before by tour company . the tour guide would want to go a many place a they think in a short time . what if i want to stay in tour area for a while for a nice , bronze tan i wanted to get in france ? what if i fall in love which hot italian guy who is really good at kissing ? i would want to delay my flight for a week or so . is that possible for touring in goup ? no way . some people might say , `` i miss korea , i want kimchi ! '' when others do n't . third , tour guide tend to take tour group to ton of suvenior shop . just like leashing dog off from owner , tour guide spare many hour in suvenior shop thinking that people might want to buy lot 's of them and take it home . i do n't go traveling to buy suveniors . it would be wasting of time , spending three hour in duty free shop . in conclusion , traveling in group is not attractive to me because , if i go traveling , i want to spare more time knowing and leaning the place that i go by willing to spare more time and effort on trying to know what i want . so , it is not the best idea to travel in group led by a tour guide .
