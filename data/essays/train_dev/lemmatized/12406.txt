i totally agree with the statement that successful people try new thing and take risk rather than only doing what they already know how to do well . in my observation from the successful businessmen or professor , they often do thing or sucjects what other people do not understand at all . for example , ten year ago , while most people do not know value and benefit of the computer , but bill gates knew it . because he went ahead and tried the new thing ( computer ) , he made a real big fortune from doing latest technology . on contrary to those person who only do what they known , successful person are always trying new thing . they usually have a open mind to absorb all the latest concept , and they often take risk . for instance , if a businessman adopt the idea that he never heard before , it must be very risky to use it if the idea is not pratical to operate . there will be two different way for using the new thought : success or fail . most people will not dare to adopt new thing because they are afraid that they may lose everything . in this way , they gradually developed the idea that they do not want to learn the new thing and take advantage of them . in contast , this idea seldom be formed in the heart of successful people . they , of course , know the risk might be , but they are not afraid . successful people usually have a positive mind to keep them go ahead . in conclusion , i think that i truly agree the opinion that successful people try new thing and take risk rather than only doing what they already know how to do well .
