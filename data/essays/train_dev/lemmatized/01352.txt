i agree with the given statement which state that the most advertisement make product seem much better than they really are . there are number of reason and example that support this statement . the objective information that most of the advertisement show seem very attractive to the public and in many case that information might not be necessarily accurate . i can not comment that the information is incorrect , but some detail might be hidden in the information that they show to the public . the best example for this is the ` vehicle fuel economy ' number that the auto advertisement show . if the vehicle is driven under specific condition , the stated fuel economy can be achieved . but practically , under normal driving condition , it is simply not possible . another reason is that the fine print in the advertisement that people in general ignore and would face the consequence later . as an example , once i opened the home equity line of credit account with a bank because the interest rate were lower . i ignored the fine print which say that i need to pay huge penalty if i terminate the accouint with in 2 year after opening the account . interest rate went up soon after opening the account , and i had to pay fairly big amount to terminate my account with them . the reason and the example explained here might be specific , but in general one way or the other , the advertisement make product seem much better than they really are . and , i believe that one of the main purpose of the advertisement is exactly that . this is one of the business strategy of most of the big company to suceed in today 's business environment which is extremely competitive . in conclusion , it is very obvious that most of the advertisemsnts make product seem much better than they really are . and a discussed above , to some extent , it ha become essential for many company to follow this strategy to succed in the businees in current competetive environment .
