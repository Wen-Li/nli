i totally agree with the statment that succesful people try new thing and take risk rather than only doing what they already know how to do well . in my opinion , a time go by , the world is improving , and so do ourselves . we need to improve ourselves everyday to be successful . i believe that trying new thing and take tisks is the best way to improve ourselves . as the environment is moving on , we meet new thing . since we are not familiar with it , we should spent time to find out what it 's all about . in that case , risk is unavoidable because we do n't know what 's going to happen . in the progress , we can find out and learn a lot of precious knowledge that we never knew . in that case , we 're improving . in the progress , we may face a great difficulty , which is very hard to solve . when we managed to solve the problem , we gain experience . in this way , we make the new thing into the thing that we already know . so we can learn more thing if we try new thing . for the more , i believe that trying new thing can make u more intellegent . we face different thing so that we think about different thing . our brain can recieve a better practice . as a result we can be more intellegent . on the contrary , if we do n't try new thing and take risk , the only thing we could do is to repeat doing the same thing that we already know . that would have a bad effect on ourselves . when more and more new thing arrive , we still know nothing about them . so we would no longer be competitive . in other word , we would not be successful . as trying new thing can improve ourselves , make u learn more about the world , let u be more intellegent , i believe that trying new thing and take risk is more likely to make successful people .
