yes , i do agree with the quoted statement . i think success is connected to new thing and risk . as an example you can regard the opening a new business . if you want to found a company or a new business , you have to take several risk . first of all you do not know whether your potential customer will like or accept your offered product or serivce . but you have to invest captial in order to be able to offer your good . of course there is the risk of losing this invested money , if your article are not requested on the market . on the other hand , it may lead to success and it will pay off serval time . another aspect is the innovation of your business . you must be better than your compeditors to be succesful . new product by invention or imporvements are a must to survive on the market . a favourable price and quality is also a strategy to reach your target of success . a succesful company lay it focus on innovation . as a matter of fact you must offer something , that your compeditors are not able to . this can be a new product . but not only from the perspective of a company but also a a succesful employee you must provide your target group , who ever that is , with something new that other can not offer . as i have mentioned before , this take work and investment before , which may not be paid off directly . but that is the risk of success . a too high degree of security doe not permitt competition . i think competition will lead to the highest degree of performance in total . i can understand why people fear taking this risk because they depend on a direct income , but you should always try to experience new thing and try new method . the first one with somthing fresh and new ha a small number of compeditors and low competition . if it is requested what you are offering , it will lead you to success .
