fact is reality and people have to face the reality no matter how high education you are , reality still can beat you down so easily . there is always something to learn from fact . for example , indepentent , raise a family . .. etc , these stuff you ca n't learn from book or tv and just understanding the idea and concept of it . learning from fact is much helpfull than just understand idea and conpects . just learning concept and idea of one thing , it can help you to understand how it work but it ca n't let you really know how to '' make '' it work , like doing laudry , everyone know how to do laudry just throw all the clothes into the washing machine that 's the idea of doing laudry but in fact there are many kind of clothes that you have to wash and do you know this kind of cloth can put in dryer and which one ca n't ? . too many thing we have to learn from the fact not just showing understanding on idea and concept . abroading to other country is a great example of this topic . when i wa still in taiwan i asked so many people how is your feeling about studying in other country or what do we have to be aware and notice , suddenly i realize the idea of abroading to other country to study what will everything goanna be and i wa n't scared . but when i really came to america and study , everything is different than what i thought . so i realize everything can ' t learn from idea and concept , we have to learn from the fact . gradually i get used to this life and after i went back to taiwan , some people asked my what do i have to notice when i go to other country to study . i just answer : '' you will figure it out , it wo n't help you if i just tell you the sistuation will be '' . again ! i emphasize fact are much more important than understanding idea and concept . let 's make a conclusion here , understanding idea and concept only occupy 1 % but learning from fact it ha 99 % .
