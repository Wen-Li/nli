i agree with those who believe that more advertisement make product seem much better than they realy are for tha following reason : the costomers are more sensible for the external aspect of the product , if the advertisement exalts some particular the product become more interesting and a funny music or presentation may involve the costomer to buy . if the advertisement us an inteligent presentation the costomers hase more interest for it . for example if i product a cake for child and i show attractive ad funny character with my product in their hand ad i give some gift with this , my cake will be selled a lot . otherwise , if i do n't make some expedient my product appears not good . second , using tip like show how better a soap clean your flood but using another soap or a lot of whashes . finaly , if the costomer see a funny music , presentation o situation , he remembers the product better and if he find it in a supermarket with anoter tipe of same product , he chose the first .
