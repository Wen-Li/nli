i think that it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subject than to specialize in one subject . first of all it is true that you have to have many academic than one specific subject , because if you only have one specific subject you might get bored and you wo n't get well on it , but if you have many academic subject if you are bored on that you can go to the next one . so in my point of view it is better to have many academic subject . if you have many academic subject you can learn lot of thing that you might not hear of it , and give chance to people that have n't heard or know about it . or one day you can have your own job and you thought of helping people to learn somehting new that they have n't heard about it . i think broad knowledge is what you need in your life without it you wo n't learn something new . if you learnt one specific subject it wont be fun because in the other subject there are something new that you have n't knew about it . for example in your specific subject you choosed maths but you really liked history and you really wanted to know something in the past what will you do ? so in my point of view it is better to have many academic subject than to specialize in one specific subject . broad knowledge can be fun by learning something new or they might tell you to go abroad and experience something that they have told you , it will be fun because your in abroad and you will learn something on your own . so in my opinion go for the many academic subject , believe me you will learn something new that you have n't learned .
