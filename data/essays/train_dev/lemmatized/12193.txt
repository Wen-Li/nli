i 'm agree with this statement because i think that sometimes most advertisement make product seem much better than they really are . the advertisement is maded generally to achieve the customer 's attention because in this way there are more possibility that the costumer buy the product . there are some person that study for a lot of year to learn the rule of marketing and to learn the right way to achieve their costumer . today , on television , we can see a lot of beautiful advertisement . we are often intersted and enjoied from they , but when we buy this product in a supermarket often we are not so happy for our purchase . i think that often the advertisement that i see on television are really marvellous because they capture my attention . for example next week i saw the advertisement of barilla , a famous firm that product some type of pasta , and i thought that this is made a a little film . it 's beautiful because it talk about the life , the way that childrens have to see the world and the love that is between a mother and her baby , through all of this the advertisement speak also of a new type of pasta called `` piccolini '' . i think that this is a beautiful advertisement and each time that i watch it on tv i really want to buy the product . few day after to have sought this advertisement i have eat this type of pasta and i understood that it is not so good a i believed , infact i prefer so much the normal type of barilla 's pasta . therefore i say that often most advertisement make product seem much better than they really are a for example i can understand in tha case of pasta .
