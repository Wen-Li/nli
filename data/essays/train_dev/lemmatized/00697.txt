i really agrea with the point that say most advertisments make product seem much better than they really are . in fact tey have to do that to attract the customer . as a customer , we have the choice to buy the item or not . as i said most of the time the usually product look much better than the are . every comany or shop doe that . it is just part of their business . the more they sell mean the more they are successfull in their work , and in their business . these kind of adertisements became normal and common in these day , even though there are a few copanies say the right thing about their product a they seem . anyway , since we know that issue , and we are so familier with it , we should buy what is good for u . as we know each comany ha it own plan to attract the customer . in these day they even try to call you , and introduse their item to you . you would see alot of advertisement on internet , in newspaper , in magazine . sometimes you might even laugh , when you see something is free . that thing happened to me , when i wa going to buy a cell phone , which ha a sticker on it say free . i wa suprised , then i asked the seller he said it is not free , you just pay monthly or weekly a you like . we see strange thing that ha to do with markting , because everyone want to be the best . since that they try to do anything to show their item a they want . in my openion they have the right to make product seems much better than the really are .
