fifty year have witnessed the rapid development of the car industry . nowadays , the topic wether there will be fewer or more car in use in twenty year than that of today ha been hotly debated . although some people hold the opinion that there will be more car in twenty year because of the develop of the ecnomy , some people believe that the car number will become fewer . personally , i am one of those believe that there will be fewer car in twenty year . my view will be greatly sustantiated by the following discussion . the most persuasive point is that the science tecnologies are rapidly developping now . that mean there will be some other veicles subsititue car . according to some available survey , it is said that over 60 percentage company which are faminiar for their car producing are engaging in inventing new veicles . for example , the toyota company in japan ha invest over 7 billion to invent new veecles , and some new production were showed in the presentation during the past few year . furthermore , the resouces in our planet are not allow too much car which comsume a great mount of energy to run in our society . accompaning with the development of the groble ecnomic , more and more country especially china consum a lot fuel . not only do the gas ha been greatly reduced but also other resurces . it is commonly believed that car pay an important role in the reduction . if the number of car are more that that of today , what other resouces will be provided to car . in addition , the environment in the world areworsen now . there is a strong lik between an increasing the car number and the worsen pollution in our world . you imagine what it will be when almost every people drive themselves to work . recently , the stradegy of sustainable development ha been widely spreaded , many measure relate to the policy will help the world to get fewer car . taking into account all these factor which sometimes correatle together to generate an integrate whole and thus become more coving than any single one of them , we may safely draw the conclusion that the car number will be reduced in twenty year , that mean there will be fewer car than that of today .
