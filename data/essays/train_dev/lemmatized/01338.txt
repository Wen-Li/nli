in my opinion , understanding idea and concept are more important than just learn fact . just learning fact could bring few problem to student . first , if student just learn about the fact of any topic , they might forget them very easily , some student might not forget , because not every body ha same style . however , if they do n't understatnd idea or concept , they will forget when they do n't study fact for a while and try to study again . it is why understanding idea is important , if they understand idea and concept , they wo n't forget them easily . second , it is very hard to learn fact without understanding idea or concept . especially , for young student like elementray to middle school , they need to understand idea before they learn fact , because most of thing they learn in school for example are the stuff that they never heard about . therefore , if they just learn fact and not understanding idea and concept , they will get hard time in later like high school or college , even they still remember the fact . third , they can not discus about the thing that they learned , if they only know about the fact , because they would n't know what they should discus about , for example , student learn about the fact of soda , they ca n't discus what are the pro of soda and what are the con of soda . they only know that what is the soda . to get better knolwedge , those are the why they should understand idea and concept of the topic they learn . however , i would like to say the fact are very important too to know thing , because student could know specificaly about the thing they learn with fact . therefore , my opinion is understand idea and concept are more important and the first thing to get before learn the fact .
