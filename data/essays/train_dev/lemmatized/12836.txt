some of the people think that successful people must have to try new thing rather than only doing what that already know how to do well . in fact , people who want to try new thing must have to bear the risk . however , without trying new thing , thing wo n't be improved or invented by themselves , and there will be no successful then . so i agree with this statement . in this essay , i will argue in favor of this statement and give some example to support my opinion . firstly , if people never try new thing , but only doing what they already know how to do well , they wo n't know that there 's can be a change or improvement . since thing wo n't be improved or invented by themselves , and without trying the new thing , people are just like sitting at the same place or same level . thus , they wo n't be succeed . secondly , if people only doing what they already know how to do well , it wo n't bring out a change to improve the situation . since people are only repeating and repeating the same work that they used to do very well , there 's no change in their life . so , it 's also believed that they wo n't be succeed since there 's no change . lastly , although people who try new thing need to take the risk , it help to improve their work and life effectively . with such an improvement , people have opportunity to be succeed and go to a higher level rather than staying at the same place and have no improvement or change . so people who try new thing help them to be succeed , in a conclusion , it 's believed that successful people need to try new thing and make their life different . with such a differ , people will know there are something they can do to improve or change . so a to make their life become better and more comfortable than before .
