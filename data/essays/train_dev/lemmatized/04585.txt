the following argumentation is about if it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subject than to specialize in one specific subject . today everyone dream about to have a very broad knowledge and want to know everything , but is it always helpful ? i think it is very important to learn or to know a lot of different thing , which give you a basic knowledge about how the world work . i think that the people have to know that for example in history the important fact like when the first world war wa and who stalin wa and where the industrilisation started and so on . but in addition people should know about mathematics , geography , their own language , too . i think people should be able to handle with mathematic problem and should know the grammare of their language . but it is no use to know from every single subject just a little piece . it is better to specialize yourself when you want to work , because work always need a specific subject . for instance when you want to be a professeur for history , you have more to know than only the question about who wa stalin . than it is important to know that he wa a dictator of the ancient russia and that he wanted to make a communistic area out of the world after marxism . if you want to practise a specific work , the result is that you have to specialize you , because you have to know all background in order to do your best in your work . but i think , if you want to communicate with other people it is verz embarrasing if you do not know about some usual fact , which are a basic knowledge for everything you do . imagine that a stranger come to for example germany an ask you how many region germany have after it reunification and you could not answer him . that would be very poor . i think everone ha to know that germany ha 16 region . that is a fact . so , all in all i would say first one should know about the basic fact of many academic subject and than he or she should specialize him or her in one specific subject in order to work later . i would do it like this .
