travelling is one of most exciting thing to do on a holiday . when i have the time , i like to travell alot . i have visited india , egipt , and morocco . there are some difficulty that you might incounter during a vacation . for that reasoun i think that it best to be in a group or to have a toure guide . first , you may have difficulty finding the right place that you want to be in . for example , you might want to visit a cetain mall or a mounten but you can not find where it is . more often , you may get lost in the new country . a toure guide will organize your trip and make your vacation more enjoyable . second , you may have difficulty with a forigne language or culture . for example , a cetain sign in one culture may be offinsive in an other culture . also , a certain word in one culture maybe offinsive in an other . having a torue guide will avoid you thies proplems and will help you with the language and the culture . third , you maybe defraud by other people in a new country or someone may steal your thing . for example , i went two year ago to morocco . while i wa there someone tried to steal my bag and passport . luckly he failed to do so . beeing in a group and having a toure guide will be most benefical in that case . the toure guide will avoid place where you might get hurt in , also , will make sure that you stay in the most comfetable place . in conclusion , i think that having a tour guide is very important . first , a toure guide will help to go wherever you want in the most comfetable way . second , a tour guide will help you deal with the new culture and language . third , a tour guide will keep you save in any case .
