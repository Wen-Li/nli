in my sense it is better to specialize in one spesific subject in a globalised renovative and inventive world namely in today 's world a an exper in a specific subject . twentieth and this century have been the leading century in technological enhancement and progress . so much information is being circulated so fast that sometimes it is very difficult to fallow up the development . in suzh an environment it is more useful and efficient for person to specialise in a specific topic and improve himself in this field . to me we have to specialize since this is the only way to go in this century . just giving an example you can not go to a doctor specialised in the heart illness for a headache you are suffering . the very broad range of field in medicine requres doctor to specialize in one of those field . we can consider this requirement for all of other science namely social science math and etc . .. while you have the oppurtunity to examine detail from many aspect of view in one subject it is very hard to do this if you care about the all matter . and having this oppurtunity will contribute the efficiency and productivity of the study . by specializing in one subject one gain the confidence to carry out new research and he/she is encoureged with new finding . on the other hand a close cooperation among the field of study is necessary to yiled fruitful result . since some subject are interrelated and have very close tie with eachother we need to achive this cooperation in order to have more advanced result . finally i beleive it is better to have an expertise in one subject . this is not a choice but an obligatory situation in today 's world . morover some sort of efficient mechanism must be promoted to establish connection among the related subject .
