the argument of people 's view about having broad knowledge or specific knowledge deserves careful consideration because it 's such a complex one . some people hold the opinion that broad knowledge of academic subject will have more advantage than specific subject . in my point of view , i prefer having specific knowledge rather than broad one . there are numerous reason why i think specific subject is good and i would in here explore a few of the most important one . first of all , we come from a collaborational society , therefore , we need lot of different specilaists to improve our problem . it 's even a tough job for a genium to invent or solve everything we need . we also know that every people ha it adventages no matter he is clever or not , therefore , it 's better to specialize in one specific subject . if we do that , it will explore more specialist to contribute their capacity to our society . another essential reason why i advocate this point is that we can establish our country ' economic position by cultivating such specialist . for example , in the past , taiwan , my country , is an agricultural country . later , our ex-precident , in order to make resident living better , tried to find out the better way to improve our economy . finally , he found that computer , internet would be the most popular product in the following century . therefore , he planed a policy which about training specialist , encouraging them go aboad to learn the skill . under such improvement , we transfer our economic system successfully . there is an argument to be made by the opposing position . they might say that having broad knowledge of many academic subject will enrich people 's view . but the statement i have presented above , i do believe it 's the most valid .
