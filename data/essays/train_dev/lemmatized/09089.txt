people who have succeded in this world have taken risk the set a difference between them and those how have not , and i have seen case like that . that is why i agree with the statement . most of the people around u can be called regular people , i mean those whose activity and action do not exceed others . indeed , the people that can be refered a successful can be distinguish from all the normal group . i remember once when i wa 18 year old and i went with my family to paris . the first night we went out to have dinner and , suddenly , in the restaurant we saw one of the most famous actor from hollywood . thus , i realized that many people were looking at him and some others were asking him his last film . indeed , this kind of person are some kind og magnet to others . the fact is that this actor began is career acting in a old theater and letting other people how good wa his performance . he took lesson from a acting academy , something that almost nobody else doe . another example that i would like to give about my opinion , refers to the business world ; where you can be rich in just a matter of hour . when i wa in the university i remember , studying for my major , we where studiying business success a the pick of our life , so we analyzed the bill gates case . therefore we came to the conclusion that you only have to have an idea , a good , new and different idea to have success and in this case how to be richest in the world just in couple of year . what happened to him is that he worked hard on something different and came up with the big deal of affortable computer . in conclusion , i might say that making the difference , taking risk , having new and good idea is the best way for being successful is life , in any point of view . for those reason , i agree with the statement .
