i totally agree with this statement . doing just the thing that all people do is not really creative and will never differ a specific person from the others . but being successful mean being different and taking risk otherwise everybody would be successful . we all know the phrase : ` no risk , no fun ' . that can be used for many part in life . for example in the stock market . there are so many investment banker . who are the real successfull one ? the guy who took the highest risk ! another example is given in the movie business . how many of this famous hollywood star have ever finished or even started university ? most of them did not ! they took the risk of being a star or a nobody . same to all this well-known hip-hop star like snoop dog or r. kelly . but it is not just the risk that people have to take to become successfull . they also have to try new thing . the have to be innovative . bobby dekeyser is innovative . bobby dekeyser is succesfull . being a former soccer player he decided to open his own business . his idea wa to create high-quality chair . the problem wa that he could not find anybody who would invest in his idea and the much worser thing wa he did not know anything about chair . but after ten year of hard fight for his idea and his dream he is now one of the most famous chair producer and his company called dedon produce for star like brad bitt or nicolas cage . to recap the mentioned point it is important to understand through the given example that to be successfull mean not only to take high risk or doing something different than the others . it mean also fighting for odreams and not giving up in difficult time . all those thing together make people really successfull .
