given an oppurtunity i would like to answer the question basing on the country about which the question is being asked . in my perception the answer completely depends on the nature of the nation and the people about which we are talking about . so i would like to both agree and disagree with the given statement . in the present day world we have nation with various economic status . there are developed nation , developing nation and underdeveloped nation . we can see a definite distribution of the number of car in relation with a country 's economic status . a developed country ha more number of car per caput than developing country which are followed by underdeveloped country . since much of the world population still life in developing or under developed country we can say that number of people owning car in the present day is le compared to that who do n't own . as time pass nation gradually develop and the per-capita income also increase so the purchasing power of a citizen . so we can see that number of car should rise in the next twenty year . but this alone is not the point . as the number of car increase the fuel consumption in country would also increase leading to a fuel scarcity and hence price rise . but this will again not be the same globally . countries which are rich in oil will have a comparatively much lesser price rise than others in case they do n't want to export their oil . so we can clearly see that the citizen in these country can afford to buy more car than others leading to an increase in number of car . another point to make is environmental concern . since increase in number of car would lead to an increase in green house effect people concerned about the same would tend not to use car . but again we lack the data regarding how much of the world population is ready to give up the comfort of using car for sake of environment . another important point to think about is the public transport system in a country . if the government improves the same people may tend to use car in a lesser number . this again would vary from country to country . since i have no information about the above mentoined point i ca n't caste my vote to whether number of car would increase or decrease . if i were given the data regarding the growth rate of various country their population , their economic policy only then can i clearly say whether there would be an increase or decrease in number or car .
