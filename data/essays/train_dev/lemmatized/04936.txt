recently , in the company , people who are employed by company are basically given their task from sinor people . i strongly believe that successful people try new thing and take risk rather than only doing what they already know to do well . the reason is that people can have much responsible for doing well and unless people think about , their skill will be in a wrong way . first of all , if they do what they already know how to do well , people may not comtite each other . in addition , people will be think same in working because of doing a well and they can not have laiable for keeping something . however , due to trying new thing or having risk , people may work hard in order to making money ad preserving something such a family . therefore , people who have responsible for anything can come up with good idea in order to success . secondly , if they don `` t need to think about to make new idea , their knowleadge can not be grown . people who think about forever can bring up parmanentaly . since knowleadges are used , so they can know the new skill . it can mean that people can be in a good way . for example , basically , a people are getting older , their knowleadge decrease . however , people who get a novle prize are increasing thier knowleadge baecause of thinkinhg . we can say that person of getting novle prize is successful . although they are usually old , they can make an effort in order to invent new thing and they take risk . therefore , they can live truthly to be successful . as i mentioned , unless people take risk and try to do new thing such a inventor , people can not success . if you do the old thing which is known already , your brain inferior to people who make an effort . so if you want to be successful person , you have to be disadvantage .
