youngsters and community aid i believe the implication of young people in helping their community will vary from one country to another . focusing in my home country , spain , i must say that i do agree in general term with the statement proposed . the decline in social concern that western country like sapain are experiencing is due , in my opinion , to two main factor : the improvement in the quality of life of middle class family and the reduction in the size of family . spain ha changed a lot in the past thirty five year . while some decade ago we still had a considerable proportion of our population living in condition of poverty , that is not the case anymore . middle class ha boosted in spain and nowadays it is one of the country with the most disperse distribution of wealth . in this new situation there are le class difference and therefore the need of helping the community is not so evident to young people . another important social change in spain ha been the dramatic sreduction of average family size . thirty year ago there were very seldom one-child family in spain . today , this is the most common situation of family . one-child family usually tend to over-protect the lonely child , and these child become le concerned about social aspect of life . therefore they do not spot the need to help the community afterwards when they grow up and become youngster . these two reason just express my opinion and must be taken in general term . i am sure there are a lot of other reason why young people do not give time to helping the community , but i consider these two a the most important one . it is also important to take into account that there are exception , i know young people that devote a lot of time to help their cummunities and even some that work full time in field related with community aid , but i just feel this is not the general behavior of this generation .
