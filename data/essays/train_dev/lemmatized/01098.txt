when people go to travel , they should led by a tour guide . i agree with this statement and i have tree reason why i agree with it . people have to move a group in a guide tour . it is kind of tiredness but i think that people can know other people threw a tour . i would exprain why people should lead a guide tour . first , people do not have to waste time during the travering . people usually travel which they have never been . therefore , ofcourse they do not know where there are . they can get information from just guide book or internet . however , when people lose the way , these information are not helpfull because book cannnot say any word . if people lead s tour guide , they do not have to waste time and actually they do not have to use the map so much because if they have question in the travering city , they can ask the guide tour person . i think that they have more imformation that the book and people can ask any thing which the book do not have . people should n't get stress during the travel . people should comunicate with other people . if people travel with their friend , they usually move together most of time . therefore , if they travel and look around , they always go to same place . however , if they go the travel with a tour guide , they can get more interesting information from other guide tourist . i think that tourist people can get the free time and each tourist travel with their family of friend . therefore , they look around with them which mean that tourist spread . after they finished free time , they can ask interesting information which they do not know . moreover , they can comunicate other people . they may make new best friend . if people want to enjoy their travering , they should comunicate other people . third , people should be decided their plan during the travering . i have experience that when i travel without a guide tour with my friend , i wa excited at first day but second , third day , my friend and i wa got tiredness , so we thought that we do n't want to move from the hotel even we are travering . after we came back to our house , we are dissapointed ourself because we spent a lot of money to taravel but actually , we did n't enjoy the place where we went . if people are decided the time schedule by a guide tour , they have to move at thet time because it is group tour . people should make the plan and take responsibility to do not waste money . people can travel enjoyable . therefore , i agree with a guide tour .
