i agree with the idea that most advertisement is better than the product itself . for example , when i read fashion magazine i find many attractive page which appeal various product such a cosme , dress , watch , and perfume . whenever i look at these kind of page , actually i feel like buying them immediately . the one reason why people have interset with advertisement when looking it is that it usually use female model whose style is good and it always look very enjyoable to use the product . it attracts people and urge them to buy and wear them . sometimes people tend to forget that they do n't have same face , style and atmosphere with the model . it 's a fault . after obtaining product , people feel it 's not better than expected because people do n't really need it . the another reason why most advertisement is nice-looking for people is it 's quality . to compete with other company and get a big share of market , company make effort with various way , in particular for advertisement . a recent reserch show that 90 percent company in fashion field consider they should spend money and time to produce an advertisement . for example , to hire famous designer cost 10 time higher than salary of one employee month . consequently the quality of advertisement sometimes win the real product itself . for these reason , i support the position of considering that most advertisement seems much better than the product itself .
