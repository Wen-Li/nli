in general , i agree with the statement that understanding idea and concept is more important for student than learning fact . to my mind , the idea of school is that student learn for their life . they should not only learn fact by heart , since it is more important that they understand the idea of what they learn . if they can reproduce a whole text with many fact , but do not really understand the meaning of this text , what did they learn ? i would say , nothing . because then the student doe not profit from it . maybe he doe , in an exam for example , because he can answer the question correctly , when they are superficial . but for his further life and understanding of the world he could not learn anything . i think , it prepares them for their future life , when student are taught in a specific way that they understand different idea and concept . this should be the object of a school or a similar institution . still , it seems clear to me that the two aspect have to be balanced . facts can also play an important role for understanding idea and concept . sometimes it might be just unevitable for understanding a special idea to learn fact about it . the thing is that this should not be the only aspect . while learing them , one ha to go beyond the fact . that lead to the better understanding . in conclusion , i think one ha to do both , learning fact and understanding idea and concept , but learnig fact should always have the final goal , understanding something better by doing this . from my point of view a a student , i can also say that it is not enough to learn fact without getting the real meaning of it . i think this is good like that . those guy who only try learing by heart fail in school .
