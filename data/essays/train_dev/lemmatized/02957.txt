i agree with the notion that there will be fewer car in use twenty year from now , then there are currently based on certain fact and projection . firstly , we all know how the gasoline price are rising everywhere . although part of the reason is political , there is no doubt that the amount fuel in reserve ha dwindled rapidly . for a common commuter that mean an additional cost , a cost which is not increasing with his/her income . slowly this would lead to people shifting to public transport . the goverments are also working in various country to improve there public transport system especially in the big city . sooner or later most people would have access to good and efficient public transport . secondly , a the population in city is rising there is lesser space for housing consequently either the city would get bigger or more housing would be built in the space which is available a of now . if the city get bigger , the distance might become to large for people to drive on their own . most people would , i feel , prefer getting on to a train and bus . not having the discomfort of driving these long distance and maybe getting some work done on the way . if more housing ha to be built in the city , then the parking space and wide road will have to go . in this case most definitely people would have no option but to leave their car and rely on public transport . finally , with the rise in global temperature being linked to green house emissons , the time is not far when government would start charging exceptionally high tax from people who are producing these gas to compensate for the nvironmental damage . the car owner , i think , would be one of the first to get hit with these tax . so unless some radical new fuel which is both cheap and clean come up in the next five to ten year , i think we are looking at much fewer car twenty year from now in our urban environment .
