i agree this opinion . i have three reason about this . first , the age of community is growing up . there are usually many older people in the community with enlonging the mean age . older people have many witness , skill and culture , so young people have to absorb it to heridate the new generation . indeed young people are difficult talk with older people because the interested thing are quites different . we have to get those thing . second , it is safty to protect our community themselves . the ratio of damaging by the thives could decrese with power of protecting themselves . in fact , it is possible to decrese it by walking around the community at night . we are be too careful to close at door and window a possible a we can , but thief are often appears . it is necessary to prevent from invading thief with community power . finally , human live with group . we can not live alone . while young age , it is little opportunity to be helped by other people . if they need , they take a telepone some friend at long distance . they get not help but opinion , we can put it off .
