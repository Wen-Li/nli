today in our world no one can not count his success without taking risk . if one want to successful he must have to take risk . without risk one can not success . i m agree with this statement that successful people try new thing and take risk rather then only doing what they already known how to do well . first , successful people have good expiriance about his business so they want to use his expiriance in other business . by doing this they also know new thing and also knowing new business stretergys . these stretergy help them to creat their business more powerfull and strong . for ex. recently a popular industrialist from india under take a gient steel company of europe . his exprince help him to buy this company . second , successful people are already having good setteld business so they can give their more time to new business which they started . by taking this risk , starting new business they also come in touch of new people from another industry . by comung in touch of these people one can study another industry and it help him lot in new business risk . a business man started softwear comoany but he doe note have expiriance about it but keeping touch with other i.t company it help him lot in his new business . third reason is successful people have already earn good amount of mony from their business so they have good balance of mony to spend on new business . they allways want to be successful so they never think about risk . it is true that successful people try new thing and take risk but in today competitive world every one have to take risk to became successful . if one take risk for being successful his chance will incresing to be a sucessful .
