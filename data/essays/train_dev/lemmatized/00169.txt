do you think that there will be fewer car in use than there are today ? some people believe in this dream . however , i do not agree that that many people might give up on using car in twenty year . i have got several reason to think so . first of all , the statistic done up to now show u that there ha been a rapid increase in the amount of car in use all around the world . moreover , it seems that it is more likely to keep increasing . there are three major explanation for this rapid increasem : `` the decrease in the cost of making car , the population growth and the overal recovery in people 's financial situatuion around the world . '' these and related factor have been enabled more and more car to be produced . secondly , we can easily see that transportation heavily depends on car in most of the country around the world . for example , in the u.s there are state and city , like dallas , where there is no presence of a good public transportation . you almost have to have a car in order to go somewhere . moreover , statistic show that more than 60 % percent of the world transportation rely on car . thirdly , people have been considering car a a need rather than a luxury . especilly men start to dream of a car starting from their childhood . most people would not want to give up on their car or their dream to have a car . maybe in the future , in metropolitan city like new york and istanbul , some people might stop using their car or can be forced to do so because of the terrible trafic problem . in conlusion , it strike me that in twenty year there will be not fewer but more car in use than there are today because of such reason i have mentioned above .
