i agree with this statement . i think it is important to have broad knowledge of many academic subject . it is because we need broad knowledge for all work , lefe and etcetra . i think that specializing on one specific subject are based on the broad knowledge . first , for example , we think of economist . truely , they are supecialized in the economic subject . but , they have a lot of knowledge broadly . it is because economist need to have various knowledge to think of economy . for instance . on thinking about economic plan with another county , they need the knowlwdge of the histry , relationship and some other about that coutry . second , in our life we need broad knowlege , too . for example , when we read the newspaper , ther are so much imformation of many thing . if we do not have braod knowledge , i think i can not understand the almost of the news . it is because today 's news are made of the histrical thing , geografy thing and so on . so we need broad knowledge to understand today 's thing . from these two point , i think it is impottant to have broad knowlege of many academic subject than to specialize in one specific subject .
