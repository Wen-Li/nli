`` being young at heart is more important than being young in age '' . i disagree to the statement that young people enjoy life more than older people do . lots of young people of late do not look at life the way it is supposed to be taken rather are carried away something that is unreralistic and is only depicted in certain view . the older people who have seen the hardship of life a well a the unexpecting situation of life and lived up to the expectationsof themselves a well those relying on them at that time , are more likely to enjoy their life a they have lived up to their duty and have passed the test of life in hardship and endeavouring time that the unpredicting future ha had in store for them , on the other hand a younger person in the present third world where competition is the very word for survival . the young who is now at the crucial stage of the life with lot of demanding responsibility resting on his shoulder and the dream to be realised and pinnacle to be reached , goal to be accomplished to save his face in his view a well a those who count on him , look at the life and the obstacle in the path only with the view of overcoming them but not with a view of apprecitaion that the trouble and tough time are not forever . in the attitude to win the situation the young often fail to appreciate the beauty of very trivial thing which indeed have in them a abundance of happiness which rather the smart and patient old would view and appreciate it for what it is . a research scholar who ha seen a lot of work in his time and been through testing time of lack of result probably enjoy his work with a more optimistic view and would device more way to make it work rather than to sulk and lose interest and patience in work a most of the young are most likely to do . a old person for example consider a dextrous surgeon who ha understood the real meaning of life and the importance of the role he is playing in saving a life enjoys the work he doe due to the perfection he ha achieved of late and also the underlying role he play , where a a young and new learning and practising surgeon look at the situation only in term on his development and fails to realise the hidden satisfaction and happyness of work that a aged surgeon gain in a similar situation . thus the real meaning of enjoying life is existant in the very minute detail it brings in front of u , which when viewed with a optimistic and a patient view appear more meaningful than with a pessimistic view . age definitely is not the criterion that determines whether who ha fun or who enjoys life but it the importance of appreciating thing and looking for positive in every little thing is the real enjoyment of life .
