both young and older people can enjoy life but i think younger one will enjoy it more . young people have fresh energy to use and they can do whatever they want . they can do some activity for adrenaline . for example bungee jumping , to jump to sea from high rock , dance untill morning etc . older people can do these easyly . their energy will not be enough for these . also they will have a family to look after . and they need to pay the bill . so they can not use the money how they like to . but younger people need money just to have fun . they do not need to pay bill or they do not need to look after a family . they need money to go travel , drink beer , have fun with girl , going to disco etc . lets think an old man aged 70 and a young boy aged 20 . there will be an important thing that the old man can not do in that age . this is sex . i think sex is the most enjoyable part of our life . only this opinion can make me to support that young people will enjoy life than older people do . older people always think about to work , to eat , to sleep and maybe to travel in their mind . they use most percentage of their mind to do these . and only a little part to have fun . young people always think about where to go this night , which girl i must date with , which film i can watch today or to do a party at the weekend or not . all in all younger people enjoy life more than older people do . because they have high level of energy , or no family to look after . they can do what they want . they can do when they want .
