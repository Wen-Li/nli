nowadays we are completely surrounded by every kind of advertisement ; watching tv , listening to the radio or surfing the web , it is almost impossible to skip advertisement . they belongs to our society now ; they can be sometimes annoying but at the same time they are important for a company to improve the name of it brand and the knowledge of it on the consumer . personally i am not critic about advertisement ; sometimes i like to focus my attention on them , i do like buying some magazine just to take a look on fashion advertisement and i have to admit some of them are reallly funny and smart . they are now so important that many company tend to spend huge amount of money and making cospicuous investment on them in order to gain customer trust and obviously profit . nevertheless all this i have just explained is not always supported by a good product in term of quality : it happened to me many time in the past and i wa really hungry about . i bought a particular doll to give a a present to my little sister in-law , she wa just 4 and according to the advertisement that nice doll had to walk and to use rollerblade only with three battery . i wa absolutely enthusistic about the idea and i wa sure that my littke sister for sure would appreciated . finally , she opened the box and our joy soon turned into rage since the doll did not work at all even with the battery ; so the advertisemet wa really tricky and mislead . moreover i felt really bad because my lovely sister wa clearly disappointed . in conclusion , this wa just a personal experience but now since that day , i feel more mature and confident when i choose a product , sometimes we should trust on advertisement but not completely and always being aware .
