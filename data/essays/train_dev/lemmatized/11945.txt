most of the product look better in the advertisement , but not all . why ? that depends on the target market that the company or the producer decide for the product . for example , when you see the mc donald 's advertisement , they show you a big and tasty burger , but when you go there and buy it , you realize that this burger is smaller and not that well presented a the one you saw on tv . in the other hand , when you see a rolex 's or cartier 's ad , you see exactly the watch or the product they are selling to you . then , when you go to the store , you see the exact same clock or product that they showed you . when people that watched the mc donald 's ad on tv are hungry , their mind can automatically tell them that the burger they saw is a good option for lunch . but when people is thinking to buy a rolex watch they want it to be elegant . if they go to the store and they see that the watch of the adverisement is different from the one in the store , they wo n't buy it .
