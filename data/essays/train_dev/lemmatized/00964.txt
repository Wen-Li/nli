its hard to agree or disagree , but i go more with agrrement . i am going regulalry to the church youth , a place where you would expect young people to be paticipay in different activity of the community . but is isnt the case , ist more like dont asjked to me help , there are 6.6billion more people on this world please asked them . i find it sad that people react like this in a time , where there acctullz able to change something or get something started . i said before that ist to find a right opinpion , i belive it depens on the activity. a work in inclues social activity , isnt the likelies one studens or young people . there are moen in to the sport . i personally know many , who are active in sport , not just doing them but also train the youht team . and thant is a way of helping the community . the much more intresting question is , why dont they want o do social work or activity ? why is it more atractive to spend the time playing video game ? it wasnt that all age ago , otherway you could statment nowadays . there is a switch in the thinking , we are getting more egoism , `` dont bother me '' . maybe people arent any more religouse enough , they gave up the christinanty moral of helping each other . nowadays we need is interent , you stay behind your desking and the whole world is in frnt of you , the internet , you dont even have to leave the house anymore , just order on the interent . i wnat to point out , we are loseing somthing social connetion . maybe a person who ha lot of this connetion is more likely to spend time helping the cmmunities a whom , who just sit all day , cheking out the triple w. this statment ha something in it , where you could say , a a inter-guy , i give enough time . chatooms are also sometimes called community , in order to this kid help each other in sharing information about their idol , etc. school is place where kid should learn how to live in community , a class is like community , but mostly they dont learn , because there arent any activity , who give them the feeling of beeing part of a community . helping out ist mostly the kind of job , which isnt get paid , but money the stuff that keep the world running , so i assume people would help if the city help with a finicial plus . to close this i think there are many reson , but in the end they all have the same idea among them egoism or volunteer ( doesnt get paid ) . i hope someday we will recognize that a volunteer job can give you the same good feeling like a paid job .
