everyone want to be successful , in our personal or professional life . this is a level showing your quality , and this can show a well your wish to progress in your life . as an example , if a working person want to progress in his working life , he ha to show his motivation by trying new thing such a giving innovative idea or spending more time on project . this will prove to his manager that he is concerned by his work and by the company itself . he can reach to a better job by this way , being promoted and earning more money . on the other hand , if this working person stay quiet , doe not try new thing , this mean that he doe not want to take risk . and sometimes , this can be a security for him , he can keep his job and he will be sure that he will be paid at the end of the month . indeed , if this one ha a family , he ha to be able to buy all his family need . maybe he will find a routine in his everyday life , but he will be secured that his family will have what they want . in my opinion , i think that we have to progress in our life . and if this mean that we have to take risk , or to try new thing , most of people should do this . for example , if i have a report to do in group , i will suggest all the time new idea , even if these are not relevant , but at least , i would have tried . i know this can be boring for other team-mates , but by this way , the report can progress , and this could be a success if everyone tried this . successful people are not rare , they are part of our everyday life and they allow some work to be done in time , and with idea of quality .
