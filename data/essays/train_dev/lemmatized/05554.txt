i do agree with the statement `` it is better to have broad knoeledge of many academic subject than to specialize in one specific subject '' . because of differents reason . firts , i believe that it is nice to be able to talk about differents kind of theme . for example , i would love to have the opportiunnity to debate about economic problem with a person and discus world history at the same moment with another person , such a it could be a dinner with friend . also i believed it is better to have and idea about differents aspect of life because it show what is important for a person in their life . the idea of be interested in a variety of stuff for me is a way to demostrate that he or she is a culture person who want to learn more and more about life . besides , that is a statement that i have been debateing with myself lately becacuse i am at one step to enter to the university , and i had to choose whether a carrier that contains knowledge of many sbujects , such a international relationshiops ( i. r ) , or to choose one with more specific information . since i like to have broad knowledge of many academic subject , i decided to follow the i. r carrier . in conclusion i prefer to have knowledge of differents aspect beacuse i have the strong believing that it is important to be informed about almost everything . in addition to that , i think that with this kind of knowledge , society personal 's image of a person is gonig to be better and more interesting . finally it is the kind of knowledge that i considere appropiet for the university carrier that i had decided to follow .
