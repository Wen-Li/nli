definitly advertisement make product seem much better , they have to , otherwise who will be willing to buy product . the purpose of advertisement is intended to do so . i strogly agree with the statement , espeacially for selling their product , earn profit & so on . first of all , if the company ha to sell a new product , they have to work on how to attract consumer . though the product may be not so good . for example , when i see an advetisement on any medication , espeatially for cold i look for how it is different from other medication & buy the medicine to try out , then it totally depends on me if i want to take it or not . secondly , buy making the advetisement look better from the product will help the company earn profit . if people are attracted by the ad then only they may buy the product . it will bring people to atleast give a try . that will benifit the company , but latter it all depends on how the product actually is . for instance , i saw an ad on weight loss program , using pill make you slim & trim . i wa so attracted to it that i just wanted to go & try it out . i did , but when i took the medication with no diet control i lost so much weight , that wa incredable . but once i stoped it i stared to gain weight . it wa profitable for the company but not worked for me . not even that i gave suggestion to all my other friend too . but later realesed that it doe n't work . by my suggession all my friend bought the product . to conclude , all ad are made attractive inorder to attract consumer & sell their product to earn money , but it boil down to one point that we have to decide to buy or not . your judgement is the best . every one see thier own profit but we are at loss so be careful
