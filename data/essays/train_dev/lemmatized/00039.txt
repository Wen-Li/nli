innovation in business life some people argue a if it a general truth that if you want to be a seccessful person you dont have to need to take risk . but to be frank , i have no confidence on them . the reason and example listed below will explain my point of wiew in this situation . we know that the world is changing rapidly . technology is improving and in business life only innovative people gain much money . for example , there are lot of innovation course for business and production place . because they know that if you want to make customer satisfied , you need to take risk and try to find new thing for them . you can only be the competitive company in market by innovating act . furthermore , i give an example about my job . i am an engineering manager in a company . engineering management need to have both an ability in engineering skill and manegerial skill . and i always studied hard and never afraid of taking risk on my job . now next year , i will be the top manager in my company and my bos told me that the most important thing that make me the top manager is my encourages in taking risk and innovative behaviour in company . we may safely come to the conclusion that if you want to adapt yourself to the new life , you need to be innovative and encourage to take risk . it give you lot of advantage in all of business life and i thinh it the only way to be seccessful .
