when student have to prepare a test they study on note they took at lesson and read the book to well learn the topic . we can split two method to learn , one using the fact and one using the idea and the concept . mainly student at first learns the fact , in fact is more easy for a person store a fact than understand a concept , but sometimes it is not enough to be well prepared for a school test . sometimes is nedded to know the idea and the concept who are back on the fact , they are more difficoult to learn becouse the person can understand and compare the main idea of the fact just once a person well know the fact , . i think that is more important for student to undersdtand the idea and the concept than it is for them to learn the fact becouse if you know the idea and the concept it mean you well know the fact , and sometimes if you forget the fact you can remember the idea and than remember the fact . anyway , in some particoular situation is better know the fact than understand the idea and the concept , it appens rarely for me , for example when i am delaied with my study and i have a very few time before a test , so i need to study the topic a fast a is possible for me . for someone it is a common way to study but i think when a person store just the fact he will be not able to remember it in a large scale time , becouse the human 's memory is more able to store idea and concept than it is able to store fact for long time . a personal example is what i learned in the past when i wa a child , i well remember the ideas and the concept but i really ca n't remember the fact , it can be just a characteristic of my mind so it mean that my idea is wrong for another peson .
