i am agree with this statement . the reason is that in the twenty year there were not many car in use a now or because the people could not afford to buy it . if we look at the history , the twenty year were not many successful for many people . for example , in the united states although there wa a period of healthy in the early twenty and people could afford to buy car , at the last year of the century the depression let many people witouth job , house and withouth even necessary item . as well in europe , a always , there were so many status difference between people that only rich had the opportunity to get car . however , today there are a lot of differents model of car and you can buy a car cheaper that in those year . for example , now a little car that allow you to drive along the city cost about 6,000 euro that is a raisonable price . also , nowadays , you have the chance of buying a car and pay for it every month during several year , so even young people having good job can afford to drive their own car . besides , you have the option of buying a car that have been used before . we know that , propably the car will be broken before than a new one but , if you really need it and you do not have enough money to buy a new one , is an option that can be considered . however if you have money to spend and you really like car , there are a huge variety of them to buy . nowadays , car almost can drive by their self or at least , park . this type of car are from japan or china and maybe , in not a long time , many people will be able to get these wonderful car . as we can see , today , there are so many option in the market that make possible to everyone to get a car in an economic way , if it is that they want , or to buy a super car spending more money . however , i think that in the twenty year get a car wa a thing for only rich people and it is for sure that there were not so many option a we have today to choose one , based not only in the price but also in our preference .
