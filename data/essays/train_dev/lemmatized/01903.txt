i agree with this statement that `` young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their community . '' since the society we live in ha changed with time , people nowadays spend more time establishing their own affair and therefore they are easily tended to ignore the need of other people , and young people are no exception . in fact , young people spend most of their time concerning about their study , their future career , and they might be too busy to give time to help their community . take taiwan , my homecountry , a an example . it is surely a very small island in the world , but meanwhile , there are still many people on this island . the population density is astonishing . therefore , people here need to work or study hard in order to compete with others , and that might take them much time . young people in taiwan need to worry about the school exam they are taking everyday and the future career they are going to pursue . they spend so much time at home studying or going to the cram school that they only have little time for themselves , not to mention for their community . what 's more , people nowadays live more in apartment than in house . that is why they have fewer chance to communicate and interact with other people . people living in apartment or mansion may not see the necessity of giving time to helping their community or they may even think that there is no need for them to do so . indeed , it is nice to help the community , but not giving time to the community doe not have any difference . according to the reason and example i menioned above , i do agree with that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communites . and that will remain a a current trend in the present time and also in the future .
