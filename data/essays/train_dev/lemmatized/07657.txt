based on my previous experience , i am totally in agreement that it is more important for student to understand concept than learning fact . i have realized when a person understands the concept and the reason behind of this concept , it is easier to keep it in the memory for a long time . and to make this happen , the student must be willing to ask all the question needed to clarify the concept during the class . in this case , teacher are the main contributor to make student understand the idea . that mean , teacher should use the following process to better explain a concept during class : first , mention the background of the idea ; second , explain the idea what is about , including example and consequence ( if any ) ; and third , translate this concept in a realistic or insightful situation where student will be related with . having said this , if the teacher follows this flow , it will be very easy for student to understand the concept and store it in their brain for a long time without memorizing . on the other hand , when student are learning fact , there is a high probability to forget them very easily in the short term . the common mistake that student usually do when they have an exam in the next day , they start memorizing everything a it is the easiest way to get a good grade . whereas , teacher also do mistake . proffesors develop their test based on the theory exposed during class . this test are normally very hard data driven and thats why student always memorize fact a they already know that the test will just ask for those fact rather than putting in practice the concept learned . in conclusion , there is an opportunity area for both student and teacher to know how to learn and teach concept and idea , respectively , in order to improve the educational system .
