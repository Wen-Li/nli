from my point of view , in general i can only agree with this statement . nevertheless i think this statement request for further analysis in detail to come to a final opinion on that topic . it is a clear and from my pespective very sad trend that young people nowadays do not invest much of their spare time into helping their community . therefore it is important to evaluate the reason for this trend first . being 21 year old myself and therefore belonging to the group of `` young people '' i think i can base my evaluation on my own experience . one of the main problem community have to face is to make `` helping the community '' attractive for young people , especially taking the diversity of other possible activity young people are offered today into consideration . most young people rather invest their time into entertainment than in helping their community neglecting the fact that helping their community can become entertainment , too . i experienced a good example of this myself . since i starting thinking i know about a little festival in our suburb of the city of cologne . everybody knew about the existance of this little festival , but somehow nobody wa interested in the organization or marketing of the festival . no wonder such condition led to dramatically decreasing number of visitor throughout the year , which made the festival itself of no interest at all for the young population in our suburb because it always had the prestige of being `` boring '' . but one day our school principal started a school-wide project called `` organize a social party '' . initiated by a good friend , some friend of mine and me started to think about an event we could use to organize . then it came to our mind , that it would not be neccessary to invent a new social event at all . all we had to do wa to do a better organization and better marketing campaign for the existing suburb festival . soon we started brainstorming for idea that could make this community festival more interesting and attractive for young people . quickly a whole bunch of idea wa collected , so for example , a soccer competion called `` little world cup '' where little team of young player represented a country of the world fighting for the world championship . soon everyone in school wa talking about this competition and the community festival , too . the result wa an all-time record of festival visitor that year . this little personal example show up how `` helping their community '' can become entertainment and therefore become much more attractive for young people . all that it necessary is to show up the attractiveness of improving their community . if this can be aim can be achieved i think much more young people will start thinking about becoming active in their community . and this , even this may not be the way out of the dilemma at all , it is a important first step to deal with this trend among the young generation .
