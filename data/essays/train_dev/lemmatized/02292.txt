i agree with this opinion . there are some reason why i agree this opinion : advertisemenats can be everywhere and attaract the people . first of all , we can see the any kind of advertisement everywhere . for example , most people read news paper everyday , and there are lot of advertisement on the news paper . also , tv , on the street , bus and radio . we can see and heard everytime and everywhere . i t can give me fantastic image of the product and remember that product . i think that it is kind of addiction . the advertisement attact people with good picture or some comment . in addition , the product can not compete without advertisement . because , nowdays , the company think that advertisement is very important to attact customer . so most company use the advertisement to sale their product . for instance , there are the most expensive price advertisrment in the world at near the time sqaure in new york city . most company want to get that place for their advertisement even though price is so expensive . it mean that the advertisement ha power to sale product and make product seem much better . to sum up , advertisement are very important to sale product , attract the people , and make good seem better . advertisement usually use the product ' advantage and fantastic image . it can emphasize the product more than other product without advertisement .
