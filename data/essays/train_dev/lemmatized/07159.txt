i strongly agree to this statement that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their community . there are two reason why i believe that the statement is correct . young people nowadays do not have much free time and do not have time to think about their surroundings , and they also tend to be extremely lazy and are not willing to help for their community . these day it seems to be that young people have a very tight schedule . most teenager have school till the evening , and some may even have extra curricular activity or part time job to earn some pocket money . unlike before , young people are very independent and us time wisely which would benefit them in any possible way . since they have a tight schedule and do not have other spare time other than thinking about themselves , they do not give enough time to helping their community . in addition to their tight schedule , young people nowadays are extremely lazy . this may be because of the fast developing techonologies , such a use of computer , and easy access of transportation to place . teenagers are especially lazy when it come to solving problem . they believe that they have better thing to do than helping their community , and avoid volunteer work . however , problem may change once money come into an issue . young people nowadays love money , and they would most likely do anything which involves earning money . if the government make this community help a some sort of a part time job , young people may find some interest in helping . today , young people are much more independent than they were before , and are extremely self centered . i believe that this problem should deffinately change a soon a possible . in this way , young people would learn that helping others is an important aspect in their life .
