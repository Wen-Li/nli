i agree with the statement that `` in twenty year there will be fewer car in use than there are today '' . as we can see in the everyday life there is a decresing amount of space to get around with car . parking it is becaming a real challenge , and the frustration that build everyday is assuming very big proportion . the statistic showed that in twenty year the population of the world will be at about six billion . right now we are only four billion . what that mean is that the level of pollution of the air it will be unlivible for any human kind . the space available per person will decrease and the driver will have an increase in anger . unfortunately we are able to see that in indonesia right now . their problem is that everybody us a car . therefore , living in a confined country , with an increasing population doe n't allow a sanitary and better life . so , to avoid this problem , we should decrease the number of car by simply applying to few rule . first of all , we should make a law that forbids people to drive by themselfes . what i mean is that car should be considered for a minimum of four people . if that doe n't happen the owner of the car should n't be allowed to drive , penalty a tiket or worse . then the community should make available more community ride like bus or any other vehicle that hold more people than a car . doing so , we should be able to decrease the number of car , the pollution of the air , the gas consumption , that nowdays is reaching incredible price and we should be able to decrease the frustration and anger of everybody . in the meanwhile , another good thing that could be done is allow the circulation only to the vehicle that have a gpl or a methane implant . that doe n't decrease the number of car in circulation , but at least decrease the air pollution .
