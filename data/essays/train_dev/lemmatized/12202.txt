do young people enjoy life more than older people do ? this for sure is one of those question that bring about so many discussion . when one is young , it is easier to speak , to reach strong judgment . when you are older , however , you get to have a different perspective on life -- not that i am one of the old yet , but turning 30 recently ha made me see thing in a different light . and no , i do not agree with the idea that young people enjoy life more than older people do . of course , being young give one an obvious advantage -- that of being physically fit and active . when one is young , they feel like they can do anything ; they have their whole life to look forward to . they can try out new thing , go see new place , meet new people , and so on . however , a pleasing a this may seem , such an abundance of choice also brings displeasure , unhappiness , and at time , even regret . especially when combined with inexperience , one is likely to encounter -- and will , by all mean -- many stone . you tend to make more mistake and make decision you later would like to forget . being old , on the other hand , is a whole different story . yes , it mean that you will not be able to jump and run around a much a you would like , you will have to see the doctor a little more often than you used to , and you may have to cut out on certain flavor you are so used to have . however , this doe not mean that one can not really enjoy oneself because they are old . age mean experience , and this experience is what make it easier to derive pleasure out of life . the more a person ha seen of the world -- the pain and the pleasure , the easier it becomes for them to make the most of what they have . in conclusion , being old doe not necessarily mean getting le out of life . on the contrary , it provides you with the opportunity to have more pleasure out of it , and what is more , be able to be grateful for the thing you have .
