frankly , a long a we will not develop little spaceship to fly around - which i do n't see happening within the next twenty year - i do n't think there will be fewer car on this earth ever again . it is a proven fact that the amount of car we use , and most of all the emission those car cause impose a big threat to our environment . and although there is a lot of misperception today i am sure that there will be a much higher concern about environmental issue in twenty year . but this is , what will mainly happen in industrial state . we should not forget about the devoloping country that start to take off now . i personally hope that they will manage to thrive further on , and increase their economical potential a well a living standard . but this usually implies a technological advance . people in india , china and eventually africa will need to get to work , will want to travel and will demand car . lots of them . even if they do not reach western standard , where it is normal to keep a couple of car per household , their mere number of inhabitant will boost car demand . i do think though , that in twenty year there will be a difference in how car work . i am sure that environmental concern will be high , that people will have seen the importance to get independend from fossile fuel , and that car will be developed that need le energy and additionally run on electricity , solar battery , hydrogen , water , biological waste - or some new idea . they will be cleaner , more efficient and probably even run silently . there might also be an attempt to foster alternative mean of transportation , like public mean , bike or train . but this developement i rather see in industrial state . to put thing in a nutshell , i think that in industrial state there will be le a well a cleaner car . while developing state catch up there will be a much higher demand for car , and also the necessary wealth to purchase them . this , i think , leaf u with an equal or rather higher amount of car in twenty year , than we have today . i do hope though , that there will be better and cleaner car on the market than the one we use today . and i also hope that people in today developing country will be able to move along and start with the new technology , and are not turning into a huge graveyard for our old , polluting car .
