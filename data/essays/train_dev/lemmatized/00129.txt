having knowledge in many subject wouldnt help a student in many way because of this a student can not be perfect in a subject after he completes his academic . this happens mainly because throughout his academic he ha to write many exam on these subject so his preparation would also be for the exam only rather than gaining knowledge in that particular subject . for example , take the engineering study the people who take up this course have to be perfect in their field that is either computer , civil , mechanical etc. but they finish their course without any knowledge and after that when they go for job interview they began to feel the importance of a particular subject and start gaining knowledge of that subject . so after reading the example , effectively one question come to your mind what 's the use of doing engineering , studying a lot of subject and be perfect in none . it would be better to say , you can select subject which are related to one another and start gaining knowledge from them , so that you can become a specialist in that particular subject . by becoming a specialist in a particular area you could do wonder to that particular field in a small period of time . so i disagree the statement mainly because of the following reason , by reading many subject a person might get a broad knowledge but he can not implement that knowledge perfectly because of imperfection in those particular subject . but once a person chooses a field in which he is interested and specializes in it he would astutely know of what to do and the shouldnt 's in that particular field of specialization . from this it can be said that , it would be better to do specialization in a particular field rather than many . and to support this there is famous quote , `` jack of all trade but , master of none '' .
