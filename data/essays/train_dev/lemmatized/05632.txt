the massive development of advertisement strategy represents one of the most relevant characteristic of the `` consumption society '' we live in . the goal of the marketing is not necessarily to make the product seem much better than it really is , but rather to attract the consumer 's attention on the product . first , in many case , emphasis is put on one special feature of a certain product , rather than on overall quality . we will illustrate such claim with an example . advertisements of soap to clean the kitchen board have been some of the most common commercial on tv at least for the last twenty year . producers know that , in spite of minor difference , all the competing product are very similar . market target are likely to be aware of this , too . therefore , these commercial usually do not try to convey the message that product a is better than b , c , d , but rather they aim to stress a particular feature . for example , one advertisment might put the emphasis on the nice smell produced by the soap , another on how fast it is to use . in this way , each producer aim to differentiate her product from the other along a particular dimension and to become attractive for a particular target of consumer , thus creating a special market niche . second , advertisement usually rely on a specific eye-catching image that stay impressed in the consumer 's mind . referrign again to the example illustrated in the previous paragraph , company often hire a movie or tv star who act a housekeeper in the commercial . such tactic ha nothing to do with emphasizing how good the product is . however , it creates a reference point for the housekeeper who is about to go to do the grocery . it is a somewhat subliminal message that conveys the message : `` if i use this product , i coudl be like her one day ! '' . another good example refers to the commercial for car . most of them show the car crossing desert or magnificient coast road in exotic place . there is probably no consumer who really care about whether or not the car can really cross a desert . yet , such image stay impressed , and the consumer will inadvertently associate that model of car with an idea of freedom , long travel , adventure . in addition , there are some commercial that are just deliberately stupid . they rely on some joke or message that provokes the same reaction in everybody : `` who the hell created such a stupid commercial ! ? '' . well , if potential consumer wonder about this , the goal ha been achieved . the product ha a place in the consumer 's mind . and maybe that brand name will come out when he or she go to the commercial center the day after . in conclusion we want to stress how it is of course important that consumer perceive the product a a good one , not a a `` lemon '' . however , this is probably a secondary point in the mind of a creator of advertisement : the emphasis is not on the exaggeration of the quality of the product , but rather on the way it is possible to attract consumer ' attention on the promoted product , through the usage of particular creative messagges .
