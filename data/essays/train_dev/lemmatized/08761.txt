the topic state that `` it is better to have knowledge of a number of academic subject than having specialization in one specific subject '' and i tend to disagree . the reason for taking this stand is this - although education system through out the globe support both the mode of study yet a specialist is any way prefered over a person who is a kind of `` jack of all trade '' . before going into depth let me remind you about a normal prcedure of education these day . when a child go to school then in order to make him acquainted with all thing in the surrounding , he is tought a variety of subject . later on , in his teen , he is taught the basic of all the major stream , so that he can choose his major . finally , this all go in the direction of choosing one subject , and all the subject are touched so that he can find out the flow of his interest . now let talk about `` specialization '' . the specialzation is required for depth knowledge of a subject . to work over a subject you always need that and all the subject ( available for major ) are having enough depth to spend your life working on it . i remember one very well said line `` practice make a man perfect '' . in the same way a specialist is always having his concentration at a subject and is working out with that subject all the time in order to get best result for the well-fare of the society . here , i can also take example of myself . what would i do in case i get a heart problem ? i would definetly go to a heart specialist . the similar situation can be applied in all the problem you encounter in your life . its true a basic knowledge of each and every subject is required to sustain your life without getting stucked at every other hurdle that come but broad knowledge of many academic subject will make life a mess . you would not be able to comentrate on one thing . hence , i would always prefer going for a specialization instead of mugging my head in a number of subject at a time .
