every human being in thecommunity have some responsible towards to the community . they can not only enjoys the thing a community provides them . but also they can give enough time to spend on help to their community . morenumber of engineering student produced during year by year . they can began to create new invention . the young per son invent the the computer . but the other young who learn thorough this subject introduce a internet . we can get more information through this internet . we can not specially mention those thing . more more and advancrements these thing we can get every thing a eazarly a possible , but the cost constriant is also there . dotors find out new method of surgery thing . if a person seriously injured in accident , or fire work , or some other disease , he can completly recovered in few day , not like unlike inold endayas . young people are learned the new thing , thechanges that are occur in the surrounded world . they want help peeople . not only in educational field , they enter into the agricultural field also . they ininvent new genetic tree , to produce more fruit to u . thus we can meet the need of the people . tthey go to the rural area when they get free time . they spend time with rural people to educating them . young one enter into the spacce reseach also . through which we can get the information related our country not only iours but other country problemms are also solved . example tsunami is occur in chennai in india in past year , it create lot of destuction incity . but again tsunami come we can find out the reason , area these tsunmai get exposed to . throughspaceresearch . earthquakes , weather report can be given by space research people . and there are more developements are made inthis . field . we step inthe moon . to get more usefull information to u . that s why i disagree with the sttement a young people donot give enough time to helping their community .
