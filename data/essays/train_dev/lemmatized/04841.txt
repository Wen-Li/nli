i am so agree with the statement . this is also what i like to do all the time , being a creative people . i think this is very important to be a successful people . i think if people want to be sucessful , you have to take risk , try something new that people do n't know very well . because if you keep doing the thing people already know a lot about it , you ca n't be better than the people who are very professional on it . there are a lot of famous people in the world . why could they be so successful ? because they keep trying new thing . for example , bill gazs , the rishest man in the world . but do you know he dropped out of the college in the second year . do you think if he did n't take the risk of dropping out of the college to try something new or you can call the computer revolution , he would be so successful like this . i guess it is no . however , if you keep doing the microsoft ware now , you would not be successful on it , i am pretty sure it will not . because no body can produce the microsoft product better than he do . that is why you have to produce something new , something quite different and more convenient . a lot of people are being normal , because they do n't rather to take risk , even if he is very good at it and have very good oppurtunities . of course we ca n't ignor those people who want to be normal . this is why successful people are usually few in the society . i bevelive successful people 's life should be very exciting , and they are the kind of people who like exciting . because they take risk , and nobody would know what is going to come out . and sucess would be one of the result . is n't it exciting ?
