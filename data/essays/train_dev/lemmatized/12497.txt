some poeple think young people enjoy more than old people in life , so do i. old people know the value of life . they have a lot of experience . they know that when they enjoy with life , they lose somethings . but , young people can not know they will be loser , when they begin to enjoy with life . to me , all people enjoy life when they are young . because , young people neither know , nor consider value of life . for instance , in turkey all young people go to the party , at all . they spend their time on fun . if you go to a club in turkey , you can see young people , but you can not see older people . in addition to this example , older people prefer to rest , rather than to go to enjoy . for instance , in here , old people become retired when they spend a lot of year to work . after that , they are usually found , or seen at their house . because they find their house more comfortable than out of home . but young people use different method , when they are tired . for instance , in my university , there are party at the end of all semester . all student at the university are found at these party . on the other example , young people do n't want to be their house , when they are tired or angry to anything . i usually drive my car , when i am not happy . i like to do speed with my car . if i become my house during bad time , i become worse . finally , young people spend more time to enjoy than older people . because , when people are young they do n't know that they will be loser when they spend time on fun , rather than on studying , or on working . that is to say , people learn the value of life from youngster to oldster . when young people become old people , they start to spend le time on fun than before .
