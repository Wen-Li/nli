the topic at hand is whether in twenty year there will be fewer car in use than there are today . this topic is important from many point of view . i disagree with the statement . i think the number of car will not decrease in twenty year down the line . world is growing at a rapid pace . time is the utmost important factor . even though there is an increase in the pollution from the increase in number of car , people will not avoid car . they are very much busy with their daily schedule . they have thing to be completed within the deadline . they can not imagine themselves with out atleast an automobile . they have to run with time . people find other way to reduce the pollution , but they can not sacrifice their car . they would say that increase in the number of plant would decrease the pollution . even they would invent new method to reduce the pollution but there would n't be any comprimise in the car usage . car number would decrease if car owner come forward to disown their car a the car are creating the environmental pollution , which is impractical to considerable itself . maintaing a car is also important from esteem point of view . there is a craze for the car in the market . some people want to buy car a soon a a company release the product . even there is a scarcity in the gas or petrol , new car will be invented which do not require petrol or gas , instead us the natural resource like the solar energy or biogas . besides `` as necessity is the mother of invention '' people would certainly do research to create new car which solves the problem created from the existing car the technology is also supporting the increase in the number of car . with the ever growing technology , new car with different power , style and with high efficiency are being invented daily . there is a competition between the company for producing the best car . this competition and thrist to win the market will lead to increase in the number of car in future . in conclusion , i think the number of car will increase with time , even though there are some negative effect from the increase in number of car . this effect are nullified from the advantage and necessity of the car
