are young people not give enough time to help ing their community ? and wa it other in former time ? to answer this question you have to think about a few different point of view . the first point is that they are a lot of young people , which have some kind of `` i do n't care '' opinone . they do not have target to life for or task to do . as i drive to berlin per train to do this test a saw a few of them , already beer drinking in the moring . furthermore , there are a lot of young people which do n't have this kind of `` homefeeling '' in their community . they would take any change to leave their town . you should not forget that , perhaps , they have to leave their community to find a job or have a better future . however , on the other side there are young people every age which spend a lot time by helping their community . they work in social organisation like the `` red cross '' ( so , do i . ) or the `` kinderhilfswerk '' . althought , they spend a lot of time in social project like organisation of a camp for kid without parent or collection money for a homeless shelter . the question also implies that it wa better in former time . this is perhaps true but i 'm to young to join this expericens . i think a time change aswell the situation al change . all in all i disagree with `` young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their community . '' they are helpful young people , but you have to look for these .
