i believe that it is better to have a broad knowledge of multiple academic subject than to be a specialist in only one . the primary reason for this belief are the balance a student gain from having broad knowledge and the interrelationship that exist between different subject . lets start by looking at the importance of balanced knowledge . being good in multiple subject such a finance and strategic management will allow a management consultant to give advice taking multiple scenario into consideration . on the other hand , a specialist in finance would be able to give a solution solely in term of bottomlines resulting in a le practical solution for the customer . the second advantage is that a company need to hire one student competent in two field , rather than spend more resource hiring two expert . in addition , having two expert who do n't understand each other could result in an inferior solution because of the lack of agreement . the final reason is the interrelationship between subject . for example , a physic scientist ha to use complex mathematical formula for proving some of his conclusion . if he wa specialized in physic alone , he may not be able to prove his theory unlike a scientist who is good at physic and math . in conclusion , while a specialist may have value in certain situation , the better value proposition that a balanced student brings to the table and the multiple option he ha in his career outweigh the advantage of specializing in one subject .
