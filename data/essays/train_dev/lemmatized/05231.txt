have you ever been mislead by a tv or a web page advertisement , and bought something you were not completley statisfied ? i have , that is why i belive that advertisement make product seem much better than they really are . in my opinion , i think this occurs for simple reason : people want to sell , and internet and tv make it easy . selling more mean winning more money . acutally , the purpose of advertising is to sell more , they do this by making the pruduct attractive . the thing is that there is a diference between advertising the product and tricking people into buying something that is not true . the sad part is that there is lot of people that are willing to risk their reputation in order to win more money . latley , buying through internet ha become more and more popular . it is cheaper , easy , and you can do it right at home . the problem with on-line and tv purchase is that you are unable to see the object that you want to buy fisically . there are many well known web-pages in which you know you will have no problem . for example , i bought the toefl test online , and recive exactly what i bought . the problem come when you are dealing something le formal . for example , if you are planning a vacation and are planning to stay in a home and breakfast , you must check twice the place . the owner always take the best picture of their house and even use photoshop . some time when the change is so drastic that you feel that it is not the place you saw on your computer screen , so you feel decive . all in all , i belive that most advertisments do make product seem better than they really are . i belive it is in their nature , since it purpose it to sell more . . i do not belive that most advertisments want to decive people , but i strongly recommend not to buy online unless it is a recognized webpage .
