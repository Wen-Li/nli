successful people try new thing and take risk rather than only doing what they already know to do well . i agree with it , and i think this is perhaps the summary of how to be a success person . first , to be sucess , one should be at least in the five percent top in the domain he work . it mean that if there were one thousand people which do the same work in this world , you should be better than other nine hundred and fifty person . more competitor in the domaine , more difficult to be success . want to be success , create second , always repeating the same work , satifying with the recent life , not being willing to take the challenger , all these are not the characteristic of the successful people . if you want to be success , you have to surmount the achivement you have got , you must get higher and higher . when you chose a new thing which nobody else had tried , this is the challenger and this will cause the risk .
