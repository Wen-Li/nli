i agree that most advertisement make product seem much better than they really are . many product have advertisement their paccage or poster in the street or shop . i have not see same thing about product and advertisement . first of all , we often see advertisement of new product at street or shop . the advertisement make u want to buy . i have a experience . this is abut shampoo . a certain country broadcasted cm about the new procucts of shampoo . this made me wanted to buy , because the woman 's hair after used the shampoo is different it before used . actually , i used that , but my hair did n't change . also , we can say about food . foods paccage look delicious , so we want to buy it . however , we have situation that actually it is not delicious . the campanies that want to sell more product try to use good picture and phrase . in couclusion , we have a right that can choose food or something to use . we should not credit the advertisement easily . sometimes we need to think more seriously about advertisement . in addition , we do n't have to forget that the advertisement is trap made by company to increase customer who buy the product . it is dangerous u to buy without thinking deeply about truth of food . we should decide to buy more seriously .
