travelling is one of the most interesting beneficial , eye-opening , horizon-widenning hobby a person couldn have . every time you travel and see a new place you get the chance to meet new people , be introduced to a new culture , and get acqaunted with new habit and tradtions , not to mention the food . yet travelling if not planned properly can end up to be a nightmare . lets say you have decided to travel to a far-away country where u know no one , and ca n't speak their language , u have never been there , and have no clue on what to expect . in this case it better to arrange your trip through a travel agent where she/he hook you up with their partner in the country you are going to , to take care of you and arrange some guided group tour for you to go around and see the country . this can be the right choice in many situation . if you are going to a relatively unsafe country , where it not advised to wonder around alone . if you are worried that you wont be able to communicate with the people in that country because of the language . if you are travelling alone with no friend or family , and you want to socialize on your trip , being in group guided tour might be a good chance for you to meet people and have fun while site-seeing . at the same time u gaurantee to get enough information about the site you visit on your trip , since the tour guide will be briefing you about each and every place you pas by . as much a this sound safe , entertaining , and informative . i prefer to travel on my own . something i got used to and enjoy doing . i tend to find travelling on your own more interesting , and force you in a way or another to mingle with the local , to get more immersed into that culture , and get a better taste of that place you are visiting . besides , you would be able to follow your own schedule and go and see place you choose to see and not the tour guide planned for you to see . it would give you the chance to do some research and reading about that place , before and during your trip . you will be you own master , your own guide . our day to day life is already scheduled and going according to a certain plan , when i go on a holiday or travel , i do that to run away and relax . on my trip , i do n't need to sleep and wake up , eat or shop , according to someone 's esle plan , not my own desire . otherwise i will end up not enjoying my trip while the tour guide end up making lot of commission from each and every single shop or resteraunt she/he take the group to , and most of the time they are bad choice .
