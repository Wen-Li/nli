nowadays advertise occupies a central position in our life . some person belive strongly in it , instead any other are sure that it can produce negative effectives in the quality of our life . in my opinion advertisments make product seem much better than they are in the reality , and so in the following paragraph i try to explain my point of view . when we watch televison or when we walk to the street , we can easy see adverstiments ; they talk about food , for instance , or clothes , car , bank service etc . . in all these situation the object , or the product , appear beautiful , confortable and in same case chip , nethereless when we decide to buy one of them we have a surprise . for example , the last year i saw a beautiful photography machine in a television advertise , it seemed very small , easy to use and with a lot of different function . in this way , i convinced my boyfriend to buy this model becuase i thought it wa an incredible occasion , infact the price is not so high in relation wiht the quality . the day after he decided to buy this photography machine , and unfortunately my boyfriend and i , using it , understand that it use not so good . the same situation happens when we buy a food only for the fact that it is presented in a particular way in the advertise ; for example , the advertise us a specif enviromental , color or situation to expain the caracteristics of the food , and a a consequence we immidiately decide to buy it . to sum up the adertisemntent make product seem more different and much better or more cheap than they are in the reality , and so we note the differerence unfotunately only when we decide to buy it , i think it is not right !
