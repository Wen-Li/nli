it is difficulf to make a certain prediction about this topic , because in one hand taking care of the enviroment is becoming more and more important nowadays and on the other hand technology is definately part of our life . anyway , i believe that in twenty year they wo n't be fewer car than there are today because modern life move fast , communication are very important and there are new , ecologic energy that can avoid car pollution . modern life move fast , specially in big city . people in big city work very hard and work many hour . for that reason these worker really appreciate their free time and want to be able to move fast to enjoy it . nowadays public main of transport are not a usefull and efficient a having an own car . having a car is not that expensive , so many peaople can afford having their own car . economy is growing a 3 per cent every year so hopefully in twenty year people will be able to by nicer car , instead of having to take the subway or the bus . the globalization movement ha made the communication very important . it is true that others main of tansport may be developed , but having an own car allows citizen to go wherever they want whenerver they want . globalization is called to become more and more powerfull , that 's why i believe that people will like having their own car in twenty year . one of the main problem about car is that they damage the enviroment . anyway , country are spending a lot of money in investigating in renewable energy that do not damage the enviroment . that will allow the car industry to use these new source of energy to car construction . hopefully , in twenty year car will be respectfull with the enviroment , so people wo n't mind driving their own car . as a conclusion , in my opinion in tewnty year there will be a many car a nowadays because of the necessity and characteristic of modern life .
