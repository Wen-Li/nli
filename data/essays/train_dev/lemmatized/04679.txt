from my point of view , human life is so complex that the only way to learn valuable aspect is by trying event that we had never tried before . for instance , an engineer may be a genius in developing complicated mobile phone service , but these service may not appeal to most of the people . so what he or she should do is concentrate on completely different subject such a people 's need and habit . probably , he or she ha never studied anything related to this , but the only way to obtain success is by trying . let 's see another example . if we worked for microsoft and we would simply expect to earn money for the current version of windows , other company may create a powerfull operating system that would gradually substitute windows . that 's why we would have to invest an enormous amount of money on a new operating system . if we do n't do it well the company will eventually disappear but if we do n't do anything it 's much more likely to disappear . nowadays there is much more competitiveness than what it used to be . obviously , these measure are always taken after many hour of debate and requiere the support of many worker . but the point is that if we do not convince ourselves that we have to innovate , then other people will innovate for u and they will be successful but not u .
