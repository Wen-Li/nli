i agree with that statement , though i have to admit there are exception . nowadays , it seems to be all about themselves but nothing else for young people . they do not mind about the one in need because they are not even aware of such a thing called `` in need '' exists . their family spoil them to no end which led the yoiuth to be unaware of whats going on in their community , let alone the world . the thing with the young people these day is that they are being brain washed by some industry and they are being victim of these industry . like the food industry . they created a new form of ideal for woman body and nearly all the young girl are concerned about their weight more than anything else , this nonsence is what is taking their mind of other thing . like helping their community !!! and this generation [ which i am a part of ] is very self centered because what is expected from them is perfection . which , we all know is impossible to reach . so to reach that impossible goal of themselves , they give their full attention to theirselves . i know the thing i wrote down is a little bit off the topic , but thinking twice , they are somehow related . youth is striving for an unrealistic goal , making them imperfect by the way of characteristic , just the oppose of what they are striving for . all in all i do agree that my generation is not giving enough time and care to help the others /
