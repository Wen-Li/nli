whenever there is a lecture beign given , the student often get involved with the subject that they start implementing the idea and start developing few analyzstions regarding the teaching , but hardly try to understand the fact behind them , basically the originality of the subject . even though the fact are retold most of them try to repose them and concentrate on the concept . the fact is that both the concept and theory of the fact are important . it is thinking and implementing some idea about what is beign understood and developing the idea to make it real , this theory drive behind the knowledge of understanding and knowing fact . many of them are interested in knowing the fact behind everything ( afterall , who doe n't want to know the reason behind each matter or say topic ) . this also may depend on the person desire to use the fact in understanding the topic . the difference in a study may be figured out due to the lack of fact known regarding that particular field . though the reason may be figured out , the fact is that learning through the new ideeas and the concept are very much preferred by most of the future student , may be this id the like of the newer generation . for example , when a theory of pendulum is taught in a class the student do try to learn the principle of it but are least interested ( atleast galileo ) in how it happened to be seen light , and again it is a different story . the student start developing their idea on the concept taught to them and start working to create or say invent something that is based on the principle of pendulum . the same go with the very popular newton-apple tree story . many theory have seen light after the principle of gravity is given byt he great newton . thereb are many instance that go in the same path , likebohrs atomic theory , rutherfords . not only in the field of learning but also in the field of research these thing do apply . although the research feild require sthe student to remember the name of thescientists they do it for the namesake , but are rather interested in their research . finally , not only me but most of them would agree that the student are intended to get to nstudy the concept , undersatnd them and thus leading to the better result . although there may be a piont raised that the fact are a must for experiecing the situation and circumctances , it may be obvious that it go thgrough the old saying `` failure ( s ) are the step to success '' , wherein the student do try out getting new thing and fail but rejuvinate with a roaring success . i think for such thing the need of fact to be known is not a of great help but finding out something new doe make the joy double , encouraging , therefore , the future studentd
