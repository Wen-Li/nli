coca cola 's new product , cocacola zero , announced some month ago with huge advertisement , provoqued a great echo all over the world . a sweet nutrition without sugar , that wa the strategy to sell a popular product in even greater amount . but in my opinion , the statement that most advertisement make product seem much better than they really are is true in many case . advertisements argue that the quality of the product they want to sell is better than that of all other producer , but it is available at the same or even a lower price . the consequence i draw out of this strategy are firstly , the production cost were reduced or , secondly , the quality of the product is not a good a the advertisement want to tell u . regarding sugar free product , for example , it is clear that an artificial substance ha to replace the sugar by keeping the taste . then the product may be sugar free , but added with many artificial ingredient which are not mentioned or written on a place hard to be seen by the customer . as a second example , i will mention shortly the consequence of advertisement denying the real quality of the product by regarding cosmetic product . especially young people who have problem with their skin are attracted by advertisement which promise to help them with a product wich cost le than others but ha better impact on the skin . in the meantime , the ingredient of this product do not help or have even negative effect the customer do not get to know by reading the instruction . so young people trie one product after another just following the false promise of some advertisement . in the end , advertisement always play with their direct or indirect influence on the customer . and unless the customer doe not reflect this influence critically , the producer will not change their habitude in making the product seem much better than they are .
