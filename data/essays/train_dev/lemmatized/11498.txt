i do not aggre with the statement . it is obvious that youngster and older people have different way to spend their time , but it ha to do more with generation matter than with their capacity of doing enjoyable thing . i know it is a common belief that during the youth one ha a wider range of activity to enjoy , but a more carefully view of the fact might change this position . there are two main factor that could support my point . in first place , an important factor is the experience . the experience give a person the capacity of making better decision but also give one a better perspective of life . both thing help older people to enjoy some event or thing which young people do not . secondly , older people usually can be benefited from resource they have save during their youth . thus , the avaliability of greater resource among older people can also contradict the idea that young people enjoy life more than those older one . commonly , young people have to spend a lot of time generating those resource . however , it ha to be said that young people have some other advantage over older people regarding the capacity of enjoy some activity . the main advantage is naturally their energy and - usually - health . young people have more energy and are usually healthier . for that reason they can enjoy better thing involving physical activity . the main example of this is sexuality , but there are a lot of other example like sport . in balance . i think both youngters and older people have many thing to enjoy . and there is no reason to think one of those group is more able to enjoy life .
