it is a good idea that when you travel with a group to be led by a tour guide . there are many reason which make this issue an important . on the other hand , there are some people who think that when they travel with a group , they do n't need to be led by a tour guide . the best way to travel is in a groupe led by a tour guide because it is important to have a leder . when people travel in group , they mostly can not make the desicion about what to do in an exact time ; in contrast , when they are led by one person , they listen to every thing he say . people always have controversy in many thing , if they are not let by one person , they may have disagreement about something which is not important in their trip . some people think that it is not necessory to be led by one person because they do n't accept comment from people in general . this think that a leader will be strict , and he will just give order for the other people . some time if people have a trip without a leader , their trip would have a disapointment . actually , the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide . i would suggest every person who want to go on trip with a group to have a leader .
