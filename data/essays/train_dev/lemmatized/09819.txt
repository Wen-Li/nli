some people in the world , may be in poor country dislike to understand idea and concept , but they prefer to learn fact . i do n't agree with this statement , because the real sense of the life is in the fact . for example : it is more important for a fisher understand how find a fish , or it is more important for he swim in the river or sea and became to know how is phylosophy of fish , i think the fisher should be firts a good swimer , and he only will obtain good result in his work with practice , with fact . but it is also important understand idea of how working the thing , because if we do not study first the world can not know the fact . for example , the same fisher will obtain best result in his work , if he first will study how is the behavior of the fish , in which kind of water , the fish grown faster . other example , the farmer cultivated a lot of year ago , without our tecnology and knowlodge . how did they cultivate it ? there is a only answer , with fact , with practice . so , if the farmer cultivated with more idea , with more knowledge , theirs result will be best . how did child learn to speak ? he do not learn with to understand idea and concept , he learn with fact . in the progress country , there are some people thinking that it is more important for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact . in conclussion , it is more importand for student learn fact , practice for learn , because this can use for them in their country .
