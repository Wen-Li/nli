the statement given make a strong assertion , that we will see fewer car on the road twenty year from now . this is a statement i disagree with and i will illustrate my rationale now . let u look at the possible ground for this statement . petroleum , the current source of fuel for car , is already facing the prospect of stock depletion . faced with ever-increasing demand ( ironically because of the increasing number of car , among other vehicle ) oil price have already touched 70 dollar a gallon ( a very considerable amount ) . with fuel price this high , how much longer can people afford to buy and use car ? also a very pertinent issue is the alarming-level of pollutant that car spew out . marked environmental change like increasing health risk in shangai city ( a study done very recently , in early 2006 ) , have finally brought more and more environmental lobby and even corporation to sit up and ake notice . with car being one of the major source for such pollution ; how long can they continue ? the final potential nail in the venerable car 's tombstone might be very real , very visible , very pragmatic issue of space ! with city ever increasing , car are literally clogging the artery of organised urban existance : the road . i have observed this in all the city i have lived in so far : from hyderabad to mumbai to guwahati in india ; from frankfurt to mainz to paris and amsterdam in europe . this problem is just a , if not more pronounced in us metropolis like new york or even detroit . with this being the case , how much longer can people even possibly drive car ? that is the present situation ; but it not a dire one . man , being the persistent , ever innovating construct that he is , is very really circumventing these very issue . petroleum is increasing in cost ; yes . but no longer is petroleum the only viable source of fuel for car . already , new source of fuel ; from hydrogen cell to solar energy : from nuclear energy to most importantly , electrical energy are being harbored a source of fuel for car . in my institute of study , a lot of work is being done on this very issue and we especially look at the protius in the us or the smart car in japan , where petroleum is no longer used . with such potentially limitless new fuel ; car are still going to live on . another fantastic characteristic of these new fuel is their harmony with nature ; the lack of any real threat to our environment . this only reinforces their role a pragmatic lifeblood for the automobile . the road today are being choked up ; yes . but what are we doing ? , we 're building more . its amazing to note that the top 10 civil engineering marvel of the modern age are either road network , or bridge ( like the one at shanghai airport ) . we are countering this threat of traffic in new and wonderful way . a lot can happen in twenty year , but certainly not a much a this statement asserts . frankly , when i wa a kid , i thought we would actually be living like the jetsons now : but thats obviously not the case . before a day dawn when we buckle under the weight of our own contrivance ; before a day dawn when urban network utterly degenerate into bedlam because of critical mass ; man will most certainly have contingency upon contingency . maybe a time will come when car are no longer pragmatic at all . but not within twenty year . as the point i have made above assert ; i truly believe that car will still remain on the road twenty year from now .
