people , especially common people , often discus whether it is necessary to try new thing and take risk rather than only doning what they already know how to do well . but i strongly believe that succssful people try to new thing and undergo risk . if it were not for taking harships and trying new thing , they have no opportunit to win other competitiors . successful people generally more bold and painstaking than those who do not . as everyone know , this is not the only way of succeeding in doing , but this is one of the most effecitive way of succeding . in addition , it can positively contribute to find new one that give people a lot of confidence . let 's say that a scientist try to reasearch new thing , if he is just the man who just mix other theory that already every people know . he would never be successful in his filed . if he tried to find new thing and take harship , he would succeed . successful people also think different way in every time . i understand that too much attention paid to new thing is negative becasuse it may cause much more cost to do and sweep memebers along , sometimes to the detriment of their original work . but the advantage of tinking creatively eclipse the disadvantage . for example , people who always think different for winning in the market econnomy can find the fraction between many product . so he can beat other competitiors . as everyone know people can not work to it best ability when there is not new one that enable company to be vigorous a well a company to win in economy . taking all of thing into account , there is no doubt in my mind that if you want to successful people or to win in some field , you should be not doing what you know how to do well but doing more courageable , painstaking and creative .
