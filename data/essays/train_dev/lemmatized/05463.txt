i firmly agree with the opinion that it is more important for student to learn how to understand idea and concept than just learn fact and data . it may be true that fact are basic for a successful academic career , however for all the rest of the human being it is just personal enrichment . it may also be true that learning raw data is a very rewarding experience , but again i would suggest to focus this desire on more stimulating and challenging activity . first , fact are much easier to forget than idea . i am sure that no friend of mine from school will remember all the name of the river in our country , but they maybe can remember why the pc ha been so important in the development of our culture . therefore , it is much more useful to learn something that you will not forget than just have a hard time with nonsense tough data , which you have to read over and over because it doe n't have any logic behind ! second , in our work we hardly use specific fact . but we certainly use idea , concept , argument and logical discussion . at least i do in my consulting job . i have learned to structure my thought and put into practice improvement lever simply by understanding and applying idea , not by remembering fact . third , fact can be looked again and again in book whenever we want . nowadays , there is no problem in finding information . we can just connect to the internet , make a search and find it right there . when i do n't remember a formula , i just do that . google is my good friend when i have memory loss . maybe other people just have a neighbour that know it all or a teacher who is an expert in that field . i could go on saying that what the world lack are good idea , revolutionary thought that can improve the society we live in . this last idea lead me to my final argument : fact are part of the past while idea are the raw material of the future . the formula of a circle ha been invented many year ago , but how we will beat cancer is a pending subject and only with good idea we will suceed in this matter . we should be engaged in providing an outstanding ideas-focused education to the future einsteins . for instance , during my education in high school in the usa i experienced a quite different approach compared to the european one . we should foster this type of education . summing up , my opinion is that student should learn what will be useful for them and for the society a a whole . consequently , managing concept and with their interaction reaching conclusion is much more productive than memorizing load of book .
