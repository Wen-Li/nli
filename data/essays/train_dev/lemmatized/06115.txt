the question if young people enjoy their life more than older people is hard to answer generally . i would not say that this is always true , but for most of the case i agree with the statement . i think that young people are more free in their thinking in the way that they are often not think about the consequence first . they put many thing not in consideration . they just do it . my younger brother for example , he is 19 , is often going to travel without beeing worried about what come next . i think he is a quite happy person who really enjoys his life . older people , in contrast , see the same thing often with different eye . they have much more life experiance and another view on many thing and i think this is often a more negative view . older people think about consequensives first and are often more worried about what could happen in a negative way instead of how could this be enjoyable for me . my mother for example wa grown up in the communist system and wa treatend badly . nowadays she is a very pessimistic person and ha mostly bad oppinions about thing which i see actually positive . sometimes i think she is not enjoying her life that much . my brother and me are grown up in another environment than my parent . we were grown up in a surrounding of freedom and had le worry in our young life then my parent had during their youth . this is one of the reason that i agree to the statement that older people enjoy life le than younger do , in most of the case . surely i think that in other case older people are enjoying their live a same a younger do or even more .
