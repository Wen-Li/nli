by discussing the statement , we first have to define what > > helping their community < < mean . what are the community ? the community may be some of sport , music or religious . and what is helping ? helping may mean helping in the familiy ( which is part of the community ) or by helping direct the community . there are several method of helping in community . these method changed along the year : in former day people were perhaps more friedly and more helpful to each other . they were another generation and had other living condition . i also think that the people have had another familiar surrounding in which they lived and worked . as young people they had to help the family e.g by going in the field and doing farming . they also used to help other family , because they benefit from each other . the family had not so much money and so much thing like we have today . so helping wa very important . this were a community in these day . nowadays the familiar surrounding is not so close a it wa a hundret year ago . there are more single or more family with divorced parent . so the surrounding in which the young people live nowadays is completely different to tho who lived a hundret year ago . but this fact i think is the critical point : the young people nowadays want to have a bigger or a more family like family . because of this fact i think , nowadays young people are also engaged in their community by searching a more completely familiy . so i disagree with the statement . my own experience confirms this . a lot of my friend are in several sport or music community . and they help there for non profit . i am in our religous community in my town and i am helping the pastor for non profit .
