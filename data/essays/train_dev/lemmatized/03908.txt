it 's the `` eternal strife '' between the seller and the customer . as we walk through the street of a city today and just look around , if we just give a glance to a newspaper or a magazine , if we turn on the tv for a few second , what we see is that we live in a culture made for a great part of advertisement . what they are is easy to define : short , colourful , attracting and effective ( or suppose to be so ) message , calling our attenction to product of the most various sort . what 's behind their glittering surface ? that 's the question that amazes and sometimes confuses the customer and that he go on wondering for some time . unfortunately , the answer is that often what we find is not what we expected to handle and we have to conclude that teh single product is not such a good staff a it wa supposed to be . for example , some year ago a famous industry had for some time it car advertised by a short movie , in which the car wa running on the water around mount s. michel , france . it wa really impressive , but a the car came out in the market , it revealed to be inferior to the standard of the house . a field especially affected by misleading advertisement is that of food stuff : deli presented a prodigious or incredibly tasty have often not safe origin , or not good taste . the reason that hide behind all of that , you can easily track out : marketing is one of the finest and most expensive business of our time . marketing is going to look more and more like an art , whose task is not to inform the customer about real quality of the product , but to make the best of it , to describe it in the most imaginative and intriguing way . it 's also important to remember that a great amount of money is invested in trade by single or group seller and the effort to have effective advertisement is normally equal to the productive effort . as it happens normally in human life , is possible to find a glance of good just adopting the right perspective : about advertisement , maybe ther will be a time when we should not ask if they are relieble or not , if they tell u the truth or an amount of lie . just look or listen to the story and enjoy the glittering tale !
