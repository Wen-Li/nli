depending on the personal experience , personality type and emotional concern , different person will have different opinion on whether it is more important for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact . in my eye i strongly believe that learning fact is more useful . in other word , i disagree with the statement . i have several reason for my propensity . the main reason is that only though learning fact would people get to know the idea , concept and the truth . thoughout the history , all the idea is come from the obervations of fact . nobody could come to any kind of conclusion without the research and the acumulation of data . for example , newton discover the rule of gravity from observe the apple falling from the tree . another reason canbe see by everybody is that thoery will not be able accepted without the detail and fact . why doe most scientist conduct million of experiment ? because they try to find the support of their idea . thus , it is more important for student to learn fact . that 's all the reason why in the school experiment course are provided . finally , learn fact is necessary for u to discover more idea and concept . this world is still full of mystery . we need to solve them and find out the reason , in other word , to get access to new thoery . only following the concept give by old people , never will our society develop . we ca n't deny the importance of understanding thoery , for the are the truth of the world and very helpfull to solve problem . however , those idea wa come from fact the scientist learned . all in all , considering all the factor above , we can easily draw the conclusion that it is more important for student to learn fact than it is for them to understand idea and concept .
