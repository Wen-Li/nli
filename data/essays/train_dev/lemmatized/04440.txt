with this set of material i 'm really disagree ! cars will be fewer is a fantastic future ! in fact in the last year the number of the car on a road is moltiplicated ! only if an organization like a government or much importatnt like onu or nato will make some mesuerd like a law for this problem we will see fewer car turn around ! my thesys is supported from the known of human mind ! some year ago people every day walk , go by bike or take a bus for go to work , to study or to do other thing ! today man is able to buy a car and use it for his thing , this because the world changed and are changing on ! many year ago peolple got up in the morning and think what the best way for find a food ? later in the year when man got up think : how can i do for live better ? this is one of the mean of evolution ! so , i 'm sure , next year peaple will think , for example , how many car can i buy for live better ? another example to support my opinion you can find in the last year . family ten year ago ha only one car for family , that father usually use . today for each family you can find minimun two car , one for a wife and one for a husband . now number of car are increasing and next year you will see better in one family every component of a family ha a car ! i know some my friend that have two car for each one . the evolution can help u to find a way for limite a pollution for example or increasy the useful of a car , but modern people want to have everythind to take with the hand . .. the strange thing is that this man or woman that doe n't want to walk or take a bus or move , in the evening will go in a fitness center for have a physicol activity ! for this reason usa that is a rich country people are became fat ! in fact fact is one of the problem of modern socety . because machine like a car are doing the all thing that man did before . so i think that that sentence is very funny and fantastic !!!
