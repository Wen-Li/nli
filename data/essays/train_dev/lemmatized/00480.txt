i believe that most of the product we see on tv or magazine are much better than they really are . two year ago i bought a face cream i had seen on the television and it turned out to be a disaster . this kind of misrepresentation are really common in today advertisement world because of the company aim to sell more product and advertisement agency way of being more attractive . the company represent their product better since there is a a lot of potential customer and they all want to take their share in this large cake . these company have great competition between themselves and they are ready to do everything even these thing are unethical . their way to sell more product is to show their product better and they can do this easily since there is no control over the kind of misrepresentation . besides the company , the advertisement agency show some product different than they really are . since they are in the business to make people believe , they create some idea or image which seem more attractive to the customer on the television while misrepresenting the product . while they are doing this untrue presentation , the company do not prevent them since it is for their advantage . from this arrengement in a conclusion , today most advertiments we see represent the better version of the product and there are still people who buy these product before searching the product really quality . i took my lesson two year ago and i hope everyone see the true face of these company and advertiser a soon a possible . this misrepresentation will continue a long a it go until someone come and show the real face of these company and advertisement agency to all world , but until that time i wonder ` what is next'
