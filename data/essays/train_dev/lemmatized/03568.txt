in our childhood , we try to omit other 's behavior and handle new thing . we learn how to stand up properly . sometimes we would fail and cry , but soon we would try again until we succeed . then , we soon try another new thing and get more and more ablility . to me , i believe learning new ablility is a life-long proccess for successful people . we should take risk to try new thing in order to succeed because it provides u opportunity to benefit of life , improvement and correction . trying new thing benefit people 's life because people could gain many usable skill that would be useful in the future . for instance , bill gates gathered the valuable knowledge of computing in his early life . he then used this knowledge to establish a unique computing system - windows . the new ablity allows bill gates to be richest man in the world in his later life . trying new thing always let people to gain wealthy . thus , the people would always pursue in study even after they have been working for a long time . when people try new thing , they would get improvement that they could not get from doing thing already familar . for example , if i read the book which i already read it before , i would probably learn very little or nothing . the book is no use for me . in contrast , if i read a new book about `` how to straigten your personality , '' i may alter my old way of doing thing . i could improve my way of last but not least , people could make correction while they try the new thing . the reason for that is , people can make comparision . the new thing would let people to rethink the way they do old thing . they thought they do thing pretty well , but actually they did not do it right . therefore , successful people always try the new thing in order to correct the mistake that they did not realize before . in order to be successful , people should always not hestitate to try new thing . they can therefore enhance their life both intensively and extensively .
