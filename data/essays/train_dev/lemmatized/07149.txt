it may look like it to many people , but i disagee with this . i think in old day , thing that should be done had been visible . it wa need to be done with physicall labor . now , physical labor is le needed by using machine and computer . young people nowadays just do n't have idea what is really needed . where their heart are , where their treasure is . old day , society wa composed by big family . everybody is helping everybody . you know who you are helping , because they are their family member , relative , or everyday neighbor who is even more close to your real relative . but in modren socity with nuclear family people do n't know really about their neighbor . in this situation , getting help from other people sometimes considered a personal shame for some of u . as society is more and more materialized . we tend to judge other people by what they have , rather than what he/she really is . we should teach our young people about real value . we should open our eye on emotional and spritual world . so that their value are not to have something more for them self , but for others . let ' them have chance .
