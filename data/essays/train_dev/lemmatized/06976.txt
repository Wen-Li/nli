i rather agree and disagree with the statement that ` young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their community ' . well it depends on the people on how they take the situation . young people who are more enthusiastic towards forming a community can tend to help more . and they would rather give enough time to dedicate on helping their community . on the other side , some of the people show le concern towards helping their community . perhaps they would be rather busy with their day-to-day activity . they would be more selfcentered and they would never even bother about helping their community . it is not necessary for the younger people to dedicate much of the time helping their community , infact a little amount of can help much better . sideways poeple with positive view towards developing a community are more concerned to help their communties and dedicate their sufficient work to help them get the community better . they will organise more effective program to help their community . they will arrange more and more effective plan to take their community in a straight way . the young people should be motivated about helping their community and effective program are to be implemented to motivate people . moreover some or more young people are more than enough for a community to develope . however formation of the community help most of the thing to grow in a straight way . it will also give suggestion to most of the problem . communities should be developed in such a way that they should drive the people 's attention towards them . they can do this by organsing some cultultural activity in some occassions . by doing so , most of the young people will be motivated to help their community . so by all of the above point , not all young people are not concerned about helping their commodity . it depends on the people on how they are . and the activity taken by the community which drive the attention of young people .
