definitly i agree with successful people try new thing and take risk rather than only doing what they already know how to do well , because they are the moldel to others to be in advance with the people who are common and tradisionlist . people that no follow the rutine and take risk usually are successful , in a high scale and always are trying to go ahead of the rutine and the society that traditional or common people do . people who take chance , have the vision to improve every day for them and indirectly for the people arround , for exemple people with vision are working for improve the system on the job , or at least how improve the time in every aspect . successful people , always are ahead becoming in lider , that is why the president of the big company , dean in the university , politician in our country are succed . they avoid the rutine of the common people . the do investment not only economics , educationals , and that is they are succesful . the people that follow what they only know , do n't take chance and their life torn boaring without hope in the future , and this can be part of the consecuences in country of the therd word do not proggres and during the time only follow what succesful people such a country ahead improve it 's people . i prefer successful people
