i disagree with this statement to some extent . young people are more enthusiastic for doing such type of work than the older one since the latter have a family and also concentrate on their career to support their family wher a young peole are at the start of their career and they have le pressure . you can also take the example of many university having community service a their course . in these course although there are no grade they provide great pleasure for younger people to go outside the university and help a community . also young people should not be expected of only doing community service since they have an important decision to make regarding their career . one such experience to support the statement i have made is occured on the date which is celebrated a mahatma gandhi 's birthday . on that day many of my colleague at a local call center and many other software professional participated in helping out to clean a community nearby which is full of slum . the reward which we got for it is a great deal of happiness . from then on we helped out that community on saturday of every week by conducting calsses on health and hygiene and even conducte the class for elder who dont know how to read and write . for me this is a perfect example to show that younger generation can do such stuff in modern time too . you can also take the example crisis situation like during war time . here young one are the first to take responsibility in providing any kind of support the army or even helping out the injured . in summary people should not judge young people on just observing some section who are not that great at community work and also this judgemen
