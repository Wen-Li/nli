i think an old saying of `` jack of all and master of none '' , in my opinion doesnot have much standing a time are changing fast and your considered fit in the circle you move when you can comprehend and also contribute . therefore , i agree with the concept of being aware of a lot of discipline than mastering either a few or only one of them . the requirement of this fast paced society , require you to be in touch with the latest development in various field . the reason that i would like to report relate to my field of work , communication of agricultural innovation to the peasant community . firstly , the situation under which the farmer till their land in the developing country are full of challenge both natural and man-made . a knowledge of the latest technology in remote sensing is an essential pre-requisite if i have to give weather based advisory on the kind of crop to grow and the appropriate sowing time . this expertise could also be used in mapping those area for the farmer which have great potential for growth . another of an important learning area could be the crop survelliance technique which could be utilised to fore-warn the farmer about the outbreak of crop epidemic so that preventive measure are taken and farmer donot lose their hard raised crop and avoid huge annual loss to pest attack . marketing intelligence , is one such field which ha a direct relevence to what every one of u desire for , higher profit . if iam aware of the national and international market trend , the same kind of commodity may be recommended to the farmer to make avail of the growing market . consumer preference and standard for organic food are to be one of the knowledge area . to summarise and conclude a varied knowledge is always better than a limited or restricred one . therefore , keeping abreast of many field is highly benificial in my opinion .
