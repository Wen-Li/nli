i disagree with the statement . traveling in a group take away your freedom in time and space you may find it is easier and safer to move around in a group , but in reality , if you wish to go and stay in a certain place for a certain time , that choice is not possible if the group ha a different agenda . a tour guide can be useful and informative , but this also take your agency of deciding what to see , where to go . the best part of traveling in a group with a tour guide is the safety and the le effort you need to gather information about the place , and information for ensuring the safety . but this is also the worst part of traveling in a group , in that , it eliminates positive accident . by positive accident , i mean your opprotunity to meet people , find a great shop or street by accident , find a new thing about the place which may not be marketed in the mainstream tourism . traveling in a group can take away some occurences that can only happen because you have no agenda or specific information , because you wonder around . a good example of this is going to a restaurant . if you travel to hong kong , you find there are restaurant that are specifically for tourist . they are expensive , give le ifnormation about local food and culture , and you meet no local . but if you are willing to take a risk of wondering around , asking around the local people to show a good restaurant , that experience can give you so many episode . you get to communicate with the local people , maybe try speaking a foreign language , find out what is considered a good food in the place and how to use the public transportation , and line up in the restaurant and eat , learning the `` local '' way of doing thing . since i prefer adventure and really experiencing a place when i travel , instead of being a part of marketted and `` selling out '' tourism , i choose to travel alone , in my way , in my own timing . if i work hard to find a good restaurant , i would like to decide what to eat there and how long to stay , not minding what the group may and should do . some may say the trouble it take to gather information about the place on his/her own is too much , and it is better to leave the job to the tour guide . however , recently there are so many book and website about traveling alone ( or a a couple but without any guide ) that are easily accessble , that the thing i mentionied above about getting around on your won can be easily found in a book , such a `` lonely planet . '' after all , traveling is a mean to get away and placing yourself in an odd situation , getting away from your mundane life and chore . in that perspective , no group tour is beneficial if that limit your adventure - possitive accident . by planning and traveling alone , you may find a new aspect of the place you are visiting , which is your own original version and not the marketted version that are equally given to any tourist . i think my position can be easily supported by the numerous current tv program about backpaking , traveling alone , seeking so-called adventure in traveling . a famous example of this will be a program called `` global trekker . '' now the trend is in adventure . traveling in a group with a tour guide may be a good idea for older people , but for myself , i chose traveling alone .
