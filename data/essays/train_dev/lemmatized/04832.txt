there is no doubt about the fact that some people are not able to differentiate between the idea and concept versus fact . what i normally do and follow is to learn about the idea and concept first and then connect it with the fact . so , for me understanding idea and concept is far more important a they are universal and is a complete statement in itself . as far a i am concerned , to me ideas and concept , are a kind of universal rule i.e it can be used in more than one situation and / or event . for eg. if i am having clear concept and idea about any particular thing it becomes lot more easier for me to understand the detail though it look tough . it also help me to generate an example and explain the same thing in my own word . in addition to it if i am having a strong understanding of the fundametals ( idea and concept ) i could apply in any given situation a currently in a toefl exam many a time you had to understand the concept and idea of the reading and listening passage . secondly , i would like to say that idea and concept which we also call fundamentals is complete statement in itself while on the other side facts are incomplete without an idea incorporated in it . for eg. the theorems and formulas used in maths and physics are also a kind of concept and idea of solving the problem of calculation ; without this it is impossible to do anything . therefore , i strongly belive that idea and concept are definately having an upper hand than the fact in every aspect of life whatsoever .
