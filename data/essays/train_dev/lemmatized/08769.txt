i agree with the statement `` successful people try new thing and take risk rather than only doing what they already know how to do well '' . the statement above is considered to be statisticly true due to the fact that those successful people have a back-up plan that they are currently using which is the thing they are already doing . the saying `` if it ai n't broke do n't fix it '' is false for the business world . if those sucessful people keep clinging to what they already have eventuallly somebody else will take thier idea and evolve it or take it to another level , thus leaving those successful people no choice but to take risk and try new idea . if successful people try new idea that help them and further increase thier profit and help them build a better reputation then they will gladly take that idea . if they try something new and hope that it becomes successful then the faith that they put in thier new idea ( ex . project , product , or any other thing ) will either strengthen or weaken depending on the outcome of the new idea . in life it 's either eat or be eaten . the same rule applies to the business world . if you have a plan that you might think will work or will not work then you should take a chance and not any chance but a calculated chance that give you hope of letting your plan work or flourish . many people try to invent new gizmo 's or even update old idea , but they fail in doing so becuase they lack the financial aid or even the help from people , that is why only successful people take chance and try new idea so that their success continues and that thier business continues to grow .
