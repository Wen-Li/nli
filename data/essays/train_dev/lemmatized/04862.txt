nowadays there is a discussion about the youngster . it is that recently , do young people give enough time to helping their comunities ? in my opinion , young people do not give enough time to helping to their community , a it wa at past . at our time , there are lot of thing that youngster can waste their time with . firstly , most of the young people are wasting time with computer . computers were made for people 's good at first but then it start to become a toy or a game machine and no one tried to stop it , because game are a seriously large echonomic resource for the people working in this sector . for example , young people can try using computer and internet for searching for the information about their country 's place in the world and feature prediction about their country . further more this interest would make the young people more interested in their community . secondly , i think that younng people are not taking the lesson at their school so seriously . there are important lesson given to the student at school about their community like history and geography . in my opinion , every person , related to a community , should know his country 's history . also geography is an important factor for a person to help his/her community . these are just two factor for a person to help his/her community that the education of them are given at school . moreover school give the education of loving your country , after your family . these are all well known by people , but , however , still people are not taking seriously and thinking school a gamefields . young people are like diamond . you should shape them , otherwise you can not expect anything from them . they have to be shaped , if they are wanted to be the saver of the community . so if a youngster doe n't give enough time to help his/her community , it is also his/her family 's fault .
