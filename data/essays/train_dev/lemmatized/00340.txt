i disagree with the statement that twenty year from now there will be fewer car in use than there are today . nowadays people are realising the benefit that the automobile provide to people . its more convienient to travel by a car than by other mean of transport a car provide u with a sort of freedom that we do n't get from other maens of transport and since the economy is improving more and more people can afford to buy car . this will lead to an increase in the number of car in the near future a m nowdays the automobile company provide variety of comfort with the car and hence make travelling more fun in the car . and thse comfort will only increase a the time go on . the safety standard of the car is also being steadily improved upon thus making a car journey much more safer . the safety standars can only improve with time thus making car much more safer than other mean of transport . moreover it is easier to buy a car nowdays with the reduction in price and the variety which is available . and a few year from now we will see more variety thus prompting people to discard their old car and buy a new one . also the one thing that will never go away is the enjoyment one get while driving a car . this will never go away and will make people buy car . then their is the reason of economic superiority that we human tend to show which make people buy many car . thus all these reason suggest that their will never be a reduction in the demand of car and hence we will see more and more car on the road few year from now .
