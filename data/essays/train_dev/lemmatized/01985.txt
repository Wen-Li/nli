there are many way for young people to help their community . i personally disagree with the saying that young people now are not giving enough time to help their community . as a university student , friend around me ha joined some charity project and i myself also go to the child near my neighnor everyweek to take care of the child . first of all , there more and more club or student society established in school to help the deprived people . for example , my professor told me that there were only one charity society formed by student ten year ago , when she studied in our universuty . however , there are more then eight student society which help people who need help . second , more and more people are associated with helping the community . while there are more and more charity society establihed , that mean there are more and more people involve in this kind of activity . according to my own experience , this is true . during my freshman year in university , there were only three people in my class joined the group which do charity . but in my junior year in the university , there are more than ten of my classmate devote themselves into community service . last but not least , this summer when a work a an intern in citi bank , they have a poject called `` read for the future '' . this profect is to gather university student to let them read story for the child in the le developed area . citi bank counted the amount of time they read for the child , that wa more than a thousand hour in three month by only a hundred student . as a society developed , there might be more and more problem appear . on the other hand , there are also more and more hot-blooded young people are welling to spend more of their time devoting themselves into helping the society .
