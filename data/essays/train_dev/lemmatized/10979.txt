some people say most advertisement make product seem better than they really are . i agree with it . when people watch a television , read newspape or walking on the street , they see a lot of advertises . even though people do n't concentrate about that , they already have influenced . the first problem is the company cheat the costomers . when the company make a commercial for selling product , they usually try to show there product a the best and they tell them only good point . due to they made people beilive that product doe n't have any defect and costomers but it . however , there are also many bad point . it is one of the cheating . the other one is overconsumption . the commercial stumulates people want to get that product and actually they do n't need it , but they buy it . sometimes buying is caused to develop the economy , but typically it ha to disappear . third reason is cost . if they make an advertisement , they need money and when they make an advertisement that is look better , they have to pay more . it is going to be caused the increase . the increase will poor people suffers from money . the purpose of company is make money . whereas they earn money , the people 's saving decrease . the company must make good product and after costomers will be able to judge it .
