risk equal to success . two type of people we can see in our life . one of them who dont take risk and continue his or her boring life and other one is who get risk and ha a not so balanced but intruduce success and lose in his or her life . so many people like cilently life no risk , no fear , dont think so much tomorrow . that type of people never get a success in their life . their succsess is only buy a new car or go holiday at abroad . succsess is encourage you make better . i think that risk connect you to life more strongly cause of when you get risk that make you all the time awake and thinkful . you should think not like other people you ought to see all apportunities what make your risk more successful . you should read and research new thing in the world . at the end when you reach succsess again you feel your self more brave to try new thing . because one time you get success and next time will why not ? than you start search again new thing for try again . i agree that successful people should try new thing and take risk in order to reach new succsessions .
