i agree with the statement that afferms that in the next twenty year will be a decrease of the car in use , because i think that the frenzy increase of car that we are in this year assisting to , have to , sooner or later , coming to an end . i think so because probabily , in the nearly future , people and government will be forced in thinking of enviorment and how to preservate it . as we all know , car are now one of the mainly cause for pollution , this could bring , in a future , to moving the attention to all the other echologic kind of fuel that the progress of modern science offer u , like wind , water , sun , bio mass , and so on . this possibility is also supported by the fact that petrolium source ( from which we are now taking all the source of energy we use in ordinary life ) will probably decrease and then come to an end in the next year , and so , a the yaers pas , other kind of energy will become cheaper than that in use today . a future world with no petrolium derviates ha to find alternative solution for the problem of transport . not only with alternative energy source ( a i already said in the first part of this essay ) but even with a stronger government 's politic that support the developing of new idea , for example , giving benefit and help to whom that try to improve the daily situation or to increase the use of public transport ( like bus , train , taxi cab and so on ) instead of private car . i hope that this future situation would n't be only a dream because if it would , it will be very difficoult for people of my generation to live a normal life in a `` sane '' world like our parent ' and grandparent ' generation did .
