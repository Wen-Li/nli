i did not aree with the deal that the best way to travel is in a group led by a guide . the reason why i think so go a fallow . although it is more safety to jion a group to travel , especially in a strange foreign country , it will limited one 's action . because in a group one have to obtain the group rule , an individual ca n't stay in the place that really attract him , it will be le free for sightsee . second , traveling not along with group will get more impressive experience because all the information must be accquired by effort . and it make the experience more worthy . a guide may provide only brief knowledge about the spot throught his time limited intrduction . searching the story about the exotic atmosphere is more attrative for me . third , in group travelling we may get new friend in the period , and getting new friend is interesting but may influence the quality of travllingbut because we might meet the people who ha bad habavior that make me unconfortable . if i travel on myself i can choose the accompany whom i am alredy familar with . group travel is interesting , howerer learning to solve the cultrual gap problem by myseft is also intereting .
