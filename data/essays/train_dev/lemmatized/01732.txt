the importance of ideas and concepts in our life i am a hundred percent agree that `` understanding idea and concept are more important for student than learning fact '' . facts are generally the result of the idea and concept , while fact are the given situation or just the result . ideas and concept and fact have a relationship like the visible and invisible part of an iceberg . as you all know the visible part of an iceberg is very insignificant if we compare it to it invisible part . therefore if student learn the idea and concept they will understand the reason and cause of a fact . if they do so they will respond to the fact differently and more maturly . by learning idea and concept it will be easier for them to change the world into a better place but just learning the fact will not help them do that . in generally the idea and concept play a role in the formation of the fact . for example , blindness is a fact but producing smth a a blind person is related to the concept and idea . poverty is a fact but changing this situation into a better one is to do with idea and concept . of course it ha to do with the will power . without the will power we ca n't change the fact that surround u . that is the reason why understanding idea and concept is more meaningful in my opinion . the idea and concept in the world that make a change and have an effect on the fact .
