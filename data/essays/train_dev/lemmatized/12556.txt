nowadays there is great controversial over the time young people spend helping their community . many year ago , it wa very common seeing young people helping their community in activity such helping in church , school and so on , during last year old people have noticied it ha decreased the number of youth who help their community . from my point of view , it is a matter of fact that the number of young people who helped in their community ha decreased in last decade . for instance , when i went to my church ten or fifteen year ago me and my friend helped to do all the thing that the preacherman could not do by himself ; but a we have grown up there are no young peolpe who help in church and , in fact , the elder one are those who help the preacherman in order to go on with the mass . there are many reason that can help to understand this problem . in the first place young people are so ineterested in new technology that they are forgetting so important value such a family or friend . what i mean is that they spend so many hour playing with computer or watching tv that they forget what is really important in life which , i believe , is the people around you including family , friend and , of course , your community . it is obvious that if you do not care about your family you will not care about your community . on the second place , we live in such a competitive society that parent do not spend enough time with their child to educate them in the same a they were educated by their eldest . as a result , young people have not received the learning of helping those around them . if you ask to me , i think that the lack of help from young people is an important problem because it is producing a great seperation between the young and old people in their community , and the only way to resolve it is give a better education to the little one in order to avoid this problem in the future .
