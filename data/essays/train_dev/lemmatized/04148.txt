i completely agree with the statement that it is more important for the student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact . in today 's world the quality of the education system ha certainly gone down . now a these day more stress is being put on the student to learn fact rather than focusing on the understanding of idea and concept . eg : a student is stressed to learn when the world war ii started or which country were fighting in the war rather than providing an understanding to them whether the war wa necessary or not ? what could be the consequence of another war of the same sort taking place in the future ? in today 's world one ha to be innovative , creative and original . the education system in today 's world doe not input any of these quality in a child . these quality can only be inputted through proper understanding of idea and concept and not by mere fact . the above mentioned quality contribute greatly in one 's success . facts are also important . a student should definitely be familiar with the historic event . eg : the date when his/her country got independence , how they got it , the name of the freedom fighter etc . but these are just for knowledge . they are not going to contribute in one 's success . if a child learns only fact at school and doe not understand idea and concept then he might even have a problem finding job . he might not do well in his job interview where they test your understanding of thing concerned . so i definitely think that it is more important for student to understand idea and concept than learning fact . i also hope that the education system in make the required change in their procedure and focus more on the understanding of idea and concept rather than fact .
