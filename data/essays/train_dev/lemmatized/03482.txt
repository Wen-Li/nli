some people like to attaind a tour group led by a tour guide when traveling . however , others like to plan the iternirary and do the pre-trip information research by themselves . in my point of view , if one want to have the awesome travel experience , travelling alone would be the best choice . first , when traveling in a group , you do n't have much choice . much time of the case you encountered is that a bounch of tourist crowed in front of the painting or relic and listened the lecture addressed by the tour guide . the quality of lecture may vary between tour guide and you do n't have much choice about what you can see or where you can visit . another reason why traveling alone is better than joining tour group is that you will become the tour expert when you come back home . you can enjoy every deatils from the very begining of trip planing to every moment you spent during the trip . you may do more background information for the spot that you have interest . it is not what a tour guide can do for you . the way of tour guide 's leading may not fit your taste perfectly . one of main reason that people choice join tour group is that when facing accident during trip , they need somesone can help them . but , sometimes even a tour guide may also not the local resident . when accident occurs , tour guide is also in the same situation a we are . if we do the information collection by ourselves in advance , we can have more confidence when faceing accident after considering the reason above , the best way to travel is travelling alone . you can have much more controle over your iternirary and you can learn more about the spot you have interset .
