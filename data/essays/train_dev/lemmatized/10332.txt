being specialised in one academic subject or in many subject which is better ? and is it true that the more subject u specialise in the more acadamic and better you will be ? people 's opinion in the number specialization differs widely , but the question is which is better ? first of all , to be specialized in one subject make the person more professional in the subject he choose . secondly , in work he would have a higer rank which mean that more salary will be offered to him which can lead him to have a better life like having luxury car and house , but the problem that it may be hard for him to ind a good work if he wa specialized in a rare subject . also their are quite alot of advantage for having more than one specialized subject like1-more oppurtunity for him to find a work2-give him the chance to work in more than one place which may lead to more salary but in the same time more stress3-makes him have a better place in the community due to his knowledge in many thing which may make him help many people . but in my opinion , having more than one specialze subject is better because it is possible for the person with many specialism to have the same degree in all of his subject a the person who ha just one specialze subject with the degree . also i think that having one specialize subject may take a big effort to find a good job with a good salary . for example my cousin studied in us computer science and came to uae to study there but couldnt find a job because it is not needed in this country so he had to studfy again another subject in order to live his life . as they said the more knowledge you have the more important you will be in your county .
