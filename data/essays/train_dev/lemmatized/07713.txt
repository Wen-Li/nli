enjoying life . in order to answer the question of who enjoys life more , younger or older people , i think it is vital to look at how each of these group do actually enjoy life . very young kid seem to need very little to have a good time . an empty paper box , and nice puppy , lot 's of mud or just a sunny day can be enough to make them totally happy and enjoy life . they might not think about it , or be aware of it , but exactly this carefreeness allows them to make life so wonderfull for them . this behaviour mostly continues into later stage of life , the teen , tweens and probably the thirty . during this time people might still enjoy life , but being a lot more reflectory about it . some of them tend to worry too much . it is a time when great difficutlies in life might have to be overcome , such a education , first love ( s ) and work . i think a lot of external side effect influence the life enjoyment of a single person druing this time period . due to it still being in the first half of a normal life expectancy , i would count this life period to the `` young '' part . the enjoyment of life in the second half of our life is based on two major factor . one is again the external situation . have you found a job or life partner that fulfills you and make you happy . have you maybe made enough of money to now be able to live a dream life that wa not possible otherwise . the second very important aspect during this time is the gained life experience . older people seem to have a more relaxed view of life . they are not scared or worried a easily . especially very old people that have survived war and famine , great area and disaster seem to be able to enjoy life with a lot le . on the other hand there are those of course that have suffered great hardship by that time , and might even not have a bright future . enjoying life might not be somthing they think about at all . perosnally i agree with the statement . i think full and complete enjoyment of life is probably most common and easily reached when we are very young . yet , when external circumstance are right , it is quite possible to have a very enjoyable life to the very end , even if there might be a few down inbetween .
