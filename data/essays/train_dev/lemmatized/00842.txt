i very strongly disagree with the claim that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide . such a position relies on a few logical argument , but also on the result of a personal experience , both of which i shall now try to highlight : first of all , any effective decision coming from a group ha to be the result of a very long , slow and fastidious process of argumentation . also the decision , once made , are known to level the number of exciting thing to do , museum to visit , to a strict minimum . even if the presence of a guide would undoubtebly temper the problem of an effective decision a the result of a collective process , it would only do so by raising another kind of problem , quite more preoccupying really : tour guide are not always reliable , and actually often turn out to be quite deceptive if not fully mendacious . true , to the extent that it allows the traveler not to worry about any plan or any decision to make , to rely on a tour guide can be an agreable way to enjoy a holiday . also to travel in a group can provide a sense of psychological comfort , by knowing that one will never be on her or his own . in the end , it seems that the personality of the traveler play a huge part in the answer to that claim . in my opinion , the best way to travel is unquestionably on one 's own . no tour guide , no group , just a backpack and a city map . as paradoxical a it may sound , i have always experienced it to be the best way never to be alone .
