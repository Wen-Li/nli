i do not agree with this statement . today , technology is advancing with a breathtaking pace . newer source of energy are being pursued and more efficient way of using resource are being researched on continually . the demand for transportation will always remain and people would always like to travel in their own personal space . the most common fuel that is used for running car is petroleum and this fuel will be in great scarcity and it demand will keep on increasing a year progress . people have already started switiching to other source such a hybrid car which provide a combination of electricity and fuel on which the car can run . researchers and scientist are continually trying to harness the potential of hydrogen ( h ) which if successful , can be easily used to reduce any dependence on other fuel because of it abundance on earth . governments of various country are making effort to make the use of public transport such a public bus and train more common . for example , in the united arab emirates , a huge project is presently under construction for the metro train . various government are trying to relieve the dependence of a commuter on car . but , this doe not mean that every single person is going to make use of the train or bus at all time . many people need to travel short or medium distance frequently throughout the day , pertaining to their job requirement . there are also people who do not like travel in public or need to travel in controlled atmosphere because of medical condition . this category of people will always require that some sort of personal transportation be available which is also comfortable . this requirement can only be fulfilled be a vehicle such a a car . therefore , car will always be there a a mean of transportation and will definitely not decrease in number than what is present today . various new source are being developed and some may also be discovered by scientist and researcher . it is only a matter of time that something more efficient than petrol come into picture and replace it .
