i think that in our complex society is surely better to be specialized . i learned it from my own experience . at university i studied communication . when i applicated i thought i could really learn a lot about the specific mecanism of it . but i wa quite disappointed . the main course where quite confuse quite different one from the other . i have had a very spread education , because i studied a bit of history a bit of economy , a bit of sociology . but at the end i understood that there wa n't anything that i really could say i knew . i could facing lot of different situation and solve different kind of problem . and it could be very useful for every day situation or for a job without particular ambition . but we live in a very competitive world and it 's never enought to be prepared to the simplest . the process of development we live , we can appreciate it or le , require a great specialization . someone who know very well is own specific sector will have more opportunity to devolop it , to find new solution and to have good opportunity . a person could also start from a not specific knowledge , that coul be the base for something else . i think that should be better starting at the college with a specialization , but even after it , there is always time to try to understand the little field where someone should be brilliant and follow it . a way to devolop this kind of specialisation could be with a master of science or with a phd . knowledge is more spread in our generation , and it 's very good that more peple have the opportunity of a high level education . but the drawback is that to be specialized someone should study more than the others . and so he should go on with his own study . but the most important think at this step is to choose a master that can really make the difference . it 's better to study something so specific that just few people on the world know , than something that is common knowledge for everyone .
