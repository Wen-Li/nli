i believe that age doe n't matter when it come to enjoying life , it is up to each person to make the best of it and squeeze every drop they can get . sometimes when we are young we tend to think that old people had their time and that because they are so worried on their grandchild , the cold weather , money problem or about their health problem they do n't enjoy life the way young people do . we believe that age is everything until that a day come when you look back and think of the great memory you have and the great one that will still come . my grandmother wa a great example . she always used to tell me what her life wa like when she wa a little girl growing up in a small town and moving to a big city , going out with her firends , her curfew and when my grandpfather proposed . i thought about how great her life wa but never thought about how great her life is . since we see the present a something common and even unrelevant sometimes i did n't see my grandmother 's life a '' exciting '' let alone fun when she wa 60 . now , after many other conversation , i got to know that life go on and that every day is enjoyable , even if it 's your last . my grandmother go away on field trip with her friend while i am studying for a never ending test , cook because she want to and not because she has to , ha great story to tell and always wait for u with a great meal . enjoyable get a different meaning while you are growing up . when you 're little an ice cream and your mom is everything . when you get older a toy or a new friend is very important ; when you 're a teenager enjoying life is having friend around you and have something you can identify with like sport ; by college the challange of living alone , traveling , going out to club and having a boyfriend/girlfriend is enjoying your youth . by the time you graduate hopefully you 'll get a good job , marry the man of your dream and watch your kid grow up . every step of the way is enjoyable then . in my opinion there are no time when you enjoy thing more than others , it 's up to you to make every effort for every moment to be worthy and worthwhile .
