i do agree with the viewpoint that most advertisement make product seem much better than they are . in fact , the purpose of the advirtisement is to incite the desire of the customer and increase the sale of their product . it is unavoidable to use some kind of communation skill to stimulate customer to buy their product . in order to increase the sale of the product , advertisement will mask some kind of shortage of their product and only put emphasis on the outstanding point of the product . for example , the renovation of the processor of the personal computer is fast . many processor manufacture always emphasize on the processing speed of their product . however , they never mention some important feature such a how much electricity will be used for using the chip and how hot they will produce during usage . for a good computer , low temperature and stable performence are far more important rather than fast speed , however , the advertisement never expose their shortage . another example is the advertisement for restaurant . they always show how good their food are and how low cost for their food . however , the advertisement seldom give correct information to costemors that what kind of food is good for health and necessary for human body . the purpose of the photo of the advertisement is to arise the interest of customer and the ultimate goal is to sell their product . in addition , when we buy food in mall or supermarket , we can often discover that the picture do not match with the product . the photo of their product are surely more beautiful than they are in reality . good advertisement will deliver the correct information to the customer and help customer make reasonable decision . on the other hand , inadquate advertisement will affect the brand image of the product and further damage customer . in my opinion , more and more poor advertisement are showing throuth different medium and thus it will be more difficult for customer to make right decision in the future .
