in my opinon i agree that most advertisement make product seem much better than they really are . advertisements are used to educate and promote product audio visually . products are used to educate consumer about their benefit and usage and also it side effect . the use of audio - visual method have advanced over the year and to an extent with the help of digital technology . for example , action figure in child 's toy are shown to be moving and fighting on their own and kid want those toy which move and interact . but when you buy them they are to be physically moved and the child have to do the voice over and pretend . so practically one buy a product by the image created through advertisement . the color and the texture and the lighting in which it is projected make the product look enhanced . for example furniture , the advertisement show the same product in a perfect enviornment it tempts you immediately to replace your existing furniture but when you actually personally feel the wood it chipped or it not a desirable a it look are not that rich a advertised . it could be true with plastic , fabric even ingredient like color in food used to enhance the product to promote sale but in reality it not that good . hence i believe that most advertisement make product seem much better for they actually are .
