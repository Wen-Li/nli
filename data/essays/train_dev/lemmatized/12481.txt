it is often said that knowing a variety of subject is better than concentrating only one subject . some people might disagree with this statement because they believe that specializing one major can help them to be more successful . however , i strongly support the idea in the statement since having a lot of knowledge is very useful in one 's life a well a help student to study better . to begin with , studying many subject is very useful . it is no secret that we live in a complex society that is consisted of many aspect . therefore , you can use your broad knowledge during your life . a shining example of this is one 's hobby ; even though your major is business , for instance , you would probably enjoy your hobby such a listening to music , going to the gallary , etc . if you have a broadened knowledge about these thing by taking a music or art class , it will be helpful to you when you enjoy them . therefore , it is obvious that various subject can be used many time . it is also true that many subject have something to do with each other . it is especially true because there is no independent subject in the world . in other word , all subject are linked together . here is what i have seen myself . my major is languge . however , i am taking not only class that are my major but also one physiology class . in my major class , i study about human 's brain that is related to ability to speak . also , in the physiology class , i learn about haman 's brain , too . this is an evidence that language and physiology are related subject . given this , a lot of subject can help one to study one 's major better . in conclusion , i firmly believe that it is more important to have a variety of information in many subject than only one major . that is because it is useful a well a improves your study . therefore , if i can , i want to study more kind of subject in the future .
