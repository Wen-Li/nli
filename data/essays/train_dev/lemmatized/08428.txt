i am agree , becasue when sucessful people take risk to do something else , they discover that they are able to do new thing , and they can help another people with their problem or with their proyects . if i know that i am sucessful in typing wihtout seeing , it doe n't mean that i am going to be only concentrated in this matter because that will not help me to take a risk and try to do something differente . that mean i would never know that i am able to do new thing very well . one example is when i wa younger , i wanted to be a teacher , but a i wa afraid , because i did not know what grade level i will be teaching , becasue when i wa a college student , i used to practice second grade , and it wa the grade level that i liked , but i thougth about it , if i wo n't take the risk , i wo n't find out how well i will be a a teacher in a high grade level . so i took the risk and i got a fourth grade level and i had a wounderful class . all my student were promoted to the next grade level , which mean they were succesful at the end of the school year . that showed me , that if i would n't take the risk i would'n know i could be a good teacher in a high grade level . i mean , higher than second grade . so i recommened to the people to take the risk and try new thing rather to be there stock in one thing forever . the new thing that you can do well , will help you to be succesful in differents field , and that will help you to have a better way to live and enjoy your job or job .
