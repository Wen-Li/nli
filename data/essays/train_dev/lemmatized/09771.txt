i diasgee with the statement . according to me it is equally important for student to understand idea and concept and learn fact . mostly idea and concept are based on fact and if the student would n't know the fact how would they understand the idea and concept and build on them . lets take the example of a nuclear fission/fusion reaction and the nuclear energy which is used to provide electricity to a large part of the world . if the person who came up with the idea of building a nuclear reactor would not have known the fact that nuclear fission/fusion reaction emits a large amount of energy he/she would not have come up with the idea of tapping this energy and concepting the idea of a nuclear reactor . facts are like the foundation stone without which all idea and concept would be baseless . equally important is for the student to understand the idea and concept . if the student do n't understand the new idea and concept how will the world advance . all these technological innovation today have been possible because people have thought over the idea , extensively researched the fact and then used both of them to their advantage . for example , if alexander graham bell would not have had the idea that he could build telephone or thomas edison would not have the idea that electric bulb could be made then we still might have been living in a world full of darkness and this kind of communication would not have been possible . also if the student would not concentrate on idea then they would just become a kind of robot with data/facts feeded in and with no innovative and imaginative idea . students also find an outflow of their emotion in the idea they express . so , the student should concentate on both ; learn the fact first and then build idea over it . both are equally important .
