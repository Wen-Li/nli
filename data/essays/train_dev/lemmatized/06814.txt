i disagree with the statement , i think student have to learn the fact inorder to understand the concept , with out learning the fact regarding how can a student read ? in my opinion student have to learn every thing practicaly so that he can remember for more time , let take an example , let take a lecture from a proffessor in a biology class , the professor is explaining about some subject related to frog , in this case with out seeing by testing a frog just having a figure in the black board and blindly following the textbook is not good , if you want to learn the subject perfectly then go to biology lab and test a frog then know the fact by your own and then prepare your own note , check it with your textbook content and see wether what you studied practicaly is correct or not . with out doing all these just by reading the textbook andsaying that `` i got understood '' is not at all a correct thing for student . we can learn fact by doing thing practically and by conducting research . students should be in a position of describing new idea and new concept but not in the position of mugging the old idea and concept . there is much thrill in learning the fact , here is an example from my personal experience , last time when i went to my friend place which is some where near warangal ( historical place in southeren part of india ) , it is a very rural area even power supply is not there , the people there are uneducated , there is a belief in that area that if any one go at the night time to a place called `` maranam '' ( a big tree with lot of cave ) then they will be killed by an evil , i felt strange when i heard this , that night me with my friend went there my firends hiding near another tree and i 'm standing nearer the tree , i waited their for a long time , atlast i found a short and stout object coming towards me ( well it is coming from a forest which is near to that tree ) i slowly called my friend by sugnaling with the tourch , that moving object nearing me and me with my friend torched at his face , got shocked it a lion , seeing at the light the lion got scared and ran away into the forest , next day we anounced in the village that it a lion do n't get worry and we even informed zo authority and they had taken it away . this is how learning fact will also give thrill , and one important thing is learning new thing will make
