i disagree with the statement `` young people enjoy life more than older people do . '' i think that people can enjoy if they have enough ( i ) money , ( ii ) time , and ( iii ) physical power to enjoy their hobby or thing which they are willing to do . with respect to ( i ) money , it is the many case that young people do not have enough money to enjoy their reasure time . on the other hand , older people have enough money to use for their fun . honestly speaking , my father have more money than i have . older people have deposited their earned money from their long time 's working . and there is the national pention system in our countory , so older people do not have to spend their own money to live and they can get enough money from such pention system today . with respect to ( ii ) time , young peopele have lot of thing to do , such a study , work , and local activity . in my case , i am working more than 200 hour a month , in order to get money required to pay back to a bank ( i borrowed some money for buying my house . ) . so young people do not have enough time to enjoy their hobby . with respect to ( iii ) physical power , the physical power of young people is higher than that of older peopel . but according to the article i read in a magazine , older people 's physical power is getting higher and higher in accordance with the development or inovation in the medical business . so older people today have enough power to enjoy their hobby like young people do . from above mentioned , i must state that older people enjoy life more than young people .
