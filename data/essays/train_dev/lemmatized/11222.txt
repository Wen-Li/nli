i agree with this statement that most advertisement make product seem much better than they really are . because medium have a strong effect on people , and how much the product became a familiar to people it became better . as we all know that advertisement is an essential step to make any product to be success . it is also can be a misleading for people know nothing about product in market . the advertisement is using a simple way to get simple people are not aware if that product are good enough for them or no , and a a result of worldwide medium now and the expantion of it become more easy to get people in trap of these advertiesments . as any company make good product or bad product all are seeking for binifits of these product . but the difference that good comapines are affraid on thier respective , rather than other company produce le qaulity item for market . if we take a soap product under consideration , and if we asume that there are two company are producing such a material we call them x and y respectivly with good product and bad product . in the following situation we will see how that medium will make the bad product of y better than broduct of x. company y choose a international program that many of people like to watch it and they like to keep watching it continously . they advirtise their product over and over for long time . which make people uncontionsly take on this product and being familiar with it . so when people go to a market and want to buy a soap a our example . the customer will find two product one is for x and the other for y , and because the strong advirtisement of product y the customer will choose the product y. even so product x is better than product y the customer choose product y . so in my opinion how much the advertisement of a product were good and alot . how much better the product will be better than reall is . and here become the role of customer in seeking what really better not what he saw in tv .
