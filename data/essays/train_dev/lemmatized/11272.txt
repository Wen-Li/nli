a hundred year ago nobody thought that these day we would have million and million of car in use in every country . i do n't think that in twenty year there will be fewer car in use . in fact , i do belive that the number of car in use will increase dramatically . one fact that may cause this is that there will be more single people than nowadays , and they will all need a way of transportation from home to their place of work . another reason why numer of car will increase is that rich people love car . they think they are better person if they have more car than anyone . that 's why they will keep on buying them and using all of them to try to show how rich , powerful and great person they are . in addition , car are may be the best way to get from one place to another : it is the cheapest way to travel , and you are free to decide where you want to go , even to change your opinion during the travel . but car do represent a big problem to our environment . they produce toxic gas that affect the ozone layer . due to these gas our lung are polluted too . now there are more people with cancer than back then . in the future , car will face another problem : the matter that there will not be enough oil to all of them . is there anything that we can do to protect ourselves and our environment from pollution and also still have the chance to travel whenever we want , wherever we want , anytime we want ? yes , there ir . but the solution , unfortunately , ha not been developed yet . we need new way of transport , such a vehicle that run thanks to electricity instead of oil . that 's why i really believe that when these ` green vehicle ' get to be developed , there will be fewer car in use than there are today . however , it wo n't happen in twenty year .
