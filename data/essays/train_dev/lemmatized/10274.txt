i agree with the opinion that in these time younger people are more likely to spend their time with other thing than in spending it in helping their community because of the following reason . first , the continous advance of technology over the last couple of year ha created a completely new world of medium and arcade possibility . young people are influenced from all side with computer game , various tv program and the internet . so they invest their time in these thing instead of doing beneficial work for their community . second , and this point relates in some part from the first point , the availability and the access to this various kind of entertainment tool nowadays prevents young people from concentrating on their school or study which somewhat is also a negativ aspect on their community , because when a community ha n't a lot of educated young people , it will appear that these community will look underdeveloped when comparing them with other community . on the other hand young people that are not interested in school or in good education tend to be uninterested in their community aswell . so in paragraph one and two we considered only those young people that are somehow affected in a bad way from thing that promise amusement and therefore leave their responsibility behind . if we consider young people that are very encouraged and challenged student of school or university i feel that it can also appear that some of these student are too overwhelmed with their study and would more likely try to achieve a good educational goal than investing their time in their community which obviously and on the short-term would n't affect them and from which they have hardly any benefit ( so do they think ) . in today 's world ( young ) people are getting more and more selfish and do n't see any sense in helping someone or something without getting any benefit for themselfes from it . summing the mentioned point up , nowadays it is not so unusual that young people are not interested in helping their community because of the immense influence of medium and technology and the increasing responsibility that student have and the selfishness that tends to appear in our today 's anonymous and cold society .
