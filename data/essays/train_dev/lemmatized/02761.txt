i agree it is more important for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact . just like math , idea and concept are process and answer is fact . i think most of the teacher would like student to understand solve problem 's process not understand what the answer is . if you have right process for the problem but get wrong answer that teacher suppose give you point , if you get right answer but your process not correct that will let your teacher doubt you `` how did you get this answer ? '' understand process that would easier to know how to solve the problem but know the answer ca n't sure you know how to solve problem . it is important for student to understand idea and concept . facts are dead , idea and concept are living . fact always have one but you may have the other thinking in the mind for your idea or concept and if you study deeply , it may overthrow original fact . that why understand idea and concept is more important for learn fact . sometimes learning idea and concept can make you easier to understand , we can find something trick among them . what is your thinking , your concept or your idea , like math have many of way to solve problem not just one .
