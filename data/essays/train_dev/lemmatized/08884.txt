i strongly agree with this statement . let me explain why . we live in the era of information and technology . our everyday life is sorrounded by this fact : computer and internet , television , cinema . .. enterprises take benefit from this new way of obtaining information , and settle their advertisement everywhere . we can see publicity on the street ( for example bus stop ) , on the internet ( while we surf the net , many different advertisement will show up ) , in the cinema ( film usually contain hidden reference to product ) ... but the main way enterprise expose their product is television . most of the population ha a tv at home , or at least , ha access to it in the neighbourhood or at school . .. who doe n't watch television ? a person that might admit not watching it would be treated a an alien or something similar . publicity in television is the main support of a tv channel : enterprise pay large amount of money to have a space after a program , so they can show their product . and what about the product showed on the television ? well , a we can daily see , all type of item are anounced : car , perfums , film , drink , food . .. but are these product exposed from an objective point of view ? no , i do n't think so . publicity expert design the advertisement in a way it will call the spectator 's attention , but not because of the product nature , instead of that , they will talk about it effect , about the feeling or impression you will experience if you buy it or use it . have you ever seen a `` high quality '' perfum advertisement ? this publicity will not refer to the way the essence is made , no , this advertisement will talk about the effect it might have in the person and all the people that sorrounds that person . for instance : the perfum will make you feel fresh ; or make all the men fall in love with you ; or make you the sexiest girl in the city ; or even compare the perfum 's effect with the great pleasure in life ! the thing is that we do n't realise this is n't true until we buy the product , and then , it 's already too late . so finally we conclude , a the statement say , that most advertisement make product seem much better than they really are .
