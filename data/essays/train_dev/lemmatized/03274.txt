the topic under discussion is whether most advertisement make product seem much better than they really are or not . i go with the opinion that the advertisement are making the product look much better than what it actually is . the growth of the communication medium widely in the form of television , news papers , internet and various other choice had lead to an outright growth in the propaganda of any item . people come to know about any new product in the market through any of these medium . the mind set of the people ha changed variabily in the sense that they shifted their side from buying the required one to the one that were advertised by the celebrity . gone were the day when people used to go outdoor shopping to get the required product . the new era ha just begun through the interenet shopping where it reduces the burden to go out and shop . people can sit in their home and if they find something interesting in the adverstiments they opt to buy it through internet . the previous notion of buying the product based on it requirement and merit ha totally changed . people changed their mind set to buy the product that seemed appealing and interesting in the advertisement . as an example consider the good olden day when there were not many of these advertisement for a product . people used to get a clear understanding of the product they were buying and then opt for that . now a day the scenario ha changed where people buy the product only beacuse their favourite celebrity ha advertised that product . furthermore people are more interested in buying the item his neighbour ha just bought . they consider to be one step higher than them and buy that product even if it is irrelavent to them . in this way mouth to mouth medium created problem . these advertisement are now a day making the product look much more valuable than what they really are . going through various advertisement provided through the communication medium and opting to buy a product is not a wise decission . these advertisement generally hype the product . one come to know the seriousness of the mistake he ha committed in opting for the product with the only impression of the advertisement when once he receives the original product . next time he might be careful enough in selecting the product to buy . so in my opion it is always better to select a product basing on it merit rather than following the advertisement and selecting the product .
