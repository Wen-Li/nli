through the television , nespaper , or on the street we can see any advertisement . and we sometimes feel that advertisement are seem too much better thatn they really are . and that is true . i agree with the statement that most advertisement make product seem much better than the really are . but there is reason for that they need to make advertisement seem much better that real product . for make look better , cheaper , bigger , or useful . i will give you some situation for prove my opinion . for the first situation , when you see advertisement , you could see that they are saying that you will never get this product in this price . but when you are going to the mart , you will feel that their product are not that cheaper than other company product , or sometimes you will see more chaep one . for another situation , when you are driving , you can see the advertisement on the street sometimes . for the example , their is advertisement that advertising a restaurant on the street . usually lot restaurant advertising with their food picture . so they are make you to go their restaurant , and get their food . however , when you go that restaurant , sometimes you feel that their food are much smaller than advertisement . for the last situation , on tv , we can see lot advertisement . we can see same advertisement in same time , same channel everyday . and whenever the company built a new product , they are make new advertisement for their new product , so people are going to buy thier new product . for the example , the cell phone . we can see the verizon , or cingular 's new cell phone every month or two month . and they advertising that their new cell phone is best cell phone in this world . so they made you buy their new cell phone . but two monts later , they made new cell phone which is much better than your cellphone . now , your cell phone is not the best cell phone in this world at all . when you see my statement with these reason , you will feel that most advertisement are seem much better than their real product . but for make people buy their product , they will keep make advertisement that seem much better than they really are .
