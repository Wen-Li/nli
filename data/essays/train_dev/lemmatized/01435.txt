i completly agree with the statement that it is more important for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact . understanding is not only memorizing a fact it is also about interpretating and thinking on what you have learned . understanding allows the student to develop creatity that will lead them the solution to problem they will face in the future . the fact that a student understands a concept or an idea will help him develop the ability to inovate . understanding give anyone the ability to come up with a new and personal solution to a problem or situation . learning and memorizing is the old way of teaching . this method doe not help the student develop ability they have and that they are going to need in the future . learning or memorizing a fact will not allow the student to think or be creative . it only help them adquire new or additional information on a certain topic that they will not be able to use on a different and more adverse scenario . today having the ability to understand and interpretate a concept or an idea ha led to the improvement of process and technique used in many industry . this improvement can be translated into time and price reduction . if student do not have the ability to understand they will not create and inovate and their possibility of success will be narrowed . they will be in a very difficult situation to compete versus those who do have the ability to understand . i definitely agree that it is much more important for student to understand idea or concept than it is for them to lean fact . understanding will led student to have a easier educational career and a more succesfull professional trayectory .
