is our young generation egoistic ? the question is always the same , i think . before i will wrote my answer to this statement , i will ask : had parent the same meaning about the young generation in the 1950s ? i think yes . it is not the time , which make such thing . it is the generation , which make , or here which not make , thing in their community . it wa so and it will be in future . the young generation is not egoistic , it is their lifestyle . if somebody is young , he or she have to meet new people and make new experience . they do n't want to stay at home or in their village . they have to go in the world to see new thing . it is important and so they ca n't help their community , their first and right choice is to help themselves . the right choice i think . but when the young people come back , in their village or in their family , they want to help . in my environment , there is a friendly partnership between the old and young people in my small village . almost all people in my village go to the church on sunday . it is a nice day for everybody and i do n't want to miss it . latest survey show the increase of family value in the last ten year . for most people the family is holy . they defeat them against all . in a communitiy there is the same situation . either they fight against people who want to hurt somebody in the communitiy or they will stand together if somebody is ill . i do n't know how is the situation in south asia , for example , but in my environment the world in complete . here is this statement completly wrong and everybody around me would agree . the sport club , the church club and every other single club in my village have enough people to help . the statement is in my eye only a typical prejudice of old people .
