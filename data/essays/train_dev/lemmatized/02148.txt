throughout the history , there have been many successful people who have tried new thing and taken risk instead of doing what they already know . it is also argued whether the reason of this behavior is . in my opinion , it is fairly true that most of these people do try new thing . the first reason why they try new thing is that they really feel that they are mainly satisfied with the subject they are already specialised in . many scholar point out that the reward obtained , appreciation of public opinion and that person ' s surrounding make this successful person feel that he or she ha done so many thing and accomplished his or her mission . in other word , the main objective that he or she ha aspired to succeed is done and there is no more step to thrive . because we are all human and want to taste the good side of life , we want to be whipped by an external force to continue . that is why people who have already accomplished their objective want to see new one that will keep them fit and ambitious . the second reason why i allege that successful people try new thing is that they want to thrive much complex , hard and far - fetched seemed objective that have not accomplished by someone yet . seeking out a new but also harder aim drive these people to focus on a risk - taking objective . lastly , these people seriously feel that they had to prove everyone that they have not achieved all objective and have made through any hardship by luck ; they have done everything with their own aimable disposition . that is why they want to show their surrounding that even a thrill - seeking and harder objective is not difficult for them . in conclusion , it is vital to note that these successful people have already showed that they are qualified and prosperous ; but they want to achieve a harder one that will keep them striving to succeed another objective and also prove others that the current position of these successful people is not a simple luck .
