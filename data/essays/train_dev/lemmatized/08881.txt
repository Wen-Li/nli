the department i am currently studying ha the policy to encourge all the student to specialize on finance or marketing . the logic behind is that you can not make smart choice if you have le and broad knowledge in a specific topic . i totally agree with the idea that focusing is better . because i believe that you can not talk or make comment about every topic in the world and to specialize encourges you to learn more and make you love the topic . firstly having broad knowledge of many academic subject only give small opinion about them and one can not know the detail . therefore the ability to make comment on the subject and talking about the issue becomes impossible . for instance someone who watched only the teaser of a film only can tell one or two sentence . however a person who watched the film and read many thing from the magazine about the film can make comment or discus about the film . thus the people having le about a topic have not the right to discus about this issue and can not be able to make smart comment . secondly knowing a lot of thing about an issue encourge to learn the topic more and make love the topic . because the beauty hide in the detail . when i start to learn about a topic it always seems to me very boring and hard to understand . however after passing this point and coming to the detail i find this subject more interesting because i start to understand . thus knowing the detail make the subject important for me / to sum up because the policy of my university i am used to focus rather than having broad knowledge . i would like to specialize in one specific subject because of two reason . the first reason is the ability to make comment and discus bout the issue . the second reason is that detail make me love and encouge me to learn about it . focusing is always better than know le but about many subject for me .
