nowsday , some may hold opinion that it is better to have broad knowledge of amny academic subject then to specialize o = in one specific subject . however , others may hold negative opinion about it . as far a i am concerned , i do not agree that it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subject than to specialize in one specific subject . first of all , people will not study very well if they learn many academic subject . because they need to spare their time on so many subject . we all know that the more you spend on doing one thing is better than the le you spend on doing one thing . the result for you spend one hour on study is different from the result for you spend eight hour on study . if you spend more time on one subject , you wil know more about it . but if you spend time on so many subject , you can not deeply learn about them . secondly , if you have one special skill , it is easier for you to find future job . because you have specialize knowledge in one specific subject . many company need people who have special skill . for instance , in canada , it is lack of people who know how to build cable . if a person ha that skill , he ccan easily find a job and get higher pay . however , people who haver broad knowledge of many academic subject can easily find job , such a in the foreign company , they require people to speak 2 or 3 language . tthey may can speak 2 or 3 language , but they may not know how to write them . it is better to have specialize in one specific subject than broad knowledge of many academic subject . people can learn very well in one subject rather than in many subject .
