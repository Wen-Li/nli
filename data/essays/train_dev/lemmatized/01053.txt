in the world , people generally like to travelling different country . therefore , people are different because some people like travelling alone but some people like travelling in a group led by a tour guide . i can prefer to travel in group led by a tour guide because firstly , a tour guide know everywhere and secondly , while travelling , people have to make communication together . a tour guide ha to know everywhere because if i am going to somewhere with this guide , i have to trust . in fact , if dont know somewhere , i can apply a tour in order to go somewhere . of course , there are many advantage of going somewhere with the tour guide . morever , this person know where we ha to visit such a historical place and introduces this city with a lot of true information . for example , when i went to fethiye in turkey , we had a tour guide and we travelled somewhere and he introduced historical information about this city . as a result , i had a lot of information and offered my friend and family . in fact , going to somewhere is better with the tour guide . there are many people so a to go somewhere with a tour . therefore , people 's communication skill can refine because they will introduce many people and of course , while travelling , people can talk together and this is so different from going to somewhere alone . moreover , people need to go sowhere and in this tour , while people are talking , they can mention about their life and family . for instance , when i went to england with the tour , i had a lot of friend because in this tour , there wa a same age group and we talked about this city , our life and this city 's people . as a result , i always chat this people in msn and sometimes i can meet them . \ to sum up , if i want to go somewhere , i can choose a tour because my first reason is that this guide know everwhere and i have many idea about this city . my second reason is that i can develop my communication skill and have new friend .
