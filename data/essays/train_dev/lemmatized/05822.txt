eventhougth , some people think that it is better to have broad knowledge of many subject rather than to specialize in one specific subject ; there are other people that think it is more important to have a huge knowledge about one specific topic . based on my own experience , i can said it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subject , so i agree with the statement . i have been working in a big oil company since 2000 and in these time i could do a lot of thing and i learned a lot of thing of many subject . in fact i am geophycis and i am going to do a master in business next year and it is a result that in these six year i did a lot of different thing in a different position in my company . i think that if i can do a master in business i will have more skill in order to reached a good position into my company because i will do the same work that i am used to do , but in addition i will be prepared to face a different challenge . i am sure that is better have knowledge of different academic subject because this give u the skill to do a lot of different work , it is very important in a world where the technology are changing very fast , and where it is difficult to know how the reality can change so it is neccesary to be prepared for these change moreover to have the skill to survive into a competitive world . in conclusion i strongly agree with the idea that is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subject because in this way we can have a open vision about any problem and we have more skill in order to survive in a competitive world .
