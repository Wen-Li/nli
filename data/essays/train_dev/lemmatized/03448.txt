i agree with the people now is very busy to think about to offer some help . it is very important to understand that today the world is very competitive , and young people have to be dedicated on his learning , developing their skill and improving their capacity to answer the demand of new professional . however is truth that exist another kind of people that are very comprometive with the situation of the others and the mayority of this person are young people . this world is very complicated and is very difficult to achieve the individual goal . people have to work very hard , they do not have any time to breath , to stop and to think in another situation . the life is taugh and they have to give an answer about what is their role today . people try to have success , try to demostrate their worth and work to be the best . they have to study , next to find a good job and to survive into this competitive world . them they have very tired to spend their time in another task . they do not have too much time and they know it . however today the thing have been changed . actually young people , start to be more compromited with helping their community . they use to take part in different event , and participate in various association . there are alot of people developing job that have very relation with voluntary activity . the reality of this time is that there are people who want to colaborate and serve . i think that today beging to be a new kind of people , vey responsible with the social situation and very identified with teh situation of another people .
