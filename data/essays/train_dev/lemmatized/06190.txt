the question of wheter we should have general knowledge of many academic area than specific knowledge in just one area is interesting one . of course , there is no simple answer to this problem . however , personally , i think that we have to take broad knowledge from many subject . firstly , general knowledge is connected with total context of science . in spite that we have very good specific knowledge in one subject , if we do not understand the role and value of that knowledge in the science , we can not use that understanding or skill freely . secondly , it mean helpful for explaining to people that academist have a lot of knowlege without his or her major . for example , if he or she is not only specialist but also person who have many understanding other topic , that person can explain the academic knowledge to use many interesting example . this fact make u understand that having various broad knowledge help to realize and solve the difficult problem to ordinary people . finally , that academist can explain the complexed quetion easily by using a lot of example form his broad knowledge point out the possibility of inter-academic communication . one example of this is the subject of cultural study in u.k . . sometimes , the scientist of this area have many knowlege to sociology , and there is very good explain in university . therefore , i agree that it is better to take general knowledge of lot of academic area than to specialize in one specific area . as i see it ,
