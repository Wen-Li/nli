i do agree with the statement that most advertisement make product seem much better than they really are . advertisements are produced to promote a product and to make it sell better . so what do we do if we want people to buy our product ? we try to tell them that our product is the best choice on the market , which is maybe not true , but people need to believe it to chose our product . that is the reason why many advertisement make to seem their product much better than they actually are . in our every day life we are confronted with many example . my favourite example are the washing powder advertisement on television . would n't it be wonderful to put your clothes in the washing machine and when taking them out again , all the ugly stain are gone and the clothes look newer than before ? i have tried several time , but it just doe not work . so there the advertisement definitely make the washing powder much better than it is . another product which ha to be incredible according to advertisement , are energy bar for sport . you do not only get an unhuman power and condition , but the bar turn your outer appearance into an athlete 's body . `` this is much cheaper than the fitness studio '' , i thought and tried . but again i wa disappointed . neither did my condition improve , nor did my body shape change . disillusioned about advertisement promise i resigned , until recently , when i heard ovomaltine 's new publicity . the advertisement of the chocolate powder to flavour your milk , doe not claim to make you stronger , but more enduring . it say : `` ovomaline - not better , but longer . '' so this is the one and only exception i have seen in my life , where advertisement doe not make a product seem much better than it is .
