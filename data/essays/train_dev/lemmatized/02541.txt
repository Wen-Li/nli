i agree that a person who want to be succesfull in his life must have a broad knowlegde of a vast majority of academic subject . first of all when a person is in the process of having a coversation with any one he will have an idea of what to talk about during there discussion . for example if you were taking to your dad 's freind who is a doctor that is specialised in the heart it would be useful to have some background of how the heart function and it stucture . it could also prove useful a genaral knowledge during day to day activity . for example if you were asked to buy a certain product at a supermarket you would need to know how to determine whether this particular product is benefcial or not . this could be achieved if the basic knowledge of business study is available to you . it could also help in your scocial life by allowing be to become more closer towards you . this mean that you would be able to gain and select form a larger range of people to become your friend . being specailised on certain area sometimes promotes bordem due to every day repetion of task . having a broad knowledge of many academic subject also ha some disadvantage to it . firstly it promotes unspecialisation in people since they only have minmal knowledge in a certain subject . it also resricts a person from having a job were he is good at and is specialised at . it also make a person seem unprofessional since he ha no real skill to give to the working world and society itself therefore he/she ha no contribution . also people who are specialised most of the time obtain a higher salary than people who are not professional or specialised .
