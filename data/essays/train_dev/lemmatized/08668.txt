i strongly agree that it is more important for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact . the society rapidly change , fact will be someday outdated and not important when other fact show up . therefore , understanding idea and concept is the best method to help student think abstractly and creatively . for example , in the car show , people would like to preform their ideal concept car to give new insight to company and customer the trend of the society flow . no matter the reliability and feature of the car , people have to think critically how the next step will be . if people just follow the stopped fact , people would not have new idea to create and the society will not easily grow . fact is just let people know that people need to be aware without making the same mistake and error . in childhood , student have to learn art , math , music , and science subject to help student increase insight and be abstract . understanding idea and concept can be used permanently , but fact is not . in some condition , fact is more important when student make mistake . teacher give either reinforcement and punishment to stop student ' behavior and help them create thought . in the fast-paced society , people everyday is struggling the meaning of life . for instance , money , realionship , culture , and safety are all meanful in human being . this is a fixed fact . however , anything that give meaning to human being before fact would be idea and concept . students will not know what love and money mean until the day they learn and experience , and then one day become their own fact . as a result , in the twentieth century , to go a step further , people have to understand idea and concept and ignore the previous fact in oder to create new insight to contribute the modern society
