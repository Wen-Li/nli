no , i not really agree about this statement . i think that , in twenty year , the number of car in use will be increase in the world . but i think the increase will be le important in the developped country . in fact , in each developed country , the increase of car is already done . .. for exemple , in france , it wa during the 70 , with the background of the economic increase , the unemployement rate wa very down . the french people bought a lot of car during this period . almost 40 year later , french people buy still car . .. but in general , it s to replace the oldest . they just change the model of their car . now , each member of the family had his car . .. the wife and the husband , the young adult boy or girl . .. it s the same in america , in great britain , ... in the developped country . so , in fact , in twenty year , i think that in the developped country there will be fewer car in use than tere are today . but in the other country of the world , it s not the same situation . i think that in the country on the way of the economic increase , the number of car will strongly increase . for exemple , china , the country that everybody is talking about and which is going to become one of the most important enconomic country in the world in a very short moment . the actuel economic increase in china
