one of the major problem of ` homo-urbanis ' , that is , the human being living in urban area , is transportation . with each day , our road are becoming crammed with an increased number of car and our air being infused with higher density of vehicular pollution . obviously there is a limit to how much our infrastructure can support . what happens when there are so many car on the road that there is no more place to move ? that is a rather scary vision . however , it may well be that the number of car on the road twenty year from now will actually be le than what it is today . is n't that a rather exaggerated claim ? after all , even if the world population stabilizes a the estimate have indicated , it will still be much larger than what it is today . and with increased economic prosperity , more and more people can be expected to own more and more car . true . however , if the current trend are any clue , the number of car should nevertheless reduce . first of all , many country , especially developing nation with large population , are rapidly developing their public transport system to tackle the problem of urban transportation . public transport system are not only more cost effective , they also ensure a better quality of living by eliminating traffic jam and exposure to vehicular pollution . therefore , it will not really be surprising if more and more people take to public transport a the primary mean of moving about . second , fuel price are expected to rise heavily in next twenty year a world oil reserve get delpleted . in such a scenario , it will be much more economical for people to use public transportation system . such trend are already showing in country like india . the delhi metro is a success story that well illustrates the point . with high quality service available at low price , even the rich and affluent of delhi prefer to keep their car at home and use the metro when they need to travel to the crowded area of the city . rapid bus transit systems introduced in city like indore and bhopal are becoming increasingly popular amongst citizen . thus , the day may not be far when you might be the only person driving on the road ! in fact , if one want a better quality of living for one and all , one should actually hope that it happens .
