some people say successful people try new thing and take risk . it is true because when a person start to do new thing he/she can keep attention from the others which help to keep him/her high motivation , make own rule instead keep trucking somebody 's old theory , and also have more chance to be a successful person . first , when a person start the new thing usually the other people keep on eye on him/her . it really help to the pioneer to keep their motivation level in the high . the long term high level motivation led them to successful people . second , if a person start new thing there is no rule from the past . it indicates that the frontier can make their own rule for their work . it is really necessary fact that to start new thing because normaly the basic rule , made by somebody else , are preventing the procced thinking . third , the risk taker can get more oppotunities to be a successful person . risk taker can more chance than the others because if there is a risk lot of people prevent the risk and go on the easier way . hence , under the risk there are more oppotunities and chance to be a successful person . in conclusion people who do not care about risk and willing to do new thing might have more oppotunities to be a successful person . for example , our ancient edison said new theory at his time . he seems failed at that time but actually in 21 century he is well known for a successful person over the world . there are lot of risk when person start new thing , but a person should not give up to go on it . otherwise he/she can not be a successful peson . whoever want to be a success try new thing . it work
