i am kind of disagree with this statement . i agree that to understand idea and concept are important , but to learn fact are also important . by understanding idea and concept student learn how fact take place . it is not just once you understand idea , you do need to worry about how fact happen . for example , my professor explained the process of the earthquack . she briefly described each and every detail about it . now i know how do earthquack happen , but what if i do not know the fact of it . how can i prove my concept about the earth quack , if i do not have the specific example . if i said that there are earthquack happen in indonesia , and explain these are the reason this happen over there more often , then i support my statement . my fact support my concept and idea . happning of the earthquack in indonesia is a fact . i need to know it to understand my concept better . facts are important in order to understand the concept . you can not say that fact doe not worth it . without fact no concept and no idea take place . facts are the life of the concept . one more example here is that country in sourthern hemishphere have warmer climate and country in northern hemisphere have cooler climete . how can i proove this statement ? i will give all my geographic reason and explanation . how can i proove all my geographic reason ? now to have fact is important . if i say that united states is in northern hemishphere and that is why it is having cloor climate , and shri lanka is in southern hemisphere and that is why it is having warmar climate . this is the fact . my fact support my argument . fact are important to proove your statement . you can not just state something and agree with it without giving specific reason and example . basically , the fact are a important a concept and idea . they both are equal . none of them is more important than the other .
