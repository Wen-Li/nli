the fact that the number of car in use in the world ha increased a lot since their invention is of course not discussed . but one can really ask himself if there will be more of fewer automobile in twenty year . despite the fact that we can truly believe , for several reason , there will be fewer car , i personally think there will exist more car in use in twenty year than there is today . the main reason of this theory are , first , that people had , have , and will always love car . second , an automobile is too useful for disappering from the surface of the planet . third , the law against pollution are not very effective . first of all , people have deeply loved car since the beginning , and there is no real reason why it will suddenly stop . cars carry an image of wealth and happiness . it could also be part of certain dream and fantasy since they were often use in movie , for example . moreover , a car is fondamentally very helpful . it is a convenient way of transportation , a very flexible one . my opinion is that there is not any other invention , to date , that allow people to decide to leave a spot for another one and go off immediately . i bet there will not be one either in the next decade . another example of the usefulness of the automobile is that you can put more personal stuff in it than when you travel by plane or by train for instance . finally , the political battle led against car pollution did not permit the number of car to dicrease . thus , i think this uneffectiveness will continue in the future . for example , if it is true that people driving car in mexico have to pay more tax , it is still the most polluted city in the world , because of number of car in use in this town is still the same . i think this will also continue in twenty year . to sum up , there will be probably not be fewer car in use in twenty year because of the three major reason i expressed . but , of course , it is only a guess , since nobody , can really predict future
