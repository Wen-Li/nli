`` do advertisement make product semm much better than the really are ? '' i agree that most advertisement do so . sicen this topic is acontroversial issue , i suppose that different people have different idea on it . some people may think it is not true because almost all advitisement are through tv program or picture . they tell u the real figure of a project . so the people wonder how the picture of a product become better of their looking than it really is . however , those who think so downplay or overlook the following three important point . first , generally speaking , the role of advertisement is to make the good impression of the product for cunstermer . without thes effect , advertisement are not ` advertisement ' in the real meaning . apart form the wrong advertisement , almost all one make product seem much better than they really are . second , i have the experience of buying a product by being derived by the advirtisement . i bought a pc , but it wa not the one i wanted . this show that the look of the product that i saw at the tv program wa different from the real one . this is the way to sell a product , and it is the real role of advertisement . third , a i mentioned , some people may believe that tv program and picture image the real aspect of a product . however it is false . in the process of making advertisement , maker use several kind of scientific method in order to make custermers believe that the product is realy good . that is , they change apearrence of the product , and give u the good impression on it . by using the effet , like visional effect , the maker make the unreal image of the product . the aforementioed three reason are persuasive . therefore , i agree that most advertisement make product semm much better than the really are
