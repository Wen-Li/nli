as far a trying new thing and take risk is concerned , it is really difficult to do something you do not know but you can say you are really brave when you have tried doing a much a you can . i 'm not a person who is looking forward to make new experience , i mean if i have to choose whether to follow a new way or the path i know , i thik i will probably go through the way i have already experienced . but it is not the right choice . take risk is like growing up facing a situation you have never experienced . as a matter of fact you can always learn something by doing new thing . people who do not try something new are probably not sure about what kind of person they really are . they may think they are not strong enough to succed in new situation . so they continue to live a they do and they do not take risk . what these people do not understand is that they should try doing new thing beacuse it is not something that is limited to people who have succeded in whatever they have done . on the contrary their success is may be related to the fact of trying something new . as i wrote before people who make new experience are brave but it doe not mean that they are successful . so everyone should take risk because it make you learn something either you will succed or not in what you try .
