i think there will not be fewer car in use than there are today in twenty year . cars in use will be increaced . because population of human will be still incerased in twenty year and technology will be still developing , too . it is true that there are many car in use in the united states , england , france , japan and so on , but for example , most people in china ride bicycle to go to their office or school . i think the price of car is so expensive that they can not buy car . if the tecnology of making car develop in this twenty year , the price of car would be lower . so people who can not buy car now will be able to buy car . and the number of car in use will be increaced , i think . some people would say that car are bad for environment of the earth , and it is true , i think . but i hope that the technology of eco would develop , and we would be able to have `` eco car '' , which have no badly influence on environment of the earth . and , many people say that their hobby is driving . it is because car are private room for driver , i think . when i feel sad or when i have problem , i want to drive to be relax and reflesh . so , if the train or aeroplane were more comfortable and usuful , people would not take their car away . cars are not only traffic tool but also `` oasis '' for people . these are the reason why i think there will not be fewer car in use than there are today in twenty year .
