being able to speak about everything , even just a little , is a very attracting idea . however , i disagree with the statement beside . in my opinion , if on one hand people knowing the main issue of many major topic can be useful , on the other hand we still need very qualified people in very specific field . particularly in politics , it is useful to have elected people who are able to take into account and to pay attention to a large panel of issue . their role will be to look at the pro and the con and to decide . someone who is working hard on a topic might become unable to keep a clear sight of the whole situation . he or she might be likely to support his or her point . i think that it is the same at a smaller level . in a firm or in an association for instance , a person with a large knowledge is important to drive the whole structure toward the right way trying to define consistent decision . however , we still need specialized employee and manager . consequently , student who want to get a very specific training are very useful a well . these people are the base of many domain of our society because they are able to give very precise specific . when a manager or a director ha to take a decision , he or she will ask advice to expert . if nobody wa able to bring detailled answer , we zould live in a very syuperficial world . in conclusion , i think that both are very useful
