i think it is more important for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact . first of all , if we do n't understand idea and concept , it is difficult to have good view about fact . that mean we ca n't have our own idea and opinion . therefore , even though we can remember the fact at the time for test , it is easy to forget the fact . for example , when i wa a university student , i majored in chemical engineering . there are a lot of concept and idea about principle of nature . it could be impossible to memorize them . however , i tried to memorize them for test because i did n't study hard . as a result , i do n't have any knowledge about chemical engineering now . but many friend who tried to understand idea and concept still remember many principle of chemical engineering and they are still using their knowledge to their job very efficiently . whenever i see them , i envy them . i regret i just memorized fact without understanding idea and concept . second , if we only learn fact without understanding idea and concept , we are hard time adopting our knowledge to other area . in other word , learning fact is only for test , not for real situation . if we face with same question that we have learned , we would solve them and manage them well . however , if we face with different question even though the concept of it is same , we could not solve those question because we have n't seen them before . this problem will happens because we do n't understand the fact correctly by only learning fact , we do n't have our own idea and opinion about them . that 's why we could n't solve them . in conclusion , when we are in lecture , we will learn a lot of fact which are involved in the lecture and then we must understand the idea and concept about the lecture . it is important to have correct view of them .
