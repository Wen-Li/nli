i totally agree with the statement that `` young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communties '' . there are three reason why i believe so in term of vote rate , improvement of the technology and urbanization . first , young people , especially in my country , tend to avoid to participate in politics . even though it should be essential right and duty for the people to attend vote , the rate of voting is decreasing year by year . young people seems busy to work and play and they are losing interest to politics . second , obviously , the number of the young people who do not know how to communicate with others is increasing . it is said that the distribution of computer game and improvement of networking such a internet cause the problem . people no longer need to go out to find someone who would make conversation with him/her because they not only can `` talk '' but also can play with their friend online . although technoligy enables interactive communication , such thing are not literal `` communication '' . young people should go out and see many people otherwise they lose ability to communicate and they will never find the way to contribute to their society . \ third , urbanization is also one of the factor . recently , most area in the developed country are urbanized . even in the country side , young people try to move to city and the average year of country side area are increasing . however , there are traditional community and older people have wisdom based on their experience . in contrast , there is no `` community '' in the city and no one would tell young people valuable thing .
