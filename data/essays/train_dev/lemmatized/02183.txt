taking risk and trying new thing are important factor in order to be successful . however , it is equally important to be sensible at the same time in order to achieve something . one the one hand , only people who are willing to try something new and to take risk can stand out and do better than their competitor . it is neccessary for people who want to have success to believe in their idea and to be self-confident . a person that never dare something will most probably not be very successful . today , innovation is very important but always connected to a certain risk a well . e.g. launching a new product can fail completely , costing a lot of money and it might even lead to a company 's bankrupcy . however , if it is successful , the profit of the innovation is usually higher than the profit of product that have been established on the market for a long time . only company that come up with innovation regularly are competitive and able to maintain thier market share . one the other hand , people who do not know when to stop often risk a lot . if the risk is to high , it is better not to take it . to my mind , it is sometimes better to stand still than to risk losing everything . if something is not very likely to be successful , it is a very important characteristic of a person in a high position to decide against it . furthermore , it is not always neccessary to do new thing if the `` old one '' work well . in conclusion , i agree that people trying new thing and daring thing are often more successful because one can only stand out in today 's society by differentiating from the others . this is very important since success is defined by doing better than the average . nevertheless , i believe that it is very important to know , when something is too risky . only people who balance these to factor well will be really successful .
