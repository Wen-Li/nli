i think that both of these option are very important for a student . of course , it depends on what is your field of study . for this reson i would say that i desagree with this statement . for example if you are studing history , is much more important to learn the fact and the date of the history passage , than you have to understand idea and concept , but of shure this is also a very important knowledge that is required you , a historical , to have . is really very important , infact a student is studing for this reason , to understand idea and concept of what are you studing but i ca n't say that this is more important than learn fact , because without the knowledge of the fact you ca n't say that you have studied something . i 'm thinking about when i wa studing mathematik : for me and also for the teacher wa very important that we , a student , had understud the idea and concept behind an algebric formulation , but of shure you need to know very well also the formulation itself . an other reson why i disagree with the statement is that if you are a student you have to learn everything that they are explaining in the lecture or that you read in the text book , you ca n't say at any time that you have studied this or that fact but you do n't remeber the fact : i 'm thinking at some friend of me that they study something and after a few hour you can ask them somethink and they do not remember anythink , exept the main idea . to the other side i think that is important in the future , i mean after 10 or more yars after your study , to remeber the main idea and concept ; and is quite impossible to remember all the learned fact . at the and i wont to say that i desagree with this statement but depends a lot on wich is your field of study and in wich time proyection ar you looking for .
