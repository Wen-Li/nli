we often hear the word `` neet '' in japan , neet is the person who ha only part time job or do not have job . i have some friend who are neet . they have free time , so they can enjoy life without thinking time or date . now , i am a graduate student . i work for my laboratory from early morning to late at night everyday . i am busy everyday , so i am always thinking that i want to have a rest . for me , i sometimes envy neet 's life because they have freedom . however , i do n't think that it is good that young people enjoy life more than older people do . i have 2 reason . first , young people need a lot of money if they want to enjoy life a older people . but in most case , many young people earn so much money . if they get money from their parent , i think they should not enjoy life a older people . the money that older people use their to enjoy life is earned by themselves . but the money that young people use is not ! i think that it is very hard to earn money by themselves . when we realize it , we know the importance of money and we appreciate money . if they use a lot of money without knowing it , it is very dangerous . second , i think that we work so hard when we are young . when we are young , we can move freely . when we are young , it is better that we enjoy only to do thing we are young . when we get older , it is hard to move , and they can not get le knowledge than we get . so i think that young people enjoy thing we can do only when we are young . for these reason , i disagree with the statement .
