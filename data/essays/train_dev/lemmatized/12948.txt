in my opinion , the best way of traveling is in a group led by a tour guide . because in this way , traveler who come to the unknown area can do sightseeing whrere is not only popular shop and building , but also picked up place by tour conductor who know all this place , and do not careful for dangour of the area . traveler may not lost their way . if i had been in situation making traveling plan , i should have confused . in contrary , they can not make the plan for traveling by themself . if they would have thinking the place and building they want to go like clearly . in addition to , they may lose oppotunity like meeting with native and local people . therefore i think the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide .
