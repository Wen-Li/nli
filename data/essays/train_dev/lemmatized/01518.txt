i think the most advertisement are made to look the product much better than they really are . they make the ad or tv commercial intensionally attract the customer by emphasizing a certain poing of product . typical example is , i think , an advertisement of car . one commercial that i felt like i missed the poing wa the one ; a man at the groccary casher look at what he wa going to buy and what the other man is going to . he got vegitables and a pack of big in tofu in his cart and the other man ha huge bulk of beef . after that he rush into a car dealere and buy a big car . an impression that i had from this tv commercial is , `` get a big car , get your dignity . '' but the car eats gas like a monster . in these day , especiall after the midle-east crisis , the gas efficiency is one of the most important element when you choose which car you perchase . more people concern about efficiency much more they used to before . i believe that the car company ought to forcus on what the era require them to make and respond what poeple need . the ad doe n't show anything like that but encourage people to reverse the flow of the current . we , comsumers need to be smart enough to read what they show and what they hide behind the advertisement .
