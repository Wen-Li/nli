i disagreee with the idea that young people enjoy life more than older people do . ther main reason i support the idea are time and money . first of all , we the youg have to do thing to do even though we do not want to do . for example , high school student have to go to the school everyday , or do homework of their dislike subject . on the other hand , the elderly can spend their time on way their own . nobody blame their way of using their spare time . secondly , older people have money that thay have earned for a long time . they can travel with their close friend or neighbor , or start the second business spending those money . however , youg people ha limitation of their money , because most of their money come from their parent . it make them think about on what they they should spend money , in short , thay can not afford to travell abroad . another reason is satisfaction and comfortablness . elderly people who had finish the role a a worker are confident to their skill that ha supported thair country 's industry . at the same time , they might feel camfortable with the dedication . these feeling make them happy , so they can enjoy the rest of their life . in contrast , the young always feel uncomsortable , and are under the pressure from their parent or teacher . they they think thay have to do manything to their country or family . it cause mental problem . for those reason , i think older people enjoy life than young people .
