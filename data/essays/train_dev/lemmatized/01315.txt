i agree the following statement `` it is more important for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact . '' i really think it is more impotant to learn the idea and the concept more than the fact . students need a lot of idea to grow not only their body , but their inside such a opinion and the way they think . i am not saying that to learn fact is not important , but i think it is more important to learn idea and concept . i think fact come from idea and concept . if there is no fact , there would not be any fact in my opinion . so i think student need to learn about the fact and concept and then learn about the fact . if they learn the fact first it would be difficult to understand why it happened or why it became like that . today , the office and the company look for the idea and how creative are the people when they hire new staff . you might learn some idea or the way it is , but if you learn idea it woud give you more fact and how it is . i believe that both are important but it is more important to learn about idea and concept today . facts might be more important to some other kind of job , but i think most of the job need more idea and concept than fact . in the old day they might needed more fact instead of idea and concept , but today , it is more important to learn about idea and concept to improve your opinion and what you believe . finally i think it is important to learn both `` idea and concept '' and `` facts. '' but fact need some idea and idea and concept cause fact . it mean they both need each other and people need to learn both . if you learn just either one it would not do any good , but i think student shoud learn about idea and concept more than fact .
