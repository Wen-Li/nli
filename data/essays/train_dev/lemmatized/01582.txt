before deciding which side i will stand , i would like to querry what is defined a successful people . if successful people mean people who made a big advance in our life , i agree that successful people try new thing and take risk . however , if successful people mean people who live well doing their job well , i think successful people are those who only do what they already know how to do well . first , you should know the history of human 's first exploration of the moon . i think the people who were involved in that momentous event are those who are successful . unless did they plan to travel to the moon and enact their plan , we could have made no progress in our knowlege of the universe and our technology in relaion to aironaut . with respect to human knowlege advance , i believe that successful peopel are those who try to do what ha not been done . second , i even can observe how people move towards what they want . for example , my husband make seemingly unfeasible thing possible . when he face a barrier , such a dealine , facility unavailities , and job opening , he try evey mean . he call to company that do not announce any jod \ b opening . but , he advertise himself and get a position . he enjoys his way of life , which seems to make him a a successful person . however , i also can find people who life well without a big challenge . for example , medical doctor seem to live well following well-defined path . although they have to study had in roder to get into a medical school , i think they do not have to try new medical procedure . on the ready-established path , they are considered a successful people . in sum , it is difficult to devide people into successful and unsuccessful people according to whether they try new thing and take risk or not . rather than , i think successful peole could be defined according to whether individual life the way of life they value . if a person who pursues taking a risk life by trying new opportunity , he would be a successful person . if a person who pursue a challenge life in a way that is already established , he would not be considered a a successful person .
