i agree with the statement and i do think understanding idea and concept is really important for student . and i have three reason . first , it 's quite necessary to understand the idea and knowledge when student first learn them . in this way they learn more effectively than simply memorize the fact we come across . also , a good understanding of the knowledge would help student recall what they learned before . if the study is all about reciting and memorizing , there would be not a better student than a computer . second , a my teacher always told me that student should learn `` how to learn '' , rather than gain the knowledge only . and believe that 's the real purpose of education , to teach the student how to think and solve new problem they will meet in the future . my high school could be a bad example . when i studied there , although my teathers told me it wa important to know how to learn , cared too much about memorizing . it wa indicated in the exam . in order to get a good mark of the examination , all we should do is to copy the fact into our mind . what 's worse , the process of study wa so fast that we could n't have time to have a good thinking about the idea . as a result , i only can remember a few of the thing i learned from the high school textbook now . in addition , to understand and take a deeper thinking of what we learn is the way how we 've developed our culture from the very beginning ! it 's the way we gain the knowledge from the people before and create new idea of our own . image if all the student do n't learn how to understand and how to thinking deeply , how would be the future society like ? ! in a word , the way i see it , it 's not only important but also fairly necessary for student to understand idea and think more about what they learn .
