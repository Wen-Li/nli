some people would like to travel by themseleves , while other prefer to travel in a group led by a tour guide . of course , there are some benefit of each side ; however i would like to travel by myself especailly when i have a long trip so i do n't agree with that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide . because it ha no pravicy and inconvenient . first , i would like mention that the best way to travel in a group led by a tour guide is actually not because of it invonvenience . several year ago , i went to austarila for traveling by myself . i visited so many famous place in big city and also went to non-famous area in such small town . bascially i could go wherever i want to go and do whatever i want to do . due to the fact that i do n't need to think about the schedule of tour guide . if i wa in a group led by a tour guide , i had to follow the schedule . besides , something that i want to visit or do may not be part of the tour . second , the best way to travel is not good because i do n't have much free time and pravicy . for instance , when i visit a certain place that i may want to spend more time . if you travel in a group , there is le free time and pravicy . in addition to , you will have to follow the rest of your group in conculsion , if you want to travel in freely whatever you would like to do and visit without concerning the tour schecule or time , in my opinion , the best way to travel in group led by a tour guide is not good . since we wo n't get much free time , pravicy and tour in a group is inconvenient so i would rather have a trip alone eventhough there are a few advantage of group tour .
