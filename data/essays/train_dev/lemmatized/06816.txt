i agree with the statement that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their community . in my opinion , this is because of the change and developement of our sosiety . in the past , a lot of people had done agricultural industry , which need a lot of help and group work . farmers need to help each other to gather the crop and raise thgem . however , a our industires develop , a lot of people started to have service industry or manufacture . which requires le help , and more competition among the individual . because of these , a lot of young people seems to forget about the importance of helping their comminities and care only about themselves . these industrial change also changed young people 's opinion . long time ago , many people thought that it 's their duty to help each others . however , many young people now a day think it is waste of time and money to give even little help to their community with out reward . for example , long time ago , if we had poor neighbore who is having a hard time , a lot of people tried to help them with out expecting the reward . however , lot of poor in our community suffer because no one voluntear to help them . because of the change of the opinion , a lot of young people are neglecting to do even small act to help ous community . urbanization had a lot of thing in our community , including the opinion of the people . as our society started to require more and more competition to survive , a lot of people think that the most important thing for them is to care about themselves and success . because there 's to many people who do not even practice simple act to help our society , i sometime feel like no one is caring about our community .
