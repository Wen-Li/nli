i disagree with that young people enjoy life more than older people do . there are three reason . first , older people have much time than young people because after older people retired thier job , they can enjoy the second life slowly . when they were working , they were so busy that they could not do what they want to . besides , they could not take many vacation . they can do thing which they could not do when they were working because they have a lot of time . however , young people do n't have a lot of time . they have to go to school or work . students have exam . they are recqired to study harder and harder for exam . second , they have more money than young people . when they were working , they would save money for their future . they can buy what they want , go where they want to and eat what they want to . finally , of course older people have experienced a lot of thing . they know what they should do when a problem happens . they also know how to avoid a problem . they would experience hard thing that a if it seemed that they could not solve the problem , but young people have not experienced such a thing yet . even if young people have experienced such a thing , the number would much le than those of older people .
