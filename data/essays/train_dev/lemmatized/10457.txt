when it come to choosing whether you prefers broad range of knowledge or just one specialized knoweldge , there could be a lot of opinion just a different stroke for different folk . some of my opposite number would try to win me over by saying ` one specialized knowledge is better ' . they would come up understandable reason like ` if you tried to learn a lot of thing at one time it will simply overwhelm your self and you may not be able to master just one knowledge pluently ' . their reason is quiet acceptable and very tempting however if i am allow to choose one treasure from the various shiny one i would claim my prize by saying ` i think it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subject ' . there are various reason to support my idea . first our life are limited to short period and we can not turn it back or reset it like a computer . so what i figure is if you have limited time to learn might a well learn much stuff a possible . the second reason is that we are living in fast evolving society and i think the era of one speciallized knowledge is over . people with broad range of knowledge are treated more nicer than people who just specialized in one academic subject . let me give you one example . in our country it is very hard to get a reliable job . we have to faster than others , smater than others , even richier than others . at the time like this specializing one academic subject is like a sucide attempt because job are limited and company are looking for more intelligent people . come to think of it the idea which my opposite number are suggesting is very reasonable . but i think what they are claming is kind of far from the reality . besides i do n't think my opinion is not a far cry from the given subject nethier . so in conclusion i think it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subject is better than to have just one specialized academic subject .
