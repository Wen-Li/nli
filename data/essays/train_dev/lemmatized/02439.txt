i do n't agree that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide . when you travel in a group led by a tour guide , you may feel safe because you can not lost your way in a where you are not familiar with . on the other hand , if you travel in a group led by a tour guide , you may not have the access to the place where you really desire to go because you have mere free time to travel freely . you will feel like you were bound with somthing . for example , you are going to the kind of place of interesting , such a holy tibet , you can only enjoy yourself in a quite situation , watching the chiru running over the great grassland . the tour guide 's word will sometime become a kind of disturbing . sometimes , even there is no need to follow a tuor guide . for instance , if you go to hong kong , which is extremely narrow but is famous for it disneyland and the famous good in low price during the end of the year , you can spend a joyful holiday with a tour map , benefiting from the highly developed transpotation . third , you may feel very tired when you travel in a group led by a tour guide because the schedule is very fasten . you may travel in the car during the night to get to another place that you will visit the next so that you can not get good rest in the night . finally , i suggest that those who have the ability to travel by yourself do not travel in a gruop led by a tuor guide .
