specializing in one specific subject might be considered more like a person that can do better work than a person with broad knowledge due to the deepness they have in their own field of education . however i think that broadly educated people are more useful and well made because of the trend of the present society and how the mind of an normal person work . first , the society these day require a wide range of knowlege . that is because almost every work done by people ha something to do with other subject . except for some exception such a researching something scientificaly . for example people who learned only about managment do not understand other affair that well even though those affair are essential to business such a law and other stuff like that . for an another example , when someone want to make a website on the internet , he or she need lot of area of education such a design , computer using , and some other thing . secondly , a person 's mind is n't appropriate for doing something that is same over and over again . the person will think the subject a a boring subject after a bit of time flow . it 's like eating the same thing over and over again , and it wo n't be efficient compared to studying some subject widely . think of studying math for four year and not anything else . it will be real frustrating . but if she or he study something else when he get boring about studying the same subject , that will refresh him and let him study math some other day with a replenished mind . in conclusion , i think that it is better to have a wild field of knowledge rather than to concentrate on one subject too much . that is because the world need it is better for studying effeciently .
