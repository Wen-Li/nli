learning fact make the student to understand idea easily . facts act a a foundation to any subject . any subject lie in the boundary of fact . so i think that leaning fact improves the ability of a student to understand the idea and learn the concept . water change it state from one form to another form i.e water is a liquid state and ice is a solid state of water and this is considered a a fact . if student are not aware with this fact how can they understand the concept of transforming the state of water and method used to transform . the student can not understand or develop the idea of changing the state of the water . when the foundation of the building is not laid properly then it collapes a the time pass . in the same way if the student are not perfect in the basic concept of the theory they my face problem when they go deeper into their subject . understanding idea and concept come into picture if the student is perfect with their basic , those are fact . when the student want to develop new idea or concept they should check whether their concept obey the fact proposed earlier in that feild . when a new concept or theory is proposed , it is accepted by the people only if it obeys the basic rule . the concept is verfied by testing it at several condition and is checked whether the concept obeys the basic fact at all condition . the concept is then accepted if it satisfies the condition . facts are never misleaded but idea have a chance to mislead or can be proved wrong at different condition , but fact can not be changed or misleaded at any cost . facts are a true a the earth is sperical , but in ancient time a concept of earth being flat wa proposed , later it proved wrong and a fact that the earth is sperical wa stated . thus learning fact play an important role in learning than understanding idea and concept .
