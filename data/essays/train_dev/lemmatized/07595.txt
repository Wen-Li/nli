instead of having broad knowledge of many academic subject , i prefer to become an specialist in one specific subject . of course , this decision depends on each person and the enviroment where he use this knowledge . when you study several subject , you manage to achieve a quality of education that let you be useful for many job . you are not specialized for a particular task and you have enough knowledge to understand problem in different area and manage to find a solution . another advantage of this education method is that you can work with specialist of different area and understand , no without difficulty , what they are talking about . you can be helpful bringing to the discussion idea that are based on your broader education and experience . for example , software developer usually know how to use different programming language and design technique and many way to combine them . this make them very valuable because they can work on different part of the system they are developing . instead , an specialist would be useful to solve a particular problem , but nothing else . on the other hand , there are many job that need to be done by an specialist in the subject . a clear example of this occurs in medicine , where just an specialist can operate a patient or know how to treat some uncommon illness . when the task you are accomplishing requires a lot of knowledge and practice , you need to be an specialist to be successful . if you are a researcher , you will need to study a lot about the area where you are working to learn about different approches that can be taken to resolve a problem or discus with other researcher . if you are a lawyer , you have to be an specialist with the law you are dealing with . as i have stated , both option are possible . depending on the task that ha to be done an specialist will be better or worst than a person with a broader knowlegde .
