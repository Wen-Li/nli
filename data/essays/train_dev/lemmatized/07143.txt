yup ! i do agree with is statement that most of the people in the world are not spending their atleast time to help their community , because their is a major problem , is lacking behind the people , at which people are not spending their time to help their respective community is that everyone are selfish in their job , mean which include many . the people are more effective in their familie 's , with their wife and childrens . to overcome this problem , people should take immediate action in this case ,, each and every one should built helping nature , should obey their elder , younger and especially , should obey their parent , so by developing this helpling skill in their nature 's the respect towards their communites will be gained and automatically , every one will help poor people . the major point i would like to contrast is `` donating '' , by making donatings to the poor people , people could gain lot of respect in their respective community , not only donating to the poor people , also creating charitable trust my making contribution people could gain higher priority in their respective society . today there are many people who are starving because of food , not only food also with clothes and no shelter . however today we are seeing that , most of the people are dying with lack of food starvation and shelter , this incident we are suppose to know by reading newspaper and by seeing the news , most of this belongs to poorer country in which their government is not in the position to afford food and shelter to the people in their respective city . so , in every country ( poor or rich ) government should take immediate action on such type of incident and should provide the poor people to get them survive in their life . the above point which , i made is not only that government should help the community but , it belongs to everyone that each and every person in the society should behave a a responcible person , should respect their community and spend atleast little time to look after the poor people and help them in their poor life .
