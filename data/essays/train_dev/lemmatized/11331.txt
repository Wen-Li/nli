i agree that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their community . i believe that the reason behind this statement are the parent . the child will grow up depending on how the parent raise them . it is the parent responsibility to give their child the knowledge of the community they live in and what they have to do in order to fit in their community . i strongly believe that the young people nowadays are very spoilt . they are not taught the value of money . families give them enormous amount of money and the freedom to spent it a they want . as every young person they think that everything in life is money . because of this , young people have no moral left . they grow up learning how to spend money . parents do not give a much time a before to their child . even the celebration of the holiday are not the same anymore . young one care about their moral much le than the older generation . for example , i live in istanbul , and according to our religious holiday the whole family , from youngest to the oldest , come together . if not the young one go to visit their elder . but , nowadays unfortunately this is not happening . younger generation do not care about these thing . they prefer being with their friend . life to them is about drinking , driving the most expensive car , going out with the pretiest girl or wearing only brand name . as a conclusion , i blame the parent for this situation . every parent is responsible for their own child and it is up to the parent how they brought up their child in to this community . young people either will be welcomed by their community or be rejected .
