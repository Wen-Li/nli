nowadays , many people believe that young people are very selfish and they do n't do anything for their community . but , i disagree with this kind of opinion . from long time ago , people have complaint about younger than them . however , nowadays youger people volunteer in many field for their community and they study very hard . first of all , we can find many young student to volunteer in many place . of couse , some school need some volunteer job for their credit . even though , there are many student to do it just for helping their community . for example , we can see many young poeple to voluteer in the orphanage or hospital or school . they can be very helpful in this kind of place . because , in the hospital or orphanage house , there many people to desire the help . but the supply is very lack compare to the demand . the young people compensate the gap . how appreciatable thing it is . futhermore , many young people study hard and work for thier future and their community actually healthy minded young people can be very important resorces for their community . they take responsible the future of their society and the result , it can the most helpful thing for society . for example , if young people reglect their duty in the society , it can be very miserable thing for the community . because they are our future by themselves . fortunetly , most young people take their responsibility , it can naturally predict the positive future . to sum up , many student give enough time to helping their society by voluteering and studying or working . as i considered , our communitie 's future is very bright because of appreciatable young people . i think that we should encourage the healthy-minded young people to go on the positive way not to blame them .
