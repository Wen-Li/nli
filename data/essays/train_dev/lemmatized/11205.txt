the topic is about `` young people enjoy life more than older people do '' . i agree with the statement for the following reason . the younger poeple will enjoy in their age a they have more strength and enthusiasm than the old people . the old people feel that there life is over and they had nothing to do . as the life is begining for them , they do not have problem a the old people have they will enjoy themselves by spending time with friend , family , and playing sport in their leisure time . they do n't have any body to care at that time . they enjoy a lot during classtime also by cracking joke on professor . they have more fun by going to party with friend . as they are energetic and interested in many thing they will enjoy by doing thing what they want . they will not feel about the future , they always think about the present . they will enjoy the life of young age by doing mischeivous thing a they are not matured a old people . they dont care about other people . as the life is almost over for old age people they always think about the past and a they did not have much energy they ca n't enjoy what the young people enjoy . the old people always thought about there family and theur hard ship rather than their enjoyment . as there is saying `` once the age gone it will not regain back '' , once the young age is over it will not come , so we have to enjoy at that period . some old people think that they had n't have enjoyment in their young age , so one should have enjoyment in their young age a the age go on we can not retain our enjoyment . as the time is not regained we have to enjoy at the right time . so i conclude that the younger people enjoy life more than old people . my view is that we have to enjoy when there is ability to enjoy , it doesnot come back when the time is over and we lost lot in life .
