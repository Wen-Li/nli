for what concern my point of view , nowadays advertisment is used to convince people buying product that are often of lower quality than they seem on the tv spot or on the advertising space . i think most of the company are only interested in earning a much money a possible . their policy don-t always care about ethic and moral principle . this attitude is reflected in the way they act when advertise their product . they want to caught the eye of the consumer with bright color , wanderful image of idyllic place , beautiful woman , music and similar thing . they work hard , thinking about what attracts the majority of the people , what are the desire and the dream that their target customer ha . but on the other side they do not invest enaugh money and time to improve the quality of the good . i think every customer at least once experienced the misleading information advertising conveys . when i wa a little child i always want my parent to buy thing i saw in the television spot . for instance , when i wa six i wa amazed by the spot of a doll that could speak with child . i thought that she wa able to answer every question i may ask to her . but when i went to the toy shop and i tryed it i wa really sad in understanding her ability were only cry and saying she wa hungry , thirsty and sleepy . now i-m no more a child but often product that attracts me with advertising don-t satisfy me at all . i think that government should be more severe with company , checking if the standard of good really meet the promise of the spot . the company can-t be free of telling lie to the customer , beside this he must = e protected by the law .
