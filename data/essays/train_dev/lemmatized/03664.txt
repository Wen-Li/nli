this statement is true to every single word and at the same time equally convincing . i strongly agree that successful people try new thing , indulge in innovative activity and are risk-takers . first and foremost , the proverb ' no risk no gain ' support this idea . had our forefather not tried new thing and taken risk in their lifetime , we would not be sitting on our sofa watching a big-screen tv , talking on the phone with someone from a different continent , eating microwaved food and getting an automatic massage to our foot . all these comfort at our disposal are result of the effort and risk people have taken to bring on change . people who always try new thing and take risk are likely to open the door to fresh idea , novel result , widened scope , broader perspective , new domain of thinking , and most importantly , a profound intellectual comprehensibility of what is around u and what can be done to make this world a better place . such people are not only successful themselves but actually help the society to be a role model . on the other hand , doing what one know how to do well is almost like living in a confined area with limited scope and result . not that these people are not part of the society and do not contribute to the well-being of the society and become successful , but they lack fresh perspective and idea to anything that is unexplored and unexploited , in term of it value . a good example would be the invention of airplanes . if the wright brother did not take the risk of flying , we would not have airplane today . therefore , i firmly believe that in order to be successful and be able to help the mankind , one must be ready to cross boundary , explore the unexplored and make this world a better place .
