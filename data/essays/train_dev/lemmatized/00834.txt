i agree with this statement . becouse i know many people who tried new thing and took risk to success . one man came to study hair cutting to new york 30 year ago by him self . he is japanese who i met in new york . at that time when he came new york by ship , it wa n't common at all . just few japanese were living in new york and nobody had n't tried to come studying hair cut . when he came new york , he wa so poor and could't speak english at all . he did n't know how he could learn hair cutting . so he just went into hair salon and asked to teach . and also he tried to make friend little by little . after few year later he got chance to have a shop . now he ha many salon all of the world . my father is also one person who took risk . he is living in small city in japan . he is an archtecter and he ha a office by himself . so he ha to do all work by himself . i think it is a risk . he can do everything how he want , but when he is sick nobody do n't his job . but he success very well becouse of it . pe
