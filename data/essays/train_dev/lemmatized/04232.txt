firstly , i disagree with this statement . as a part of advancing the technology it ha been also known to be associated with cost effectiveness . the technology might help in giving more chance to live modern and fansy life but doe not reach to ignore the current transportation way . in the recent past the discovey of using the space ship wa a great evolution but still yet the cost and the risk of using such technolgoies are preventing even developed country to have these modern technology . in scientific term , we can say that consuming of petrolume might be le than what is on today but the number of the car might be even increase . relatively , the world population is increasing on daily basis thus represent the demand for more land transporter ( e.g. car , train . .. etc . ) . using of the new technology might help in accompany the new civilization to live in a fansy life but the cost effectiveness must be put in consideration . undergoing the process of cosuming petrolume product on our daily activites this might help to develope a futurestic plan to maintain our daily usage which might be reflected on the number of the car in the future . alternatively , the land transportation way will also bieng required a a part of our daily use and a of their cheaper cost in compare to the other fansy transporation way ; for example , space ship , aircraft , superjets . finally , i would say that a the population is increasing the demand of people to use different facility and transportation is also increasing and it ha been reported that the wide of highway and road is taking place nowadays all over the world even with the presence of different modern technology ( e.g. train , airplane , ship . .. etc . ) . it is not even stricted on third world country but even in the big developed country .
