nowadays , there are several different way to travel . in my opinion , the easiest way to travel is for sure to travel with a group led by a tour guide . but the easiest is generally not the more interesting ! in this way of travelling , everything is planned for you in each level of the travel . the tour guide is here to bring you to the most famous place , finest restaurant , museum . . as vacation rime with having rest , it 's a lazy way to discover a country , without doing any preparation . it is also a way to meet new people and maybe new friend in the group . unfortunately , the bad side of this kind of travel is a lake of freedom . you have to respect the planning of visit , be with a group all the time . actually , it is a way to travel that i am not used to . i like to prepare my travel , to do some research about the place that i will go visit . in this way , i feel free to do exactly the thing that i really want to . i buy book and map , after a little bit of lecture , the place becomes mine . i feel more at ease doing exactly what i wa looking for . i like adventure a lot , i walk in place that tourist do n't usually go with a tour guide . i like to speak with people from the place to have advice on what i should do or see . i am not the kind of person who leaf the controle to someone else . as a conclusion , i would say , that travelling with a group led by a guide is certainely a good way to travel . but i desagree in the fact that it is the best way . i personnaly think , that a travel is personal , and i prefer to be guided by my own feeling , and my sen of adventure . i 'd rather be my own guide .
