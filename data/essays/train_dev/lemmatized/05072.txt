i both agree and disagree this statement . on one hand , a broad knowledge of academic subject is often , dare i say always , good to have . it is important for man to have a knowledge of many field a possible . you a human being always want to learn more and , in university for instance , one subject is not enough all . i am currently a student . i study at la sorbonne nouvelle university which is the top university for foreign language . i am majoring in both english and german but there are many other language you can learn such a spanish , italian but also arabic , chinese or hindi . after graduating from this university and this major , student often applied for job in commercial trade or international business . in this context , the knowledge of many academic subject is much more than useful . in the case of two graduate student applying for the same job in international business , somehow i know that the one who ha the knowledge of different foreign language will get the post . my university is also famous for cinema , dramatic art , and communication and it is absolutely possible to major for example both in foreign language and in cinema or follow theater class . but on the other hand , i think that there is a time when student have to focus on what they really want to do and what the really want to be and then , according to it , try to get more chance a possible in order to sucess . for example , the knowledge of many academic subject could lead student into confusion . they try to learn a many subject often because they are interested in all sort of field and if you ask these student what they prefer for most or what they would rather study if they would only have to chose one academic subject , they do not know . this fact can explain why a lot of student fail their first year of college . most of university failure in france are cause of a mistake in the choice of major which are cause of a bad information after the twelvth grade . i would say a a conclusion that it is always interesting to have a knowledge in a many field a possible but student have to focus on the main point which is success .
