in today world of cut throat competition , advertising play a major role in increasing the sale of any product . there is a large variety of product available in the market today . similar product are manufactured by many company . hence customer today ha a variety of chooice . the difference in these similar product may be very minute . the advertising help in exaggerating this diffeences . take car for example . one car manufacturer may exaggerate about the spaciousness in the car by comparing it to a lounge ambience in it advertisement . another car manufacurer in the same category may emphasize on the outer design of the car comparing it with the aerodynamics of a spaceship . thus both the manufacturer have a selling point to be amphasized . but a the saying go look can be decieving because all that glitter is not gold . there are so many instance in which the customer is fooled into buying a product because of the galmour created around it through advertising . these instance are coming to life almost everyday . there are many letter in the ` letter to the editor ' column of newspaper that highlight this point . let u consider a simple example of buying an apartment . one of my close friend wanted to buy a new apartment . he collected many brochure and visited many incomplete site of construction . he decided to finalize on the basis of the brochure comparison . the brochure of the apartment he zeroed on spoke about the spacious room , facility like gym , sauna , play park and many more amenity . after actually shifting to the apartment he wa surprised to see big spacious room accompanied with lot of plumbing problem , no gym , the sauna without water in the pipe and so on . but if the advertisement hoarding were to be followed , this wa a dream apartment . this is a common case for a large variety of product . going from the advertising point of view , the advertiser are paid to make the product look good even if they actually arent . take an example of a popular razor which show leading sport personality using it . this razor actually caused skin problem to a customer according to a news paper . but the company that made this ad made profit and successfully helped in selling the product . there are many more instance which help in supporting the statement that advertisement do make product look much better than they actually are and i completely agree with this notion .
