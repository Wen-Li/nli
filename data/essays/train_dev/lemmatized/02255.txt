i disagree about ` in twenty year there will be fewer car in use than there are today . ' in my opinion , if they fewer car use in than there are today , that will call a lot of problem . first , they are young so they can make many possible of problem with car than adult . of course they are not so young to drive but they are not adult eigher . for example they can make the drunk drive . they do n't think harder than adult so they think they drive with drunk . that wa just one of possible situatuions . how do i know ? my friend 's brother started drive when he wa 20 year old . oneday , he drunk at noght with his friend . after drunk he drove the car . he thought he could dive . and he made accident . anyway that is one of example . second , when we start driving when we are 20 year old . they will more pollution than before . and that can make more traffic jam . . so in conclusion , i do n't think they will be fewer car in use than there are today . however they can use public transprotation for moveing . that wa my personal opinion .
