ther are some people who belive that in the future it will be fewer car in use that today . they usually argue that in twenty year we will discover another type of public transport that could remplace the tradicional car . i not agree with this optimistic vision . in fact , i think that in twenty year it will be double of car that there are in use today . i think this because three main reason . actually use of the car is not extended in africa , india or even in china , but when the wealth of these country grows up , the citizen are going to demmand more car . in a few year they will be at the same level a europe and usa , and please note that in europe and usa we have an averadge of two car per familly , therefore there is another important argument : the petrolium and gas . the future of gas industry depends of the number of car , so they are not going to allow that the number of car decrease . therefore , there is no chance that we discover a new energy fount in only twenty year . the last argue is the car industry . it is a powerfull industry , which provides work for thousand of people arround the world . the goverments are going to use it influence to increase the number of car in order to avoid social problem in their country . it will be great if we could reduce the use of car , specially because it would helped u to decrease the pollution on the earth . but i afraid that it is only a dream ; the reality used to be more cruel .
