some people do not agree with young people enjoy life more than older people do , but i agree with young people enjoy life more than olader people do . i have some reason why i agree with it . first , young people have more free time to do fun stuff than oleder people who is like working do . young people can do anything that they want to do . here is an example . when i wa in high school , i have been to hawaii by using my spring break . if someone who work , they do not have vacation . i enjoyed staying in hawaii by myself . secondly , older people dose not have anegies to enjoy their life . i mean , i do not say they are not fine , but if you are young , you have enegies to travel or meeting someone . i like traveling around the world and i think it can really enjoy my life . however , it would cost to do so , so i keep my money by working hard . thirdly , there is some stuff that only young people can do . for example , go to the u.s. or other country a an exchange student or meeting new people who speaks different language from what we speak . i have been in the u.s. for one year a an exchange student and went local high school , meet new people , had experienced different culture what i used to it . it wa really impressing for me to be a part of different family member . i met a lot of friend during my exchage year and had lot of fun there . i though i could not do this if i wa an older people . all of my state , i agree with young peple enjoy life more than older people do because i had experieced some stuff that only young people can . however , older pople ha more money than young people so they can enjoy their life pretty much , too .
