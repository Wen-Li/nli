first of all , let me ask you about this quetion . would you like more car or not ? are n't you aware about the severe air pollution problem ? do n't you get embarrassed when passing in a speed of 10km/h in crowded area ? in twenty year , le car will be in use than now . actually , i used to dream these kind of case when i 've been involded in environmental friendly social service . our goal were to advertise the air pollution of car and encouraging people to use public transport . by that time , i sometimes had that feeling one day , car should be at least banned by half more try to develop a new type of car which would be eco-friendly . likewise , the place i 'm living now singapore is the very country which succeed in reducing the number of car . the high tax included in the purchase disgust the buyer ' taste of getting a new car . not only the tax included in the buying process but tax such a erp , those which are paid when car are passing the city area , are having great success in making people using le car . this morning , i read on the internet newspaper about one very special item ; the flying car m-400 . this car ha been put on ebay a an ` on sold ' item and the price predicted wa about 4000 million us $ . it also included that this kind of car will perhaps be more popular in about 20 year , and be the time 20 year pas , i think scientist and engineer will be able to find a new kind of source a replacement of fuel . well , it 's truth that people have already started to use gas using car or even car with engine using oxygen . no one know what will happen in 20 year . but considering the current way people think about pollution and the fact that science is still developing , i prefer voting my part to the one agreeing at the statement . franckly said , at the time i wa born , personal mobile phone were predicted to come out in about 30 year which we actually made it within 15 year .
