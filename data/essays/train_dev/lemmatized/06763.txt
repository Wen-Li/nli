i agree that successful people try to do new thing and take risk rather than doing only one thing that they know well . first of all , i think that learning is a life-long job . every person who want to succed ha to learn new thing very hard . i believe that having an open mind , trying to be adventurous and taking risk are the key to success . if i am afraid of change and do n't want to give it a try on new thing , i will not be able to develop myself . for instance , say that i am afraid of water , so i avoid learning how to swim . i never try to learn so i do n't know how to swim . but one day , i wa on a boat or a ship and the boat wa on fire . or , i fell from the boat and i 'm in the middle of the sea , not being able to move . what will happen then ? i am a foreigner , good at my native language . but since i am good at what i already know and do n't learn foreign language such a english , i will not be able to study in the state nor communicate with people from abroad . i will be stuck in a little world . second , i think that people who resist to make change become lazy and outdated . they do not develop nor improve themselves and just sit idle only doing what they know how to do well . i have seen many pople around me who become outdated and fall behind other people . for example , many korean people who came to the state do not know how to speak english . i wa very shocked when i met some koreans , who lived in the us for more than 10 year , not being able to speak english well . the reason that they could n't speak wa because they were comfortable with their life . they did n't want to try new thing or learn a new language . nor do they wanted to take risk to adapt in the american society . they were just doing what wa easy for them . they only hang out with koreans and watch korean tv show , and do not know what is going around in the us . no self improvement nor development . all in all , people who sit idle and just do what they already know well will not be able to succeed . only the one who try new thing and learn consistently will flourish and succeed . if a person only doe what he want and doe n't learn anything else but what he know , the outdated person will not be able to succeed .
