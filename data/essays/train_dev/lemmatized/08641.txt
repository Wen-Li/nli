the following statement `` it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subject than to specialize in one specific subject. '' is a faulse statement lacking evidence to support such an argument . the passage below will demonstrate , through three example , how the above statement is inaccurate . firstly , if the population of the world continued to educate their child , or adult in many subject then the world will have too many people that know a little bit about everything and none that know accuratley and condensly about specific subject . if we take the case of jordan or saudi arabia , we find that the education system ha proved to be le successful than that in the west , namely the a level , or igcse system . studies have shown that student tend to do badley when the education system includes many subject . the english system for example , ha proved quite successul . we find that student tend to choose subject of interest , and tend to focus quite well and progress flourishingly at university since they focus all their effort at subject of interest and tend to excell . it ha also been proven that if a student enjoys a subject such a math they tend to do considerably well , and may never excell in subject they dislike due to the left part of their brain working better . studies have shown that the human brain is split into to category , the more creative side , and the more mathematical side . it is upto the subject to excell those part of the brain more considerably . secondly , if indeed we broaden the knowledge of student into many subject , we will find a lack in quality in nearly everything . if we take the following example , we find that in discipline such a architecture , urbanism , or even medicine ; a need for an accumulative time frame where constant knowledge is used to develop in such subject . if an architect , did not spend an approximation of ten year learning and mastering the topic , then the work will be far le than perfect . ofcorse , it is always useful for one to learn more about other subject generally , however it is important to relate them back to one discipline to actively excell in a particular topic . thirdly , we find that at postgraduate level , the reason the world is moving forward and excelling in term of technology , science , and what have you , is due to researching specific topic at a higher level . a phd professor spends all his time focussing , and detailing a single topic for 3 to 11 year , and that is when the subject move beyond it traditional scope . we also find that respectable institution have continuously been re-inventing new topic of education such a human resourse education , and emotional intelligence . if we strived to learn all topic in their totality , then we would lack sufficient resource to keep expanding and creating new form of education . in conclusion , we find that one need to focus and free himself of external factor in order to succeed in life . as illustrated above the definition of success is the amount of knowledge one ha gained in a particular topic to the degree where he ha created and invented a new form of language to offer back to the world . if we all attempt to learn about many topic in general , then we will loose the devoted time to excell in just one . as mentioned , and supported in the example above , the art to mastering a topic is to devote much time to perfecting the information up to the final element . as the saying go : `` god is in the detail '' .
