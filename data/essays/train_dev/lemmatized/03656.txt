modern societes are thinking more individually than ever . this is a result of multiple factor that i will shortly describe in this writting . the first factor is the metropoli concept . at the beggining of the 20th century , there were no so many city in the world with more than a million of habitant . today , one can realize more than 50 city with more than 10 million of habitant . the metropolis ha many implication in the way of living , in term of competitivity for a workplace , time dedicated to educational activity , time and resource invested in transportation . day after day time invested at home is decreasing and the young people quite often do not see with treir parent a they have so many thing to do , but the family is not a priority anymore . a second factor is the revolution of communication medium and all what it ha brought to society . the medium influence over the people is huge . unfortunately what bring cash to the medium company are the star program . i have not seen any top series for young that focus their attention to comunitary program , obviously , that wo n't have any rating . the third factor is the lack of belief . as a human being , is important to believe in a superior god , no matter if is christian , methodist , budism , etc . the belief and practice of a religion are the basis of a community . the final factor is that the education at school are focusing more in technical formation than humanistic , focusing student more in `` me '' thinking than in a community thinking . technical education is basic , but moral education is a important and shoul be teached in the same way and intensity . multinational and global corporation work a a community , share a corporate culture and value , and from my point of view , that is the only way that one could guarrantee sustainability . one of the basis of leadership is to work in group to bring result foto the community and young should be advised of the importance of helping their community .
