the young boy helped the old lady cross the road . this is the stereotype on how the youth help their community is based . according to me this extremely unfair . the world ha evolved and with it so should the defination of helping your community . the youth of today contrary to general opinion are not so different from the youth of yester year . we may express ourselves in a different way which may or may not be acceptable to society but at heart we do care for our friend , family and yes even our community . a vast majority off all social , environmental development drive are carried out by the youth . the soal purpose of these drive is the betterment of our communites , our society on a whole . for instance in my school we carried out a `` say no to fire crackers '' drive . in my country the festival of diwali is a grand affair which is celebrated with great zeal and vigour . bursting mind boggling amount of fire cracker is a part of the festival . these firecarcker are made by poor child a the are a cheap source of labour . my not supporting the booming fire cracker industry we not only aided a social cause but also majorly decreased the excessive pollution linked with the festival . the youth of today may be caught up in their own issue but that doe not we sacrifice the welfare of our communites . it is not uncommon to see child picking up a wraper or can from the road and throwing it in the nearest bin . we still carry out our responsibility a proud citizen of our respective country . my school bus had stopped at a crowded intersection on my way back home from school . a motorcyclist on our side of the road dint mangae to break in time hit an on coming car and fell of his bike . our bus driver saw the man fall and decided not to stop the bus a he felt other would come to his aid . one of my seniours ( i wa in 7th grade ) though immediately told the driver to stop the bus and ran to the injured motorcyclist aid . he told the bus driver to conitue on and took the cyclist to hospital in a taxi on his own . this wa just an example of somthing which is quite commonplace in todyas world . t
