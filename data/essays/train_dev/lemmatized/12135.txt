i agree with the idea that successful people try new thing and take risk rather than only doing what they already know how to do well . but it is not so easy to apply this thought to the life that we are in . because doing something that you know without taking risk ha advantage . you may not feel stressed and may feel relaxed when doing the thing that you are always doing . as it is easy to estimate the result of your action . on the other hand , it wo n't help you to discover new thing , try different way or widen your vision . you will stay closed to your surrounding but can not find the ability to try different thing , a you are not willing to take risk . so you become an ordinary person doing a regular job a usual . that seems so boring to me that i do n't like to be that kind of person . staying away from ordinary life , trying different thing , being open to new discussion , taking risk will definetely change our life . hard thing require difficult step to take and sharp hill to climb . you must tolerate these step by taking risk , if you want to be a successful person , different from the others . risk mean loosing or winning . imagining the positive side of the risk , that can make revolution and bring success in our life is the key point for motivation . we can see it best example in business . for instance ; bill gates had taken a big risk by leaving school and tried something new that wa not popular at that time . but now he is considered a the leader . that doe n't mean that he did n't face any diffuculties since then . but he endured the diffuculties and did everything step by step to the way to great success . in a nutshell , i agree with the topic that nothing can be achieved by sitting or doing the usual thing . you must try different , new thing and take risk , if your aim is to reach up the peak of success .
