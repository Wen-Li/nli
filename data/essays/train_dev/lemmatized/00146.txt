from every travel , what we get at the end are just a group of memory . events , thing learned , people met , and lot of specific information that may be with u until we leave this world . a tour guide is an effective and excellent way to ensure a quality trip , and what better than a great trip with friend and family ! my family is a huge fan of tour guide and is obsessed with traveling always together . `` we all go , or nobody go '' my mom usually say when somebody is planning a trip on his own . they always say that the trip is not even worthwhile without the two key ingredient : a good group and a good guide . i sometimes wonder myself if they would rather leave me and take a guide to all of the trip we have made in our lifetime . i have to say , regardless of the weird obsession my parent have for guide , i agree with them . having a guide help you understand the history and the people of the place you are visiting . you can get recommendation for good place to eat , fun park to visit , and interesting museum and show . and best of all , share all this with the company you have ! on a trip i made to europe two year ago ( obviously with every member of my family ) , i went to see a city that hundred of year ago had been covered in lava , and completely destroyed . the first thing my father did when we arrived at thhis amazing place , wa to look for the best guide he could find . i think regular parent first take a look at the place , read something about them , and probably go buy the ticket to enter ; but not my dad . in le than five minute he came with a spanish guide that had studied history in a prestigious university , and spoke around six language . although i make fun of my parent ' obsession , i have to say that in every trip we make we have the best tour guide a tourist can possibly get . i should probably thank them for getting the best out of every place we visit , because that is really priceless . in conclusion , i would like to say that group and guide are an incredible combination for every trip . it give you people to talk and have fun with , and the touch of history and education we should all receive .
