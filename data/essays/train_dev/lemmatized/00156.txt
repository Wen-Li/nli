in our society time is running and we only have or take little time to discover a foreign country . and in these few day which are always not enough everything worth seeing ha to be vistited . additionaly it all should happen in an easy going way because no one want to be stressed on his or her vacation . therefore a guided tour may be the best way . there are many possibility a well . it range from adventure tour containing sleeping in a tent under the sky until the more luxury one with a nice four or five star hotel included . furthermore a guide most time know the area like the back of his hand so no question will be unanswered and every beautiful and famous place or building will be visited . but there are also some negative thing by joining a guided tour . most time only the tourist spot are visited which are subsequently crowded with tourist from all the other tour . so it is always worth it to find a tour that ha additionally some point away from the usual place . of course some thing ` have ' to be vistited but in every country are several unknown place which are at least a remarkable although they do not appear in every tourist information book . and there are of course some people who will do everything on their own . most time this mean more planing or a very spontaneous lifestyle . but these people will probably have more contact with local and a total difference experience and view of the visited country . in conlusion i think it is the most convenient way to travel in a group led by a guide because you can see all ` important ' building or landscape but i would never go so far to say it is the best way , because that is something everyone ha to choose of his or her own .
