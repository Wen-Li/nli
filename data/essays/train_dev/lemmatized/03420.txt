there are different type of traveler , those who like traveling in group led by a tour guide and the others , more courageous , who like traveling alone . i my opinion , traveling in a group far outweights traveling alone . there are two main reason why i strongly agree with this statement : you travel peacefully and you do n't have to worry about where you will arrive . travelling is a great experience but sometimes it can be a little bit scary . that why i prefer to travel in a group , indeed you can leave your home more peacefully and enjoy more your trip . furthermore you do n't have to worry about nothing because everything is organized by the tour guide . the other reason why i certainly prefer to travel in a group is because of the tour guide . in a the matter of fact i can be sure that he will already know the place to visit and for sure the place to avoid . consequently i will not have any bad surprise or bad experience with the native people met in the new country . in addition the guide tour can explains clearly the culture , the importance of the monument and the history of the unknown country . in conclusion traveling in a group permit me to avoid the stress due to the trip and to learn more about the country i visit . it is for thess reason i strongly recommend everyon
