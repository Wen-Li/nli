in my opinion is certnaly better have a general point of view about many academic subject , and at the same time focus on particolar subject wich you think are the most important for your future or your work . i belive that have a general knowledge is important to undenstard better the subject wich you have choose to specialize in , beacouse all the subject are relate with other subject . for example student who studyied architecture can not focus on only about architecture , for undestand what architecure is , how is it made and how to plan it they necessity to know sociology beacouse sociology study human behavies and relathioship , and architecture is the place how behavies and relationship born . and also they should know ecology beacouse building have a strong effect on nature and ecosystem . know geology is also important to predict the soul density . to achieve this big knowledge is necessary ask a to yourselves why ? why th happen , why how is made
