first of all , it ha to be metioned that the concept of ` enjoying life ' is dramatically different for a teenager and for an older person . even if this concept should be present in life from the cradle to the grave . on the one hand , it is generally accepted that young people are physically more capable than older people . as a result , they will normally not enjoy life by doing the same kind of thing . indeed , going out in a club on saturday night is surely quite unusual for most elderly people . they may prefer to travel on an organized trip or to read a good book . older people also have the advantage of being retired , which allows them to have more time for leisure , holiday abroad , etc , on the other hand , young people usually have le experience in life and have a tendency to make `` youth mistake ' . they are usually le wise in making decision and will sometimes face a lot of problem . furthermore , young people get more and more responsabilities a they become older . for instance , the one who study have to attend class regularly , to do homework , to write a memoire or a these on a particular subject . others will have to work , to care for their child or face money problem . indeed , generally speaking , older people tend to have le money problem because they are not menaced by unemployment and mainly have their accomodation mortgage paid . undeniably , le responsabilities give you more time to enjoy life . however , in my opinion , enjoying life is not really a matter of age , i feel that quote like `` life begin with 40 '' are totally wrong . for me , life begin every morning when you wake up . in conclusion , we were all given the choice to do what we want with our life and should take advantage of this opportunity . life is short and enjoying it every single day , regardless of either you are young or old is definitely a conditio sine qua none to happiness .
