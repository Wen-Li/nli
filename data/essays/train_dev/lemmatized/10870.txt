i disagree with the opion that it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subject than to specialize in one specific subject . although to have broad knowledge of many academic subject may help people know different field acknowledges , we only can know the surface knowledge about each subject . so i prefer to have a specialize knowledge in one specific subject . to begin with , our time is limit . we can not study every subject well . we can not acquire the true knowledge and tecnical if we sperate our time into many subject . for instance , if a student learned art , psychology , math and drawing in his colledge life . i think he may know a lot of thing . however it is difficult to him have a good mark in every field . on the other hand , if we pay most of our time in one field . we can know a lot in this field than others . for example , a student whose subject is psychology pay most of his time in the psychology . maybe he can know this field well . he can write paper about this field and find job in this field . in summary , i think it is better to have a specailize broad knowledge in one subject than to broad knowledge in many subject . it is good for person and the whole society .
