from my point of view , i see that most of commercial make good more attractive and better than really are . and i found that from my experince and from what i heared from my relative and friend . although advertisement sometimes are necessary , but still there are a lot od deceiving and misleading to custemors . also for me is wasting time to see , hear and reading advertisement . from my own experience i saw an advertisement in the tv about a medicine that will realive the pain pf foot and it wa very attractive , so i call for it and after using it for a long time nothing changed . and i heared a lot of story from my friend and relative and the same thing happend occationally to them in other stuff that they bought . i know it is sometimes there are advantiges from commercial , they will expose a to the new and developed technology , material and a lot of thing . but still i there are another way to know about these thing from others source like depedent research and from the experience of others . i believe commercial wasr my time a lot for a lot of reason , it take time from me when viewing prgrams on tv , like news , show , sport and almost in every thing . and commercails also in radio , newspapaers , magazins and everywhere . all that a real wasting in my time . so i am sure of the fact that advertisments mask the fact of the product and make it much better than it is . i realize they are not for me those commercial , it make profit for me , so i do n't agree with the above statement .
