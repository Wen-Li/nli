cars have been playing an extremely important role in the society nowadays . while people are enjoying their obvious advantage , problem come companied with the convenience they bring . more and more people are complaining about the air pollution that car created . however , car , a for me , will also exert an great impaction in human society in the future . and their number will not even decrease . on the contrary , the development of car will be surprising and momentous . twenty year can be a long time or a short time , but the development of the quality of car , including speed , security would be tremendously huge . people will definitely enjoy these obvious advantage in the thought of travelling more place in the world that ha became smaller and smaller . and there are also other aspect in their development . as you know , many institute and country have been doing research to find a fuel that posse both efficiency and environmental benefit . progress have been made in these research . and fuel can replace the role of gasoline , whose quantity ha been declining because of the explosion , have two main choice . first one , for me , is hydrogen , that can be fired and used for energy and can produce few substance that pollute the environment . the next one is the usage of solar energy , a sort of energy that can be obtained from the sunlight using peculiar way . after about twenty year , when these two kind of energy can be used in car , people would like to make a use of these car under the thought to protect environment , and this thought , will be erected in ten year ascribed to the education that pay attention to the education in this area . not only the improvement of the quality of car , but the usage of fuel lead me to believe that in twenty year , the number of car will not decreased , but ascend in a large quantity due to both the improvement of the sence to protect public and natural environment and the usage of new fuel which will make car the most effiencient and covenient mean of transportation without polluting the environment .
