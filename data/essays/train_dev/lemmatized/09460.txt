understanding idea and concept are more important for some student . on the contrary , learning fact are more important for other student . that is a very complex issue because it depents on the person . however , i agree the first statement because of some reason . first of all , a student have to understand the idea and concept . after that he can learn and understand fact better . for example , when i wa in the university , our teacher told u idea and concept . after the lesson , we learned fact by our self . as a result of this , we could set an interaction between them easily . second , people can understand idea and concept more quickly . furthermore , they can get them more easily because fact can change but idea and concept can not change . namely , idea and concept are basic . for instance , while i wa preparing to the toefl exam , first i studied to the concept of the exam . then i started exercising and i saw that that is better . consequently , i think understanding concept and idea are more important . also they are more understandable than fact . if you understand the idea and concept clearly , you can also get the fact easily .
