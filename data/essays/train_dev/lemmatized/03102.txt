i disagree that young enjoy life more than order people do . first of all , there are many active , fresh , lively older people . they have many hobby , friend , family , so they are enjoying their life . some older people look like so yong ! my grandfather is also one of these people . it seems to me he is enjoying his life . second , there are many yong people who do not enjoy their life . some yong people have no hobby and they are not interested in anything . for example , today , the number of neet is increasing in japan . they do not want to work and stay home watching tv or eating snack and so on . they depend on their parent completely . so , i think that sometimes older people enjoy life more young people . on the other hand , some people may say that older people can not move free because of disease or injuring . so , if they want to play sport , they can not . but yong people can play actively . i think this is also true . but there are also many young people who have disease or injure . i think it is not true that these people do not enjoy life . i believe if there are some disability , we can enjoy our life . i feel that to live better life , we should think anything positive , and enjoy anything ! not related to how old you are , the person who try to live better is the person who enjoy life .
