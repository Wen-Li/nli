in today 's world young people are trying to make their career a soon a possible in order to get settlement in their life . and to achive this task they are working hard to earn good sum . so now a day young people are so busy that they have no time to help community . young people are really not worried about the community they are living in , all they are worried about their work . its because of the stress they are put in to study to work hard . to justify this particular point one of the best example is , in today 's world parent are more worried about thier childern future so they are placing their child in those school which give them education for almost 10-12hrs per day , if that is the case then what would the child position working for so long hour and getting tired for rest of the day . then how will he be able to help community infact in some case he cant help himself also . now a day education is so much stressed that young people have no time to look upon community , atleast those young people even dont know that communites are in search of help . even in collage now a day they are given lost of home work to do that these young people are not in a position to do other activity . i dont say that every young man is of this kind but there are some people who are really helping the community for example in some college they go for camp to some remote area and draw their problem and they try to sort of their problem by providing some fund to them . but there are some young people who think all these are of no use to them . so , a this the case about the young people nowadays , it once parent and teacher duty to let their young child know about the communites and let them also know about the good and bad , and also give them time to think about other thing apart from education . if this is done then iam sure there will be lot of change in the communites because some day the same young man may need help .
