advertisements or branding is an important key in today world of business , in fact , it become very essential in selling any product or item . most marketting organization or company relay on branding or advertisement to introduce their product to the market . most people are looking for brand through advertisement . most advertisement make product seem much better than they really are . in my opinion i think that this statement is completely true . although advertisement gave the customer very valuable information about the product he or she intend to buy , but that is not neccessary to give him the full information he need and not to be nessessary ture 100 percent for many reason : firstly , the advertisement will be prepared by a specilaized staff or expert who is professionally prepared to attact customer to buy their product . in other word it is matter of money first of all , but not nessessary quality . there is no gauranttee about effecinecy or quality of the product unless it is very big company where brand name mean a lot to that specefic company . secondly , by using new advanced techological method available today for photography , digital imaging and printing high technology , the marketing company can send strong messege to customer , but that not nessessaryily will give them full detail about the brand or product . from my peronal experience , i think it is matter of trust and loyalty to a specific company . long time ago , i have received some advertisement by mail about new type of shoe . the company pretend in their advertisemnet that their shoe will be practical at all season and it will stay for long time and the photo included in that advertisement wa very ipresive . i wa convenced at that time and i have decided to buy that shoe . it come to my surprise when i have received my order , that type of shoe which i wa waiting for is not what i am looking for . it wa just nomal rubber shoe and it dy not stay for long a they have said . of cousrse i get dissoponited in conclusion , i would like to declare that branding or advertisemnt is a nesessarry tool in marketing but also make product much better than they really are , especially by using high advanced technology available today .
