the number of car is a problem , a problem for the planet , a problem for a city . we need to reduce this number to pollute le and increase the atraction of the big city . all this thing are evident but , if the question is : do you think there will be fewer car in twenty year , i aswer with no hesitation : no , and for two reason . first i think that fewer car can come from a revolution in poeple mind . to me , we are no ready to abandon the concept of : a family , a house , a car . in spite of all the good argument ecologist can give , everybody wille feel the need to hqave got his oun car . of course city are developping bus system and metro line but it will never be enouth to accept to to by a car . i admit that maybe it can provoque some change about how often poeple use the car . only for the week end or in vacation . then , we have to change the level of analysis . car question is a global issue and we have to consider the problel on the international level . if we can admit that we will see le car in the big city of developped country , it is difficult to imagine the reaction if somebody explained to china citizen that they did not have the right to buy car . today thing are not going so bab but can we imagine the situation when asian poeple will be rich enouth to buy a car ? to some extent , we could say that global development force u to integrate the idea : no , it is impossible to think a world with fewer car aware of the consequence of globalisation . to conclude we can say that , if we can imagine le car for europe , it is impossile at the planet level .
