within the following essay i discus if people trying new thing and taking more risk are more succesful than people using well established practice . for the beginning i give an principal definition of succes , because it is a question of perspective wether someone is succesful or not . secondly i highlight several argument on the topic before concluding with my own opinion on it . succes is within a society normally a well conscructed and established value . every value consists normally of an imagination of distinctive goal . instead succes itself is not adequate to a constructed goal but need to be constructed by each community of people . within western country who share the same principle of economy and society succes can be defined a earning a lot of money , having a family or simply being happy , whatever this would say . now my perspective focus on the economic perspective by earning a lot of money and therefore i definite succes by it . by stretching the economic face of succes i need to differentiate between new product and well established product . new product are normally accompagnied by a bigger amount of risk and also by a larger scale of innovativity than established product are . the example of franchising worked on earlier this toefl fit quite well . it is relatively easy to buy the right of a huge company like burger king and to produce it product but it also highlight the limitation of own freedom to establish something own . while starting his proper buisness is relatively costly for oneself and is followed by the incertainity of acceptance of the product , it let some room for creativity and personality . additionally new innovative product could be sold for higher price . nevertheless it could n't be denied that you can earn money with both possibility . perhaps it 's not really a question of succes in this case , but of making it a special way . for my conclusion i emphasize on the hope of everyone to have succes that lead people to start something new and innovative against all odds . this hope might be imaginative but lead researcher to new invention and at all humanity to progress . so it would be necessary for humanity but not for economic succes at a short range . by using well established practice you can suceed too and by stretching on the example of new product you need an etablished name to sell product better . therefore it 's the mixture of both , risk and new way a well a well established way that lead to overall success , for individual , enterprise and humanity .
