there is a diversity of opinion over the issue of whether most advertisement make product seem much better than they really are . nowadays , when faced such a problem , some people believe that most advertisement make product seem much better than they really are , others , on the contrary , seem to have opposite opinion . in my point of ivew , however , i fully agree with this position that most advertisement make prodcuts seem much better than they they really are for the following reason . here are some reason why . first of all , consumer ca n't deny that company spend a lot money to broadcast their prodcuts . using pop star or overstating their effect is one of their way to sell their product . however , consumer never think about where these money come from and go . as a matter of fact , what consumer pay for what they buy going to the advertising because company want to cousmers to buy their product . there are a lot of similar product in the market . only one way making consumer to remembe and choose their product is to advertise . in addition , company using advertisement tell people that how good their product are . in fact , people always feel upset because the product do n't satisafy them . take myself for a example , one time i bought a food , according to the advertisement , that could helf me to reduce my weight . needless to say , i spent a lot of money and time to try it . however , the outcome wa making me pretty upset becuase it did n't work even thoug the company ha guarantee about the effect . after this experience , i never believe what advertisement say . to sum up , it is not very wise to believe any advertisement . my personal experience and actual observation of life have led me to conclusion that company spend a lot of money to broadcast their product even though their product doe n't seem much better than they really are . companies not only exagrrate the ability of product , but also transfer the cost to the consumer .
