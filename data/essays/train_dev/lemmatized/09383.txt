i disagree with the statement that young people enjoy life more than older people do . i think that probably younger people have more opportunity to lead a pleasant life , unaware of danger , economicall worry and age - related illneses ; but i do believe that young people have le wisdom to realize that those opportunity must be well used to get joy in to their life . i often see young people overdriven to acomplish thing in such a short time , that they can not possibly realize that they are missing important and joyful experience on their path . young people are more and more feeling the pressure to do a lot , at the cost of enjoying le . this pressure come from society , family , their peer , and sadly from themselves , pushing more and more to excel in so many thing at the time , that they just end doing everything automatically , without stopping to see what they have acomplished . even though older people can be very driven to succeed , year have taugth them that a important a get thing done , is the experience of doing them . i have seen myself stressed and feeling unfulfilled after long hour in a supposedly joyfull experience , a an over planned trip , scheduled by the hour to maximize the eyesightings . i have also seen my grandfather enjoying himself a lot by just sitting close to the window with a cup of strong tea , reading a magazine or watching the people who pas by the street . there are pleasure of the older people that can not compare to some rush and excitement that young people can get from partying all night and leading an accelerated life . there is the possibility to see the kid grow and become nice people , who will honor the value they where raised in . and there is of course the possibility to enjoy grandchild , who can be spoiled by the grand parent while the parent struggle to teach them manner ant get them to bed early . i also think that older people enjoy more life because they get a sense of a `` job well done '' about their family , job or whatever commitment they had in life , whereas young people are still trying to find their purpose . older people often have ( or make ) more time , to devote themselves to thing they find enjoyable , a learning something special or talking to people with related interest . my grandmother spent long hour working two job when she wa younger to be able to raise her kid , and never had much of a hobby , but now that she ha retired , she ha found great satisfaction in taking cooking lesson with neighbor that became real friend . i am finally realizing that life can be more enjoyable than what it ha been to me in the past , but this is probably because i am starting to age myself . .. i wonder if a year pas i will find more joy on the little thing , and if i will be able to be delighted by seeing the passersby a my grandfather doe , but i do think that with age , more thing will come too , that will make me very happy . to summarize , my opinion is that older people enjoy life more than young people , not only because of the oportunities that life present to them , but mainly because of the way they see life .
