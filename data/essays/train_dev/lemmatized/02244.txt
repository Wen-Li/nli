although some people prefer to travel in a group led by a tour guide , i strongly prefer to travel individually . in my opinion , travelling in a group offer several drawback . first of all , travelling in a group prevents you to discover thing by yourself because you always stay with the group . in addition , you always rely on the guide . in contrast , travelling individually allows you to discover place alone . for example , when i wa in egypt , i noticed that the local population wa nicer when you were travelling alone than when you were part of a group . second , group travel have the same schedule . they usually eat at the same time . in addition , they always have the same food . besides , group member should stay together . that mean that you can not really be independant . whereas , travelling individually can let you more opportunitues to discover the local food , local monument which are not described by a guide . furthermore , you can choose to visit the monument when there are le people . therefore , i think that you are in a better position to appreciate the sight seeing . third , i think that group travel are too noisy and are sometimes very disrespecful towards a culture . as a matter of fact , i notice that the group tends too be very annoying . on the contrary , the individual tourist will try to fit into the environment . he generally show more respect toward the local population and show more curiosity . besides , travelling individually can offer the possibility to be in contact with the people of the country . in contrast , when you are in a group , you are le curious to go talking with the local population . finally , i would say that travelling in a group led by a tour guide can be the worse way to discover a different country and another culture .
