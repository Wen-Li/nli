centuries ago , a writer could also be a doctor , a scientist and an economist . people used to have broad knowledge of many academic subjetcs a it is illustrated in the book gargantua by rabelais . nowadays , people become more and more specialized . let 's face it , our knowledge is so huge in every academic subjetc that it is impossible to know everything in every topic . there is a common joke in economics thats point out that every economist get specialized in a very specific topic and doe not know anything about the rest . it is a consequence of the specialization of people that took place in the nineteenth century . indeed , progress ha been made in many area and the knowledge ha increased . in this respect , medecine is a case in point , people used to know very little about the organistation of the human body but nowadays , the knowledge is so broad that doctor have to get specialized to be efficient . furthermore , the only doctor who remain generalist ca n't cure everything and they often send you to a specialist to resolve your problem . however , a bad consequence of this specialization is that people do n't know any more everything about their own subject . if you have a broken leg , a neurologist wo n't be able to do anything to help you . but anyway , according to me , this evolution towards specialisation is useful and , moreover , ineluctable . it is first ineluctable because a i have said the knowledge is now so broad that a human being ca n't know everything . furthermore , it is useful because it allows u to better understand a very specific point of our subjetc . for instance , all the progress that have been made in the research for the cancer would not have been possible without this specialization . to have broad knowledge of many academic subjetcs is pleasant but it also mean that this knowledge will remain limited and it 's why specialization is needed .
