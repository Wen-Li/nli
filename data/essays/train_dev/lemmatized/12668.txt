i agree with this statement . of course some people might say that learning fact is more impotant . however , it is clear to me that understanding idea and concept outweight than learning fact . first of all , education is for improving capacity of student 's thinking . if teacher stick their own idea , then student only can think teacher 's way . that prevent increasing student 's thinking . and , also a we can see , nowadays many school have student-centered class to give student think more . in addition , in our country - south of korea - , most of class are only for leran fact . teachers do n't ask student 's thinking , student only listen and write what teacher say . so that my country 's people weak of imagination . but a you know , imagination is the power of future . finally , student can more concentrate on thier study . thinking something , imagne somethings are very interesting .
