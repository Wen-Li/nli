the issue at hand is that whether in the next twenty year the use of car is going to be reduced or not . i believe that the use of car is going to be reduced . the first reason is that travelling in car is not safe . you need to concentrate on the driving . one should not get distracted while driving . where a travelling through other mean like bus is much safe . the driver are very experienced and well trained . many people know this and many are still learning that travelling by car is not safe . so i feel that car are not safe . the other reason is that car are le ecomomical . we need to spend a lot of money for petrol . presently there is a hike in the petrol charge and it is going to increase further . for example i go to college daily by bus . my college is around 30 km from my house and going by car cost me more . so , i feel that car will be reduced in the future . the other reason is that we may have new invention which may reduce accident and be more economical . technology is improving at a much faster rate . so definetly we will have new invention which dominate car in many aspect . so i feel that use of car willl be reduced in the future . every one is busy in this world . while driving a car we waste our time in driving and need to concentrate more . by travelling by other mean if we can do some other work . this is going to save time which is the most valuable thing in this world . in conclusion i strongly believe that there will be fewer car in the future .
