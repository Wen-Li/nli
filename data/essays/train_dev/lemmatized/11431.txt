i believe that it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subject than to specialize in one specific subject . i believe this because the student in an academic field will not have grassping knowledge to get the entire knowledge on one specific subject and it the teacher responsibility to explain the future task which are going to be there in the subject mind . one reason , the student in an academic subject will not require a specialize in one specific subject because the student will get a brief idea about all the subject in the academic field . and this will in turn give a good idea about the future goal , student can decide which will give a better idea of the subject . second reason , the student in an academic subject will not require a specialize in one specific subject because the student will get a broad knowledge of every subject in the academic subject . from this broad knowledge in a academic subject , the student in the future will know whats happening in the society and cultural activity in theie own place . lastly , the student in an academic subject will not require a specialize in one specific subject because the student will be exposed to different type of environment which the student may face in the future and teacher should explain the student about the exploration and understanding of the subject which are going to face in the future by the student . finally i conclude that it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subject than to specialize in one specific subject because a broad knowledge in every subject will give a better idea of all the subject and student will have a bettter idea about the future goal .
