traveling is an impotant part of life . rarely there is a person who doe not travel or doe not like to travel . i think that a person should travel in group , by this a person can have more security . if a person travelling in a group of his friend or family member and they are visiting to some new place they will need a guide . guide can tell u the historical importance of the place we are visiting to . as the guide know all the area and place of interest so he can guide u well . also if we are visiting to a place where there is different type of language used , guide can act a an interpreter . so i am fully agrre with the idea of travelling in a group led by guide . first reason that why i am in the favour of tour guide is that the guide can tell u the importance of that place in detail , which otherwise we cant get enough through other source like book etc. for instance last year me and my friend visited some historical place in india like agra , delhi and jaipur but we people do n't think like hiring a guide , so v faced much problem over there . second reason in favour of hiring a tourist guide is that the guide is well known to the area where we are visting and he know very well about the other place which we had not heard earliar . so he can make our travel experience more interesting by introducing u to the new place . another important reason that i am in the favour of tour guide is that we can easily come over the language problem if we are visiting a place with different language . for example if we are visiting european country than we might encounter with the language problem over there . and we can come across the difficulty of interacting with people . a tour guide can act a an interpreter between u and the people of the other region we are visiting to . to summarize , the best way to travel is in group led by tourist guide , so that we can come to know in detail about the place we are visiting to , we can enhance our experience by introduction of new place and we can handle the situation of language problem and last but not the least by travelling in a group we can have a sense of security .
