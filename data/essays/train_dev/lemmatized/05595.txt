advertisments are helpful for all company , it help them market their product in a fascinating way that will convince others . with all the help a one minute show advertisement is carring to a company , i agree that most advertisement make produts seem much better than they really are . people who get amused with a certain advertisment that pop out on the television every couple of minute , in my opinion these people are sick , because they get attracted to a certain product without even knowing what doe this product consists of . companies try to win our attention with a silly advertisment to convince u , and i ca n't say they dont gain our attention . most advertisments make product look much better , and the prove is that when you buy the prcoduct you get shoked with the type of quality and the exaggerated advertisment done for it . in my opinion all company sell the same product without even caring wether the product is useful or not , befefitible or not . manegers may forget about their conciouns and work for the aim of money . in conclusion , be wise and pay attention to what is going around you , because you might reach a certain point that you might lose yourself following dream that doe not even exist .
