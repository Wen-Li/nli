there are some reason to believe that yuong people enjoy life more than older people do but , personally , i think that nowadays it is n't so . in my opinion yuong people want to enjoy their life but they want a lot of thing and resoult is that they do n't fell happy never . on the other hand old people , actually not very older , have a good experience to enjoy their life whit a lot of thing . i believe this because they have a lot of possibility , such a more free time than yuong people and more money . i think that in this society money is very important for everythings because this help yuo to enjoy yuor life . for example yuo can go on holiday where yuo want . instead young people ca n't because they need an allow of parent and they must go to scholl . so they ca n't go on holiday where they want . also this topic depend on the bheviour of people because there are a lot of different character . in my experience i 'm sure that my life is more interesting today than when i wa very yuong . i feel this because i have a life experience that help me to grow up better . when i wa teenager i had problem that now i fell stupid . for this reason i could n't enjoy my life in the past , but now it is all different . i enjoy my life whit my friend , for example to go dinner togheter or to go dancing . i prefer simple situation because to enjoy my life i don-t need a lot but only my friend . uin conclusion , i think that it is important for the life that everybody fell well and consequently yuo can enyoj your life every day better .
