i met a lot of successful people in my life . all of them have always tried new thing and take risk . i agree with this statement . infact , in order to have success in life , is important trying new experience . i think that the more you do in life , the more you learn . if you just do what you already know how to do , you will never succeed in your life . an example that can support what i wrote is the analysis of the attitude of one of my best professor : silvio abati . my oral medicine professor is a great person and he is very successful in the hospital and university where he work . many colleague look for him when they do n't arrive at the right diagnosis for their patient . moreover he is very admired by his student for his interesting lesson . he often tell me how he had been able to become such a good doctor and teacher ! . when he wa a student he had many school friend that studied just on one book , while he used to read more than one book and he always reviewed literature of a specific topic . he also went to meical meeting even if he could n't understand everything . to be sucessful in your work you have to increase your knowledge a much a possible without being afraid of risking . like my professor , many other scientist found out important discovery just risking and betting on what they were doing . we have just one life so i think is important to exploit it a much a possible `` without any brake '' . i 'd like to be a silvio abati in my life , and i will follow his advice ! risk !
