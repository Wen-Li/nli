nowadays , our society provides u with a new kind of difficulty : we always have to evaluate the pro and the con of what we are going to do in order to keep our job or our husband or wife . consequently , we can observe two behaviour in the population : some of u keep on trying new thing and taking risk to reach the success . others prefer doing what they already know to do well . we are going to see whether a solution is better than the other one or not . first of all , when you only keep on doing what you already know how to do well , you never discover new activity and thus , you do n't try thing that you could however enjoy . to illustrate my point , i can explain my own experience : i have always played rugby during my childhood , and i reached quite a good level . nevertheless , 2 year ago , i realised that i had never tried to practice another sport and that 's why i decided to become a triathlet . although at the beginning i found it hard to swim during many kilometer , i can claim now that really enjoy this new sport and that it allowed me to discover a new , more individual activity . thus , i could live a new kind of success . secondly , when you are working on a project , two solution are available . the first one depends on your own knowledge , and ask you to avoid any kind of risk . in that way , you will perhaps be able to keep your job during a long time . but is that the only thing you can hope during your entire life ? i would rather say no . it 's obvious that one day , you will want to have more responsabilities . and the way to that success is to try new thing and to take risk . to put these idea in a nutshell , i would rather say that i agree with the statement . nonetheless , perhaps that 's the best solution is somewhere between these two extreme .
