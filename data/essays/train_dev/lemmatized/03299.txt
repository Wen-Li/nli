cars are associated with the twentieth century -- they were created at the beginning of this century . nevertheless , since a decade , the sell of car in europe and in the united states of america are decreasing ; general motors and ford are still in the top 5 of the best car company , but the first one is not an american . because of environmental issue such a the greenhouse effect caused by emission of carbon-dioxyde , we may wonder if in twenty year there will be fewer car in use than there are today . even if , in my opinion , in the industrialised world car are tending to decrease because of the pressure of some environmental think-thanks , group or organisation , i fiercely believe that there will be more car in twenty year than now . indeed , a host of country which are nowadays in development , may reach their maturity in these twenty year -- for instance , when the asian world , such a china or india , will be considered a industrialized country , i suppose that an indian or a chinese car constructor would be next to the toyota 's rank -- a car major companie . in other word , even though the industrialized world may do a host of investment in common transport such a bus or subway , i assert that in twenty year there will be more car than now . oil rersources , which is the first car energy , are plummeting , and on the opposite , the demande is skyrocketing ; thus , it 's tantamout to saying that if there will be fewer energy in twenty year , there will be fewer car . however , i still maintain that there will be more car : during these twenty year , i suppose that alternative car 's enegies might be founded or created by scientist or ecologist , and therefore , that car would be still abble and allowed to be driven . the twentieth century is the century of car . this one may be a bridge between two kind of transport . nevertheless , the gap is still deep , and that 's why i think that there will be more , and not fewer , car in twenty year .
