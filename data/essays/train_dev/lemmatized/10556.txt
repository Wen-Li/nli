successful people try new thing and take risk rather than only doing what they already know how to do well . i completely agree with this statement . most of the people are not willing to take risk in their life . this is due to their fear of failure . their idea , view and opinion remain confined to themselves . they are not willing to take the risk of impling their idea and therefore gradually stop thinking about the various alternate way and mean of doing thing . one can be successful only if he is ready to take risk . the first and the foremost benifit of taking risk is that you get the first mover advantage . you will be the only one to know it ! for example in case of business enterprise , if the manufacturer take the risk of investing it fund in the innovation department for the development of better quality product with efficient use of resourses and new technique of production then they get the advantage of being the first one to introduce such a product in the market . they can fix the price a they have no compatition and earn huge profit . also , there are some other advantage of taking risk like the bigger risk you take the bigger the gain will be ! but at the same time i will call it more like a gamble . it involves a lot of uncertainities and some time what you expect will not happen at all . at that time you will have to face the consequence . the best way to handle the problem of `` risk taking '' is to look at the probability . if the event is most likable to happen then take the risk and if there is any doubt about it take a smaller risk . but remember the bigger risk the bigger gain and hence only the people who take risk become successful in life .
