will there be fewer car in use than there are today ? my opiniont is yes . i believe with the development of breaking technology today that will lead the world to a brand new transportation time and cut down the car in use . every morning in the rush hour , we can see the traffic jam and serious air pollution around u . people suffer from that and our child live in a worse environment . it make many goverments of country set way to result this big problem and want to bring a better life to their citizents . recently , we found that there is fewer and fewer gasline left on the world . this problem push human to creat a new style of transportation . goverment start to establish public transportation and encourage citizents to use that well . everyone ha the responsibility to protect our earth . besides , evironment issue ha been raising for these few year . people around the world graduately focus on the protection way of our environment . therefore , most people will follow the goverment 's order to try their best to use public traffic like subway , skytrain . to sum up , i believe 20 year can bring a lot of change . the change include people 's manner and technology . people realize the importance of our earth and make action to do something and technology will help people to find a better way to live . therefore , i believe taht the number of car will decrease in twenty year . that 's also my hope .
