although many people think that only during youth we can realy enjoy life , i do n't agree with this statement and i will now give some reason to support my idea . first , i think that in the last year youngh people do n't have any more time to spend in enjoying life . the stressing course of moden life do n't allow them to stop a minute and taste it . indeed they have to study hard and a lot to be able to find a job . on the countrary retired people have a lot of time the they could spend by making holiday or just doing what they like to do . for example since i wa ten year old , i dream what i will do during my retirement time because since that age i have only studied to manage to succed in my future job without , thus , having the time to enjoy the best year of my life . second , i think that even though many physical problem add gradually during life time , they allow old people to do what they want . nevertheless these physical problem are n't invisible and with the pas of the time they become a problem , sometimes a serious and bad problem . however , a cicero said , the age is n't a ill . indeed if physical problem come inesorabily nevertheless they take with them more wiseness . an aged people is wiser than a young people who ca n't understand the real and beautiful meaning of some little action or experience . in conclusion i think that old people are able to enjoy life more than young people . indeed they are alble to know the real sense of life thaks to their wiseness . on the contrary young people stop to the superficial and physical level without achieving the deepest one .
