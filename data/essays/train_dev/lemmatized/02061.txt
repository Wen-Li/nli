considering the population of the world today and distribution of income rate among country , it is hard to give an immidiate answer to the question about the number of car in use in twenty year ' time . let me brirefly state why i have chosen to emphasize an ambiguity instead of an exact answer . first of all , the population of the world is growing rapidly which might create the impression that there would be more car in use a there would be more people living on earth . it is true for the case of turkey for example . i came to observe that automobile gallery in turkey are the best profit maker and also the number of car sold increase dramatically each year . but taken from another aspect , it could quite be the opposite . the rapid growth of population is observed more in underdeveloped or developing country whose gross national product or income per caput is very low . then it would be more likely for the citizen of such country to tend to use bus or train which would be a much cheaper way of transportation . in india for instance , one can easily notice this situation . secondly , the increase in the number of people living in a city might push it dweller to make use of public transportation . not because that these people can not afford to buy car but because that they do n't want to lose their valuable time on road , stuck in the middle of a never-ending traffic jam . let 's take the example of new york city . even the mayor of this city is said to be using the subway in order to evade from the traffic and promote the use of subway . yet there is also the case of california where we can see anyone at any age to own and drive a car . because of it geographical characteristic , it is almost impossible to live one 's life without a car in los angeles . not that the city is overcrowded such a new york . but because there are mile in between any two destination . as to my personal observation , there are a body of reason both to agree and disagree with the statement . in the end , whatever the sings and predilictions are , we live in a world of unpredictibility and suprises . who know wheter a genious scientist would come up with a more time and energy saving invention than a car , or not ?
