there is a well known idea stating that young people enjoy life better than older people do . we are going to show that , in a sense , it is true since one can not deny that the craziest thing and most thrilling decision we make happen when we are young . then we will proove that older people enjoy life a much a younger people do , but simply in a different way . when we are young , we think about our life a exiting , or at least a more attractive a the one of older people . we travel more ( it is easier for u to travel ) , and experience lot of thing . for instance , i spent last year in wales , and i think that it would not have been possible if i had been thirty or forty year old , with a husband , child , and a house . this wa a unique experience , and i really enjoyed it . my young age enabled me to live it . however , my firm belief is that older people enjoy life a much a we do , but in a different way . of course , when people get older , they have more and more responsabilities , and it becomes harder for them to free themselve , to spare time for their leisure if they are working , and , if they are retired , they probably do not wish to enjoy life in the same way a young people do . they may appreciate a great deal to play with their grand child , or enjoy to play card , for instance . moreover , and in my opimion , old people can actually have a definitely exiting life , and enjoy it entirely . by the same token , i know older people who travel , cross continent , and appear to lead a life even happier and fuller than young people are supposed to do . to conclude , we may say that the statement considering that young people enjoy life more than older people do can not be taken for granted . as far a i know , one can be young and lead a rather boring life , a well a one can be retired and lead an exiting life . it all depends on each individual 's character and state of mind . stereotypes rarely happen to be true . .. !
