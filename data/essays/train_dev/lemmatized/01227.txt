cars , which are considered a mean of necessity now a day , were considered a luxury in 1950 's and 1970 's . people since 1970 ha increased using car because they stand for prestige . the present topic is use of car in twenty year , whether there will be more or few car in use . there are both advantage a well a disadvantage of using car . advantages could be 1 ) economical , a the whole family could travel at the same time and cost le when compared to the expense of travelling by train or bus . 2 ) second advatnage could be halting or taking rest when wanted . the disadvanatges could be 1 ) pollution , 2 ) increasing traffic , 3 ) more accident . now-a-days , people in city like london , tend to leave their car at home and prefer travelling by train to their destination and this probably could be due to increased traffic , which delay people from commitment . so i agree with the statement that in twenty year there will be fewer car in use . the second point that incline me to take the side of the statement is pollution . most of the people are suffering with respiratory disease like asthma , chonic bronchitis and for this pollution could be blamed partly . people who lived all their life working in bigger city tend to retire in country side to avoid air and sound pollution . so this could be one of the reason that in future use of car will be lowered . the third point which support my decision regarding fewer car in use in twenty year is obesity and physical fitness . people are more bothered about their physical fitness a they are busy with the work and ca n't exercise in leisure time . so a a matter of fact most people to improve and maintain physical fitness ride bike to work than using car . so to conclude , with all the above reason there will be fewer car in use in twenty year .
