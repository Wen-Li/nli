every age ha it way to enjoy it and to live it the way you want , nevertheless to specify a certain age which is more enjoyable that other it would be difficult . enjoying your life doe n't depend on what you are doing ? but on do you love what your are doing or not ? and so it 's not easy to diffrentiate between who is enjoying his life more than other , older people life or young one . enjoying life may have many point of view which depends on the person himself . as for example someone may enjoy playing sport everyday or at least continously , in that case he would be enjoying his life more when he is young than being old , a he wont be able to exercise or play whatever he wa playing everyday . another case , someone would enjoy spending his life wathcing tv , reading news paper , and watching everyday 's news . so in his case he would find much more time to do that after retirement from work , so he would enjoy being an old aged man than a young one . for businessmen their enjoy is to be always in succes , and to be on the top of the market , or on the top in his field . moreover they would like to have a family always there for him caring ad loving him . such thing could n't be acheived in young age , succes in work would be acheived after lot of experience , which is gained by lot of situation passed by throught year and year of hard working . so they would enjoy their life when they are elder . others who always like adventure and being in risk and so on , whom are always feeling there is more to explore and much to do . and they are always having risky travel or such stuff wount enjoy their life when they are old a much a they were when they were young . and so , to cut it short enjoying life depends on everyone 's character and interest which differs from one to another , and so there is no any specific age to enjoy your life in .
