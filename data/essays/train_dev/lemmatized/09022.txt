i strongly agree with the statement that young people do not give enough time to helping their community because i have observed that nowadays everybody is occupied with her or himself . for example last month i had a terrific accident and i wa not able to attend my class so i wa depending on the helping hand of my classmate . but although they recognized my absence knowbody wa willing to help me with my homework . that wa an hardtime experience for me . thus , i have many friend i felt so alone . another good example is the behaving towards older people . i sometimes sit in and overcrowed bus and an old woman is coming in but nobody besides me want to stand up and offer the woman his or her seat . that make me sad . or helping old people with their housework would be a good possibility to pay attention to them but nobody ha time to do this because of a full activity plan . to my opinion every person should treat the other person like he himself want to be treatend by someone else . that mean when you are observing that your neighbour need help then do not hesitate to help him because next time probabily you will need his help . the most important thing to me are the people who suround me for example my parent , frieds and neighbour . and therefore i always try to keep my eye open and help them when they are in need because i now know how it feel to be without help . for me it is also clear that i would help oder older people in any occasion because when i am old i need the others help to . to sum it all up i strongly believe that young people should change their attitude towards other people by spending more attention to the need of other people . so that they will change from selfish young people to one who pay attentin to their friend , neighbour and to all other people .
