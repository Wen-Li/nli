i firmly believe that , in the twenty-first century , specializing in a specific subject is much more important than having broad knowledge of many academic subject . this is for the reason that with developing technology and the accumulated knowledge of humankind through century , having broad knowledge on any subject is not sufficient to make research , experiment or , consequently , any development . it is known that aristo worked on various branch of science from psychology to biology and physic . however , when the circumstance of the ancient greek civilization is compared to those of 20th century it will be quite clear why einstein did not follow the footstep of aristo and merely , specialized in physics . in aristo 's era , humanity had not developed at all and wa living it early stage . in this context , aristo had the opportunity to bringforth the most basic concept which were valuable then , but are a part of our daily life , now . considering the technological condition and the level of the knowledge of humanity , einstein conceived that in order to step up he should focus on a single subject . because being a member of the 20-century-old humanity he should learn a subject by heart , not only the main topic related to it but also the very detail . that is , learning physic is a stepping stone to learn modern or quantum physic . the general behaviour of the discipline of science is supporting this idea . as the researcher continue and the development are achieved new discipline are born from an existing branch of science . physics wa just physic at all , but a it is understood that there is something more to it , electronics , mechanics , metallurgy etc. began to be considered a different branch . to sum up , i should say that i agree with the idea of knowing single subject but being the expert of that field , is far more better than having broad knowledge of many subject which is identical to being able to talk of many subject at first but is not able to keep pace with the real expert of that particular subject . it should not be disregarded that every effective person in today 's world , whether a politician , an academic person , soldier or a sportsman is specialized in single subject and that is why the people around the world know them .
