`` in twenty year there will befewer car in use than there are today '' . this statement can tell me a person who do n't belive in the progres of any city . there are the people , that say this , because they use the car only twice on the week , but for example , an transporter that use the truck or the her car for th eher job , he can not think minimally , that in twenty year there will be fewer car than today . in my opinion is that there are will be many car in use in the next future . one reason , for my opinion , is that the car is one important part of progres , because what will began the world , is there decrease the number of car . i think will there are more problem on the trasport sector , prahps the only point better of view is that there are littel pollution on the air , that we breathing every day . to resolve this problem thare are different solution , that can be an change of kind of car 's engine , a a engine that ha a power the idrogean or the light 's solar . therefore , i hope a world with few car , but this is not possible , because the people is increasing and they need job , and last ring of this cirle is a transport with car .
