in my country there is a famous sentense that say , if you know the reality today it will be easy to know the history , for this reason i thik is important to understand idea and concept , but to learn fact also is usefull . first , if the student learn idea , they are capable of practicing their knowledge to some example or fact in the real life , i remember that when i wa studing history i undestood the concept of revolution but only when my teacher gave me some example i could understand the real meaning , and after it is easy for me to developesome idea about the industrial revolution , or social revolution . i wa learn also different thecniques in math for fact . in addition , there are some efficient method to teach , for example if the teacher give in clase un concept , after the student should make a a homework un example associated with this concept , and i am sure the student are not going to forget this word . as a student the most important thing is do not learn subject with my memory because these kind of learnig is easy to forget . second , when the student to learn fact they can associate some cause or consequence and make conclusion , but to conclude it is not possible only if the student have only idea and concept . education ha made important advance in this area and in the actual word , intelligent person is who can applie the knowledge or the theory in the real life . it will be usefull learn concept and fact at the same time and inmediatly to practice above real example in a company or a school in conclusion ti undestand idea and concept and too learn fact both are essential . however i think it is necessary for student to have idea and concept clear because these are the base to developed some interesting new project or knowledge , thus if have have to choose over these point a most important i would choose to understand the idea a first step .
