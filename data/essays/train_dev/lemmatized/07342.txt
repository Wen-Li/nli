homenkind always need success to reach good life standard therefore succes is a very important aspect of human life . everyone ha different point of view about the idea of being successful . some assume that , trying new thing and taking risk is better than making what they do well , in contrary to those some assume that , doing what you already how to do well is better . i personally agree with the first idea . these are my following reason . firstly , success is related with gaining new experiment and making new change . everyone need to change and must develop their self . for devoloping and advanceing , sometimes people take lot of risk . because when you are trying a new and unmaked thing you can loose your other qualification . i think that , a successful person should be creative . for that reason , these people should make new experiment that others ca n't do . because they have ability and they are capable to do this . history is full of with those courage people . in addition , successful people should be hardworking and persist . they should always want to invent new thing and should always be inclined to changeing . for example , there are lot of scientist in the history that they established the world unknown rule . we can give albert einstein for an example . when he wa at school he wa n't a perfect and brillant student . just because when he wa at he classroom he always ha thinked about the world existance any any other unpublished stuff . after year he discovered lot of thing about thhe enviroment and he became one of the most well-known scientist in the history . the last but the least , when anybody changeing his or her expertise , he or she take a lot of risk . if people attend to discover new thing , they sould educate other people around them and share their information about their expertise . furthermore , when you are trying to make a new thing in many way you should delete your ex-career . also , in your new direction you may not get succed . in that position you might loose your respect , money and selfconfidence . on the other hand , if you succeed then you would be more valuable member of your community . all in all , a i said before successfull people should try new thing and take risk rather than doing what they already know how to do well . i hope humankind doe n't disregard what i mentioned .
