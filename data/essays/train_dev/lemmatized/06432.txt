in my opinion a lot of advertisement increase the desire of particular thing in people and then it seem much better than another that are equal . such a shoe , there are some brand of shoe that make an advertisement by television , journal , and then guy will prefer a specifical brand than others , but there are n't a lot of difference by one or another 's pair of shoe . the television play an important role about this topic , all the day on tv we can see a lot of advertisement and our choose can be influenced by this . a lot of people watch the tv and generally follow medias and the brand know this and then spent a lot of money for making them visible . sometimes if i am skilled about the thing ( such a computer , car . .. ) i can be aware that another unadvertise brand can be more efficiently , can be better , can have more quality than what i 've seen on tv , and this enforce the topic . when a brand spent some money for make it 's advertise on tv the price of his product raise but not necessarly raise also the quality , but a lot of people buy him without know the effectively quality , only because they have seem him on tv or others medium . the charateristics of a product can be the same ( or le ) than another but if a product have a specifical sign on it will be more desiderable . many time the person who buy an advertise object can be not very happy of his article simply because will see another brand with more better charateristics than him . the advertise can be not exhaustive and can confuse the buyer , it making the product more better than it is really . the people that do n't interest about the effective quality of product that them buy often are unhappy because they spent so much and have a lower quality product .
