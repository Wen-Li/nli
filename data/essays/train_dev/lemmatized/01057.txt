i agree withe the statement that understanding idea and concept is more important than learning fact . for three reason . the first reason why i agree is understanding idea and concept is more important than just learning the fact is according to my experience . when i wa 10th grade i hated math that is because i am not good at math . i just memorized the fact but i did not know why the answer is . but , when i wa 11th grade , my math teacher said that i have to know the idea and concept to do well in the math . from then , i did not memorized the fact , instead , i studied the idea and concept . after the few month , i became to do well in math . according to my experience , i think understanding idea and concept is more important . second , to understand idea and concept we have to think long , patiently . during this process we can learn the fact automatically and we will not forget the fact . and during the process , to understand idea and concept , it will make u to think more flexibly . and make u more logically . and the last a we understand idea and concept we can understand the fact more . beacuse , understanding idea and concept may make u to think more flexibly and more logically , may we make u tounderstand the fact more and according to my experience i agree with the statement that understanding idea and concept is more important than learning fact .
