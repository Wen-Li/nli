traveling from one place to another is a good experiemce for everyone 's life . i think traveling by your own or with a group of people you know is more fun because , firstly , you will have the chance to go wherever you want . second , it will teach you how to discover new place . thirdly , it a good way to learn how to read map and to be dependent . i completely disagree that the best way to travel is in a group with a tour guide . to go wherever you would like is better than to be stucked with a group of people who are following a touring guide . for example , in every country there are some place which are nicer than the othersm . the tourist guide choose some of them to visit and leave the others that he or she feel are not interested to visit . however , the place which are left might be nicer in other people 's opinion . so being traveling alone will guarantee a good chance for you to visit what you would like . being afraid to be lost is the main reason for those who choose to travel with a tour guide . in my openion it is more enjoyable to be able to find and discover new place by your own . despite the fact that you might get lost sometimes , the beauty come at the end of the trip in finding what like . traveling alone force you to learn how to read map and to be on your own in the middle of no where . for example , studying the map before traveling is a good way of specifying where to go and what the best shortcut are . it teach how self-confidence and being more mature . relying on others is not going to help you when those people are not around to risk you . finally , traveling alone with some people you like is better than joining a group of people and being attached with them where the tour guide take them . to travel alone will increase the chance of going to the place that you like and the pleasure of discovering new one . it will teach you how to read map
