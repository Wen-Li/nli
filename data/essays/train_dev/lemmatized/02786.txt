have you ever noticed how young people enjoy their life and how older people do in this twenty first century ? i agree that every person contains his/her own style of how to enjoy life . it is not a matter of age . different stage of life bring different pattern of how to do it . in this eassay i wil explain in a positive manner both how young and older people could live their own life regardless of age . firstly , young people usually love to enjoy their life intensently . for example , once the turn 18 year old , which is the legal age in order for them to get indenpendent , they like to go out with their friend , and dance all night ( if it is possible ) . in addition , they could get their driver license exam , by doing this they will be able to buy their own car , which also make them feel more independent . moreover , they may be healthy sufficient in order for them to join different type of sport , that really require to be in optimal health condition . secondly , older people have their unique way of enjoying their own life . for instance , there is a certain age that an old person love to make some planns . a 65 year old couple , will enjoy to be in a quite envirement while they are having a romatic dinner . if they plann to celebrate every marriage anniversary , they will choose a restful hotel where they would not be disturbed by any type of noise . on the other hand , a young person will look for another type of envirament . furthermore , older people will not have a good health condition , which will limit them to be more creative . however they will still enjoy form several activity that do not require them to be that healthy . for example , they could spend time swimming , playing golf , and playing card . in conclusion , i am strongly conviced that the age doe not affect how people could enjoy their life . there is multiple manner of how to do this . even though not every person ha a healthy condition , there is always a way of how to enjoy a life .
