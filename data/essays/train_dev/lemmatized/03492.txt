some people may believe that the younger , the more enjoyable thier life , and others may not . personally , i believe the older people can enjoy thier live more than younger people for the following reason . first , older people get more knowlegdes based on experience than young people according to the time of thier live . knowledge based on much experience help our live fruitful one . for example , when we go on a trip to unknown place , if we had experienced any trip to other palce , we could enjoy at the new place because of the knowledge for how to get with unknown place and people . secondly , older people usually have more friend than young people . friends make our life usefule one . for instance , young people only have the friend at thier schoolage , while older people have not only friend of their schoolage , but also those who meet at the workplace or the place belonging after graduation . moreover , if we get marriage , we have more relative including relative in law . as a result , we could get new friend among them . of course , young people also get marriage , but take an example for student of colledge or unievrsity , they are too busy fro studing to get marriage . so , the rate of marriage among older people tend to become higher than that among younger people . consequently , older people have more friend and could enjoy their live . according to the above mention , i beleive that the older , the more enjoyable their life . however , the older person tend to get health problem due to aging . thus , i would like to denote that the older and healthy people could more enjoy their live comparing with the ordinary young people
