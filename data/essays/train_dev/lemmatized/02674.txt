i do believe that it is not about agree or disagree . i do believe that it depends on the people themselves . there are two kind of people and let u listen to there opinion . first group say that it is a good idea to be led by a tour guide . they say that the guide know better than u and he is capable to answer all kind of question that we have ; therefore , we will be able to know everything about the thing that we are visiting . second group say that it is a bad idea because we have to consider the time factor . for example , if we liked somthing and we want to spend more time on it we would n't be able to do it becuase we are not alone . beign without a guide will give u the opportonity and the flixibility to do what we want whenever we want . both of the group agreed that being with a tour would give them more information about the thing that they are visiting . again it depends on the people . if you asked me which you did , i would go with one . i do n't like to be rushed and i do n't like to be tied . being free is a good thing specially when when i am visiting new site .
