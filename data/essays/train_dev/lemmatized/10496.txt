it 's a common secret that nowadays we are working so hard and thus make u not to have so much time to do anything . that effect our free time where our fiurst choice is to relax from our job . so , when is the time for u to decide what thing we must buy in order to fulfill our need , the only help that we can get is from the advertisement . it 's worth to say that they are everywhere on tv , magazine , newspaper e.t.c . because usually we do n't have so much time to judge which product is better than another one , we follow the advertisement a a guide in our consuming habit . often it happens , some product to be not so good for their price or sometimes the quality to be le than the expected . that happens because we are conveinced about the product we bought is the best one . that the aim of a good advertisement . the aim is to buy something that is not the cheapest or the best according to quality , but that one they want from u to buy . as an example i choose to tell you about car . many time there are model that are not so pretty to see , but after a small period of time we discover that we pay attention to their appearance and sometimes we are at the position to discus about replacing our car with them or even buy one of them a a second one . another most frequent example ha to do with woman and the kind of clothes thah are used to wear . they are usually follow what the add want and from time to time we manage to have problem with the closet in our house . on the other hand we are so lucky from the result that we do n't say a word . that 's a good if you follow the fashion . generally speaking i agree that we are victims of the add but on the other hand there is no such a big damage
