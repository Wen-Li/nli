at school , at university ( ... ) , we can see lot of student who have either broad knowledge of many academic subject or a specific subject . we can wonder what is the most important of these two issue for a student . i will answer to this question in two part and explain the best issue for a student . on the one hand , it is a good idea to be specialized in a specific subject because it mean that the student is very interested in a subject and can continue this one in postgraduate study and maybe have a fantastic job related to this subject . for example , a student who is only specialize in economic can improve his level thanks to a phd and why become an economic teacher or a economic journalist . .. so , it can be very interested to have a specific subject where we are very good . moreover , being specialize in a subject mean that the student must have very good grade , hence am accomplishment for the student who is fond of this subject . on the other hand , i think it is a very bad idea to be specialized in a subject and it is much better to have broad knowledge of many academic subject . actually , a student specialized in one subject must have very bad grade in the other subject whereas having broad knowledge in lot of subject allow to the student to have mid or quite good grade in all the subject . as far a i am concerned , i prefer having arround 12/20 in all the subject than having 18/20 in a specific subject and 8/20 in all the others . i think a good aplication form must show that the student is polyvalent and not good in one subject and bad in the others . finally , i qgree with the statement . it is , of course , much better to have broad knowledge of many academic subject than to specialize in one specific subject .
