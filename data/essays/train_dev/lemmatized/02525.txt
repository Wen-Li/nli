marketing is said to be a great field because it help consumer become familiar to the truth about the product . but , do the good quality claimed by an advertisement always match with the product ? some company make survey and get some people to try out some product before they come out ; they get their feedback and make ajustments to the quality of the product accordingly to satisfy their client and of course some do not and just care to secure the company profit . this is when they do n't point out side effect , or some particular condition and everyone think that a product will work no matter what . for instance , we had seen a lot of advertisement about some fitness equipment , with people testifying they have lost ten , twenty or more pound within a few day using the new machine , but they omit to talk about the environment in term a food , daily nutrition , other related sport activity that stimulate the result . as a fool , you acquire this new tool which since you believe is magic , will give you result you over estimate and here we go again , you have been trapped ! also the magic `` pill '' work the same way . consumers get crazy to acquire them and expect the most out of them but to not estimate irreparable damage they can incurr into their body . they talk a lot about surgery to get slimmer , younger , flat ab , face and breast lift , but the emphasis on the post surgery time is all forgotten not to say it doe not exist . another example of misleading resides in telemarketing call . people are being more and more aware of them eventhough some others still get caught without asking what is the trick ? definitely , beside the part of lookingadvertisements personal research is of a great help for any decision someone will have to take and that will lead in the right direction , it might take a little bit of your time , but i beleive it will be worth it .
