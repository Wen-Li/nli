after people get something beautiful , we start to feel that we want it more . if we have to take a risk , we might take that risk and try to get it because we can get even more beautiful thing . however , doe everybody follow their feeling ? specially in the business ? i agree with the statement that successful people try new thing and if they should take the risk , they will take it . firstly the reason why i think is because , there are possibility for successful people to success even more . what is the risk for them is it is not hundred percent of posibillities , i believe . secondly it is possible that they want to do new thing about their business and try their luck . for example , we bet the money in casino and won lot of money luckly , what will we do ? some people , do not spend on betting anymore and leave the casino or some people believe that they have strong luck that day and will keep spending on it . on the other hand , in the casino , we can not keep winning a a similar to business and this topic . in my opinion , people sometime should not take the risk , stay where they are , decide carefully and think with reality . to not follow their feeling , might cause more success in their business . successful people more likely to take the risk rather than only doing what they already know how to do well . without risk , it is difficult to become successful and get what we want . however , it is not the only answer for everything . i believe we should take the risk when we should . on the other hand when we should stop and stay where we are , we should stop and stay such a losing our money in casino .
