i agree with statement that nowdays young people do not give enough time to helping their community . this ha resulted form a cumulative effect of various factor like the fast pace of the life , changing global scenario , changing perspective etc . due to fast pace of the life , the amount of time a person spends with his family ha steadily decreased . this ha accompnied with a substancial reduction in time that a person spends in the community . also living in nucleated family lead to increase in responsibility and thus further lead to decrease in time available for him to spend in helping his community . young people nowdays have become very narrow minded in there outlook a they feel that instead instead of spending time for helping their community , they can devout the same time to earn more and thus live a lavish life . during this course they forget that human being is a social animal and by helping his community he is in turn helping himself . this thirst to become rich overnight and desire to live a comfortable life by cutting down on the time they spend in helping there community is the underlying principle behing this change . we see this in our day to day life . during the celebration of various festival we find that most of the arrangement and other thing are looked after by our parent and elder . we rarely see any young mind working there a he feel that it a waste of both him time and energy . this fact becomes self explainatory when we observe the strength of the young people present at the meeting meant for improving service and facility available to the community . to conclude , we can say that this unhealthy change that is being observed in our society will have malignant effect and must be balanced by taking necessary and efficient step .
