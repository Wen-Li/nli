do successful people willing to try new thing and take risk ? the answer is concerned to be negative , but i totally agree the point of view . there are three reason of my opinion presented a followed . first , it is the adventurous spirit that successful people usually have . it is easier to learn new knowledge by asking a lot of question . in addition , it offer more opportunity for them to grasp something new by asking question or reading lot of book . how to make thing they already know more perfect and convenient are the priority thing to them . second , it is the special view that the successful people take with . different from the others , they look thing in the long run but not just a short term . they consider thing not only from one single aspect but also from many point of view in the future . that can actually make sure for their success life . third , it is the unsatisifing with what they already know how to do well make them eager to find more difficult challenge to complete . the more difficulty of the challenge , the more they want . challenging hard thing to sum up , i think successful people are willing to try new thing and take risk rather than only doing what they already know how to do well for several reason , among them by having the adventurous spirit , special point of view , and always not satisfing with what they have .
