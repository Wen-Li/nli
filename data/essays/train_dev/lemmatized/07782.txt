in fact , i disagree with the statement . why ? because the internet . when the internet have n't been built , there are more interaction between people . so you can see many young people in their community to care about the community . the internet is so popular nowadays , those young people in public occasion might disappear , but they have been using their way to take care of the community . for example , young people can set up the community in the internet . if the resident in the community have some issue to discus , they can enter the visual community to change their information or give advice . communicating by the internet is faster and more powerful than the traditional face-to-face method . everyone in the community ha access to the informaion immediately after these information wa post in the community of the internet . and they can react it right away . the government can know the informaion sooner than before and they can adjust the policy about the city . moreover , young people do not always sit in front of the computer . in my community , many young people volunteer to help the elderly people in the community . i , for instance , make a routine to clean the house beloning to theelderly people whose child are far away the community . sometimes , i also serve a the tutor of the orphan in the orphanage . my neighbor , james , also do the same thing with me and we all feel satisfied after helping others . of course , there are many young people like u in our community . based on the preceding point i made , i can conclude that the new generation doe help their community both viturall and pratically .
