i agree wtith this opinion that successful people try new thiungs and take risk rather than only doing what they already know how to do well . there are several reason . in my case , my mother is a succsessful person . however i always think many thingshappened in daily life negatively . for example , now i am in canada to study english . however i had a complain about my class . one of my reason wa that class wa so noisy . many peolpe always speak a lot and i could not consentrate at all . then i discussed with my adviser , mythla . she told me that i will change the class that is more higher level . however i did not have a confidence if i can do well in this level . after school . i told all story to my mother . then she gave me an advice . she told me the story thet she experienced . the story wa whar she went to skiing with her friend . and her advioce wa that if you go to skiing with friend who ha same skill with me , you can enjoy but your skill will not improved . however if you skiing with friend who ha better skill than me , then your skill is more improve . i agreed with her advice . i think the person who doing what they already know how to do well doe not take risk but they will not receive anything instead of their safty . if i will skiing with my friend , for me it is big challenge but i can learn from my fail . and , perhops i will try to do that i will never happen again . everybody have a bad experience . however we can get many advice from it . therefore i think successful people is the person who do not afraid of fail and keep challenge to get new thing .
