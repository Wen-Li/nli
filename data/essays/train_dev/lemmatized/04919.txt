according to the reading passage successful people try new thing and take risk rather than only doing what they already know how to do well and i think that successful people should try new thing beside doing what they already know how to do well . because , when you try new thing , you get to know some different thing in your life , and it will give you a whole lot of new experience and you can have knowledge of different kind of new idea and technique which , you can , implement in your actual business . as you are already a sucessful person , you do not have to bother about loss or any kind of disturbance in your business when you try some thing new . and when you try some thing new you can effectively apply your previous idea and experience into it which you have gained from your routine business . as you are a successful person you have more contact and relation in the commercial market which you can use when you start a new business , a it give you great chance of having a good start in the market . but if you are not successful , and you are new in the business feild then you have to deal with different problem like , you should have knowledge about few important business aspect like production , management , investment , marketing , and many other thing which creates a lot of problem in future if they are not maintained properly . but if you are successful then you can use your previous experience and intelligence . but , if you want to try something new beside your previous business , then first you should consider in which feild you want to invest or which business you want to start . before starting a new business you should thing about what you are investing in , whether it is proper to invest in a particular business rather , because it reduces the amount of risk you take whille trying something new .
