i think that both thing are important for a student , to now factes and conceopts and also to understand idea . first of all i think that it 's importent for people to now factes becouse if you only now idias your nouleg would not be complet . for example i use to only have idias about what arte wa and what hapened in general threw out the century in art history . i allso new general idea about how art evolved in my home country . but sence i dident have especific factes it wa quit difiult to copere what wa happening in peru when some thing else wa happening in another country . with factes i can compear more acuretly and see thi influence that one had toured the other . i also thik that idea are important becouse it helpes a person make there oun thotes obout what they are learning . this is mostly limportant in clases or subjectes like sociology , history , filosofi , and otheres that even though there are some factes that have to be lerened , if you dont understand general concept and idias this nalige would not be of much use any were but in clases . a student is preparing himself for the world , for work , and for life in general . the world is made of strick rouls , factes that we should now but be nead to understand way the roules are there for , and who doe the factes afect u . a bisness man for example need to now the pices of productes a much a how to treat his clientes , what is the best way to reach them , what give beter resaltes . in conclution i think that bouth understanding conceptes and idias is a important a learning factes becouse we need bouth for aure preparation a good profetionals .
