i agree with the statement `` successful people try new thing and take risk rather than only doing what they already know how to do it '' . the reason i agreed is beacause i think you can not make succes if they did what they already know haw to do . if you know how to do it , then other people would know a well . you try new thing and that give u the impact , maybe this is the way to be successful . however i do not think you can succeed by randumly making new idea . you do need to search on them , you need reason and proof to come up with the idea . also you may need some help from other peolpe who ha been through and experienced it . for example president of clothes shop called uniqlo . i think it is one of the most famous clothes shop in japan now day . he made so many new project , and he actually tried . but failled so many time too . he presented to u mass producing . first of all , they started to making simple designed clothes and sold them with very cheep price . before uniqlo did this way of selling clothes , every one would of thought it wa not very good idea of producing so many same designed , cheep , simple clothes . because they thoght that costumer want to buy something more individual and good quality . however uniqlo succeeded by selling product this way . but i have also seen them failling quite badly , that wa when they started to selling vegetable and frite at the shop . it wa an very big impact on u too like the last time . what kind of clothes shop sell vegetable at the shop ? but it did not make a seccessful ending . they stopped selling it after few month . it made such a loss for the company . but the president of uniqlo still doe not stop producing new idea and project . that is why the company is still growing and making a lot of money . i have come to the conclusion that i think even other people think you will not success with it and stop you , they can be wrong sometimes . you might fail a lot of time before you actually become a successful person . but that is the way to success so you should not be afraid , you need to take risk and try .
