i totally disagree with the atatement that in twenty year there will be fewer car in use than there are today . two reason came up to my mind . there have been great car now , therefore , i have some positive advantage which will have been not make car fewer in twenty year , . at first , what i would like to emphasize that technology ha been developed very well in these day . i can say that it is also for car , because almost every car ha got audio player , car navigation system , or even system for talking on the phone when we are driving . everybody ha at least one car each family and we can not live without having car . in addition , we always use car even for five-minute-walking distance in reality . it is so clear that various car syatems are developed recentry and i can not see why it will not continue in the future . perhaps car will have got more effective system that make u more comfortable to drive in . next reason is that car are really important social thing for our country , japan . japan is known for making a lot of car and when i went to foreign country i never go out without seeing japanese car on the load . we often admire to make great deal of car in the world . cars are positively one of our priority so we should not stop making wonderful car for u and also for foreigner who love them . it would be foolish if we make ourselves stop making the great product or have fewer carsthan now . these are my major reason why i disagree with it . i am sure that nothing will be able to replace car , even though there should be such an incredible creature or investigation in the future , because it is necessarily for u for everything such a for keeping our social statement and great work .
