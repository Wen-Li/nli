i actually live in barcelona , a city with a lot of traffic . i have a car but i usually go everywhere by public transport . i only use the car to go outside the city . however , nowdays are a lot of car everywhere and , in general , we use the car for go everywhere . consequently , it 's difficult to imagine a city with fewer car . i really think that in a short period of time it will be le car everywhere . there are a lot of reason for think like that . the first one , is that in some year will be very expensive use the car . for example , the petroleum resource are finishing and everyday the gas price is increasing . another example is that in barcelona in most of the place we have to pay to park the car . this reason make public transport cheaper in comparation with car 's price . the second reason is that in the big city is faster go by public transport everywhere than go by car . we have a very functional and complete underway , with a lot of line . it is also very regular , we have one every five or ten minute . moreover , there are a lot of underway station in the city . if you use this station you do n't have to spend time looking for a place to park the car . on the other hand , the people who live outside the city ha a lot of problem for use public transport . in most of the little city or town , the public transport only work one time in an hour or maybe the station is at 30 minute walking . if this happens , it 's easier and faster go by car than use a public transport . in summary , i think that the number of car will decrease in the big city , with good public transport , and it will be the same in the litlle city and town . unless the goverment improve the public transport overthere . in conclusion i think that it will be fewer car in the future but it will not happen everywhere .
