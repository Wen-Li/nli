as a college student study in taiwan , based on what i do in the past year and my observation on my friend , i agree with that young people nowadays actually do not give enough time to helping their community . i know i am kind of reluctant to admit the truth , yet i think the following reason could explain why we are not able to do so . in the first place , we are actually too busy in our school life . as you know , people at this age are expected by elder or even by themselves to be a competitive a we could be . this mean we have to spend most of our time on taking lecture in different field , learning precious experience from dealing with club affair , and some of u even already having internship in company . in the rest of our time , there are a lot of reading material and project waiting to be treated . and a a human being , we need time to play a well a to take a rest . it is too hard for the young people to put their attention on the need of their community if they are already bearing so many requirement . the other reason is that the concept of helping each other in a community ha not yet formed in my culture . i mean , it is not part of our life . we are told since young to take care of yourself first then consider to give the rest to others . so if a new idea is introducing to my country -- like encouraging youngster to do something for the place they dwell in -- it must first serf a a requirement in school . my college implemented a new policy last year that every student should earn at least 36 service hour before they can graduate . yet the service on school campus is also counted in the required hour . the result is that , most of the student still do not learn the spirit of devoting to their community . i know the fact is quite daunting to those who wish the new generation to do more to where it live in ; however , the reason above which stop u from that also discourages me . i hope thing would get better
