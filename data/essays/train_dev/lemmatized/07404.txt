i agree with the statement mentioned that it is more important for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact . if student learn only fact then they do n't have conceptual knowledge or idea that where and how to use in practical . for example , a math teacher taught one problem and solved without giving the concept of that problem like formula , method or step to perform to solve the problem . this will be difficult for the student , if the problem is twisted or another problem is given in the textbook or may be in the examination . they can not solve the problem a they do n't know the concept of the problem given . so a math teacher should teach the concept of a particular problem initially and based on that idea a problem should be solved by the teacher and then the student keep the concept remembered , so that they can easily solve the any problem based on that concept . for every problem there will be a concept behind to solve it . another example a , if we see the physic book there will be lot of concept for each and every chapter . in that there is a chapter calle `` gravitation '' . in this the idea is about the earth 's gravitation . due to gravity whatever the thing thrown in the air from earth 's surface it will fall on the earth again because of gravitational pull of the earth . if we say to the student that the thing which were thrown in the air from earth will fall back to the earth 's surface , then they just learn the fact . they do n't know the reason . due to this type of learning none of the student will not become good engineer or any other professional . because lack of concept and practical knowledge . even if we take a civil engineer student who do n't know how to build the building and where to build then definitely the building will be collapse . that is why , it is important for the student to learn concept and understand the idea rather than to learn fact .
