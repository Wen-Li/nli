i strongly agree with this statement , everyone who ha being successful ha taken some sort of risk at some point in their life . people do not success just by waiting on oportunities to come to them . for example thomas edison , bill gates and mark benz , all of them made their way to fame and fortune by doing thing out side the box and using their natural talent . in addition they had to take risk in order to get to achive their goal and dream . thomas eddison the most successful inventor of all time , work hard throught his live . his main invention the light bulb , took him 30 year to make it work . he had many offer to work for other people , but he took the risk and used his knoledge and intelligence convined with patience to reach his dream . bill gates the wealthier man in the united state , is also an example of someone who did more than what he knew . a brilliant person that could have spent his life working for a computing company making more money than what the average worker could make in all his carrer . but instead he decided to take the risk and start his own company from scratch in order to succeed under his own name in his field of expertise . mark benz the creator of the first car , everybody thought he wa crazy when he invented the carriage with no horse . however he followed his dream and taking a great risk . he sold all he had in order to build his first engine took him year to finished , his family stop visiting him . on the other hand he proved people wrong and one day drove the first carriage with no horse thru his town . becoming the first successful automaker in the world . successful people go beyond what others think unposible . they take risk in order to follow their dream and go the extramile . they try new thing and at the end most successful people create thing or provide service that are usefull for most human kind .
