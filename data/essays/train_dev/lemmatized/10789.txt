i agree that successful people are not only doing what they already know how to do well but try new thing and take risk . for example , about five hundred year ago , korean naval general yi wa continue win consist japan naval army . but he doe n't confuse it and forecasted more bigger war after a few year . so he made many new ship and training his army . therefore , after a few year he made so biggest win from japan . second example is my mother . she already gave many wealth and became well-known people in society . but in 1998 , korea met imf . as my mother taked risk , she felt to leck education level herself . in fact , she wa graduated elementary school only . so she started middle school course when she wa 45 year old . lastly , graduated middle school , high school , and university . as i am a person who see my mother most nearby , i strongly confuse it . in my opinion , when successful people meet difficult thing , they always challenge new thing .
