i think it is difficult to have a categoric response to this statement because i think it depens on the people . but , i have to agree or disagree with this statement , so i think young people enjoy life more than older people do . first , young people are `` young '' ! it implies a kind of unknowledge of life . they do not have experience and do not know the end of the situation they live ( in general ) . so , a they do know anything , they enjoy more for each situation . moreover , they sometimes think that this situation could maybe never more happens , so they enjoy the present moment . although when you are older , you have a certain experience of life . as you have been young , you had a lot of experience in the past , and you know the end of each one . so , i think older people do not take time to enjoy life when it is possible because they already live it . futhermore , i think young people have generaly a good health ( better than older people ) . so , they have the possibility to do more thing than older people . this good health help young people to take risk without doubt or question . if a young people want to jump , he jump ! and he doe not have the worry of the others . moreover , young people enjoy life because they feel free . they do not have problem at work , or family 's affair . .. only one thing count : themselves . this feeling of freedom help them to be more spontanous or happy . the innoncence of the child stay in each person but is le present in the older people mentality a the young one . young people have this child 's spirit that the older people lose with the year . but finally , i think that older people in appearence can be young people inside . sometimes , older people enjoy life more than young people because of the death which can be near for them . so , they enjoy day a if it wa the last . life is too short , and had to be enjoy every day !!!
