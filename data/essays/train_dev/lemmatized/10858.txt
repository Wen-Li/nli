i disagree with the statement : i think young people are a supportive to their community a they have always been . of course `` being helpful '' ha changed rapidly because of technologic and scientific progress changing very quickly , also there could be a sociological explanation to the actual changing of communities which is in my opinion very important to consider . communities have become more and more diverse , difficult to define and cosmopolitan , a good example is the notoious american melting pot , which of course mean that not everyone meeting for example in a class at school or in a neighborhood or also in a political group might be participating to the same type of ethnic or economic community . not everyone will therefore know what type of activity a young person is actually doing to support the community he feel more integrated in , or how much time he is dedicating to it . that doe n't necessarily mean he is n't participating in community activity . also , our era is moving slowly towards a situation where physical work becomes more and more unimportant and replaceable with technology . that mean young people may be performing very economically sustaining task , for example buying community product per internet , but you still wo n't see them in the actual community supermarket or drug store performing manual task . i actually think that in the situation we live in now , it is much easier to have a strong conscious community identity compared with the ignorant necessity of participation of the past , when many people probably could n't even imagine the existence other parallel community . in this way , young people are often more actively and spiritually involved in their community life than in the past , a characteristic of which for example we have proof in the still growing popularity of volounteer work , naturally influenced by the greater wealth progress in time ha brought to a growing number of people . the so-called `` death of ideal '' that probably would be related to the essay statement in the sense that participating in community life represents a form of actively expressing your ideal , is n't really happening in my opinion - it 's just that the sudden incredible communication possibility which were given to my generation and the national boundary openness along with a situation of peace between at least western country ha thrown u into the void of thousand of contact and knowledge possibility through other culture and community . but now , when the general culture comprises more and more of a wide spectrum of cultural , religious , economic and political possibility , i have the impression that an enormous number of people still feel attached to the culture they come from , their parent , their ancestor etc . genes and community are strong value i doubt history or time will ever distroy . we are not in the brave new world yet , and i do not want to believe that that indifference is the direction we 're going in .
