when you buy a product yo do it for many reason , maybe because it is neccesary for you , maybe because you like it or maybe because someone or something say to you that such product is excellent but , is it really true ? well , i think that this can happen with advertisement . it is fantastic how persuasive advertisement can be . they show the best of the product but obviusly , they do n't describe , if there are , the bad part of them . but like all in this world it will depend on each situation . on one hand for example , there are really good product that can fill all your expectatives and they are just what you are looking for . so , with product like these , i wait that advertisement tell me all the propierties of the product and that they give me the true reason to buy it . but on the other hand , you can feel very dissapointed if you aqcuire a product that is not the same a you believe . and this could be worst when you do that because in the advertisement the product really seem much better . nevertheless , you can reclaim to change the product but this could not always be possible . in my case for example , i had bought hundred of think in order to put on slime , but i realiced now that the only think that work is le food and more exercise . if i have to sum up i will give you an advice : do n't believe so much on advertisement . not always they reflect the true about a product . you have to be sure yourself before aqcuire somethik .
