i agree that successful people try new thing and take more risk than doing the thing which is already known there are several example in various facet of our life . let u discus a few of them in political , science and technology and adventurism . mahatma gandhi , ha fought for freedom and got the independance . at his time it wa completely unthinkable , how one can use non violence a a method of struggle and fight for freedom . had he not tried the new thing and taken the risk , one can not imagine what could have been the consequence . many adventurer ha explored the continent and ocean and found many place and people . with out the temperment and character to try to do thing differently and with out taking risk it would not be possible . at the science and technology front there were million of example . as one of our professor say , to be successful one need not do different thing but do the same thing differently . the same thing ha been implemented by many scientist and we are enjoying their invention . to name few the invention of bulb , telephone , electronic computer , automobile , aeroplane and medicine . the way we are sending space shuttle and unmanned mission to mar and saturn is a telling example of how different the scientist think . the drug discovery also ha seen some radical thinking . unless one try to do thing off beat , it is not always possible to get interesting and useful result . every aspect of our life we can find such example . unless one ha new way of thinking and ability to take risk , he / she can not be successful . if every one doe the same way and think the same way we shall be getting the same kind of result and probably we can not be called human being but robot . successful people try new thing and take risk , converse is also true a per the above mentioned example . but one shall not get carred away and say that doing unconventional and risky thing is the only way to be successful . as again one of my professor put humorosly , ` all the research is crazy thinking but not all the crazy thinking is not research ' . to conclude one shall think differently , do thing which were not tried before and take calculated risk to be successful .
