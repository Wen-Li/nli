nowadays people use to describe our society with quickly changing term . a popular one is : ` the ego-society ' . the theroy of writer or journalist employing this description is that especially young , urban people are very focussed on their career and benefit , not being very interested in communal activity or even in social relationship . from my experience i can say that i know many people who live this way , thinking only of their own interest . at school for example there were much fewer possible activity or club then in former day , because fewer and fewer student were willing to organize or conduct one . most initiative were brought up by teacher who did not recieve much support . there are , of course many example of socially very active juveniles who for example work in institution for disabled people in their free time or simply organize sport club . i think that there is an active culture of helping others without any benefit even among young people . but still the main tendency is to leave such aparently unattractive work to others or demand pay . this developement which can be seen in many of our big city surely ha it reason . advertisement in television keep showing u a world , a very attractive world in which you are not much more than the sum of the thing you own . young people today do not identify themselves with the moral or social value of their parent , they have become out of date . while our parent were for example celebrating parties of their quarter or village nowadays young people prefer anonymous discotheque or bar . they seem to barely identify with the place they live in and many of the older people surrounding them . instead peer group meet in chat room on the internt or shopping mall in the outskirt . since many do not feal being part of their community they have no clear idea what or whom they should give their help and time .
