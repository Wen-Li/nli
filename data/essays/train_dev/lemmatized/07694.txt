in light of the ever-growing environmental concern , such assumption can not be completely dismissed . however , the reason behind such an assumption can be argued with sufficient evidence from both point of view . using current statistic and general population trend , we can only predict what the future beholds . as illustrated by the rocketing oil price around the globe , there is a dwindling supply of oil and gas . the cost of finding and processing these natural resource are rapidly increasing , much to consumer ' concern . in a typical economy , once the price of producing a good increase , the price of consuming that good will consquently increase . ultimately , the price might become too much for an average-wage family to keep up with . if such a trend continues , the world will possibly witness a marked reduction in the number of car on the road . whether the dependancy on car a a mean of transport can be reduced remains unknown . on the other hand , the world is experiencing a colossal population growth . currently , there are around six billion people occupying the planet , however the number are expected to significantly rise in the near future . logically , if more people are present then more car are going to be required to transport them . an argument often made against that is that public transport method , such a bus , train etc . .. will be utilised more efficiently in order to mass transport large amount of people at any one time . however , will people compensate their comfort and personal space in order to reduce the number of car ? finally , many environmentalist are undertaking massive public awareness campaign on the ill-affects of excessive car use . this could lead to governmental legistlations on the number of car per family or similar restriction law . in effect , this will definitely reduce the number of car but will consequently leave many people unhappy . as displayed , one can only make prediction on population activity , especially when it involves large population ' activity . if i wa to predict using the evidence at hand , i believe that such a statement will prove to be invalid and overly ambitious .
