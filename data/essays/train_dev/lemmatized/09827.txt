people have to choose a major before entering in a college . there are specialized major such a for example engineering , languagues , litterature , etc . .. but we are able to choose a study which taught many academic subject . is it better to have a broad knowledge rather than having a specialization in one topic ? on the first hand , i will talk about having broad knowledge of many academic subject . i think it is very important to have a large knowledge of many academic subject . for instance , when i talk to a friend , if he told me a lot of information about several subject , i would find he is very smart . having a broad knowledge of many academic subject prof people thqt we have a huge culture , and it is useful when there is a discussion about a topic . indeed , if we had a broad knowledge , we would be able to talk about everything ! however , there is a drawback . we just have the main point of every subject , we wo n't be able to talk about everything of a subject . that 's why i think that it is better to study several subject , such a for example maths , biology or litterature , when we are at high school and not at the university . indeed , pupil have to try every subject in order to find which way they can take after the high school . high school help u a lot in finding the perfect major we want to study in a university . on the other hand , people are able to choose and to specialize in one specific subject . i think it is better to make this choice because it is useful in order to find a job in the future . for instance , i would like to work a a flight controller in the european space agency ( esa ) . that is why i have to specialize myself in one specific subject : aerospace engineering . if i chose to have broad knowledge of many academic subject , i would have an enormous culture but i would n't be able to find a particular job . to sum up my opinion , i do n't agree with the statement . i think we should specialize in one specific subject in order to find the job we want to have in the future .
