yes i agree with the topic that young people enjoy life more than older people . well , i agree with this topic because young people are very energytic , enthusiastic and can enjoy to the fullest where a old people can not do that a their body is not a active a a young person , perhaps it can not be a active a a young person . it can not be a active a a young person because it is now that that old person body need to take rest because he ha been enjoying allmost all the time when he wa young . for example : young person : a , old person : b ; a is aged between 20 to 25 year and he ha gone to a disco tech to party with all is friend an he ha enjoyed continuosly for 4 full hour . and then b also go to that same disco tech and he could not even dance for 1 hour . well , the difference between the 2 is that a is still a young person and he is very enthusiastic and energytic to dance and party all night where a speaking about the old person that is b is an old man and he can not strain his body . if he doe he will get exausted . his body will run out of energy . if he want to dance like a did then he should be having lot of energy and enthusiasm . there fore i conclude by saying that young people enjoy life more that old people .
