people in all over the world have education during their lifetime . the education never stop . it is impossible to learn everything but it is better if a person have information about everything a much a possible than keen on only one subject and do n't care about the other point . first of all , people judge the others not carefully and it is really difficult to change their idea . for example , in a crowded place where people discus their idea , people may talk about every topic and if you are not have an idea about the subject , people do n't think about your knowledge in another subject . so they would think that even you are uneducated instead of searching you about more . secondly , having information about other subject help another subject to understand easily or better . for example , in botany , it is also necessary to have information about chemist to critise and understand the chemistry of the plant . to sum up , to have a little idea about everything is better than to have an amount of knowledge in one subject . being not only a succesful but also a respectful person is very important in a person 's life .
