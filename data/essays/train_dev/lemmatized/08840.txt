i partly inagreement with the statement . some people enjoy the life when they where young and other when they became old . one of the definations of enjoyment of life is `` living with the people they love '' . in the cycle of generation of human race the relationship play an important role . at young age people look more energetic and active . the communication of the people is so fresh and healthy at that age . with this , people will really get well equiped with so many friend and relative . right from the childhood the people continue to enjoy with the friend , while studying then with work and then with his family up to his next generation . for example consider the case of a newly married couple , the couple is new to the both the family and the atmosphere give a chance to the people to enjoy that time . in some case the young people with a different mentality or due to the atmosphere they grow want to lead the life alone with out any interaction with others . the life like that ha no chance of enjoyment . at the oldage the maintanence of the relation play a major role . if the old people are maintaining the relation right from their young age with the relative , son and grandson they will enjoy the life even better at that age . at that age also the relation that maintained by u make the people to visit u again and again and they insist the people to spend the time with u . for example the love and affection shown by `` mother theresa '' is still visible to the people . these kind of people will definatly enjoy the life at oldage . they can really forget all illness due to age and keep smiling untill their death . on the other hand the people who are not having their childern to look after their need and help them at that age , will suffer so much . for example we can see these type of people in oldage home who suffer alot at that age living far from the family . so people can enjoy the life at both stage that is at young age and old age . it depends on the people maintaining the relation and the love given to the future generation .
