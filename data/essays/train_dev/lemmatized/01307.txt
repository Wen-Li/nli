i strongly agree with the statemet that advertisement drive u to believe their product are better than the truth . it 's surely a way to attract more people to buy the product . but sometimes , the product are really make client disappointed . for example : once a day , when i wa too young , a university student knocked my room door while i wa lonely in the house . she recommanded a type of shoe were very good . it could prevent from humid and firing . then it wa magically to see while the skin of shoe , it did n't get firing . then a young girl curious a me thought it wa very interesting , a a consequence , i bought it . but only after some day , i found the shoe have n't good texture and destroyed by walking . then from this advertisement , i take a lesson : do n't believe adversisements ! when they claim some aspect are really good and attractive , it mean in other aspect , maybe are controversal . when the claim something is high technology , maybe it indicates this product is easily to be destroyed ! but can we prevent the advertisement from daily life ? certainely not . watching advertisement is a way to collect information and get up with the pace of world . and some advertisement are too artical or storical which attact people very much . like microsoft 's advertisement of pentium 4 . they tell u a new generation of computer , though the high-technique such a computer , mobile , mp3 improving very quickly . but they are the fashion . and for me , i think high-technique and make-up thing are toy . they are changeable like the toy i play during my childhood . and they can be the discussion topic . it make u more interesting . though their price are not reasonable . afterwords , though the advertisement always give u product not a good a they claim . but a a daily information , we ca n't get away from them . in a global world today , we also get benefit from advertisement .
