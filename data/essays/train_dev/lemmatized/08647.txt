i strongly agree with the statement that ` successful people are the one who try and undertake new thing but also take risk rather than only doing what they know how to do well . ' although without much further thought being given to the topic , it may seem that people who always do the same thing are ` successful ' in a way , there are many other factor to take into account . in fact , the person who carry out the same task every day or the one who go through their life with the same amount and state of knowledge could be considered successful expert in their area but they do not try to go beyond their limit - a clear sign of success . let 's take the example of a basic biologist in a laboratory whose daily task is to analyze blood sample to detect a disease such a aids . this scientist is obviously an expert in his domain and most certainly successful since the accuracy of his decision affect the life of other people . and yet , this biologist would not be qualified to detect more specific chronic disease for example , thus reducing the scope of what could be considered a success in his area . on the other hand , given the definition of success , it can be implied that the more success one derives is closely linked to the action he or she will undertake and make proof of . let 's consider the business area : a successful manager will most likely be the one that is willing to take up new challenge . by being creative and clearly demonstrating different skill from the one of his or her competitor , this manager will probably take more risk but resulting in higher profit . therefore a manager will appear - and be more successful - if he is willing to face new challenge and take risk that will make his business famous . unlike a business leader who would only gain profit and recognition from copying the work of others , a successful leader will be praised for his or her creativity , a great part of success . bill gates is probably the most obvious example of a manager who wa ready to take risk and accept the consequence of it . who would have thought that his new generation of computer would become the world standard and result in such high profit both for the company and the man itself ? although money should not be considered a proof of success , it is a great part of it . therefore , the more a person take risk , the more exclusive his or her derived product is and the more success he/she is likely to have .
