many people think it is better to have borad knowledge of many academic subject than to specialize in one specific subject . in my opinion , i think it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subject . there ha tow reason that i choose this one . one reanson that is broad knwoledge is very important for u , if we want go abroad . we should have a lot of broad knowledge to gain our personal knowledge . we always stay in china , we have not know a lot of others country history , and this knowledge are still very important to u . if we have broad knowledge of many academic subject we can solve many problem , and we can aslo help others . in another hand , broad knowledge of many academic subject is more interesting than any other knowledge . in china , many student have no chance to learn some other country knowledge . than always listen to the teacher and take note without any personal idea , this problem ha becoming harder and harder . the reanson why i donot choose to have specialize in one specific subject is that i have one experence . when i wa 11 year older , i 'm interested in computer science , and i do a lot of time on it . althought i have known many knowledge on it , i get bad score on other class . a student who have broad knowledge of many academic subject can easily take part in a new student envrionment , but a student who have specialize in one specific subject just can do one thing that he or she can do . according to this above , i think a student had better to have broad knowledge of many academic subject than to specialize in one specific subject .
