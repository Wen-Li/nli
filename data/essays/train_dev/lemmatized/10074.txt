in my opinion both scenario are very important . in fact , it is true that idea and concept are at the base of everything . if you have the possibility to study and understand the theory , you can have a wide vision of the concept . it is also true that experience help you to understand what theory ca n't give you , like fact . in order to explain my theory , try to imagine these two scenario : 1 ) imagine a person that study all the theory , but he doe not never apply them in the real world . i think that in this case you have not the possibility to `` touch '' with your hand what you studied . in this sense the risk is to have a deep knowledge of concept without having experienced them . thus , is theory complete without experience ? 2 ) imagine a person that ha never studied ( independently by the reason ) and ha not a deep knowledge of idea and concept . the person make experience with the world where he life , he understand fact and concept through his behavior , but his knowledge is based on his personal experience , through his angle of view . thus , is experience complete without theory ? according to me , the best way to understand everything in the world is given by a mix of both theory and experience . only in case of cohesistence of them it is possible to have a deep knowledge everything . in fact , theory allows you to study idea and concept in all the possible way and have a high vision of the concept . afterwards , experience give you the possibility to taste , to touch with your hand what you previously studied , in order to increase your knowledge
