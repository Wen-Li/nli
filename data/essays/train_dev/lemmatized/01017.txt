in my opionion this statement that it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subject than to specialize in one specific subject is wrong . i think it is better to have a specialized knowledge , because we live in a time where knowledge get more and more specialized . in school you can see this argument good , because zou first learn the basic of a method and then it get more and more specialized . for example you first learn plus and minus in math and later on it get more and more complex . maybe it is good to have a broad konwledge later in life , because than you can expand on more field , for example in your job . but a you can see there is more unemployment than before , because company need le poeple to work on the machine . at this point it is good to have a specalized knowledge , because you are different form all the others , who are looking for a job . so specific knowledge let you stand out and help you to get a better job . this is an argument for this , but it ha it 's disadvantage , too . if the job you specified on is already given to somebody with the same field of knowledge , it could bring up problem , because you field of study is very popular and there are not much job you could choose from . this is one argument for the broad knowledge . but broad knowledge doe n't let you stand out form the mass . this is why you have to balance your knowledge between broad and specific knowledge . but there are way to study something specialized and get a good job or a variety to choose from . this is made by just looking up statistic and looking up which job need personal . another way to solve that problem is to look up if you job is needed in a different state or country and apply for this on if you got the money . but the best solution is to balance the specific and the broad knowledge , but in mzy opinion it is still better to have a specialized knowledge before you have a broad knowledge .
