during the education , the study and even when deciding for a job , people are often put in front of an important question : is it better to get very deep into one specific subject or to keep a more broad mind . there are several argument supporting both side . on the one hand , the amount of knowledge and information is getting always bigger nowadays because of the internet and the globalisation . so if you want to work on a special topic and produce or design product or even develope new technology , it is very important to really understand this topic . and because of the enormous amount of information mentioned before , one ha to specialize in this single subject . on the other hand most invention and development made today , are just a part of a bigger system . so after inventing and producing very special element , there have to be people who do not neccesarily understand every detail of this element , but who know how to put them together to one big and working system . they have to keep all aspect in mind and they also must know where to look if something doe not work . very specialized peole would have no chance here , because they only understand their own component . so broad minded people are needed . another point is that people speciaized in one single subject often have very big problem when communicating with other people specialized in a different subject , because they know nothing about it . here broad minded people are very helpful to connect member of different subject because they have enough knowledge in both area . finally one also ha to see the situation out of a very pragmatic point of view . if you have to leave the company you are working in because it go bankrupt or whatever , you will have to look for a new job and of course the chance to get employed in a new company is much bigger if you can work in a broad field , than if you only can do one specific work . taking everything into consideration , i have to say that nowadays , specialist are very important in our society . but people with a broad knowledge of different acadenic subject are definetly needed and at least a important a specialist .
