nowadays most student understand idea and concept but generally they do not know fact . i think it can become a real problem . as far a i am concerned i think that most student know idea and concept . indeed they are more taught in the university . i think they are the first point in a teacher lecture . with this point student can understand fact . however i think we shuold bear in mind fact . they are important too . for instance if all president or ruler knew the history of the world they could avoid doing the same mistake . wars are proof of this . moreover fact are also important on economic ground . for instance in order to make forecast . indeed fact are always the same if we consider a long period . but after a fact we have to analyse it with concept . on the other hand i think that student prefer learn fact . it is more interessant because it is co to conclude i think that the both are very important fot our futur . it is a question with a real stake .
