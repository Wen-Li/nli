so different are the personal experience and emotional among people with diverse culture that thousand individual might hold thousand opinion . as far a i am concerned , i generally agree with the assertion that successful people try new thing and take risk rather than only doing what they already know how to do well . first of all , one of the central reason that can be presented my position is the thing have been done by the successful people take long time experience to make it better . examples can easily be found to support my view . the most famous inventor , edison , he invented light in very early period . however , he did n't spend time on how to improve his invention well . after long time of life experience , others improved the light better , such a the clour and the used time . under the circumstance , successfull people try new thing and take risk is much better in addition , another equally crucial aspect is that a new thing 's come out can increase the possibility of others related new product ' invention . this example can tell it right . the light came out soon after the discover of electrcity , because these two invention have something in common or relation . as a result , the siccessful people always succeeded in making list of new thing after they made one . this can demonstrate beyond any doubt that successful people should keep on going , but staying behind . however , i dont want to overstate the advantage of my agreement , since it also still suffers from some comparative merit in some sperical case . firstly , when people try to invent new thing , it take long time to reach the achivement . seconly , to sum up , according to above mentioned reason and example , successful people should try new thing and take risk becomes more convincing to me , although it ha some own negative aspect which we can not deny .
