in my opinion i think that the statement will probably not reflect the real vision of the future . in twenty year there will be hopefully more car than today . cars represent a material good which everyone in the modern society must have in order to keep up with the world outside . whatever you do , you need a car . wherever you go , you need a car . it 's definetely a must . that 's why i believe the amount of car will increase in the future . also , long distance are now an everyday part of life . most of today 's job usually require a car in order to move , to go anywhere . in fact it is so common now to move from city to city for work , and many people find it easier to move by car , since the bad service of train or plane end to be often annoying and stressing . in fact , when you have to catch a train , it often happens that the train is delayed . the same happens with plane . so you find yourselves waiting for hour at the train station or at the airport , telling yourself `` i should have used my car ! '' . that 's one of the reason i do believe people would rather use their car than take a public transportation . therefore , if people need to use the car , whoever doe n't own one , will need to buy one , and that will increase the number of car . besides , i believe that we should also consider the young people in order to forsee that the number of car will definetely increase in the next year . in fact we have to take into account how important are kid within the society . they represent the customer of the future . they will also be the car ' buyer of the future . young kid ca n't wait to turn eighteen year old only to get their driver licence . they look forward to have their own car , because they want to feel indipendent , free , they want to turn into adult finally . one of the feeling to feel a grown up man or woman is driving , owinig your car . your own car represent a piece of world of yours . only yours . i think is the previous step of going living in your own apartment . having a car mean that a piece of your personal world is in that car . that 's why kid want a car so bad when they get their driver license . and since kid now are the future , the number of car will grow for sure .
