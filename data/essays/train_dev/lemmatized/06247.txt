the issue of whether we should travel in a group or alone ha been widly debated spcially after the event that happened around the world . some people like to travel in a group led by a tour guide . other people like to travel alone and without a tour gide . both approach have advantage and disadvatages . although , tour guide give more and easy information about the place , socities , people , and the history of the country that we visite , i would rather traviling alone and without tour guide . some people may argue that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide . it is more easy to descover ; so this argument go , the place and avoide any trubles . however , traveling is an enjoment that icloudes discovering new thing and knowing different people and get in touch with different culturals . therefore , if i travel in a group led by a tour guide , i will be controlled by the guide 's direction and i wolud not be able to act and get in touch with others by my own way . moreover , travel alone or with a good friend not with a group that i do not know provides me with a uniqe experience . for example , three year ago i traveled to the united arab emirates with my best friend , jack , . eventhough non of u use to live or being there before , we had a very good time and experience . we rent a care from abu dhabi , the capital city , and we almost went every where in the country just by using the mabs and asking people in street . in conclussion , i believe that traveling alone and without been attached to any group give the most wonderful experience in the life .
