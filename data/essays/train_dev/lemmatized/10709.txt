i agree that most advertisement make product seem much better than they really are . there are two reason why i agree that most advertisement make product seem much better than really are . first , we always choose same product at the supermarket . for example , my friend always go to supermarket every sunday , and he always buy a same snack . one day , i asked him about , `` why do you choose same snack '' . he answered that , `` i always watched this snack 's commercial at television , then i think that this snack is taste good , so i always chose this one . '' i think that his favorite snack 's taste is not good but he influenced by television commercial , so he always chooses same snack . second , we always belive the content of commercial . for example , two year ago , my sister bought an expensive natural food . my fater asked my sister about , `` why do you buy an expensive natural food ? '' my sister answered that , `` according to this book , this food is good for u , so i buy this food . '' however , her natural food wa n't special natural food . her book said that there are a lot of value in her natural food , but it wa a same a normal food . she influensed by the advertisement that included her book . recently , there are many advertisement in the television commercial , radio commercial , magazine , book , newspaper , and so on . however , advertisement do n't always show a correct information . the meaning of advertisement is to sell a lot of good , so when we buy any good , we should reserch a lot of information , and we should ask opinion to family or friend . if we can collect a lot of information , we can choose correct good . i think that correct information is more important than influence by advertisement . before we chose good , we should remember this thing .
