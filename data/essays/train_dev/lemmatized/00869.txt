today , the world ha become a huge `` amusement park '' for the young people . no one can denie the fact that the young generation is really enjoying their life . nevertheless , did the elder hide in their room and never come out and have their own fun ? i believe the answer should be `` no '' . all of u could not refuse to admit that the daytime indeed is the `` amusement park '' for old people . it is not impossible to see park fill with happy old people during the day while their child are at work . they can certainly enjoy the sunshine and the fresh air during daytime or sit down in a bench and chat with each other . there are no working trouble , no compitition , no anxious feeling about want to do about their own future . recently a research about satifaction of people 's life have been made in my city and the result show that among those who are 100 % satisfied more than half of them are over sixty year old . such a human nature , young people would take response for their parent and make sure they are happy about their life . in my community , it is really common to see a great many old people walking with their grand or great-grand child , smile on their face . and the movie ` on golden poud ' did show the enjoyment of the elder with their own child . we have to accept the fact that being with their child is the most enjoyable thing to do . in conclusion , the old people could easily get protection from the society and their child while they do not need to face the matter anoying u every day , their life with grand child could not be happier . so i disagree with the saying that young people enjoy life more than old people do .
