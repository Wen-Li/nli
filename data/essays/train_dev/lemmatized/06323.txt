i fully agree with the captioned statement . as a member of young people generation , i believe that we should find much more time to dedicate to and help our community . the society in which we currently live put al lot of pressure on young generation in order to push them to think about their study and their carrers . the message that young people receive from family , school , work are not oriented to develop a feeling of the community where they live . on my opinion , our society is building selfish people concentrated on their own interest and goal . i am currently leaving in milan , the business capital of italy . in milan the feeling of living in a community is quite disappeared . by this , i mean that we are all concentrated on our project and we work so hard that we do not have time to think about ourselves . we all live a single people with amazingly working hour that do not allow to think or to find spare time for a community . this mechanins is completly wrong because it destroys the sense of community and all the benefit that a community can bring . i remember , when i wa living and studying in a small village where my parent currently live , before moving to milan , that i always appreciated the existence of a community . we all knew eachother at that time , because the village wa very small . if someone needed help , everone wa willing to give their support . the family in the community were very closed to eachother . i personally grew up with many other child of other family of the community and we were obliged to help people with some difficulty . i remember that i wa teaching at that time italian language to foreign little child , coming from africa but living in our community , and i wa so happy to be of help . in conclusion , i believe that community are very important for our life . they can greatly contribute to our need . for this reason , young people should keep alive the sense of community and make a lot of effort in finding time to help their community . i can affirm that helping your community can be very rewarding and that life is not only made by your personal goal and career .
