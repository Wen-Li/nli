according to me people only become successful when they try new thing and take more risk . if a person will continue to do the same thing what he is well know for then their are le chance that he can earn more profit then what he is earning now . people like bill gate or ambani took risk and came to the position where they are now . i will take an example of my friend 's father who used to sell toy on cycle . he used to get up early in the morning and come back late at night . one day he wa offered a chance or you can say it a risk . the risk wa to invest some amount of money in a business . if the business work then he would become rich but if it doe not then he will loose what ever money he ha and become very poor . he took this risk worked very hard for the business to earn him profit . he started with samll amount of profit then he invested that profit again in the business and kept expanding his business . today he is one of the richest people in our society . so now we atleast know one thing that without risk their are very le chance of becoming successful . my father is also very rich and ha his own business but when i grow up i do not want to continue my father 's business because im getting a platform . im getting help from him which i do not want . i want to take risk and start my own business . it is not neccessary that you will always have success if you take risk sometimes you might loose everything but it all upon how you take risk and on what you are putting your money on ? so if u have the courage to take risk then you should otherwise continue the same way and do the same thing your whole life .
