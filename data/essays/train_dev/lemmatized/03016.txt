some people think that life is more beautiful when you get older , because they think that the elder people would be supposed to have experienced almost everything that a person ever could in her/his life . they also think that spending time with the grandchild is the most enjoying thing in the world . i do not think so . life is beautifel even you are younger . if you are younger then you will be more energetic almost for everything . you could do all the tiresome activity , you could run at the sea with your lover , you could dance with your lover till midnight and you would have the passion to make love with her/him . i accept that there are some elder people who could run faster than some younger people or who could do harder activity , but they are exception and they are in minority . younger people also think that there is a long and happy life in future . they could probably die before they reach their 60 's . but they do not accept it in their mind . they live without the fear of death . but the elder people would live with this fear . the death may catch them in every second .
