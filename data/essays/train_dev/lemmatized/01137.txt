cars are one of our major transport item in modern life . we have been using them for more than 50 year but it 's hard to tell what their approximate number will be in twenty year time period a this subject need a large analysis . but some prediction comparing their advantage and disadvantage can be made . number of car in use can increase or stay nearly the same in twenty year . first of all , they are not new technology so that they became crucial element of our life . for inctance , we have built large road , bridge or traffic rule to use them effectively and even some of u regard their car a their friend . what is more , although they pollute the environment it could n't prevent people from using them . secondly , they still provide easy access to everywhere comparing to plane or train . for instance , we will still be using our car to go near distance . in addition , there can be new material in twenty year time , which will be alternative to petrol and which will enhance the car usage . on the other hand , it 's also possible to say that number of car in use will lessen in following year . new transport opportunity can be mentioned to support this argument . for instance , much accessible and much more efficient vehicle can be preferred in the future . moreover , car use petrol which is a natural resource that wil be finished soon and for which people are being killed for year , so it 's logical to think that people are already fed up with problem that petrol cause . not only it political and social problem , but also petrol and car have an economical aspect due to the fact that petrol price have been on increase and became very expensive . in conclusion , it 's possible for car to be popular in following year a they are up to now . but in my opinion , the backdraws of these little vehicle are so many that , people will find new option in twenty year . besides , none of u want to face war or high price any more .
