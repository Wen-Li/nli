to know if it is better for successful people to try new thing , including to take risk , rather than only doing what they already know to do well is difficult to deal with due to it also concern u , and the way we tackle life . so ; e people thin it is better to stay in a zell known safe place . on the contrary to take risk in order to test nez thing can also be partly justified . in my opinion , i am firmly convince that it is better to test new thing , even if it includes risk . the first reason i support this statement is that you can not work wonder without doing anythings . to try new thing is kind of pre requisite to be successful . if you want to work your way up , you ; ust try neq thing . if you do not , you just stay an ordinary person . obviously there are different level according to people ze speak to . another reason i prefer testing nez experi ; entation is that it is pointless to do alzays the same . human being need to take risk to progess . to illustrate ; y point of view i can use the exa ; ple of skiing , to progessm to be successful you ; ust go on harder skipath . last but not least it is also clear that it is thanks to people who take risk on high level , who enable hu ; anity to progressm to find solution to get better condition of life . taking all these apects into account , i am strongly convinced that successful people who take risk are right .
