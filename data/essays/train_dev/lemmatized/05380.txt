i agree this statement . first , successful people ha his success from his adventure . trying new thing and taking risk are very important success factor for the people . i think it mean a great oppturity for people to get the success . sucessful people never worry about the fate in the future . they have strong confidence to support their action . thet will keep the action until they get success . second , if a person only do what they already know how to do well . they will not find some fresh and excited thing in his life . the people will tried to do the repeated job . i think people will become lazy if they always do the same work . they will not find the happy or proud from the work . the people will get le competition thinking . maybe they will result in a really faiulre in the future . so , it is very important for a person to get the success by trying new thing . third , new thing and risk mean new chance . if you can catch it , it will bring more success for people . i think it is a importart part for the definition of success . anyway , peopel can learn more ability from these new thing and risk . many example can prove the point in business today . for example , ge , mirosoft company , and intel .
