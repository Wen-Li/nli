i agree with the statement that most advertisement make product seem better than they really are but i think that the main purpose of advertising is not only to inform the customer about the quality of a product but show it in a way that it could be suitable for him . i mean , the modern customer who had almost everything is not really interested in the advertisement he read in the newspaper and magazine or he see on the tv , so the company invest a lot of money in finding an original way to capture his attention and suggesting that their product are necessary for him and are the best he coul find in the market . because of that the company emphatize the quality and the benefit of the product and try to touch the feeling of the customer for causing an irrational choise . more and more advertisement show the product only at the end of the spot and the caracteristic of the product are not mentioned , but what is really important is the impact that the advertisement might produce , the style that it suggest , the feeling that it could move in the target customer . i think this way of making advertising is not dangerous for the customer if he could discriinate between
