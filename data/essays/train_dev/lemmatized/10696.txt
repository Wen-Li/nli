i agree with the statement that successful people try new thing and take risk , because , i think , that 's what make them successful . peolpe who remain doing thing they already do for a long time get used to it . developing routine give security , but keep your ability on a certain level . after a certain amount of time you do n't get better in what you 're doing . i think , that 's when successfull people decide to make a change . they realize there 's no improvement and try something new . my husband , for example , wa working a an operator after his apprenticeship . he keep telling that he earned good money those day . but he wa n't satisfied with what he wa doing . therefore he went back to school to become an engineer . now he work a an engineer for 15 day and he 's still very happy that he made that decision , because he find the engineering work so much more interesting . another point , stated in the statement , is that risk taking make people successfull , too . in my opinion that is true , because starting something new implies to take risk . the risk can be to borough money , live somewhere else or even give up a job , like friend of u did . they both had good job in a big town in germany . he wa a manager and she worked a a doctor in a hospital . although a lot of peolpe were admiring them leading such a life , the couple decided to quitt their job and move to the countryside . everybody kept asking them , if they got mad . their answer wa , that they decided for their relationship . obviously there must have been some problem , we did n't see . for some people this couple did n't look like being successfull , but i think , to be successfull doe n't have to have the meaning of earning a lot of money . being successfull mean to do what 's best for you . in conclusion , successfull peolpe have learned to take care of their self-interest .
