this essay will examine the question of whether or not most advertisement make product seem much better than they really are . it seems pretty obvious that advertisement make product seem much better than they really are . the first example that come to mind are the picture of food at fast food restaurant . one see a perfectly looking hamburger in the picture , with fresh lettuce and tomato and a enormous piece of meat , but when you actually get the hamburger you find yourself dissapointed looking at a squashed hamburguer bread with barely anything in it . we could add many more amusing example . for instance consider all the weight-loss product . the advertisement show a before and an after picture of the person using the product . the before picture is of a heavy ugly looking man , and the after picture is of a handsome fit man ( usually it is not even the same person ) . in fact the person who actually buy the weight-loss product will soon discover that the miracle solution to his weight problem is nothing but a sham . the simple truth is that company have to lie a little in order to get attention for their product . it is a whole different question whether or not these exagerations or glorification or even straight - out lie will actually help sell the product . it seems clear that consumer will stop buying a certain product that is made to look good in an advertisement if in reality it doe n't work or is much worse than it appeared to be . so producer have to realize that overdoing it on the exageration will end up backfiring on them . companies must add a little truth into their advertisement in order to make their product more appealing to consumer , even if that mean reducing the charm of their product . after all , the consumer will make the company suffer if the product it attempt to sell is garbage compared to the advertisement .
