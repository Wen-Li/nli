i disagree with the statement that in twenty year there will be fewer car in use than there are today , even though many factor would suggest this position . even though for u the fact that car exist is the most normal thing , we should not forget that they have actually not been around for such a long time yet . people started using car in the early twentieth century , le than one hundred year ago . but what did they drive before car were invented ? horse carriage of course . those have been used not for one hundred year , but for thousand of year ! so how could we possibly expect driving something else than car in twenty year already ? however , maybe there will not be a new invention in twenty year , but people will just use their car le than they do now . perhaps some sort of revolutionary mean of public transportation will be created in the near future , which will make the use of a car unnecessary . another possibility is that oil price will rise incontrollably due to a lack of resource therefore causing people to think twice before using their car or buying new car . scientists and researcher expect the accessibility of crude oil to decrease rapidly in the coming decade , causing people to come up with alternate way of transportation . some car producer try to build vehicle that can use a different source of energy than oil . so perhaps there might be fewer car in twenty year due to a lack of resource . however , other scientist say that oil reserve constantly renew themselves , thus preventing their ceasing . in my opinion this theory sound somewhat more accurate , causing me to reject the idea that the number of people using car will decrease so rapidly . another reason for me to support this opinion is that people simply need and like their car . some own car for fun , but for some they are extremely important . for example , my brother life in a suburban area of new jersey and ha to drive at least fifteen minute just to reach the next supermarket . this situation is not uncommon in the united states , where most people have living condition similar to those of my brother . in big family , sometimes even more than one car is needed . perhaps the parent both need their own car to get to work and the child one to get to school with . in a time when family choose to live in suburban area more and more , a decrease in the number car used seems pretty utopian to me . some people also own car because they like driving them . a friend of mine life in a metropolitan area , which ha an excellent mean of public transportation , but nevertheless us his car more often , because he enjoys driving . in conclusion , the possibility of a shrinking number of car in use certainly exists , but in my opinion car will stay popular and in use for a very long time , unless someone invents something completely new and better .
