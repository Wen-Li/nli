in my think of way , it is more important for student to learn fact than to understand the idea and concept . there are two reason why i believe that learing fact is more important than understanding idea and concept . fisrt , if student dose n't know about the fact perfectly and only understand about it cincepts and idea , they would not know what the truth is . this would make student confuse when they enter social life after school and face the real situation which they only understood ithe concept . they could do well accroding what they have understood about , but if it is wrong what they have understood , they would fail at the moment . second reason why i believe learning fact more important is the change of the concept and idea about what they learned . the concept and idea about an objective could change a time go on . in other word , even though it learned the right concept and idea when they were student , the concept of an object could keep change depends on the social environment , so what they have know will may not ture anymore . third , understanding only concept and idea is le effecetive for making creative for the student . if they understand of on object 's idea already , they would believe that there is only the idea for the object . then , they 'll lose a chance to make their won idea and opinion about the object . therefore , in my opinion , it is more important to learn fact than understand only concept and idea f
