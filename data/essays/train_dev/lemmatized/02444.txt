i am agree with the idea that most advertisement make product seem much better than they really are . in my opinion , if the advertisement make product more better is in order to encourage people to buy them . in fact , if the television or the radio make many advertise about one product , the consumer will be more attracted and spend more money . it is a good way to sell a product because the most important thing consist to attray people . if the product is very sad or ugly , it is clear that poeple do n't buy it . for example when we saw advertisement on television about fast food , in particular mac donald , the burger seems perfect , i mean that he is bigger than the restaurant 's one and seems to have more ingredient but when we go to the restaurant , we have another vision , we have the impression that what we saw at the television is really different than what we have in our plate . this example show u that if we did n't see the burger on television , we ha n't gone at the mc'donalds . the role of the advertissement is to bring u another way to imagine the product and to push u to buy and to spend money . all in today 's world is commercial , to spend money is the new way of life and we can see that nowadays that we buy everything even if we do n't need it . buying give u satisfaction and we could'nt live in this world without selling . that 's the reason why the medias take the opprtunity to show u product which seem much better than reality . even if we realise that what we are buying is not the same with what the television show u we will continue to do it because it is necessary . to conclude , everybody do n't care if the product showed by the advertisement do n't seem like what they really are because the needed is to buy .
