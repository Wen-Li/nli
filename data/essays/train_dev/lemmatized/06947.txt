i agree with the statement that it is important for student to understand idea and concept than to learn fact . basically our mind is like a fire which need to be kindled and not a vessel to be filled up . ideas and concept are the right catalyst to set our mind wondering and thinking on those topic . famous scientist albert einstein used the age old calculus to derive the theory of relativity . our invention and discovery have relation to the past . the present technology owes a lot of it origin to the earlier generation . we can not do thing abstract and all of a sudden out of the blue . it may appear to have happened that way , when we superficailly go through the matter . a deeper study reveals the connection , which are very interesting . facts are simple statistic . they are very important . they need to be collected and kept for rational reference . we take decision based on fact not on idea and concept . so that is the role of fact in our life , i feel . for example , if we need to know whether a specific disease ha become an epidemic and if the government need to msuter more support and put in more effort to curb the further spreading of the disease , we need to know the number of patient registered at the hospital with the symptom of that disease recently . these are essential in leading u to make a crucial decision . facts can be of various type . some about the past which would relate to the history of the land . some relate to who did what etc and some good to know information . they have their importance in the society . a student life is very important phase in his career . we need to choose carefully what he need to understand to keep his inquisitiveness and mind in search of quest . this will take u a long way in builing a society where there will be no deficieny of innovation , discovery and invention to acclerate u towards further growth and development .
