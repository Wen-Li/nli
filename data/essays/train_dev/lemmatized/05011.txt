in that essay i am going to tell if i agree to the question or not . i kind of idea state that it is important for the student to understand the idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact , other idea state that learning fact is more beneficial . i support the idea of this question . it is more important for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact . because , in order to find something new a student should learn the basic concept and idea . learning fact is a part of the working . it is more important for a student to understand the idea and concept . in the academic world , in university we are told that learning concept and idea are more important because by learning that you can learn the fact and you can make the fact more efficient for humanity . suppose an electrical engineering student want to make an innovation about the transistor concept . transistor is a kind of device that is used in all electronic device . when that student want to learn the fact , without knowing the idea and concept he can not be an engineer . an engineer should be innovative , should think about something new . in order to invent something the concept and the idea should be understood . in order to learn the fact , a student should know the idea and concept , without knowing the concept and idea the student can not invent anything . he could be a electric technician . think about communication area . 15 year ago mobile phone are not worldwide used . however , in that day everybody us celular phone . technology becomes more efficient by time . if the engineer and student just learn the fact , without knowing the idea and concept it will be impossible for them to increase the technology level . by understanding the concept they are sharing the information and technology can be used in a better way . in conclusion i want to restate that it is more important for student to understand the idea and concept rather than learning the fact . if a student want to introduce something new he should know the idea and concept . if he just learn the fact in my opinion he can not introduce something new . thats the way that the academic learning is taught on university . they tell by using idea and concept to way of learning . by these , we can learn fact but if just fact are taught there will be no way to increase the humanity level or technology there should be different opinion .
