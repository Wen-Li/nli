althogh some people would agree with the statement that it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subject than to specialize in one specific subject , i definitely dissagree with the statement . there are two reason why i dissagree with the statement . first , it will make you feel special if you have specialize in one specific subject . for example , one of my friend play have lot of hobby , such a playing piano , reading , and playing tennis . and i asked her what doe she like the best . she said `` i do n't know . i mean i actually do n't know yet what i really like . '' on the other hand , my another friend only play judo , he ha been practiced judo for 8 year . and he know that he love judo , and once he start talking about judo , he never stop talking . it is not about the academic subject , but for these people , it work same way . the girl i mentioned first , she ha no subject she doe n't like , but she also ha no subject she really like . so in the exam , she usually get all b+ or b - which is not bad , however . while she never get a , the boy who is playing judo always get a a+ and c in his exam . i think it is better to have one a+ rather than all b since it will make you feel more special and happy . second , it must be fun to have something special . for example , if you have specialize in one specific subject , it will be so much fun to study . once you learn how much fun to study will help you in the future when you start working . for these two reason , i dissagree with the statement that it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subject than to specialize in one specific subject .
