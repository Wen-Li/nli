nobody can define what is life and what is enjoyment . life and enjoyment both have different meaning for different individual . a person may enjoy their whole life . but it is not possible to avoid the pain and sorrow from life , because these are the part of everybody 's life and come at different age . some pain are related to the age , like phisical problem . some people face age problem early in their life and some people face late in life . or we can say that some people become senile early , it depands on the situation which he faced in his life and it also depends on gene strecture also . i agree with this statement that `` young people enjoy life more than older people do '' . one reason to support this opnion is that undoubtly the young person 's energy leavel is high than the older one 's . a young people is more enthusiastic than older people and enthusiasm is must to enjoy life . older people 's energy will decrease a their age will increase , this is a basic bilogical principle . young person can travel and go whereever they want to go but it is not possible for a old age person because their body will not allow them to do so . another reason is that the physical problem will restrict the old people to do enjoyment , like they ca n't travel so frequently if they have problem of joint pain . they ca n't eat which they want to eat most because their medical prescription will not allow them to do so . old people ca n't take so much sugar in their food if they have the problem of diabetes . but a young person can easily eat what they want and they can easily digest that . they have no restriction on their food . and taking food of our preference is also a joy of life or we can say enjoyment . a young have no physical problen no joint problem so they can travel and go to adventure site . a old person can not hold excitement because they have heart problem , so more happiness and more sorrow both are injury to their health . but a young one can do lot of exciting thing . in these way a young can enjoy life more than older people .
