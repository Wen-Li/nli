when people travel , peopple might have different preference on the way to travel . i disagree that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide . i always like to travel with my plan . i believe that the travel planed by myself always make the travel enjoyable due to three reasones . in the travel led by myself , it enables me to decide where i can visit , how long i can stay at the place , and managing those plan make me a great traveler . as i travel to somewhere , i have to think where i better to go . if i want to have a great trip , i have to know some information of the place . it is not only about place , but also the weather , transportation and so forth . through those process , i can decide the place to travel and the place will be based on my interest . that 's why it might be one of reasones . during travel , there might happen something different thing from my expectation . for example , the place , introduced in a travel magazine , might not be really beautiful place than i expected . if those accident occured , i would arrange my plan for the trip . i might leave the place and move to next plan . in this sence , i can adjust my plan to the situation . therefore , i might like freedom in my travel . with whole process to have a trip , i can learn a lot of thing that i did not know . if i participate a travel with a tour guide , the tour guide will schedule everything . although the travel with a tour guide might be easy and not necessary to plan a lot , i want to learn many information for the trip . by those three main reasones , i disagree to the opinion . in addition , i prefer a travel led by myself . o
