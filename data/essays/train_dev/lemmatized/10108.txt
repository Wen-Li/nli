young people enjoy life more than older people . there are two reason for my choice . firstly , young people are more healthy than older people . secondly , young people want to learn many different thing especially enjoyable thing . young people are more healthy than older people . health is important for doing enjoyable thing . if you are not healthy you can not work , go to school , watch tv . shortly you can do nothing that you have to and of course you can not enjoy . when you go to a pub , you dance and sometimes you drink . when you dance you really get tired . dance need energy and energy is in the youth . also most of the old people have to use drug and that ' s why they can not drink alchol . another reason , the old people have to sleep long hour to feel well but the young people do not . young people want to have experiment about everything enjoyable . old people lived many thing and they do not want to learn something new . they do just that they have to such a sleeping , working , eating . the old people want to relax . young people climb mountain to experince the feeling of affair because the feeling of affair is new for them . but an old man doe not choose to climb a mountain . he can choose to sit in front of a sea and drink coffee . young people are healthy and willing to learn new thing . that ' s why they enjoy life more than older people . one day the young peple will be old one and so they should enjoy now and relax in the future .
