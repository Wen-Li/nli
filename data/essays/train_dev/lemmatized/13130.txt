the statement `` it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subject than to specialize in one specific subject '' is an important point , which play a big role in society , especially in education . on the one hand you can agree with this statement , because it is very important to have a basic background of education . you should know the basic fact in different academic subject . this way of thinking we can find in school . at school the pupil are eccept to be good in every subject . the souhld be good at math , language , biology , chemistry and sport . so a pupil ha to concentrate for every subject to achieve good result after school . on the other hand critical people would ask : `` why should a pupil , who is good and very interested in math be also good and interestesd in sport ? '' this would be the other way of thinking . some parent for example think that is enough when pupil are talented in certain subject , because after school they go to a university , where they also concentrate just on a special subject , which they choose to study . i am of the opinion that a mix of two way is the best solution . i think , people and espaccially child , should have a basic education in ervery subject . it make no sense to send a child very early to a school , which is based on a special subject , like a science school for example or a sport school . pupils should learn the basic information in poltics or in geography and other important subject . i think it is a good way to send child firstly on a normal school and after graduating pupil have to decide on their own , where they want to go and wich university mostly agrees with their own interest . so the pupil would have a basic knowledge which you need in society and after this they can concentrate on a special subject .
