advertisements is prevalent in our society . we can see a variety of advertisement surrounding u . i think , every person will be strikingly impressed by the colorful advertisement when television channel broadcast sport game , especially some very important game , such a the mba final contest . people do not spend much time on thinking whether advertisement will match what they advocate . they tend to follow the trend that advertisement have created . but from my experience , i find that most advertisement exaggerate the benfits of their product or hide their potential harm . but why do advertisement try to show u thing that are actually not that good ? obviously , profit from product drive them to do so . particulary product that are assumed to cure or remove a chronicle disease can be more attrative to u than others . manufacturers make use of our desire to spend money on these product . in addition , le work on administering and censorship of advertisement can easily lead to the appearance of false adverstisements . it 's admitted that the language of advertisement is very difficult to control . sometims , a subtle tone can make advertisement much better in overpraising their product . however , from my understanding , the most important reason for this fact is that new medium , for example internet , enter into our society . these new medium always can find a way to escape our current law and rule on advertisement . they figure out their effective method to target a special group of people . for example , teenager can take predomiance of population that surf internet often . computer game company try to exaggerate their product even by telling that game can make you more knowledgable and get you get high score in your course . the only reason is that game can make you think more .
