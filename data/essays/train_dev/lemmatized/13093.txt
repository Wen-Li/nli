i do not agree with the statement expressing the idea that in twenty year there will be fewer car in use than there are today , and this for a variety of reason . in the first place modern city planning is partially leading toward a horizontal , spread-out model of contemporary metropolitan area . examples of this trend are urban development of city like | los angeles , mexico city and san paolo , which have spread over vast area . this tipe of city growth is going to enhance the importance of the car in everyday life , a long a we need to take the freeway to go to the grocery store . moreover i do not see change in culture that would cause people to buy fewer car . in fact car are also important to plan our day a we want to ; so that even if it wa more and more difficult to afford them , they would be still used because they would enable u to be more independent with what we want to do and when we want to do it compared to public transportation . cars are also a status symbol , and people are going to buy them not only because they are useful , but also because they can show theit status by ownig a particular kind of car . it is extremely important for u to move , and be where we want to be at the convenient time . cars and modern mean of transportation such a bus and cheap flight allow u a grade of freedom in time and space that wa not even dreamed in other era , and this is not going to stop . plus , car can give u freedom of movement combined with independency from other - except in traffic jam . this in my opinion is the reason why the number of car circulating is not going to shrink in the close future .
