i agree that young people enjoy life more than older people do . a prime reason for this being that young people like student or young graduate have much le to worry about a compared to older people . people who have recently joined the workforce and who expeirence financial freedom for the first time in thier life 's tend to spend more on item of leisure like buying a vacation or a brand new car rather than thinking of retirement and buying various investment or saving option . young people are more care free because they dont have to think about providing for other family member , like the college cost of thier child , medical expense for older people etc and thus live life more rather than worrying about making thier future 's secure . young people also tend to have healthier , fitter and disease free body which permit them to pursue various hobby like wildlife trekking , paragliding , dancing , various water sport and other such activites that require a lot of samina , enthusiasm for such thing and most importantly time . older people seem to have a derth of all these thing , being too busy in work or not having a body which would permit them to follow their intrests . students for example , both school and college going have a lot of free time on thier hand to participate in extra curricular activites and follow thier intrests like sport , dance , art activites etc . older people on the other hand , are busy with thier work life and dont have any other leisure time apart from weekend , which too tend to get very hectic because of regular chore like shopping , cleaning the home , cooking food etc . they dont spend a large chunk of thier disposable income on activity which provide fun and entertainment but on investment option which would give them a safe retirement option , insurance policy etc . thus , because young people are more care free , are experiencing new high 's of financial freedom and are healthier with a lot of spare time on hand , do enjoy life more than older people usually do .
