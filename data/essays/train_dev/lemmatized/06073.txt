in this society succes play a very important role . the definition of success is to be good at something and make money with that trade , or talent . some people have it easy and some people have to work a little harder for it . it is very important to be familiar with the subject of interest , however it is also important to try new thing in different area and take risk . a person can not truly know their potential , if they only stick with the trade they learned . if their potential of growth in that field ha deminished and they are not successful they will never be successful . it is impossible for a person to be successful if they do not try anything new and drastic . it will always keep them in the same routine , and even in the same financial situation they are in today . a drastic change is needed in order to be successful because creativity can only come from change . it could be real estate , or even a bussiness . it is definately a good thing to take a certain amount of risk because if nobody would take any risk our economy would not be same today . the founder of various fast food place , coffee place , and grocery store took risk to open their store . imagine the world without starbucks , mc donalds , and wal mart for example . these are internationaly traded corporation , and very successful . trying new thing like the idea of a drive through restaurant , for example , and taking risk in not knowing if it would be a success in the future , play a very important role in being successful . i
