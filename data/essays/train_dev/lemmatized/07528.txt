i agree with the idea that it is good for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact . there are several reason that i agree with the idea about this . first of all , the fact is just one of the result of the idea and concept . without idea and concept , it would not generate a good solution -- fact . second , understanding idea and concept will help to student to think critically and efficientlly . if student learn only the fact , they will not be able to analize why that fact is generated and where the fact is come from . third , fact can not be changed because it is just a fact . the answer is all the same , so if student learn only fact , they do not know what they should do when the trouble and problem are arise . if student understand idea and concept more than it is for them to learn fact , student will be able to think more critically and productively . if student just learn the fact , they will just the follow the rule and they can not find the other way to solve the problem . therefore , i agree with the idea that it is more important for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact .
