think of a quantum physic professor who join a reception and is in a conversation with people from very different field . he could be the best in his field , he might have won countless prize on his theory about quantum computer , but he might look like a complete fool when the conversation is about the idea brought on by franz kafka in his book `` metamorphosis '' . that is , if our professor ha focused only on his own subject and left out all the other one , failing to create himself a general culture . as i tried to give an idea of a man who ha focused only on a specific subject with my example above , i think that one ha to have certain knowledge on all field if he/she want to gain some reputation among people of the same standard , even if he/she might be the best in his/her own field . although you have to spend most of your time on the subject you are specialized in , in order to be succesfull , the requirement are much higher in today 's world . you ca n't just give up on all other aspect of life and isolate yourself from other academic subject , being a stranger to what the majority of the world is talking about . this is why student are constantly being tested on topic they might not be interested in , nowadays . although cry of anguish like `` when will a person like me who 's trying to become a computer engineer will ever use the characteristic of sonnet ' in shakespeare 's poem ? '' are constantly being heard in school corridor , it is essential that one learns certain knowledge about every topic he/she can , even if it may seem trivial at first . this time , think of a quantum physic professor who know a lot more than only quantum computer . think of a well dressed professor who ha something to say , even if it is very brief , on any topic that is brought on . think of how much more he 'll be respected than the ingorant one i talked about at the beginning of my essay . think how much better a society could be even if half of it population consisted of people who tried to learn more on every topic . they would communicate in a much complex and in a much more humanistic way than the majority of the world doe today , would n't they ?
