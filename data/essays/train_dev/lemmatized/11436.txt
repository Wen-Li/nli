the fist car start circulate during the first worl war , but this car were just for rich people . after the second warld war , people feel better and had the possibility to had a job and improve their standard of life . cars factory understand that the car will be the symbol of wellness of the maa society , and start to project cheap and smart car that a normal familt could bought . since this year , car develope in their structure , in design , in confort , and the in number ! today a family composed by four people ha two car , one for each parent . in twenty year there will be fewer car in use than there are today for dirrerent reason . for example , when one of the son can drive a car , usually use one of his parent 's car , but sometimes boy that can buy a car just for themselves . this is a big problem for the health of the world . today we can see the big metropolis in the world . there is too much traffic of car ! in this enormous city people ca n't walk in the street , there is too much smog in the air and they ca n't breathe . traffic is also very noisy , this is the main cause of acustic pollution . our city are growing up very queekly and the situation that we can see today in the big city will be also in the small city and in the country . car factory try to design new motor and new car to control the air and the acustic pollution that car caused , but if the number of the car will grow up , this not solve the problem . i think that every people in the world have to be something about this and can do something to stop this diredtion . i have the possibility to buy a new car but i will use my mother 's car until i will need my own car . every one can use public transport and governement have to do something to increment people to use it
