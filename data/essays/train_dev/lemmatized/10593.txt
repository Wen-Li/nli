i agree that the most advertisement make product seem much better than they really are . this is the mojor strategy doing by advertisement to reach much number of peole . but some of them can say lie for selll the product . advertisements only give the adventages and best side of the product , you ca n't show any attention about it 's disadvantage . consumers must also learned bad side of the product . furthermore advertisement can tall much more than they are . in addition to this if you make lot of advertisement about the product poeple want to learn what it is than le advertising product . of course they will go to the shopping centr and look your product and usually this looking will finished with buying the product . in our country there are also lot of advertisement which make person boring in a rest of tv program . sometimes it take twenty minute . in fact a me all people change the channel to fin new one which is not advertise something . if advertiser want to take peole on tv they must do funny and interesting advertise . beside of that most advertisement may include more lie than others . this is selling method and we ca n't know if they tell u true or not . we must search and ask alot about product before buying it . we can get this information who use that product before . and also politician have to do some law for advertisement . that law mu limit the advertisement and include some punishment if they tell wrong in the advertisement . as a result there are lot of disadvantage and advantage of most advertisement . i agree that people want to buy product alot w'th most advert'sement but it mu n't include lie and harmfull thing for people . they must be true
