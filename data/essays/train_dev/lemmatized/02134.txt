now adays , technology play main role in our life , a it facilitates communication through out the whole world . some of the aspect of these technology may now be considered normal , but few year ago it would have been thought of a magic ; two or three century ago car would have been though of a mericales and not common a these day . i guess that we have to consider this rapid change in technology , before judging the next twenty year . i think that in the next few year ; man will discover a better and le dangour way to transport ; he will notice how polluting these car are , and that they already have damaged most of the earth 's atmosphere , then he will invent something new that will replace the car existance in our street , and i imagine that the main issue of the era will be how to save the earth from the damage that happened through the last century . he will also find faster mean , that he will find it to be more convinient than car , and this is expected a car will not be enough to supply his need in fast transportation . some people might consider the whole issue a imaginary subbject and that it impossible to make such a change in few year , but let look at car history . cars were invented and became in use in le than ten year ; lot of company were racing to produce it in several shape and with distincit facilites . as example ford company wa convinced with the idea , that car can replace all the existing method of transportation , and have a primary role in the market , so they made great production that the owner wa said to be mad , but it came up that he wa right , and the whole product wa sold and the compnay became a major one . looking through out the history will make u see it clear that no technology , no matter how large or common , will last , so i guess that this is an enough reason to think that car will disappear in the next twenty year .
