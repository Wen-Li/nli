marketers are facing an increasing competition . as they do not want to see their market share decrease , they need to find more effective way to sell their product . that is why i really think that marketer develop technique to make their product seem much better than they are . i have noticed several of these technique in various market . first , most of the product are shown in a nice environment that ha nothing to do with them . for example , most advertisement for clothes show a model in a nice place like a beach or a nice restaurant . the overall impression is very good even if the product is not great . second , photography technology enable the product to look better . for example , small object are shot closely in order to make it appear much bigger . i have noticed that it is a common practice for people that are selling ring with diamonts . another way to embelish a product is to add creative copy to a product image . some advertisement are misleading the consumer . they give partial information . i often see advertisement for computer battery . most of the time , the lifetime of the battery is not really communicated . instead , the copy say ` long lifetime ' . it could be two year or six month . in conclusion , i think that advertiser are using technique that are often misleading . it is very important to look precisely at an advertisement in order to get a real sense of what the product really is .
