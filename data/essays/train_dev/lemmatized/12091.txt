some poople in japan , where i live , disagree with the statement that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their community . however , i agree with the statement that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping community for the following reason . first , school often say that young people have to spent their time studing . for example , my son study at shudo highschool , a private achool in hiroshima where locates western part of japan . he want to communicate wiht our neighborhood . but , he always have many assignment and can not attend a community meetig . in japan , exam score are most important so young people have to study hard to get high score . in consequent , young people have no time to helping their community . second , there are few community in our neighborhood so if young people want , they can not spend thier time helping their communitiew . for example , when i wa a junior highschool student there were many community around u and spent much time to helping our community . now , in japan , people often do not know who life in thier neighborhood . we do not know each other so there are few community around u . because there are few community , young people do not give enogh time to helping their community . if there were many community , young people would give enogh time to helping their community . terefore , i agree with the statement that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their community .
