not all that glitter is gold . a very general statement yet very true . a statement that should be hung in every company 's marketing and advertising department , because i think that most of the dvertisments polish up their product . evidence to that are the policy that some company in the united state have concerning the `` refundable , no question asked '' policy . for example , the famous department store found all across the u.s called target operates under this policy , giving it customer a three month time span for returning and getting a refund for a purchased product . had the product been fairly advertised consumer would be returning le product a they would only purchase a product that they are sure of . i once watched a five minute advertisment on one of the advertising channel concering a certain product for the complexion . in the commercial they showed several before and after picture of people who claimed to have used this product . it wa very clear to me , a it would have been to any computer user , that so much of the picres shown of the after had been altered on the computer . with the new advancemnets of technology and high development in the computer manufacture industry something like that can be easily done . the product wa over estimated in price and quality . i can say that with confidence , for my friend fell for the smell of fake rose and bought the product , the next day she satyed home because she had a horrible rash all over her face . so it is not surprising that i strongly agree the fact that most advertisments are over done and do not reflect the true value of the product . as i said earlier , the advertising and marketing department should be more truthful .
