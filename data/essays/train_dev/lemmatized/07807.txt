basically , i agree with the statement . however , there are some point to be made clear still , such a , for who advertisemtns make product seem much better than they really are and to what extent . in the following text , i will clarify why i agree with this statement , clarifying these point . it is true that we sometimes have a feeling that some advertisement are overselling their product in their commercial . for example , the commercial of movie usually show the best part of the movie in the advertisement , and make u excited and looking forward to this movie , but sometimes it happens that we get disappinted with it after seeing the movie itself . however , if there is actually overdoing of advertisement are different according to different receiver . if we take an example of coffee , if you do not drink coffee at all , the quality of coffee doe not matter to you . in this case , for you non of the advertisement is overdoing , because from the first of all , you do not expect any quality from the advertisement . so my point is that if a certain advertisement is overdoing or not is depending on the person who are interested in and evaluates the product . besides , the degree of overdoing is also depending on the receiver a well . if you go to some internet site where the opinion of certain product , such a camera , or mp3 player are publically open , you can see various type of opinion toward the same product . sometimes they can be totally opposite , such that some say , it wa worthwhile to buy , and the other say it had been better to throw money away . so for those who are satisfied with the product , the advertisement of this product is not overdoing , but for those who are not satisfied with quality of the product , will take the advertisement overdone . to sum up , although depending on who the receiver of the advertisement is the statement might not be true in some case , and the degree of overdoing varies across the evaluaters or consumer , i agree that most of the time , the statement is true .
