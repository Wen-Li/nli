there are many form to travel to somewhere , many people prefer to travel alone , others in a group , some of them without tour guide and others acompanied or led by a tour guide . i think that the best way is traveling in a group led by a tour guide for the following reason : you know where are you going in order to have a security , you increase your knowledge from the tour guide about other place , and you save time to do other activity . firt of all , it is important to know where you are going in order to have a security . there are many place to know in the world or just in your country . the place look nice on the picture however each place ha it particular risk that we do not know loking the picture . i remember when i went to amazonas river without tour guide , i had a bad experience in this trip . secondly , if you travel to somewhere it is a good idea to learn about this place and improve your knowledge about other place . the best way to learn is hiding a tour guide because they are trained and they know very well the place that you are visiting . i remember an experience in machu pichu . when i arrived to cuzco my group looked for a tour guide . we really enjoyed in this trip because the guide teach u everything , he gave u all the historical of every place . finally , being led by a tour guide is a good idea to save time in your trip , because you are not worried about the map or you are not worried about the name of the different place . however in this time you can enjoy more visiting other place or write your history or write email to your friend . definitelly , i recomend it is a good idea to enjoy more in your trip being led by a tour guide . in summary , there are more advantage having a tour guide like to support a job , to make other friend ( guide ) in other country , but i consider that the most important reason are : security , knwoledge , and time .
