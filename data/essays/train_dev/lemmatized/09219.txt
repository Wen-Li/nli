in order to answer to this question it may be useful to spread my idea from the definition of the concept of `` community '' to the concept of `` responsability '' . but i think this will take me a lot of time and . .. space , in term of word to be written . however , i think that the statement reported in the left frame of this window is to be validated a well a no generalization can be done about something , since what we state is just refered to our personal experience . \ starting from this foundamental point that structure my idea on such a topic , i can clearly say that i do not ( completely ) agree with what is stated . as a matter of fact there are young people who give enough time - sometimes , too time - for helping community , and there are on the contrary young people who do not want to be involved in this fact . i think that nowadays the importance given to a generic `` job '' ( not the one we referred to a the `` money-bringer '' process , but the one of something a person can do for a reason or for another ) depends on the social , cultural and political environment in which that job is processed . as a matter of fact i think that it is true that young people have different aim in their life , but it is also true that in one way or another those people could be helping community even if they do n't know they are . what i am stressing is the idea that no one can say with no doubt that a generic person p is making well for the community instead of a person q who is not doing well . i think that this ha to be referred from situation to situation and no generalization can be used , in any way . however i can see , from my personal experience within my family , that that thing year ago guided young people to help community , for example helping old people or people with some disease etc. , is no longer present nowadays : i refer to a mind condition , i.e. spiritual support , thinking of others ( in italian we call it altruismo ) ... but nowadays we look at convenience , mainly ( i underline another time , not always ) . convenience is probably the main disease oppressing humanity because convenience make u do something just for the `` do ut de '' criterion , but this is not always the right thing to do . this can be found in every field : at work , at school , in sport ( i live in italy . .. ) . in conclusion i can remark what i just read in this few line : no matter what you work for or you work in , no matter what people say to you and what people think about you ( in a rational way , obviously ) , just do what you did for so long , and you will help your community a much a you can . ..
