in japan , where i live , many people may think that there will be more car in use in future . however , i support the statement that there will be fewer car in use than there are today in twenty year for the following reason . first , the price of energy will become higher than today . for example , many poeple prefer car which use le oil than others because they suffer from the high cost of energy . many car maker are making their effot to produce the car which need not so much energy , thoug , such car are high cost . additionary , there is difficulty in developing new law cost energy . as the anove explanation demonstrates , in future , people use fewer car than there are today . second , enviromental problem change people way of thinking about traffic method . for example , in asian country such a south korea , people put more importance on train than ever because city enviromental problem are so serious . originaly seoul , the capital of south korea , had not so enough train network . however , south korean govenment improved capability of train network in seoul to carry people . the govenment will continue such effort to make seoul 's air clean . trains seems to replace the car-centric traffic system . as the above example demonstrates , there will be fewer car in today . third , purpose people buy car are more limited than before . car is not only traffic method but also the symple of rich life . however , people will change such image on car . for example , in european country , where many people use car for the first time in the world , symple car are pupular because many europeans think car a just a traffic method . in old time , people in eurpope love rich car , though , such thinking is changing . in such situation , they do n't need so much car if there is other traffic system such a train . as the above example show . people use fewer car in future than today . in coclution , i support the statement there will be fewer car in twenty year than there are today because of the energy cost , enviromental problem , and limited purpose .
