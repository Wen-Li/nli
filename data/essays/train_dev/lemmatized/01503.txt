every one try to look for enjoyment in his/her life . enjoyment in life is not easy to earned , and it requiers several thing . in my own opinion , there are two important requirement to enjoy in your life such a , huge experience , and have your own money . furthermore , those requirement we can found in older people . so , i disagree that `` young people enjoy life more than older people '' . first of all , older people have more experience than young people . also , if you have alot of experience you will be able to choose the good and more benefit thing for you to enjoy . forexample , traveling bring enjoyment when it is empty from the dangerouse thing , and to be away from hazardness , you have to have enogh experience . experience is really protect you from dangerous thinga and from hazardness . then , older people depend on themselves , and they have their own money . so they will be able to know how , where , and when to use and spend their money . also , they will be able to save money for their need , and they will be aware from loan . in the conclusion , older people are more awake , and they can earn their right and exact enjoyment in their life . moreover , i think it is really important to advice our child about getting the right and good enjoyment in our fabulouse life . enjoyment is diffecult to earned .
