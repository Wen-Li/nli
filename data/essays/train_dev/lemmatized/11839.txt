will be in twenty year fewer car in use than there are today ? i think there are two side for this statement . on the one hand there is the oil , oil is a limited fossile product whitch doe not excised endless and the result is the hugh oil price . in a few year can only the rich people pay for gas and oil . the next point is the air pollution someday it will be so dirty that the people go back to the bike or drive by bus or train . the last point for the statement is the space . in big city like tokyo or los angeles , new york etc. is it impossible to drive by car because you can not find a parking space and you are always in traffic jam and not very fast . on the other hand there is the actual price war in the automobile industry that make it possible for poorer people to buy a car because of the cheaper car . the next point i will mention is that the car become cleaner they do not pollute the air like car 15 year ago and a few model are small enough for city . so the air become cleaner and the parking space can be used more efficient . but my last point against the statement is the growing world economy . countries like china or india become richer and the people there wound the same life a the rest of the world . people in old industrial country have their own car but people in asia or india do not have their own car and if they earn the money they would like to buy a new car . the number of these new car buyer increase enormously . however , my opinion is that in twenty year are a lot more car in use a today because only china and india have nearly 2 billion people without a car and if only 10 percent buy a car they will change the number of car in use that much that i can not imagine it .
