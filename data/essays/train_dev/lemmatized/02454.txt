i will not agree to the first statment given that broad knowledge of many subject is better than having specilize in one subject . because it is very diffcult for a student to understand many subject at atime . he can not concentrate on any off them properly since he will have a little time for one subject . it will also make him tired off work . if he feel that he is lacking off time are he is working more it may leed to get tension and streeses . which will creat alot off confusion for what he have to do are not for his feature . on the other hand if a student is allowed to study one specific subject at a time it will allow him to study carefully and understand the subject well . since he will have a lot off time to work on the subject , any he can easily clarify any doughts if he get with his teacher and can understand betterly since he do not have any other work to be done more than this . a student can have a little knowledge of many subject . but a broad knowledge off al subject s will be very diffcult for him at a time . i will be better to study one subject at a time then shift on to other subject .
