in my opinion in twenty year there will be fewer car in use than there are today ; although this statement can sound totally unaware of the fact that car ' possessor are quickly growing all over the world , i will now explain the reason for my idea . cars ' price have been decreasing slightly in the past few decade : originally born a a super-luxury status symbol back in the end of the nineteenth century , we can therefore clearly state that today car are a commodity affordable by almost anyone in any industrialized country . however , this apparently good change of the situation , ha led to two extremely negative effect : the abrupt rise in oil price , and a tremendous impact on the planet 's environment . firts thing first , since car are produced and sold even in big , heavily populated country like china and india ( together comprehending more than one third of the world population altogether ) , market where once they were unavalible to almost the totality of people , their demanded quantity ha risen to the sky , and so the fuel price : petroleum extracting site are used in a more and more savage way , but the lack of offer of this fundamental mineral caused , according to a very well known economic law , an increase in it price . as of today , even extracting site placed very far from any valuable market , or very expensive to use , have been approaching by excracting company ( e.g. in alaska , in the north sea , through oceanic platform . .. ) after the traditional site ' shortage . it is my opinion that the oil price , unfortunately , rise more and more , to the point where car will be once again an item affordable by , and only by , very rich people , therefore decreasing significantly their number . the only solution to this inevitable economic disaster would be to find some alternative energy font ; however , research in that field have been growing slowly in the last year , thus our energetic future is not looking bright at all . besides , how not to mention the fact that since car ' use spread around every continent ( and it 's gonna be worse and worse in the short period ) pollution 's effect on global environment have icreased so much ? cars are not what you might call an ecological way of transportation : having more and more of them drinving around all over the world might even lead to the worst solution . some scientist , in fact , even came to think that , if their number is still going to increase over the year , world governmentscould even ban them from using , so to prevent the enivronment , that however , by that day will probably be seriously compromised . to summarize , i think that car ' number will grow in the short period , until it will be too much to afford them ( in economical and ecological mean ) : since that moment on i believe there will be fewer and fewer of them , even le than today .
