some people said young people nowadays doe n't help our cominities . i supose that is true , but there are some reason why young people doe n't help the comunities . i think young people nowadays are very busy . they have a lot of thing even if they do n't help their community . they have to go to the piano lesson or go to swimming , or do something . other child must study hard from early morning to midnight , because their parent want them go to good univercity . the other child have to help their housework . young people nawadays often go to learn something even if holiday . for example , piano , swimming , dancing and so on . therefore they do n't have time to help their comminities . even though child want to help and join them , they have already many thing to do . most child study very hard , because their parent want them to that . sometimes they may study from early mornig to late evening , or they study even it is on the holiday . if there are the day child do n't have to study hard , they want to be relaxed at home , or play with their friend . therefore , they do n't have enough time to help their community . these day , many parent work outside thier house , so they need thier son or doughter 's help , so child have to thier housework to help thier parent . there are many housework . for instance , clean their family 's room , make the dinner , wash the dish , wash their cloth , and so on . therefore if they have to do them , they are tired and they have no time to help their community . nowadays young people have a lot of thing to do , i think , so they ca n't help their community , even if they want to help them .
