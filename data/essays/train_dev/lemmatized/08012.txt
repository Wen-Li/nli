in our growing day by day population we are inventing science and technology in a new manner whch are very usefull to our day to day life . peope are very eager to know the new technology and are willing to use them . firstly , one of the main oucoming is the technology used in car and people are very anxious to know and drive the latest model of car in day to day life . i don t agree with the author statement that in twenty year there will be fewer car in use than there are today , because people are owning it a a prestigious matter . secondly , the main reason for not agreeing with the author point is that car manufaturing company are making new car with new technology and new system which give more comfort and pleasure for thier costomers to use thier product . most people have a dream of owning a car . excluding rich people people who live in rural area feel very proud of themselves of owning a car , most of them use the car to go thier office . thirdly , i want to say that the author must have come to this decision that ther will be a fewer car in future is that he must have done his survey in a deserty area or in a remote area where there is no proper business or where there is connection of that place with the outside city like border area where there is a strict prohibition of car . there are many advantage by owning a car are we can go where ever we want where no type of communication provided by the goverment resourses , we can use the car when we want to go for a party with our family , friend , relative , etc . finally i want to say that in our world the people are willing to use the new technology used in car for many purpose . and we will see more car in our future than which are present today
