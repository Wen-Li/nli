this is the first time in the history of the humanity that the man is in a not-return point : the environmental condition of the our planet are very difficult because we are abused too much of the resource that the earth can give u . we can not mantain anymore our life condition because of the price to pay is too hight . is a reality that the environment and our way to manage it need a change . the huge presence of the car in all city of the world is maybe the principal cause of the world pollution . unfortunelly our economic system is based on resource that add pollution to the already present pollution . the main example is the oil . search , found , and utilise the oil comport a lot of danmage in the environment . before to have to choise an hursch and improvise change we can try to find different solution to change deeply our economic system . the alternative resource present in the environment need more financial aid and more attencion by the big economic company . these alternative resource are the energy of the wind , the sun and the warmness of the earth . it 's very impotant to give attencion to these differents solution , because one day , and mostly my generation , we will have the dury to change our point of view .
