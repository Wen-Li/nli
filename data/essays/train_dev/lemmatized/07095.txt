nowadays , many people want to success in their life . some people try to do very special thing that other people do n't try because they think that it is a way to make them better than other people . i agree that successful people try new thing and take risk rather than only doing what they already know how to do well . first , successful people try to do new thing and take risk because they want to resist themselves from the life . we live our life that is composed of continuous challenge . there is no way to avoid these challenge . if someone ignore the challenge , they will be a loser . not only this reason but also successful people want to examine themselves . they do n't like such a flat and normal matter and they want to improve themselves . also , they love themselves so they do n't want themselves to be lazy . it is really important point . second , successful people try new thing and take risk because they do n't afraid of other people 's saying . after people do the thing successfully , they feel self-confidence . it is such an important part of our life . if someone already succeed in some area , people will be admire him . however , if he fails in the other area , people will ignore him more than before he succeed . actually other people is not the whole part of his life . they are just part of his life . successful people know this so they do n't really mind other people . if we try new thing and take risk , we can improve ourselves more and more . we can feel self-confidence , too . success is not a whole part of our life , but we need it to make life better . if we try to make our life better , it will be great even though we fail in some area .
