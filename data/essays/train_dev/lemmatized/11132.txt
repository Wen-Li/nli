i disagree with that statement that say `` in twenty year there will be fewer car in use than there are today '' . because every year the technology are developing and help to change all te thing in better so the car is one from many thing it will be change and develop by technoloy . so every person want to use the car to o to his jop or to make shopping or to take is familly in vication . we cant alive without the car in twenty year or hundered because the life will be difficult and the car make every thing easy . espeacially for parent , teacher and student because not every one can use atrain in close place . the old an cant use the bike . all the people are different from each to other in power or the way they thinking and behavior for all this we cant live next year comming without car . we can use many different thing to move but the car is good thing to every one can use it . i see it will be imposile to use aplan or a train in our city or country so the mind say use the car . every one can use his car alone in any time to any place that he want in easy and he choise the pest fo him an select the coulor that he want with agood technology . there is many price to buy for bore or for rich people .
