some people might say that for the student it is more crucial to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact . however , i ptrfer to choose with the formal since the student are learning their subject based on fact from the school . firstly , a lot of adult are trying to teach and give them only the right factor without any explanation . for instant , whenever i had learned something from the school i did not understand the part of idea and concept on something but the teacher tought me the fact not the real idea of the problem . so it wa really hard for me to understand of my study and improve my studying skill . also i wa not even able to concentrate on the other part . on the other hand knowing only fact could be easier but unuseful and doe not make more sense . in addition , for the learner make them to understand more idea and concept are much better and they can feel more security . to sum up , a i said above , in my case telling kid the idea and concept are more critical than just let them know the fact . because student have to have their own right to think about some fact and should able to catch their ability a well a human 's freedom .
