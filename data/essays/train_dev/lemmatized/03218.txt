i agree with the statment that most advertisement make product seem much better than they really are . here are the reason why . first , advertisement tend to over exeggerate the effect of the product . for example , many cosmetic claim in their advertisement that they have speical element that make your skin white within just two week or make your face look better . when you see the advertisement you will be attracted by the slogan or marvel at it magical effect , and you will buy it . there 's no solid evidence or medical report that prof that the product is that useful , but the advertisement often use beautiful model and exaggerate speech to convince you to buy the product . second , the advertisement is a work being thoroughly and specially designed . through the lightening and computer adjustment , the product can be seen perfect in the advertisement . take the shampoo advertisement a an example , the model 's hair always look so shining and smooth in the ad after they use the shampoo . however , the hair is very artificial . there is no way people 's hair can be that perfect , but the company that produce the shampoo spends a huge amount of money on the filming to make you believe that their shampoo is really that good . finally , the advertisement is often selling a concept of lifestyle , not the product itself . it is not the product that is apealing , but the ideal lifestyle beneath it that attracks you . the product can be bad , but a long a you want to have the lifestyle that the advertisement promote , you will buy the product . for instance , in a house ad that emphasize on the idea that single woman can live alone happily , the house itself is not that important . it is the wish to live a a happy single noble that make you want to buy the house . to conclude , the advertisement is a carefully designed work that promotes concept and often exegerates the product . thus , it make the product seem much better that they really are .
