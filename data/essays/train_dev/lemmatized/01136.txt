i fundamentally agree with the statement that many advertisement make product seem better than they really are . however , we should not ignore the the benefit of the advertisement for this reason . to begin with , i admit that most advertisement do some exagerations on the product . it is also the reason why the manufacture are so fascinated in making advertisement . the ad arouse our interest by demonstrating how excellent the product are . for example , we can always see the ad for hair cleaning product on tv . some model or famous start come out to show their extremely shiny and smooth hair , and they tell u the special product is the reason for their beautiful hair . it is really attractive . but when we buy the product from the market and use them , we will find that the result is not a good a the they claim in the ad . from this aspect , we are cheated by the ad . however , the various advertisement play significant role in our life . on the one hand , we can receive some introduction and suggestion from them . imagine when we are shopping in the super market , we must to face thousand of brand . there even would be hundred kind of soft drink . if we know nothing about the product , we must spend lot amount of time on selection . with different ad , situation change . we must be aware of several brand of the soft drink , then we can choose from these small range . on the other hand , advertisement ha became a big industry . both the customer and the manufacture need the ad firm . and these firm supply large number of job opportunity for our society every year . therefore , the advertisement are necessary for u . last but not least , the quality and service determine the product ' fate ultimately , not the ad . we customer may be cheated once , but not always . besides , not every product is bad . the famous and lasting brand in most field are good enough for the customer , in fact . as this reason , i think it is acceptable when some advertisement exagerate the benefit of the product . based on the above reason , i believe that advertisement would serve good function to our society , although they sometimes make the product seem better than they really are .
