a person is succesful because the person ha different skill than an average person ha . i believe that succesful people try new thing and take risk rather than only doing what they already know how to do well . successful pople are open minded , and they experience new thing to improve their skils . first of all , successful people have wide horizon , and they have no limit . they try all type of new thing so these new thing make the people achieve succes in their life . for instance , bill gates is a successful person . he had a broad horizon , and created the microsoft . he had an idea to create an application in order to improve people 's life . his work in technology made people gain some extra time in their work . second of all , people who like to experiment new thing reach succes in life . successful people should have new idea , and these new idea lead people to experiment . experimenting a new thing let other thing to come out . people with new experiment and new idea help society to rise so these experiment positively affect the public a a whole . for instance , the turkish leader ataturk is a successful person . he experiment new revolution in turkey . he brought latin alphabet instead of the arabic alphabet , and also he let woman to vote in turkey after he wa chosen a a presedent . his revolution led turkey to be secular country instead of being a religious country . he made change a whole in the public a a individual . as a result , trying new thing and be open minded lead people to success . i believe succesful people have a mind that is very broad , and they can bring their dream true in life . they can make possitive affect on the pei
