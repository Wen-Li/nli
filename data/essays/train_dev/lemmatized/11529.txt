the world continues to explore and build modern technology to facilitate our life or simply to satisfy our curiosity to know more about the world and what we can benefit form it . cars are one of these many successful invention . despite their usefulness and popularity , car present environmental problem . this issue of global warming and the greenhouse effect is one that is talked about environmentalist and world leader . due to the effort to tackle this problme one may expect a decrease in car usage over the next twenty year . however , i do not think that there will be fewer car because there are no sign of decreasing vehicle in our current society . moreover , it efficiency and luxury it can provide outweigh the issue of global warming for anyone to consider the imediment of car usage . there are also hybrid car which i believe will increase in number and user . in the status quo , rather than seeing a decrease in people using car , we see more people acquiring them . the various brand of the car continue to advertise their new luxury carriage and customer continue to appreciate car . this ha been the case for many year since car first came into existence and unless some new , wild , completely advantageous invention is revealed to replace car , i am inclined to believe that there will be more car in use around the globe . the increasing carbon dioxide emmisions and it effect on the earth ha and continues to be explored . in effort to minimise the harm caused by all the human invention , including car , car brand are now advertising hybrid car which run on natural fuel that cause considerably le pollution . such invention prove that people love car and can not part with them right now when they do not see the complete significance of global warming . hybrid car are a solution to solve the problem of wanting to decrease carbon dioxide emission but also to continue driving . thus , there is no need , in the eye of many people , to stop driving car for any reason . cars continue to expand it horizon a it improves it ability to do thing . for example , car navigation system and dvd player insertion are all new improvement to satisfy customer . the usefuleness and it easy use attracts more people to obtain their driving license and for driver to renew their car every so often . furthermore , owning a car give the owner responsibility in life , heightening their feeling of independence . in addition to this new acquired independence and property , one begin to be interested in the type , make and ability the car posse . to show off with the car becomes a new motive . furthermore , with developing economy all over the world , more people are willing to spend their fortune on car . such arousal in emotion and considerable effect on one 's life only interest people to buy and use car . twenty year seem almost too soon for people to stop driving car . with developing technology and economy i can only conclude that we will continue to see a many car in use if not more . only a new technology like `` floo powder '' in the world of harry potter could possibly divert people 's attention away from car .
