i would like to travel in a group led by tour guide , because this way make my trip better . actually , there are negative aspect in a group trip . for examle , it reduces my own free time . if i travel in a group , i have to pay attension to other people so even when i want to buy suvenior taking a long time , i can not do this . however there are more good aspect in a group trip . last year , i went to australia in a group . as it wa my first trip to go abroad , i felt a little nurvous at the first time but gradually we began to talk each other and my nurvousness wa removed . more , during the trip , i lost my wallet , but people who travel with me looked for my wallet together . at that time , i wa very moved . moreover , a tour guide taught me a lot of thing about australia . before i traveled in australia , i know few thing about australia , but thanks to a toue guide , i learn a lot of thing about australia , for instance , the history of australia and aboliginy . when i wa a junior high school student , i read a book whose main locaion is australlia and the man in the book climb the ululu , so i wanted to climb there . however a tour guide told me that ululu is the speciall place for aboliginy and they do not want u to climb . i did not know such a thing . that is why , thanks to a trip in a group and tour guid , i had a very good time during my trip , so i agree with the statement that the best way to travel in a group led by tour guide .
