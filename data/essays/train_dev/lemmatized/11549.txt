i certainly agree with the statement that young people enjoy life more than older people do . there are several reason why i think that young people are making the most of their age while the older generation is gradually retiring from life except a selected few . according to me , the young generation is much active , able and resourceful to enjoy the life much better than the older generation . today 's youth ha tremendous opportunity to make the most of life and they are grabbing this opportunity to make their life better each day . in contrast , the older people ha much le resource and opportunity to enjoy life . basically , the concept of life and enjoyment ha changed totally since the past year . nowadays enjoyment is considered to be a part of daily activity and some time is kept aside for that . but the older generation is not used to such modern idea and life for them at an advanced age is full of misery , complaint and trouble . today , young people are healthy and they keep their fitness level up by carrying out a well planned regime . as the age advance , the older people can not maintain a healthy lifestyle and ultimately face many health related problem which cause a hinderance for them to enjoy life . imagine how a 60 or 70 year old female will travel to some hill station or let her hair down in a party when she cant even let her foot down from the bed due to age related disease like osteoarthritis in her knee ? nowadays , the younger generation are indulging in work and pleasure equally , thus , balancing all the necessary walk of life . they plan every weekend to a new destination either a movie or some exotic location after a long and tiring week . the disco and the party culture is a hype among the youth today which are not an older generation commodity . finally , much depends on how you take life in general . because a norman vincent peale mention in his book ` power of positive thinking ' that a positive outlook towards life is much important to lead an enjoyable and successful life and today youth are walking on his foot step leaving everything else far behind .
