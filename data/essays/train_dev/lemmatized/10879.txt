i am desagree with the young people nowadays do n't give enough time to helping their community . the young people like a best world and they work in these way , if they can . sometimes that look different because the young people at the same time like to enjoy and a few time or a few people look only they think yourself . the young people need see the future , not only the present because they live with the problem of the society and they try to help . i think the youn people try to need more and more responsability and decide about the future and said what are their opinion . another reason because i think the young people helping their community it 's because they work , married , enjoy and these is easy if they do n't have problem . definitly the young people try to help with the society problem , because they know , they have the same problem in the future and try found the best solution .
