for student , to understand idea and concept which represent the theory , and to learn fact which is the practice ; are both important . the practice is necessary in field such a sciences . to make a theory , you have to practice first . a basic example will be the gravity discovery by newton : when an apple fell on his head . all experience bring to a conclusion which is the theory . but before arriving to the theory , scientist have to define the problem , make hypothesis , practice , find a solution and draw an hypothesis . nowadays , in science class such a chemistry , physic , or biology , student have to follow the same pattern : problem , hypothesis , practice and solution which lead to the theory . thus the theory is the result of the practice . for education and everyday life , it is very important . it represents a base , a fundemental part to understand a topic . before doing an application , you have to know the application in the entire . the theory is very important because , it explains how something work . for example , you will not use a technological product without reading the instruction book . also , in mathematics with complicated formula , the practice can be very hard , that is why it is easier to give directly the theory to student . but we could say that theory can be easier than the practce , because theory demand only to speak . on the contrary , practice is to get involve in a project and make thing to achieve , which is much more difficult . i disagree with this statement , because , to my mind , for student , it is not more important to understand idea and concept than it is to learn fact . for them , both are important . to receive the best instruction , it is necessary to undersand idea and learn fact a well , if not the education will not be complete .
