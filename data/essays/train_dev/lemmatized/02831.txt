transportation is a very crucial dimension of globalization of which we are experiencing in it highest speed . the first car started to be used in the beginning of the 20th century and have been used for decade a the most available machine for those who are eager to use it . according to my futuristic view about car in the following twenty year , there will not be fewer car in use than there are today , but more . i can certainly argue that the globalization process in the `` third world country '' will be a very important factor which will lead to the increse in the number of car . secondly , because of the lack of the culture of the usage of alternative mechanism in transportation , the increase will continue . thirdly , the non-existence of alternative machine produce which are cheap and effective a car will be another reason for the increase . finally , even though all of these three handicap disappear , the government policy and the interest of car-producing corporation will hinder the achievement in reducing the number of car in use . firstly , globalization is a process which can not be stopped in the near future . there are significant number of country which entered the globalization age in the near past , there fore they do not have the number of car a many a the number of the car in the west . therefore , the country like china , india , the country of africa or other country which are not ndustrialized or are not in the free market system newly possesing that culture of usage if car , which simply measn that there will be more car in use in the near future . secondly , in many of the country , government suffer from the lack of the culture of using alternative source of transportation . modernized country promote the usage of mass transportation and therefore , people living there are used to be directed to these alternative . but in the country like turkey , people do not have the consciousness of mass transportation , instead every individual tend to buy a car for themselves , which is obviously a factor increasing the number of car . thirdly , many of car user do not want to give up using their car since it is very useful and it provides opprtunities to them of which others do not have . people living in istanbul would not give up their car since there is a huge mass of car on the road which creates a problem for mass transportation user . when there is a jam on the road , the best possible way to rescue yourself from that will not be using mass transportation and get stuck on the road with those heavy and slow machine , but instead you will want to use your car . finally , government in le industrialized country do not have policy to cope with traffic problem and they do not promote policy to reduce the number of car in use . on the other hand , the company or corporation who produce these car will not be willing to stop their production since that will destroy their interest . these corporation are always in contact with the government in which they are established and will try to do everything beneficial to their interest . in conclusion , i believe that there will be more car in use than today . the condition of globalization and the certaio
