in my opinion there is no single correct answer to this question . of course both way can lead to success . my main reasoning is that it depends on the path one want to follow whether an academic specialization make sense or not . my aim is to explain this argument in the following sentence by looking at the broad academic field of business . in switzerland , a master student can choose whether he want to specialize in one specific subject - a finance - or to keep his focus on a broad approach which includes subject such a marketing , human resource , finance , strategic management , risk management , leadership . to illustrate my hypothesis mentioned above i will now have a look at two different job within a company . a general manager and his management team need not to be specialized in one specific subject a they have to address problem of many different field - such a leadership issue , marketing decision and financial topic . an important aspect in the job of a manager is the need to quickly decide on many different issue . thus a broad education is actually an advantage . an employee in the financial sector such a in a bank doe not need to have such a broad knowledge . rather it is essential that he posse in-depth knowledge of the transaction within the sector and on the sector itself . the job requirement is much more focused . rather than just knowing little about everything it is advisable to have a solid knowledge of this special topic - and finance for example is actually still a rather broad subject . but of course it is needle to say that knowledge is allways an added asset . however one ha to decide first which path will be chosen in order to be able to make a sound decision whether an academic specialization make sense .
