contrary to popular belief , there are many people who are quite successful although they did not invent new thing and therefore had no risk , such a people who inherited a fortune . however , i am convinced that you normally have to be innovative to be successful in life . i will try to explain this with the help of economic and political successful person a well a person who lead a perfectly well marriage . firstly , people who succeeded in earning a lot of money , such a boss of big company , must often find a new way to sell thing . if you take reinhold wuerth , a famous economist and one of the richest men in the world , this becomes quite clear ; for example , he sell highly specialiced manufacturing tool . certainly , he had to find this gap in the market and it wa a great risk to sell such specialiced tool at the beginning . secondly , successful politians have to be extraordinary and thus have to have new idea . of course , it is also critical to have a common knowledge , but the crucial point is to be innovative . imagine a politician who just act and think in a way everyone else do . he would never become famous and no one would know him . however , this indludes to take responsibily for others and this also mean to take risk . finally , one must take into consideration that people who are happily married are successful in some way . it is a well-known fact that finding an appropriate partner is highly difficult . people who found there true love had to take the risk of failure . to draw a conclusion , i would say that there are many different way to be successful . however , regardless of which way you consider a really successful , you have to meet the general criterion which i have just mentioned .
