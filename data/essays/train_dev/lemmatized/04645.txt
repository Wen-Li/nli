i agree with the statement that it is more important for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact . it is very important for student to understand thing or idea which are told by the teacher or parent . the understanding idea will be immensely benfitical to the student in many way . if the student having this capability to understand thing they can acheive any thing , that mean they can win in any feild . this capability of understanding is also useful in their future . i mean this understandability is useful while spending with their friend , and with their life partner . if there is good understanding between friend and lifepartner , there is no possibility of clash . the student should having this understanding capability from their childhood . the teacher and parent must having the responsibility of learning this capability to the childrens . this understanding capability stand a person in very high position in the society . thes kind of people can survive any where in the society . and these kind of people can solve their problem and they can solve their neighbour problem also . there by the people automatically give respect to them . and there by they can increase their friend circle . it is benfitical to them . ilerning fact also important for the student . but it take lot of time for learning fact . in this mean time people may do many mistake . rather than learning , if the people having the capacity of understanding idea there may be little chance to do the mistake . for example if we can understand if touch the fire , it burn , we never comit that mistake . if we are not that capacity of undersatnding , the fire burn u . thats why the undersatnding capability is very important for student .
