i absolutly agree with the statement , that it is more important for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact for several reason : first , our everyday action are not based on fact we learned by heart but on idea we understood . an easy example is the action crossing the street , i look to the right and to the left to ensure that there is no car on the street , because i understand that it is dangerous to walk through a street with driving car on it since they would drive over me . if i only had learned it by heart i would have crossed a street with driving car on it and so i would n't be here doing the toefl . second , you can only solve a problem if you understand the problem . you will never come to a appropriate solution of a problem just learning some fact . an example herefore is a mathematic task : although you might have learned all relevant fact for a test you will face problem when the task derives from the standard task you have practiced in your math lesson . third , the recency factor of idea you understood once is much higher than this of learned fact . i still know how to calculate the volume of a cube but i do n't know all capital city anymore . the reason for this phenomen is easy : i learned calculating the volume through logicall thinking and not through simply learning fact . all together for me it is proven that idea you understood one will help you your whole live in different situation , let it be in lessure time or in business , but fact you learned by heart , will be forgotten a soon a the test ha been written .
