in my opinion , it is important to have a broad knowledge of many academic subject than to specialize in one specific subject . the first point of my argumentation is that you often do not know which subject or topic you mainly prefer when you are interessted in many thing . when you want get a broad knowledge you do n't have to chose early in which kind of direction you later get a job . another point to support my opinion is , that when you later get a job you can work more flexible with the knowledge in more subject . so , you can work not only in one part of a company . for example , when you are only studying economy you get probably a job in the bureau . but when you are studying english or any other foreign language addictionally to economy , you probably work a a salesman or get a job in other country too and not only in germany . and if your company need specialist for some kind of project they are going to start , you can get le difficultly this knowledge by going to evening school or something like that . it 's more difficult to expand your knowledge when you are specialized only in one subject . so you are not able to work in this project , because you need too much time to get more knowledge about a foreign subject . the most important reason why a broad knowledge is more important than to specialize in one subject is , that you more easily secure your job . when the company ha to leave one complete part of the company and you probably are in it , you have no more chance to work for this company in the future . but with more qualification you can still work in another section of your old company .
