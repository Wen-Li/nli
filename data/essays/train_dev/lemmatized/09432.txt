some advertisement will make product seem much better than they really are . the marketing industry ha become more and more challenged over the year . the public ha gotten used to the word , the style and the product themselves and advertising ha come to the point to be le convincing . trying to impress with `` word or manicured picture '' that do not reveal the whole truth about the product in order to catch the eye of the consumer is a distraction from the reality , but the continuous repetition of the advertising make it almost believe that the promoted product is `` real '' . let 's mention two clear example : - in the real estate world : just read almost any advertising on a residence for sale . it is written to make your dream come true and to stimulate your curiosity to see the house . while you are in that proccess , you have almost `` falled in love '' with your next home and by the time you got to see it , you might be dissapointed ( or not ) and will have to fight with your created emotion through advertisment ( dream ) against reality . - another clear example of this kind of advertising is regarding time share property . have you ever assist to one of those presentation where they present the product and give you freesbees ? the promoter will try to convince you of all the benefit of having that type of property to the point that you might agree , at the end of the presentation , that if you do not own one of those unit right at that moment , you will never be able to travel again due to the increase of hotel rate and bla , bla , bla . .. what a distraction from reality ! there are many other example in our industry : food product camuflaged under beautiful shining picture , pill to loose weight without having to exercise or diet , the magic of certain cooking product that will make homemaker 's life easier and so on . .. educate yourself and open your eye so you will not get scammed with false statement !
