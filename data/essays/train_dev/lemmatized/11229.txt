some peope in japan say that young peopel give enough time to helping their comunity , however , i agree with the satament that young peopele do not ginve enough time to helping their comunity for the followin reason , first , youug people can not have enough time to helping their community because it is harder for yourg people to live on fo theirselves . for example , i have started working in the goldman sachs , which is one of the most famous investment bank , in the tokyo branch in japan from 1996 . at that time japanese economy wa the worst of the worst , so it wa very difficuit for young peopele to find out and hold even a working place in japan . fortunetely , i found a good company to work for , and since then , i had worked for long time every day without long sleep and a lot of rest . considering this situation , we , young people , can not have enough time to suoport our commynities . second , comunities ha been decayed themselves . for example , i live in roppongi , tokyo , japan , which is one of the cental district of japan . a lot of youg people , who have to work for long time for themselves , live in this area . at this area , each people doe not have any idea that a community exists itself . in this circumstance young people do not think to help for the community . so they do not give no time to helping their communitis . considering the situation in rural area , there might be opposite opinion mentioned above . but a lot of young peopel think for the opinion mentioned above . thus , i strongly believe that young poepele do not give enough time to supporting ther community .
