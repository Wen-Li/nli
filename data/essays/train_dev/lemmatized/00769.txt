i agree with the opinion that understanding idea and concept is more important for student than learnig fact for them . i will explain the three reason . first , i think understanding concept is basic . you ca n't build a high building without rock a a basis even though you may build a short block like a house on the sand . if you learn the fact without accurate concept , you may hear you are smart at first . but eventually you will confuse the meaning and the pile of thr fact will collase . second , i think you should experience the proper process . everything ha an order in process . understanding concept is a start . so you ca n't understand further fact without them . if you skip something , you will meet the trouble in the end . speaking again , if you ignore the process of understanding accuratly , you will find you did n't know even a easy thing . third , you should undersand the academic thing a a whole . all the thories and fact link together . you should understand something through another thing . if you learn fact separately , it seems like you see the tree but ca n't see the forest . so i think that understanding idea and concept is more important than learning fact . a pile of there is no meaning without basic understanding .
