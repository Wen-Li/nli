i totally agree with the statement that `` successful people try new thing and take risk rather than only doing what they already know how to do well '' . in our life , we have a lot of chance to face to the delimma situation . sometime we will follow the indicatation by people who have the same experience and know the best answer . however , sometime we just take a chance even we know it might have some risk . in my opinion , i support that we should take chance in trying new thinds . first and foremost , everyday we will meet numerous of new thing . if we always just fellowed the rule that were given by others , we would miss a lot of chance to learn thing by ourselves . for example , when i wa child , i always copy the essay from my sister , because i know she always get high grade than me . but after i grew up , i try to write by myself , to my astonished , i found that writting is a such interesting thing . moreover , i can learn new vocabulary and skill from writting . if i did not do it by myself , i would never find the fun of writting . second , we will never know the result , it might be good or be bad . it is life , is not it ? it is more impressed if the result is came from ourselves . we can learn from the bad result and never do it again . also remember the good result in mind , next time when we meet the same situation , we know the answer . futhermore , after trying new thing and getting good result , the feeling of satisfy is the most wonderful feeling in the world , everytime i make a right dicision , i will very proud by myself and talk to everybody to share my joy . even some of my friend wil be encouraged . in conclusion , i think take chance when trying new thing carry more weight than doing what they already know how to do .
