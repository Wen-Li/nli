i do not agree with the statement because of the following three reason . the student will not have chance to confirm that what they know is true , and it might cause the decrease of the student ' interest towards the subject . also , they will not have ability to adjust their own knowledge to perform in the actual world which is the main reason why student learn . therefore , it is not more important for studnets to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact . understanding idea and concept are recieving information from others who have already experienced , and by not being able to actually see how the idea and concept work , the student might not be able to have enough interest about the subject a they should be . if the student are not actively experiencing the fact on their own , they can easily doubt that if those idea and concept are true in real world . lacking the ability to see how they actually work can cause the decrease of their interest , which brings negative affect on learning habit . students without skill to perform correct action in the real world often do not have enough experience which come from learning fact of their own experience . as they grow up and prepare to play a important role in the society , it is required to have a lot of knowledge a well a enough experience to know how to adjust the knowledge for each specific situation . students with only idea and concept which other people have introduced will lack the ability to gather specific information of their own and place them into a correct consequence . it is more important for student to learn fact because it increase the willingness for student to learn a well a the ability to perform better in various situation in the real world .
