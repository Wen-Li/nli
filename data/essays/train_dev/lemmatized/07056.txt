in my opinion , young people really enjoy their life more than older people do . as we see some example , we can figure out how much young people enjoy their life . using those example , we can generalize young people . young people have enough time and healthy , so they can try many thing which they want to do . for instance , if old people want to do sky junping , they usually can not do that because their body is very weak , but young people can do that without worring about physical problem . besides , if old people want to travel whole world , it will take a lot of energy , but old people can not deal with that . on the contrary , young people can do that well . usually , old people have their child and family , so they have to protect them against poverty . even though old people want to travel and have break , they can not take that , because if they take break to enjoy life , they will lose their job , so they can not enjoy their life more than young people , for they have reponsibility for their family . young people , they really have enough time to enjoy their life . when youhg people tri to do something to enjoy life , unfortunrattely , sometimes they could get in hard situation . they have to spend lot of time to escape from that situation . through that experience , they can learn something and improve themselves . however , if old people tri to do new someting so a to enjoy their life , and they get into hard situation , they will not recover their life because they don not have enough time unlike young people . from above example , i agree wtih the mention that young people enjoy life more than older people do . it wa completed from objective example that i suggested in the writing .
