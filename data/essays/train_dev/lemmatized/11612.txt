in the following i 'd like to explain my opinion to the statement : `` it is better to have a broad knowledge of many academic subject than to specialize in one specific subject . '' when you talk to people about famous personality like e.g. about the german inventor albert einstein , you often get to hear that he wa good in what he did , but he totally failed in other thing . for instance he did develop a great theory in math , but he had difficulty in getting a diploma because he wa really bad in all the other subject when he went to school . this is one example for someone who did specialize in one specific subject and therefore did not have a broad knowledge of many other academic subject . in my opinion the statement at the top is both , half right and half wrong . on the one hand i think that the statement is right . for example it 's much more interesting when you know a lot of thing about a lot of different subject . it 's easier for you to have a conversation with other people or to be accepted in society . as you can see with most nobel-prize winner ; they all are very clever in what they do , but since they are so specialized in what they do , they most of the time do n't have a lot of friend to share their knowledge with ( because it 's way too difficult for `` normal '' people to understand what they are talking about ) or even worse do n't even have their own family . the specific knowledge of a subject make them outsider , and often outsider are outlawed until they make a new invention or win any prize . on the other hand i do n't agree with the statement that it 's better to have a broad knowledge of many academic subject than to specialize in one specific one , because without person who specialize in one specific subject there would not be progress in the world . we would still be living in cave and using stone to light a fire if there had n't been someone who specialized in the subject of how to light a fire without first searching for firestone , and then hoping for good luck to make the firestone work properly to finally cook a meal . there also would not be any help for people with a dangerous disease if there had n't been clever people who specialized in medicine and found out how to heal a bad disease like cancer . they would not have been a successful a they are if they had n't just specialized in this one specific subject .
