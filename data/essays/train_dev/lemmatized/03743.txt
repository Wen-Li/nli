about a couple of year ago , my friend and i went trip to australia and newzealand for 2 week . we went in a group of 20 people led by a korean tour guide . people in a group including u visited the same place at a time and we had a same meal everytime . i thought that it wa totally ridiculous and i paid money in vain . we could n't even enjoy thing that we could have . it is not a good memory for me but a worthless exhausting trip . there is some crucial disadvantage when we travel in a group led by a tour guide . first of all , it just get rid of my interest about the touring place . a tour guide tell u everything , and we should go place only where the tour guide lead u . there can be many thing that i am going to get interested in that the tour guide is going to miss out . as far a i am concerned , i usually search some information before i do something . in fact , i did n't know that i am supposed to go in a group . i expected that i go with my friend i found many information about the australia and newzealand such a famous place , fee that i have to pay , the climate , transportation and so on . . and i prepared some plan to go and have some special meal . but it wa just a dream . if we go trip not in a group , but indivually , we could go place where we wanted . we could do thing flexibly and do n't have to take up useless time . it make me have food that i really wanted . there are many thing to see that we need to take some time . it simply enables u to do it . going individually could really help u enjoy the whole trip .
