does age really make a difference towards enjoyment ? is it only the young who can enjoy and not the old ? enjoyment is a feeling which every human being experience . each person whether young or old can enjoy in different way . enjoyment ha no bar however the type of activity one maybe involved in to enjoy may differ . for example , for a young person going to the disco or pub may be a form of entertainment and enjoyment , however for an older person just reading a book , watching television or going for a long walk may be more satisfying rather than going to the disco . but not all young people would do this a a form of enjoyment . due to one maturity and age , older people may not like to be around noise or for medical reason , they may not be able to drink at pub . a person who is old is unable to do thing that a younger person can . for example a young person may like to go rope climbing or bungee jumping to enjoy him/herself . an older person may not be able to engage in such activity a he/she may not be physically strong to be able to do so even if he/she may really want to . from the above example , it is visible that there are certain activity that an older person may not be able to indulge in due to their age or physical situation . each one form of enjoyment may differ , not everyone who is young may want to go to a disco or pub . a younger person may also like to stay at home and read . hence it not only the young who can enjoy , it also the old who can enjoy in their own way . hence age should not be a factor towards enjoying life ! lets live life to the fullest since it is short !
