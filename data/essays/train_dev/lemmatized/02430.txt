yes , i strongly agree with this statement . many company use this technique in-order to increase their selling quantity and so higher profit . advertisements in their nature purpose to be so , a they should appeal to the people in the most attractive manner , specially when the advertisment deal with product associated with teenager . advertisments can be false either when it atempts to use inaccurate and exaggerated information or when it state fact about a product that are in-fact not true . almost any country ha law and punishment concerning about such issue . i can easily give support and example from our daily exposure to such advertisement , for example : the orbit channel advertisement ; the one related to the chemical hair remover `` epil stop '' . the advertisement say that the solution remove the hair from it root and in few minute . we bought the product for my mom , and she tried it , but it appeared that the solution is unable to remove the hair from it root , however , it just wipe the hair at the surface level . another example is the advertisement for milk , protein product , or energy drink . as the person in the advertisement show a specially supernatural power immediatly after drinking it , like winning in a running race , flying , or being able to get good grade . another example is advertisments for certain car , like the one for chevorlete , when the driver of the car stop immediatly to avoid killing an animal , while in a very short ( phyisically impossible ) stopping distance . advertisements are always exaggerated in way or another ; thats the nature and the philosophy of the advertisement . but exaggeration should be limited . sometimes such exaggeration might be constructive , a in the case of the milk advertisment , a it encourage kid to drink more milk . however , it might be in some case disadvantageous , a it would be a waste of money , a in the case of the hair remover .
