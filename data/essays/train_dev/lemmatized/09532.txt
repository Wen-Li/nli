apparently , young people have much more time to enjoy themselves . however , it is difficult that to say that young peole enjoy life more than older people do . there is a problem somewhat too colplicated to speak easy way . everyone enjoys their life . indeed they enjoys their life in their own way . so young people and older people both enjoy their life , but in their specific way . older people , of course , have more time to work in their field to make money for their family . sometimes they can not have a break all day long . even , in asian country , older people can not have a vacation all around year . they have great royalty to their family . although they may complain about their life like this , they will not leave it . sometimes they enjoy this situation , to have chance to support their family by themselves and to grow their child in better circumstance . this is the life actually they enjoy everyday . young people can not help enjoying their time everyday . they have no responsibility to work for someone except simple homework . so young people have much more time to spend for themselves , in my experience , more time doe not mean more joyful . in fact , young people spend time useless more often than older peole do . but it is obvious that if young people can manage their life valuable , they have much more chane to ( really ) enjoy their life . in conclusion , the critical point of about this question is not the quantity but the quality of life managing . although older people have le time for themselves to enjoy than younger people , they can manage their life more valuable , so they can enjoy about the result .
