nowadays , people however their age , are selfish because of the value convey by the modern society and the capitalism value . indeed , everybody think about itself so young people have grown in this atmosphere of '' me and myself '' . the life go fast and we want to pursuit and achieve our plan because today everything is planning per advance and their is no time for a civic behaviour . in addition , the globalisation and internationalisation make the population mix a their is more mixed community people and there is an identication problem : which community for which people ? regarding to the recent event , community are rival and fight between them . so , their is no unity in this world why young people would change this by help who and with which mean ? the modern life make young people very nacisic and selfish but some want to implicate themselves in a cause , in something they can progress and be usefull . some will help the oldest and desabled people in their neighborhood by making the shopping for them . others will comme in an association to create a better life place for their community . indeed some association and organisation have social aim in which young want to be involve . in my case , i really want to represent the black in france because their is a lack of representativeness even on medium , fashion , intellectual and scientist work . so i went to boucle d'ebene association which promote african and caribean entrepreuneurs even if i have my study and different thing to manage before to help them . to conclude , i agree with the fact that they is a lack of motivation by young people to involve themselve in social and civic activity to help their community . in fact , they seem to be over booked by they stuff a school , work , friend , early child . .. indeed , nowadays young people have much more responsabilities than fifty year ago ! but the reality is that they is a lot of young which want to change some thing in this world by giving time to helping their community . however , sometimes they do n't have the mean to achieve their project a to create an association or a company and sometimes , they are dissuaded by the loss ricognition and credit they are given .
