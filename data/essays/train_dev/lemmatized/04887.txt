in my opinion the statement is too simple . there are also argument demonstrating that older people may enjoy life more . older people have a lot of experience . they can judge and analyze certain event better than younger people . older people are often in a better financial position than young people are . so they often have the opportunity to buy thing or to realize project younger people maybe ca n't afford . with so much incertainty in the world today recent poll in germany for example demonstrate that older people feel more secure than twens or even teenager . in a certain age one is able to review your life and to look back including the goal you achieved , but al the disappointment . young people are sometimes to optimistic about their opportunity and goal they can achieve , but with a certain experience of age some people gain a certain kind of realism that help them to organize their life in a proper way . as newspaper article and the tv show many young people do have problem and are very sad . on the other hand younger people are generally healthier than older person , so they can be more active and dont ' need to take much care about illness or risk . they are maybe even not aware of the risk , what can be an advantage and a disadvantage at the same time , because you do n't really care about smoking or drinking risk . because many experience in life can be negative , younger people are often le preoccupied with thing than olders . they try thing that are new for them instead of thinking about negative event older people automatically take in mind . in general you cant ' say that younger people are better off than the generation of parent or grandparent . enjoying life is a matter of character and personal situation , not a question of age . in all generation there do exist happy and sad character . every age can be enjoyable , but every time in life also cover the risk of disappointment or even pain . life is life .
