young people nowdays go to school , go to mall and other place where they meet new people and of course they need time to make friend . and when they make friend they are going to be in community with them by going to their house or even by calling them and they have to give up some time to do that . i agree with the statement that they do n't , and by not doing that they lose a lot of the benefit of the friendship like the friend can help them when they need to or they can have alot of fun by going out with them . it ha some bad effect if the person they are in community with ha some bad idea and he share them with young person . young people really should get some advise about that from his teacher , father or mother and by that they are avoiding alot of problem if they choose the right person . by taking time to thing and by focusing on the person 's behavior you can know even befor talking to him if he is the right person to be your friend or not . in conclusion if the young people give up some time to help their community they can avoid alot of problem by choosing the wrong person to be their friend .
