the first quote that come to my mind when i read the statement is `` jack of all , master of none '' . i do not support incomplete knowledge not only because of it non reliabilty , also because it is harmful to a certain extent . there ha always been a difference in `` knowing '' some thing about many thing and `` mastering '' everything about something . a specialization on a specific subject matter not only enhances one ability to excel in that field , but it also creates some great oppurtunities for the person to make a mark in his field . having a broad knowledge in more than one subject doe not complete the any of the above purpose . the highest one can probably do is have a general talk about it and nothing more . but thats not one can do all his life !!! just talk a little about many thing he know . specialization is an achievement in itself . it not only give the student a satisfaction of achievemnt but also a sense of pride to have gained the kind of knowledge he ha always craved for . it give u a kind of security within . a kind of peace . one becomes reliable on his most trusted knowledge on a certain subject . one begin to trust himself and becomes confident of his action , and confidence is the architect of one 's bright future . specialization doe a lot more than just keeping one occupied proffesionally . it increase the knowledge base of a person and also make the person crave for more knowledge in that area and in this way he outsmarts himself everyday . it make one life a challenge each day . it make one life more and more exciting !!! area of expertise is not just appreciated proffesionally but also in the long run it is appreciated a a gathered amount of information on a subject matter . it is not useful for the person alone but for the society , friend , family a well . and hence i believe in mastering in what one is passionate about than broad knowledge of wide range of subject .
