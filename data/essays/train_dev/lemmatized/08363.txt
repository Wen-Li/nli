i do completely agree with this statement . in my opinion , necessity of higher education have changed tremendously in the past 50 year . as human knowledge exploded during this period of time , requirement for higher education changed a well . today , because the amount of information available is so enormously big , nobody can be able to know everything any more . it ha become more important to learn how to find fact at the moment they are required than in fact knowing them by heart . nearly all information is available at any place and any time on the internet , so the problem ha changed from having a certain piece of information to finding it . schools and university can not teach all fact , even just in a small field , any more . they can , in my opinion , only supply an overview and basic knowledge on their field of study . any further information is just to be found and immediately used when required . as everything becomes more intrepid and complicated , i find it important to develope a certain specialisation on a very particular , small field of knowledge to be successful . therefore , i need to understand basic idea and concept of all the concern and issue , my subject and job requires . but the factor that make me really valueable for my employer , for example , is the individual , very precise knowledge i have on a certain field , which i can , of course , integrate in greater circumstance by my basic knowledge of the subject i 'm working on . this is why i think the statement is completely right . i would even go further and state that it get also more important to individualise one 's education independently , a i described above . private study others than the one offered at university , school and by employer will become a important a the classical one considered a higher education . but for studying these , the understanding of idea and concept will be the main issue .
