i definetely agree with the statement that in twenty year there will be fewer car in use than there are today . it is not exaggeration that we now live in car society . cars made a revolution of transformation method , they established the position a the most convenient transportation method . besides , car market is also one of the biggest commercial market , and car are essential to our economy . considering the statement , however , we need to pay attention to the disadvantags of them . using car cause the enrvironmental problem ; for example , an air pollution and the earth warming . as the gas which are excluded from each car contaminates the air especially in the city , people are suffering from the uncleared air . to make matter worse , it is reported that it can cause the earth warming , which is the biggest environmental problem not only for the people of city dweller but also the people in the world . moreover , in term of the natural resorces , car requires a lot of gasoline to mobilize them . gasoline are made by refining the petrogen , which is said to run out in 25 year in the earth . from the point of the human society , using car generates a number of traffic accident due to the careless mistake or the drive by the drunker . traffic accident are the social problem in my country , japan , and more than 10000 people are killed every year . considering the other transportation method , such a the plane , the train , the bus , there are more advantage than car have . these public transportation system can carry much more people , and save the fuel and natural resorces . accordingly , they do n't pollute the environment a much a the car . in term of safety , they can lose the possibility of facing the accident by using these system . the rate of encounting accident of public system are much lower than the car . if you can dring a lot or get tired , you can go home by using them . as i mentioned above , there are more good point in using public transportation system . of course , car provides u the enlightment of driving and some people are fascinated with the speed . but now we need to take care of the disadvantage in term of the envirnment and safety . i believe people will soon give up using car , and use public system in stead .
