that is right that some people think that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their community . i will explain in this writing which is my opinion . i am 18 year old and then i am just an adult . that mean that i heard this statement there is not a long time . in fact , all grandparent or parent said that their child do not do all they must do for the community . then they think that young people nowadays do not give enought time to helping their community . they always said that their childhood wa more difficult than it is for u . it is very boring when all the time parent are against you do or have done . that is why , i am disagree with this statement . i will explain much better the reason in a second paragraph . this statement is for my opinion wrong . in fact a lot of people help old age people when they need some help . they often help their parent at home and they do a lot of activity . i think that help the community do not you ? going to school is not really helping the community at the begining . but if young people do not do study the community will fall down because we need people who have done a lot of study to manage the other . for my point of view old people think that because they do thing which do not do . like to go to see old people in their house , doing activity for their town like organize the next party . .. that are activity that we do not have any time to do . because between the course , the sport and generally social activity it is difficult to find a moment to do what they do . as a conclusion , like you have seen i am really disagree with this statement . and i do not like when my grandmother said me that !!!!!!!!
