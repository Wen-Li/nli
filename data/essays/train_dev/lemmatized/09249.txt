in my opinion it is better to have broad knowledge of many subject . i believe this , because with a broad knowledge it is easier to work in a team and you are able to fulfill many different task . when working in a team , you have to communicate with your team member and understand what they are talking about . because a team doe not consist of people who are all specialized in the same specific subject , it is necessary to be able to talk to all of them about their problem . but to understand and solve these problem you have to have knowledge of other academic subject . for example a team in a company work on the development of a new product . this team will at least consist of one person who figure out , how to sell the new product best and another one will do the technical part and invent new technics . but if the first one doe not understand what is possible to produce , his idea wo n't be possible to build . the other one doe not understand how the product ha to be build to be sold very good . his new technics may be excellent , but they wo n't be able to sell to the consumer . because of this , the team will not be able to achieve good result , because everyone doe only have knowledge of one specific subject . the second important reason is , that you wo n't work on task in one specific subject all the time . when a task is finished there might not be another one in the same area available so you have to do something different . after finishing a physical research , instead of doing the next research project , you might have to explain the result to other people and help them to implement your result into new product . both situation show , that a broad knowledge of more than one specific subject is very important when it come to team work or changing responsibility .
