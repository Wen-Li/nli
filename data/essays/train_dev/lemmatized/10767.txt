i disagree that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide . there are two reason to support my disagreement . first , the travel in a group is limitted for time . there are many people in group travel and it mean it 's difficult to control . thus group travel need to being scheduled exactly to control easier . if i find the nice place , where i want to stay and enjoy more time , i can not afford to stay there . second , there is no dicision to where we go . tour guide also dicide the place to visit . most of the visitting place are only famous sightseeing place . of course it 's imprtant , i think . however if you want to learn and touch with local culture through travel , you should visit not famous place such a coutryside . when you go to contryside you may meet local people more and it provides the opprtunity to become friend . i think it 's really good souverior than ordinal one thar becouse of these reason , i disagree the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide .
