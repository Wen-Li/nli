if you ask people , who have success in their work , to change the work and do something else or go to another country , they will not be afraid of doing this . because they have success and want to be more successful . so i agree with the statement that successful people try new thing and take risk . people who have success want to be more successful by doing more thing and especially different thing in order to show that they are successful in every branche . they may have a complex or so but they think they have to show everybody that they are successful in their work . some people would change the country to be more successful in their life . for example the person is very successful in europe and now want to be also successful in america . step by step this person will work and do everything to be more successful and to show the word that he / she is a grand person . so that the person can be proid of herself / himself . in some case family will be destroyed because the parent want to be successful . having nothing in the mind only to be successful in life , parent could forget their child . they do not forget their child but they do not see the importance of their child and that they need love and other thing like that . with leaving the family a person risk a very big importance in the life because to have a family is one of the biggest and best thing you ever would get . and why should a successful person do something that he or she already know how to do it ? in my opinion this would not be interesting for a successful person because these people want to be more and more successful in there work and every part in there life . so they have to discover ther thing that are for they unknown to show uo other pe
