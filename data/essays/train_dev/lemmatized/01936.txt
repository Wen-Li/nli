i agree with the statement that one should have broad knowledge of many academic subject than specializing in one specific subject . i believe in being `` jack of all trade and master of some '' . we should aim to increase our competency in the subject that interest u , but should also have broad functional knowledge about the other subject . this will also enhance our capability to integrate various subject and arrive at a solution to a problem . it is because , in the present world scenario , the distinction between various subject is becoming increasingly ambigious . there are lot of topic that are related to more than one academic subject . our real world system are also mirror this ambiguity . fuzzy logic and programming it domain are two concept that address this fact . a person is also expected to be adept at handling more than one kind of issue . we are looking for people who are versatile and who have a variety of skill set . for instance , manager are expected to understand market dynamic , organisational hierarchy , strategy consulting and even do performance appraisal . similarly , in the it industry , we are looking for good programmer with ` domain knowledge ' in more than one field . if a person restricts himself to specialisation in one subject , he will be completely ignorant about the other subject that may have a critical impact on his daily life situation . also , he may be missing out on some interesting fact related to the other subject . a broad functional knowledge of many academic subject also increase our ability to comprehend a problem and arrive at a holistic solution . we will attain a deeper understanding of the working of various system , both natural and man-made . then , our thought process will also tend towards analysing a situation , integrating our knowledge of various subject and enabling u to be more imaginative and innovative . to put in a nutshell , a broad understanding of many academic subject will make u become better solution provider and all - rounder in most walk of life .
