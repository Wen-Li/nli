definitely , i see many reason that allow me to think , not only that in the near future car will be fewer , but also that that scenario is desirable to improve the qualifity of peopl'es life and the wealth of our environment . on the one hand it is plausible to think that the use of the automobils , particularly those that function with gas , will decreased during the near future , due to the evidence of a direct lingk of it usage and a permanent damge in our evironment . in fact the pollution of the latter is drawing the attention of may ecologist and political activist , clearly awared of the terrible consequence if a sustainable development is not undertaken . in adddition , the usage of more car in city seems to be very inconvenient if we acknowledge that urban place are becoming increasingly overcrowded , mainly becouse of the flow of migration , either within country , from population abbondoning their countryside town and heading to the big city , either from people leaving their own country , seeking for new opportunity . cars could hinder the possibility of a rapid movement throughout the city , creating traffic jam , thus , extending the time people need to commute from one place to other . moreoever , since city , particularly in europe , characterized from their high population density and their lack of space and , the cost of parking lot is unaffordable for the majority of the population . therefore even car owner decide to restrict the usage of their vehicle , to weekend or to go out at night , avoiding commuting by automobile on a daily basis . another factor that should be taken for consideration , regarding the inconvenience of car massive use is the cost of gas . in other word , it is a lot cheaper to use the public transportation system than to use a car . finally , the reason to rtestrict the use of the car outnumber the reason to use it . therefore i strongluy believe that their number will decrease /
