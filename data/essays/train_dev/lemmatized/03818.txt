nowadays everybody talk about environment , ecology , nature , ... this refection blame that our society do n't take care about the earth . the question about the car is recurent . and the associeted question is `` how reduce the pollution '' . so we can ask if they are fewer car in twenty year than today . on the one hand , twenty year is a court period today . in fact we are in the technologic developpement period which always rise . but it is not say that ingeniors or researcher find answer at theirs question . automobils ' ingeniors develop today news motor , conception , design , they try to develop new range , in oder to repond to demand . more they try to give an accesse to their car to everybody . despite the governemt try to imply everybody in the ecology battle , the fact is the automobil area is a business and they ca n't reduce it . on the other hand , car are a really pleasure for somebody . the pleasure to drive , to go where they want , to be independant , to do what you want when you want . today we accused the price of oil but everybody always take theirs car and do n't stop to use it . moreover today we can see the development of new oil , biological oil so ecology repected . finally , there is the city , the big city , where everybody is always worried by the traffic in . on theirs city the car ' number will be reducing in the twenty year comming . in conclusion and to my mind , the car ' number will not reduce in the twenty year because all the point i developped , but the reduction will be possible only on city where they will develop othe tranport system . i like to drive , such a take sometime train or fly , but car is the independance , and i think you ca n't take it at anybody .
