in germany the education is based on a fast variaty of subject you can learn . in the so called `` gymnasium '' it is very important to teach the student a many subject and topic a possible . so that every student recieves a broad knowledge and general knowledge . but is it better to have broad knowledge of many academic subject than to specialize on one specific subject ? in my opinion a misture of both is the best solution . on the one hand it is very important for well educated people to have a very good general knowlegde concerning every topic and subject . it help you in everyday life to understand certain thing better and to improve the situation within the society . for example there are news on the the iraque war on tv . to understand the situation you have to have background information on the situation in iraque and the reason for the war . on the other hand it is not always possible to know everything . maybe you have good quality in language and social study but you are not very intrested in science or mathematics . you can share your knowledge in certain topic with other and you can profit from the others . in class for example , my friend is very good in mathematics and i am not . so i can learn from her and she can profit from knowledge in history . i think you should concentrate on one certain topic that you are very familliar with but should not leave other topic out . then your knowledge get to one sitted and you may loose track of other important thing and happening . all in all i think it is good to have a broad knowledge of many academic subject than just to specialize on one but in addition you can specify on one so that you can share your personal knowledge with others .
