i 'm not agree with the statement , at least i 'm not agree if it 's a general statement . i think that a general knowledge it 's important because allow people to be able to do so many work , or to be informed on the topic argoments of aour time . but a broad knowledge at our day is not required from the market . for example : in my future work like an architect , the market ask for people that have a general knoledge of the complicated world of architecture , but at the same ask a specialize knoledge on one subject . this is the reason why the italian university , like the europeans university , changed the ordinary study course from five year to two kind of course , from three and two year . this division allow the student to have a general knowledge in the argoments in the first part of their study and have a specific beachelor in the second part of their carrer . the most important reason to prefer the specific knowledge is that specialize ourself on a specific subject , argoment , course or everything else , can introduce jounger people into the world job and this is positive for a nation that need to increase is product . in our situation , during theese day of changing , this way of thinking is important because i think that the age of general knowledge it 's ended ! we must be specialized in something , first to be early a worker and the specific knoledge can be a strument to find a different work in another nation or country too . theese are the most important reason to prefer a specific knowledg to a general one but i thik also that we see this important changing in the world of work only from some year , because it 's an hard changing not also in the school and in the market , but in the people ay of life !
