considering the following point such a the world 's problem of overpopulation and the positive correlation between the number of car and the potential driver , we can state that there seems to be no sensible reason to believe in the idea that there will be fewer car in use in twenty year than there are today . of course , one may claim the idea that the use of car will diminish in twenty year since everyday we confront with one of the damage given to the atmosphere by the output of the car such a harmful gas . depending upon the hopefully stated point that newly-established ozone friendly transportation technique will replace the widespread car use , one state that people will prefer rthese new brand of technique to car use . however , before accepting this point , we need to consider some of the further issue . first of all , to build new transportation system friendly with the ozone and capable of transporting large mass in a cost-effective way necessitates more money than it is ever estimated . there will ne a whole new system of highway or railway for the new kind of transporter . besides , in order to convince people use these tranporters rather than their own car , the new brand transporter have to be much more comfortable than the car used by people . if such a great invention can not be made to either the transportation system or to the marketing of this system to become widespread , the project seems to fail down and people prefer to use their own car rather than the new system . in order to make this system preferable over the use of car transportation , the benefit of the system such a it being cost-effective and le harmful to the oaone layer than the car usage should be explained publicly .
