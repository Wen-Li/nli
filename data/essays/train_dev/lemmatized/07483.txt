i think this is a general statement , and it is too difficul discussing about this without following in born tinks . however , i disagree with this sentence . fir of all because i know many boy and girl that do not enjoy in their eveerydays life . they seem to need ever something else , they are not able to be happy for what they do . everything becomes a problem : the wedding , the childrens , the job . i recognize the we live in a difficult time , the politic affair and the economic once are not very good , and also there is the war . .. but i ask to myself : what are the difference between the actual and last time ? my father tolk to me about the second world war , and also about the problem the he had had for finding something to eat end than the problem he had had to take a job . my father dead three year ago , but i think he enjoyned his life more than many young people . i want to talk about another point : the wedding . i see that many people now prefer the divorce to the possibility to solve the problem . i do not understood very well this position . for me having a family is a way to get better our life , but probably i wrong because many people i know do not think in the same way . i want to enjoy living alon or goin out untill 5 or 6 a.m. so they refuse the idea to build a family untill they are 35 or 37 year old . probably i am the fir person that doe not enjoy enaught her life . i try every day to put passion and love in what i do , specially from the time i live alone , now i have no fathter and no mother , but i see that if i am correct with other person i am not alone .
