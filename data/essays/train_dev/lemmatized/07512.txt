i disagree this statement . the young and the older people are both enjoy life . first of all , the young people are lively . they have a lot of time and energy to sdudy , which is the most exciting thing in one 's life . the young people will benifit from it . the second , in the spare time , young people have plenty of energy and time to play basketball , to dance , to sing , and also chat on-line . as a younger , i like to make freinds on-line , you can talk with many diffrent kind of people , and it will be make my life more intersting . the young people can enjoy a lively , busy and exciting life . the older people can enjoy their own life too . maybe they do not have enough energy to play crazily like the young people . but they have more time to do some calm and slow exercise , such a taijiquan . if a older person ha a good healthy , he or she may go to swim , it intrersting and make one 's strong . my grandfather is a happy and health older man . he like do sport , and every morning he go to swim with his old freinds . the plenty of exercise he take make him lively a a young man . his life is bueatieaful , andi want to have this kind of life when i am old . so the older people can enjoy his lovely life . that is why i disagree the statnm
