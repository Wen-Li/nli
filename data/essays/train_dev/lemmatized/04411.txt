although it 's important to learn idea and concept in textbook , i disagree the statement that it 's more important for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact because the idea and concept are origined from fact . for example , capitalism , one of the economic idea , had been generated around 19th century in the united kingdom when they made stock market . this idea wa generated from the fact that the stock market wa made . the fact give the idea and concept when people try to understand the phenomenon of fact . moreover , the new fact are not defined a idea and concept immediately since the idea and concept are produced through discussion of fact . it take time for people to generate idea and concept through the long procedure of discussion and comprehension . still we do n't know why the pyramid in egypt were constructed . this is completely mistery of idea and concept . but we can learn the fact that pyramid were constructed through history . we could miss some point if we focus on only idea and concept . needless to say , sometimes the idea comflict with each other because people comprehend the fact individually and generate idea differently . those different idea generate conflict . i assume that the war are induced since the happiness is defined by individual people . for example , people in some country believe in communism , one of the political idea , and the other people believe in democratism . those might start war at some point . of course , i agree it 's very important to refer idea and concept in written texbooks according to fact because this process help student to understand the fact better . however , student should study fact at first since those idea are always origined from the fact .
