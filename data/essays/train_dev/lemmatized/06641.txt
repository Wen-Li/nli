the understanding of idea and concept together with the ability to reproduce them correctly is the best way to learn something new . but the more important part from the learning in general is definetly the understanding , because only if a student understands the idea or concept , he/she will be able to use it successfully . to explain my point , i will try to give an example , where we can see that just learning fact doe n't help in real life . let 's assume that a business student , who always had good result in college , start working in a big company and ha to work on a very difficult case . this task includes a number of problem , which seem familiar to him , but he can not use the result he had learned from university , because they do n't fit in this case and he never really understood the concept . he ha never done it before and ha to solve this problem by himself , because otherwise the senior manager will recognize that he ha n't got a clue about the topic . now , he will recognize that the stuff he had learned without understanding it , doe n't help him at work . which might lead to a lot of problem for him . i think that we can obviously see on that example that learning fact ca n't be more important than understanding the idea . and even if someone can probably pas college or university without realizing this statement , he will do , when he start to work . and do we only learn for good result in school ? i do n't think so , and that is by the way what all the teacher in my school tell me a well . we have to understand what is behind the fact , so that we can use the concept . and for that , i would like to mention that a student have to learn the fact , which is also important . only when these both factor of learning come together , we will be able to learn for life and use what we have learned successfully .
