i agree with the statement that is more important for student to understand idea than learn fact , but with some limitation . i think that for young people is very important to understand concept in a deep way because after the graduate they should use what they have learned . so is good that university force student to study a lot and do conceptual exam . but many of the people that attend university are not young , and for them i think that the lesson have to be more interactive and with fact . infact they need to match what they are studing with what they have learned from their experience . for a young student this is not so important because we do not have work experience . i attend the second year of undergraduate course in bocconi , a university of economy in milan . during the course often happend that the lesson is boring . the lesson usually take about 2 hour each and it 's difficult to keep the concentration during all the time . it will be better if sometimes the lesson contain fact because that help to hold the concentration and sometimes help to understand concept . with this type of lesson student can both learn concept and fact , start to understand how the thing they are studing are related to the work . in my opinion good university should prepare you with lot of concept but also with some real example to apply what you have learned . moreover you can chage your idea during the life but before you have to understand that idea . ideas and concept are better than fact for student but a preparation only with concept will not make you able to join the world of work .
