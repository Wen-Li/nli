knowledge of many academic subject is preferable to the knowlegde of only one specific subject . in fact first of all knowing more than one thing can never arm anybody in the contratry ith help face many life situation and solve effectively problem which solution might not e in only one domaine but requires the joining of experince in many subject . moreover it will be ironical to say that one can only focus on one topic . and ignored that even that two some subject seem at first to have no connection with each other are actually dependent . for instance when one ne study psychology one will need mathematical skill to be effective in it work of psychologist for example to be able to calculate and understand concept such a standard deviation in order to interprete the result of his experiment or survey . taking the example of the humanistic theory people who will be just focus on one subject willbe le likeley to reach the self actualasation wich need one to have the maximun of knoweledge and experiment . morover , work market is very demanding nowaday and being specified in one domaine do not help one in getting in demanding post . in fact enterprise will prefere hired people who have studied a vast range of subject . morover able people to specify in only one subject will lead at the and to a system of monopole where only people who ahve study a particular suject say humanity will be able to speak and defens properly they idea in defavour of others who only focused on science for example and this can be very dangerous a some decision will be taken by only the few of those who know about the matter therfore letting the others who do not have knowledge i on the matter out of it . for a world in which every body should give it opinion and be able to contribute subject specificity will be a more , broad knowledge
