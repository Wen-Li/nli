cars are playing a domintant role in human society . cars benefit people a lot ; they make u travel faster than by bicycle ; they make it convenient for people to travel to a concert . however , car also do harm to our daily life ; one of the most fatal harm car make is the air pollution . there ha been a debate that whether people will give up using car in future year . as far a i am comcerned , car will definitely be supplanted by other form of transportation because of their disadvantage , though ther have oe or two advantage . there 're several reason why the number of car will decrease . although car have minor advantage to society , the numerous bad effect will make them dissapear after several year . a car can produce at least three ton of carbon dioxide , which lead to the serious green-house effect , and several ton of nitrogen dioxide , which result from a black smoke around the sky . with the number of car growing in the past year , the air pollution made by car is increasingly serious these day . the law of forbiding the use of car have even be made in some country such a indoesia and china . as a result , the number of the car will definitely decline after a few year . another reason for the declining of car is the limited road condition . the more car in the road , the slower they move . even in some area , people riding bicycle are much faster than people driving car . in singapore for example , the street are full of automobile . it 's quite difficult for one car to move a foot . if people see that there are a myriad of car standing in the street , then how could they buy car any more in thefuture ? though car do benefit in some minor way , and there should be a period of time to see the declining number of automobile before the entirely disappearing of car , the total number of car will be fewer in the past twenty year .
