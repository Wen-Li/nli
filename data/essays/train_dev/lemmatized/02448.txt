everybody is asking to himself : will the number of car reduce in the next twenty year ? nobody can know and forecast how life in general will be in the next 20 year , but all of u can and must hope that it will happen . the use of car create a lot of problem like pollution , traffic jam , but on the aother side using car allows economy to run . the biggest problem the use of car creates is pollution , pollution that is produced by the smoke , the oil , and the gas that come out from our car . everyday our city are becoming more and more grey and black , dirty and not healthy at all to live in . a direct cause of pollution is traffic jam . traffic is getting more and more terribly because everybody need and use car not only to work but to live in general . why doe this happen ? this happens because there a lot of city nowadays that have n't provided yet to improve with efficient system of transportation like undergroung that cover not only the space under the city , but longer distance . actually the bus system it 's not really developed and it cant be efficiently developed because there are too many car around the city , and anyway everybody prefer to use their own car than going with bus . on the other side we know that car make the economy run , actually to move car need gasoline , and gasoline derivate from petroleum , thus there is a long wire that connects society that live on car . another example are the industry that produce car , if we do not use car anymore there would be an economic crisis and may be a period of grate depression , because not thousand but million of worker would lose their job . probably if we are able in the next future to understand that we are destroying our planet not only polluting but also sucking all the source , and that we will reach a term in which it will not be possible anymore to go on with this situation , the number of car will reduce , a solution will certainly come from technology research : we could use mean of tranportation that do not pollute { like sun , wind , or hydrogen } but at the same time allowing the economy to run .
