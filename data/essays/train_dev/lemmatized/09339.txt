i agree with the statement that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their community . the modern trend of elitism , individualism , and ha robbed today 's youth 's knowledge of the inherent value in community service . in korea , a nation that ha thrived on the basis of human resource , the main source for one 's economic success is one 's ability to perform academically : thus the trend for elitism . the extreme competition in college admission and the strict education system that follows account for the fact that an average student spends at least five hour in an independent learning institution every day . it is no wonder why these student find no time for community service , save a time for personal leisure . as youth have been emersed in this merit-based society , they lost sight of the necessity to help the poor and helpless . after all , if one were supposed to earn one 's way to the top , then doe not poverty and hunger stem from the incompetence and neglect of those who suffer ? individualism , a western thought that is now spreading world-wide , is another factor for the youth ' neglect of community service . during the industrial revolution , community that were bound together by economic niche began dissolving due to the development of specialization . families and neighborhood that used to work together on communal farm were separated a they were employed by mass factory . due to such a separation , the world today is becoming more and more self-centered and individualised . the young people ' neglect of community service is only one manifestation of this phenomenon . in conclusion , the strive for economic success and individual gain have blinded the youth of today . we need to start recognizing that there is a greater calling out there in this world : love .
