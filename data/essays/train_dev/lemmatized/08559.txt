i agree with statement that most product seem much better than they really are . well , commercial about the product are very commoon and really essential for the product to sell in the very compitive market . but over casting the product and giving the credit to product than really worth it could cause the common man to consume the product that are really le productive and worthless . the use of medium to bring the product near to the public and make it more attractive and intresting is the common and basic idea of the advertisement . but , missuse of the overal concept will create the problem both at the consumer level and at the production level . the typical example of this kind is advertising the vaccum cleaner . the typical commercial will say about their prodct is very best and us new technology in keeping the environmet very clean . by watching the advertisment one can go to the store and bring the cleaner home and strart use of it to expect the best out of it . if the prodcut is not really performing what it wa claimed cause the real upset of the product . over casting the product doe not stop at the product we commonly use at home it ha spread in the advertisemant of the drug that we use . the recent `` vioox '' the pain killer that made by merk ha been withdrawn from the market because it is causing the risk to the heat . the vioox wa over advertised for it usage in the pain management in arthritis . but , after the fact wa reveled this drug will cause serious risk to the heart they taken out of the market . to summarise , the advertisemets are good in mean of reaching to the public about the product and it benifits . but , overcasting resulting the loss of the trust about the product , maker and the whole concept of advertising .
