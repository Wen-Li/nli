in my opinion , specializing in one specific subject is definetly a very important advantage in life , but you should have also a broad knowlegde of other academic subject , too . it is necessary to know about other academic subject to use your special knowlegde in an effective way . for example , a manager ha to know about much about politics , computer science and mathematics to use and handle his specific economic knowlegde . if a manager only know about economic , he could n't do a good job . another advantage of broad knowlegde is , to use it easy in your normal life . it help you having a good conversation with your business partner or other person . when you only know about your own specific subject , it is not possible to talk with other people about their problem or the news in tv . on the other hand , concentrating on one special subject can help raising the career . for a scientist , for example , it will be a good choice to concentrate on only one academic subject , because he hardly can use other knowlegde in his job . when the scientist doe n't get deep into his subject , he ca n't do a good job , because his task is , to find new thing and think further than other people did before him . another advantage of specializing is , that you can be the best in your subject if you only concentrate on this one subject in your life . it is not possible to be the best in computer science , when you are focussed on other subject at the same time . as a result , it depends on the person , his attitude and his job , what his best way of education is . for some people the best way is , to have a broad knowledge , and other people should better specialize . in my case , the best choice is to have a broad knowlegde , because i am still not quite sure about what i want to be in my life . after making a decision i can still specialize on one specific subject to be good in my job .
