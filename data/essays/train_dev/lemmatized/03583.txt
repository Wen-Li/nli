in my opinion , history show that people that take risk and try new thing are more successful that those that prefer to rely on their existing knowledge . there are several reason and example that support my point of view . first , in our globalized world , knowledge and technological innovation are rapidly increasing . ten year ago , nobody used the internet . today it is almost impossible to be successful without knowing how to write an email and how to surf in the internet . therefore , it is necessary to be open to new invention and change in society in order to make progress . moreover , invention have normally been made because people started to try new thing and to take risk . a musician that only play the song he already manages quite well is n't very likely to invent a new song or to improve his interpretation . only by trying out alternative interpretation , even though it may sound odd in the first place , new idea may come to the musician 's mind . consequently , his interpretation of the song can be improved . therefore , by taking the risk of leaving behind old pattern of thinking , previously unknown concept can be found out . in addition , people that take the risk of starting a business with a new concept may have more success than those that sell established product . although franchising , for example , give the shopowner more security , the possibilty of making huge surplus is lower . enterly new and creative concept , however , can help you to become really successful . in conclusion , taking risk and trying new thing contributes to make people successful . due to globalization , society change rapidly , so that you are required to broaden your horizon in order to succeed . furthermore , the possibility of making a new discory and to run a successful business are higher . thus , i prefer to do new thing and to take risk .
