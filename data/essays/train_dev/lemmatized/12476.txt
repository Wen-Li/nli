would you eat a hamburguer if the image that is shown of it doesnt show a delicius meal ? i dont think you will , i wont , and it true that i will probably be mad by the time i get the physical evidence of the advertisement image if it doe not look like the picture . i believe that those who work on advertisement must cheer customer to buy , buying is what make marketing move , because of buying is why economy work , it is their job , and it is our right to know how it work , so i dont think it a matter of agreeing or disagreeing about it , we can not believe everything we heard or everything we saw , we must know and be able to make our own statement of the thing that medium brings to u , for example i dont believe on what news are telling me , it is proved that there is always some edition of the true , like when a president of some country creates a virtual reality so he can excused his self to do a lot of barbarian act , like war , killing , polluting , and other horribe thing . i lived at bogota , and the police is making the people to believe that there are terrorist around , so we need the police to feel safe , i wont trade my freedom for security . coming back to the advertisement topic , i thing that is the own goberment who ha the job of not letting people to feel cheated making several law that punish those people that make money selling a false image of the product . we have to be aware of not buying untrusty product . finally i had to say that it people choice so have to be awake and ready to say if it
