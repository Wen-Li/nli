youth is the power of a nation . a nation 's progress rely majorly on the performance and contribution of it youth . a youth , today , ha multiple task to handle . i believe , most of the young people are under the pressure of perfoming the best . this pressure drive them away from their responsibilties . they are more focussed on self advancement . this focus take them very far from their source . therefore , young people do not give enough time to help their community . i am a student and currently pursuing my engineering degree in biotechnology . this course demand greater devotion and dedication towards the study . i have to attend college , do project after college and also participate in various event taking place in my college . all these responsibilties doe not give me enough time a free . thus , i fail to give a helping hand to my community . youth is the time of life where one is brimming with energy and enthusiasm of moving ahead in life . if this energy will not be manifested to work towards one 's goal then , one 's dream would never be fulfilled . helping and serving the community could happen at any time of life . but this golden period of youth will never come back again . a nation 's progress will uplift if it ha youth who are contributing their best in every field . take the example of sania mirza who entered the field of lawn tennis in her teen-age . her devotion and dedication towards her game made her popular in the entire world of lawn tennis . this also lead to the popularity of our country . in other word , she wa like an ambassador of india . sachin tendulkar entered cricket when he wa nearly 18 year old . he made himself and his country proud by his hard work and dedication . so , we see that in order to go ahead in life one ha to harness energy in one 's field of interest . this would eventually require one to give the maximum time to one 's work . but this doe not mean that one should not give time to help community . this can be done when one is settled in life . then the contribution would be much more and it would be more meaningful.i.e. one can help his community financially , in person or in any other way which is possible .
