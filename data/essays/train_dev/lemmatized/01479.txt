i disagree with the statement , `` in twenty year there would be fewer car in use than there are today '' . nowadays , almost all family in the developed country have at least one car . they use it for various reason , such a traveling , commuting , and they use it even if they are going to near place . car ha been the most popular way for transportation . on the other hand , the developing country are still struggling to get their way of living more comfortable . they are trying to develop their technique for industry . it is obvious that those people living in developing country desiring to get their country more developed . and when they managed to developed , what would they want to posse ? if i were the poor living in developing country , i am sure that i would desire to have a nice car , or may be a television . even if i got rich , and bought a television for my family , i would still desiring to have a car . on our earth , there are still many developing country . the number of car we can count know is still a tip of the iceberg . twenty year later , we would have more developed country than now . if this really happens , the noumber of car would increase . how am i to forsee that there will be fewer car in use in twenty year ? however , there may be an development in car industry . that may result in a new type of car , but it is only that . even if car ha developed , i think there would be no change in our expression . we would call our new type of car a usual ; car . there have been many development in thing around u , such a television , mobile phone , and computer . if we think about our early development in those thing , we would be able to imagine that there would be no change in how we call it . for example , computer ha changed alot . first , it wa only an big box that can calculate the number quickly . we had to have a big space to have one . although , look at our modern computer . our technology ha enabled u to have own conputer for each of u . we could not have imagined it when we first saw the big box that can only calculate . now , we can even communicate with people all over the world . even if there are big difference between the first computer and the computer now , we call it in same way . for these reason , i disagree with the opinion .
