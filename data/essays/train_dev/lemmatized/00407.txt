nowadays young people think and do thing only for their selfish satisfaction . in some case people help other people only bacause they are required to or because they can get in income from it . fortunally not everybody is like this , infact there are many people that sacrifice a lot of their free time to help others only because they like to do it . i strongly think that helping it own community is a real significant and remarkeble thing to do , it make you a better person and it certainly make many other people even happier than you are . if i had to be really sincere i wuold say that i 've never been a person that gave time helping my community because i 've always been more occupied on my study , sport and having fun with my friend . but this year i wanted to change something in my life , so in september i decided to get in an organisation that help old people . so know i usually stay with them and simply give them my company or usually i go to the supermarket to buy thing they need . i started only one month ago but i really feel a better a a person and a part of my community because i fell that i 'm giving something that only i can give . overall thanks to my experince i understood that spending time helping it community is the best way to become a better person and also to meet knew people .
