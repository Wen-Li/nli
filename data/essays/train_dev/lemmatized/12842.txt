do i agree or disagree that in twenty year there will be fewer car in use than there are today ? is it widely known that prograss of technology is astonishing immensely ? as far a i am concerned , i believe that in twenty year there will be more car in use than there are now . in addition , i will argue over the case with the following reason . first of all , i think that there will be more and more high-tech car which will be invented in the future . for example , when i wa a child , my father always put a map in the car . every time we visited certain strange place , my mother would check the map , and pointed the correct direction for my father . now , almost every car have a electric map . it will automatically tell u how to arrive the place which we want to arrive . i think that the more high-tech service car have , the more car people will buy . secondly , i find that there will be more and more road which will be build in the future . there are still many place without appropriate road for car . however , i believe that this problem will be solve in a few year . for instance , there are still a lot of place which chinese government doe n't develope . but i believe that chinese government will develope them a soon a possible . the reason are not only they want to decrease the disparity of wealth , but also they want to develpe their tourism . because there will be more and more road will be build well , there will be more and more car which people will want to have . to sum up , i believe that after twenty year there will be more car than nowaday . because there will be many high-tech car will be produced , and there will be more road will be constructed well in the future . in the end , i will conclude my decision by emphasizing that there will be more high-tech car which will dirve u to arrive more strange place in the future .
