although some people , perhaps marketing major , may argue that a product consists both of it physical form and of the good advertisement that present it , even if they are not so correct , i do not agree at all with this view . in my opinion , a product must be judged a good and , of course bought , according to it quality and advertisement should be based on the quality of the product and should not make the product seem better than it really is . the main concern of this marketing habit is that low quality product are actually invading the market and the consumer can not distinguish between a good item and an item which is only well presented . furthermore , in spite of it low quality , a product of the latter kind is often much more expensive . as an example we can take timberland shoe . in my country i see a lot of people buying them only because they have been influenced by the advertisement . moreover , the shoe with that brand cost nearly three time the price of a high quality pair of shoe you can usually find in a shop , the difference between the two is the misleading advertisement . however , i do not mean that timberland shoe are a low quality product , but of course , the sole difference between these and the one that are not presented in the same way , is the price . i could also have brought more meaningful example but the problem would remain the same , we should care more about quality and the quality-price ratio .
