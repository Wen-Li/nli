i agree with the idea that young people do not support their local community nowadays . there are two reason why the young do so . first of all , the mobility of young people is supported by the economic power of their family . long ago , typical japanese life depends on their local community . under these circumstance , young people can easily help their local community because they are familiar with that region and have many friend and neighbor . in these day , young people tend to move for the seek of their ideal universites . they are isolated in the new region because no one know him or her and no one informs them of the content of the activity held by the new community . this is the one of the reason why people keep a certain distance from the community . another reason is that that young people seems to be not interested in the activity of the local community . there are various job and attractive activity in the country and even above the country . while the activity of local community are still the same , new job are apt to enchant the curiosity of the young . for example , in our city , the event of local community is the volunteer activity for local elder people , but our university look also look for student who help the poor child in other country . if the cost and time and other condition is the same , it is obvious which is more attractive for student . in fact , our university hold many attractive program like this throughout a year . as i mentioned so far , young people do not spend their time in helping their community because of their mobility and their low attention . and these tendency will progress more rapidly in our future with the advent more attractive job and other international activity .
