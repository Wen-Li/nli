while there are thing that can suggest this can actually happen , i dont consider the idea of having le car than there are today in twenty year very possible . there are various reason why i consider this to be very hard . the first reason why i consider this not to be easily achieved is the rapid population growth we are going through . population ha been increasing rapidly over the year , even though in many developed nation population rate are either staying the same or reducing , in developing nation such a india , china and many other the history is very different , population grows everyday . even though government are trying to stop this by taking drastic measure , these will take time and by then more and more car will be needed and produced . another reason why i consider this to be something that can hardly happen is due to the fact that developed nation have people with extreme amount of money . even though this people may need one car or two they will purchase a ridiculous amount of car . technology is something that is advancing every day . before car company needed a large amount of people and time to produce one car , now with the help of technology million of car are produced every day , in some procedure human are not even involved . this suggests that car are being made at a more rapid rate and many more car are being sold everyday all around the world . as i mentioned before there are some point which are very important to these discussion . oil is so expensive now that even though many people can afford a car not all of them can afford gas , therefore this could support the idea of le car being made . i sincerely bellieve that having le car in 20 year is very hard but there are point which suggest the opposite , therefore i can only hope and wait to see what actually happens .
