in twenty year from now there would be nothing but car everywhere and i definitly dont think there would be any way to pretend that there will be fewer . people need car and vehicle all the time , they need to go to work , they need to pick they kid from school , they need to buy a second a a birthday gift for their wife , they need to race , they need to brag about new generation of exepensive car , so that mean that nowadays , car are a much important a water and food and a the population of the world is increasing , we going to need more car because there will be more people . but let get real practical about it , why there would never be fewers in 20 twenty year ? the answer is easy , but the consequance is going to be really devastating . lets see , we have a rich family that owns more than two car , and a many kid they are having it is new car coming with it , not because they really need it , but just for the lexure of it , the bragging and boating that come among they social class when they start talking about how many car they have and what kind of car it is . that is just for one . on the second , there is the econimical car generation , that is the main reason would be nothing but more and more car every single year m if not saying every single day . these kind of car are not really expensive , better yet , they are not expensive at all , that is what allows everyone , middle class , upper class , some poor folk to get a car for a cheap amount of money and with all the help that the bank give people to buy anything , we are going to see more car in the upcoming twenty year , and i bet that is willing to reach a number that would even go beyond the human being population over earth because if we just try and analyse it , we are going to find out that every single man ha more than one car and that is actually ruining everything , ruining the city , ruining the environment , ruin the economy of some country and most of all ruining the world and the nature .
