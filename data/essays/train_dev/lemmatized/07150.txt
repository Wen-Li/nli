in the time of humboldt who developed the idea of an ideal educational system that is universal in nature and combine both natural and human science subject , a broad knowledge of many academic subject wa a true value . today , by contrast , we can observe an increasing specialization and academic education becomes more and more focused , almost narrow minded , training people from the start only for a specific subject . while i would agree that given the amount of knowledge available on specifis issue and the scarcity in the labour market , it is important to be very knowledgeable in one particular field . being a true expert is important in order to be able to compete with other people in the same field and to enhance knowledge and promote progress in research on that specialized field . however , specialist should not loose sight of the context in which they carry out their work and should always be aware of the broader social , economic and political implication their result may have . to give an example , one could think of the physicist or engineer that contribute to the development of nuclear energy . they surely need a very high level of expertise and an equally focused education to be able to perform sucessfully in their task . at the same time , they should be the most far-sighted individual , aware of the responsibility the bear given the social , political and environmental risk their work might imply . even the most specialized expert who is concerned with highly complex calculus or abstract reflexion should be educated enough and sufficiently involved in mundane issue to keep in perspective the context in which they carry out they work . therefore , i belief that a specialist education that focus on a specific subject from early on should always be complemented by a fundamental ( not specialized ) education about the need of society , the complexity of political relationship and philosophical and ethical consideration .
