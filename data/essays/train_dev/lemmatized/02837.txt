i agree that having a broad knowledge of many academic subject is better than to specialize in one specific subject . first , having a broad knowledge of many academic subject can provide a more practical approach to choosing the special interest of a person . this is because , if one specializes in one specific subject without having a broad knowledge in other area , one will not be able to discern his/her real area of interest . this is why student in most educational institution learn math , language , science , social study , art and others subject intensely for several year at least . after having a firm understanding of these area , will then the student choose and study their special interest in university . secondly , having a broad knowledge of many subject can help people to become more flexible in their study . for example , one of my friend went to a vocational school that specialized in science . however , her interest changed and she no longer wanted to study science . however , because she had specialized in one specific subject/area , she took double the time and made twice the effort in changing her field of study than i would have . unlike her , i had studied a wide variety of subject and so i could have been more flexible with my study . lastly , having a broad knowledge of many academic subject make it easier to relate to people who have different interest or background . however , people who specialize in one specific subject might face challenge when trying to relate to a more diverse group of people . this will lead them to miss out experiencing many aspect of diversity . looking at the current educational system and reflecting on past experience , it can be concluded that having a wide range of study is more useful and convinient than a focused range of study .
