i would certainly agree with the statement that state `` successful people try new thing and take risk rather than only doing what they already know how to do well '' because people are successful only if they could do something which other people doe not think or try of doing them . successful people are those who dare to try new challanges and take risk to to achieve desired result . one example of this can be explained from my college day , my college ha a three day festival called `` euphoria '' on the third day an actor agreed to come and perform in our college event for some amount of money . but on day before his performance he called the management and said he want more money to perform a our rival college wa willing to pay him large sum of money so our college management told u that they could not afford that much money to bring that actor to perform . as we have printed the invitation card and even distributed them , so we took the risk of using our college lemonaide machine which wa not in good shape , we took great pain by staying in campus at night and repaired that machine and from next day itself we started to sell lemonaide to people visiting our college to see the function a it wa in the summer season the total lemonaide wa sold and we got required money to make the actor perform in our college . by making the actor to perform in our college without financial help of our college management every one in our campus started to respect u and labeled u a successful candidate who saved our college reputation . thus , successful people are those who not only try new thing and take risk but make there every move in order to help and improve the place or condition people live in .
