now a day , the number of car in use is very large and many people believe that the next twenty year wouldnt be any differnet . i share the same opinoin and think that street are going to be overcrowded with car in the next twenty year unless a solution is found . this non-stope increase in the number of car being used is due to many reason . firstly , car company are decreasing the car cost signifcantly and making their prducts more attractive to consumer , which encourages people to buy new car more often and have mutiple car for each family . this would result in an increas in the number of car . secondly , many bank are offering loan to people which help in provideing them with the money needed to buy new car . thus , people who do not have car now adays due to money issue , will have enough money to buy them in the next few years . thirdly , with all the support from the bank and car company , more car are going to be in use a the population increase rapidlly . the young generation would find it very easy to afford to have their own private car and the same would apply for the next coming generation . morover , the goverment also play a very important part in this increase . for instance , if a country 's rule state that driving for 16 year-olds is allowed , then the number of people using car would increase resulting in crowded street . also , if the gverment doesnt inforce sale and registertaion tax on car then driver would be encourged to buy extra car for their family . in adsiton , the cost of car fuel is also significant in restricting the nuber of car used . in my opinion , the number of car in use after twenty year would be greated than that used today and if no aproperiate solution are enforced , then the crowded street would be another big problem everyone should be envolved in .
