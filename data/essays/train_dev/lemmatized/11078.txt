happiness is an interesting issue : do young people enjoy life more than older people do ? well , from my experience , i believe that older people are in a better position to enjoy life nowadays than young people . first , let 's take an example . a lot of people may say `` living on an island in a warm place , far from the stress life of big city , is like heaven. '' and they add `` people who live in such place do not know the chance they have '' . this example illustrates a major point : no one can appreciate his life when he ha never experiment a hard situation . older people , from their experience , have an idea of the difficulty of life and when they decide to do something , they know how to enjoy it . people tend to enjoy more when they know thing are not so easy to get . for instance , a child who us to get expensice gift doe not know how hard her parent have worked to get their social situation . but if he make thing by her own , she would like them even more because she remember the difficulty and time she went through . second , nowadays , life is getting tougher for young people . because of today 's economic and political situation , life beomes much more stressful for young people who have to make create their social situation . unemployment rate is high in a lot of country like france and germany and young people have more difficulty to find job . moreover , because of globallization , company have to face competition from the entire world . this situation lead to cost reduction in the majority of company and a need to make profit . thus , young people have to face pressure coming from everywhere . they are not in a position to take time to enjoy life , because for a lot of them , they have to work , work , and work , and sometime rest . the situation is clearly different for older people . they are retired for some of them and they do not have to face all this pressure . they can spend more time on their passion and extra professional activity . third , the situation for older people is much better than one of those a hundred year ago . older people benefit from social enhancement . health care and health system have improved , and the life span ha increased a lot in rich country . people live longer today . thus , older people have more time for themselves . how about young people ? well , a said before , their new stressful life is not favorable for a healthy life . look at the amount of medication to reduce stress spent every year by young people ! a research ha shown that the best time to have a baby is ... retirement .
