the statment affirms that in twenty year will be fewer car that there are today . agree or do not agree with that statement it is not a matter of mere opinion but a matter of what will be , for the next twenty year , the goal of the government and their population , and why not the private company . on one side , it could be possible to agree with the statement if we think that in the next twenty year all the state with big population will be able to offer other secure and massive mean for transport , for example . in that case , and only in that case , it could be possible to begin thinking in fewer car in twenty year from now . that possibility implies that government will have at least to strong compromise . one would be with it own population , trying to offer them different a effectives mean of tranport for all of them . the second compromise would be with the environment , trying to respect not only the well-known kyoto protocol but , of course , trying to avoid any kind of damage to the environment due to a pollution problem but on the other side , we can also view the coin by the other face . even if the technology can be improved during the next twenty year , it will be very difficult that normal people can reach all the advance . in that case , in the non developed country and maybe in many developing country , the car could keep their own place a the main mean of transport . it is not too difficult to think about the implementation of the change in the case of africa , the poorest continent of the world . even in europe could not be possible to erase or to decrease the number of car in the next twenty year . there are many country with problem in that particular area that have been trying to solve them , such a italy , spain and france . .. and they failed . in latin america , and i think also in north america , a car is a symbol of power and of prestige . in that case i think it could be difficult the change of mind for the next twenty year . to all the thing i pointed out i must add the fact that daily all car company are producing new model of car , fasters and luxurious , but not cheapest , to improve and to renew the old model . tokyo motorshow ... could be a good example of this . to sum up , i think either possibility are open for the discussion and even in my case i am not sure about which one could be the best to agree with that . but in my particular way , if i wa asking to see my future ... i would like to ha a car .
