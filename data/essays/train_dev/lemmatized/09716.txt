it seems to me that specialising on one subject is much more important than knowing many different subject but not being specialize on any of them for many reason . it is clear that having the knowledge of so many different academical subject is really important thing . by this way , people may gain the speciality of looking at a subject from different point of view and expressing their opinion on many different area , however expertising on an academical subject is much more important than knowing lost of thing without being specialised on any of them . in the first place , since the people who have broad knowledge of many academic subject will not be an expert for any of the acadecimcal issue that they know , always there will be someone who are better than them and nobody will require their knowledge about that academical issue . in my opinion , knowledge is to be used and to make it be used , you should know it very well . it is not possible to gain benefit from that knowledge if you just have some broad knowledge about it both economically and personally such a gaining people 's appreciation . in the second place , the main motivation behind learning an academical issue is improving the current level of society . if someone do not have a deep knowledge on an academical issue , he can not put something on account about that issue and can not be a useful for his society . it seems to me that whatever someone do , he should do the best . in this context , if someone is not very good on a subject , people will not evalute them according to the other subject that he know , both the society and themselves will not get a much benefit of their knowledge without being specialized on it .
