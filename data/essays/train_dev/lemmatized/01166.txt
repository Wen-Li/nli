i am agree with this statement . indeed , to be successful , it is important to be creative , try new thing and take risk . i think that it is very important to do a lot of thing that we do n't already know , because if we already do what we hnow , we can not carry on in the life . to illustrate my point of view , i would like to use several example . in the professional work , it is important to try new thing and take risk to be successful and not to do only what we already know . if someone want to create his own entreprise or create a new concept , it is important that he ha quality that other people doe n't have . why not open a new company creating an innovative and concequently a new product . at the beginning , it is sure it will be hard , but if we never try new thing we can not know . i think that so many people are scare about new thing and prefer doing something known . for example , before the ipod or mp3 player , everybody listened music thanks to a walkwan . ererybody wa happy and liked it . but one day , a man decided to create something new , with another concept and it wa a very good idea . we know that today apple is very successful , many young use apple 's product and the creator is very rich . why ? just because he tried something new and he took risk . i think it is the same thing in all the domain . at work , a director prefer a employee who try new thing and take risk than an employee who already do the same thing , something already know how to do well . to my mind , the first one will have more chance to sucess , and a better evolution carreer . to finish , even in the artistic world this statement is confirm . indeed , at the beginning , a singer is not known , but taken risk an trying to sing , he can become successful , even if at the base it is not his job but more a passion , an hobby .
