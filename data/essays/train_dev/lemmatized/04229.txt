i strongly agree that the young people nowdays donot give enough time to their community . young people who are generally considered a the major force , the future of the any nation ironically dont spend much of the time helping the community . they generally donot raise voice against the injustic , against the activity carried by the malicious mind present in our society . firstly the young people of nowdays are gererally to obessesed by self-needs that they donot tend to think of the society . the term too-selfcentered is the best to describe the young generation of the era . the need of money , the self problem like emotional one tends to isolate the young people form the community a a whole for example the software graduate are willing to work for long hour in order to earn more money . the greed for money could be for family or for themselves whatever might be the reason he is deprived of his valuable time . the problem can only be solved by the satisfaction in le money not by abudence of it . the solution to the emotional problem is that young peolpe should involve in the family more for the emotional support the more spare time they have the more the involvement is there form the part of the youngesters . the second most important reason is the law , procedure and policy of the government are a such a the young people tend to think twice before helping and trying to raise the voice in favor of their community . for example if their is problem regarding the demolishing of the house of their community if the young people want to raise their voice they might end up in the jail . this is the result of the flaw of the law and policy of the government . the solution to the problem is the law and policy should be such that young people are not scared against helping their community . the le greed for money accompanied with the work-satisfaction & the law and policy which are not harsh will generally encourage the young peole nowdays to help the community .
