students are the best study material for some researcher at various stage in there student life , they are much more interesting to study when it come for there ability to undertstand something or to do some work given to them , many student go through a particular protocol given by there teacher or there parent at home at the other hand many other student work with there creative brain which make them much more active and intelligent than the earlier student with particular protocol . researchers have concluded that people with protocol have le creative brain than that of the others . i agree to the staement given that student understand idea and concept more than it is from the learning factor because student interact more with their friend rather than their teacher and it is easier for them when something is put into their mind at the level of friend , for example a kid need to be punished to learn that he or she have to be quite in the class room when a teacher is teaching something , but at the same time he learns to share his toy with his friend when they both have a different kind of toy . students logical brain work more faster when compared to that of an other student with protocol because one of the student is bound to certain rule to do that thing in a particular way where a the other student need not go in a bounded way , he can opt any way to attain the goal , learning fact have become so boring and routine that student try to avoid such fact which is a great loss for the future of the student . another good example of self learning is when a student sit in front of computer he or she themselves start exploring that topic or that particular computer button . finally i would say that student need to concentrate more on idea and concept they face in there real life and learn lot much of it , present situation is that student who have more creative brain come upin life much faster than the student with a particular protocol . in future school authoruity need toplan how they mix up learning fact with that of idea and concept tomake student much more creative .
