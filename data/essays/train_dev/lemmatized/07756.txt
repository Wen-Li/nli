i agree with the statement `` successful people try new thing and take risk rather than only doing what they already know how to do well . '' in other word , successful people are never give up when they have bad situation and big problmes . they are try to sovle the problmes . also they ha lot of passion and encoourage . they are try to acheive thier goal and dream . they are always looking for new thing and they are never take a rest . they are always running for their goal . successful people are different from the another people . maybe , thier envriomnet is not good from another people and situtaion is not good . they have to spend time to achieve their goal . they have to read and read the book and have lot of knowledge . they can learn from another people 's experience . another people 's experience make them to try new thing beside the risk . also another people 's experience give new oppunity try new thing . it is not easy to try to new thing becuase they have to adopt the situtation and have to conquer the problem . therefore , successful people never give up the dangerous situation and spend time to acheive the thier dream and goal .
