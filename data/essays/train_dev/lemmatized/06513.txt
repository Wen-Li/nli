i agree that young people enjoy life more than older people do . actually , both of them enjoy their life . but , there is difference between young people and older people . older people doe n't have much energy like young people . they 've worked hardly for long time , and it 's possible that they already saw many good thing , and had experience before . therefore , they 'll not be interested in doing or enjoying many thing . some old people really enjoy their life , but i think youung people can enjoy more than older people . for example , many old couple ha traveling to some other country because their son or daughter bought the ticket or tour plan for them . after the son got grew up , and when they can make money , and they can make some nice plan for parent . because parent worked hardly for family . however , parent really ca n't enjoy the tour . the travel ha busy schedule , and they need to walk a lot . so , it can be a little bit tough for old people if somebody is not healthy enought to do . i saw many time when i had traveling . whenever we walked to new place , they sometimes said they did n't want to go because they 're are already exhausted from another place . maybe , they can enjoy different thing with different style . however , i do n't think they can enjoy like young people . i thought about that before , and actually , i hope i can travel to many other country when i 'm younger . even though i do n't have enough money , but i think it 's good idea to try it . i have different view with older people . and , i can see many new thing , and can learn . there are some place that older people doe n't go or are not allowed for entrance . i want to have much more experience before getting older . of course , i can enjoy my life when i 'm older , too . however , in my opinion is young people ha more variety of chance to enjoy different thing , and more activity because they have more energy to try everything . after the time pass , it wo n't come back again . so , i really think young people enjoy life more than older people do .
