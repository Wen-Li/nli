in my university student can specialize or not in one specific subject and i agree with this freedom which we have . personally i think is better to have a broad knowledge of many academic subject . we are living in the era of computer in which every day we can resolve many problem whith a `` click '' on our desktop and in which we can find many specifical information in the world wide web . therfore the knowledge is more next to the people than in the last historical period . if a person specializes in one specific subject , he will to know only the argument of this specific subject . therfore this person ha a limited knowledge respect all argument which occur in the our arena of life . thus i agree with the statement and against a specialize knowledge . there are also an other reason because i agree a wide knowledge and it is that a person with broad knowledge can find work more easy than a person with a specific knowledge beacause he have much possilibities having more field of knowledge . in may opinion is right which people do that they wont but is better for all to have a broad knowledge .
