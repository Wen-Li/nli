some people are saying that young people nowadys do not give enough time to helping their community ; however , i disagree . by careful observation , i believe that young people nowadys do give enough time to help their community . there are several way to help the community such a by volunteering , caring for people , participating in community activity . many young people today make contribution to their community by participating in volunteering job . a recent news report in taiwan ha shown that more and more student today are willing to volunteer at place including library and hospital , during their summer vacation . this may seem common in america , however , it 's a revolutionary trend in taiwan . ten or twenty year ago , student in taiwan were regulated by their parent to only focus their attention on their study . young people during that time were educated to only care about themselves , about their study and were not allowed to do `` un-paid '' work such a volunteering job . however , during recent year , young people are more willing to sacrafice their time to do volunteering work which show that young people today spend more time on helping their coummunities . in addition , young people today care more about people , even animal in their community . there wa a horrible news about a man who abuse cat in his home recently in taiwan . the man force his cat to drink detergent and made them make bubble . and then , his took picture of this abusement and post them on the internet . the young people in taiwan were irritated by his action and by cooperation , track down the man 's internet ip address and located where he live . consequently , the man wa punishment by the police of his action , due to the help from these young people who care about animal . furthermore , many young people particpate in their community activity . for example , i have a friend that join the dance club that is held by his coummunity . he wa able to meet lot of people with similar interest for that particular club . and if member from that club ha problem , he would try to help them at no cost . finally , young people today do give time in helping their community . and this trend can be easily found by careful observation .
