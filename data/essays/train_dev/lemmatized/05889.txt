most product , regardless of their brand name , depend on advertisement a a main mean of promotion . the question is : are these product a good a they seem ? some of those product have been in market , and people have been consuming them for long now . these product have been able to maintain their quality and thus their name ha survived until these day . we still even repeat their brand name , which prof that quality ha outdid any role of advertisement on the other hand , some new product have emerged , and manufacturer have tried their best to draw a resemblance between different product . nowadays , if you are watching a commercial on tv , you can hardly notice the difference between product . they look the same , the way the product is introduced would also sound familiar to you . for example , in their commercial , they depend on showing the best of this product by getting it featured by a good looking model ! once the audience view the commercial , he / she would temptingly go and try out the product . but the problem that we are facing nowadays is that some product are not a good a they seem . tv , newspaper , computer , and other mean have facilitated some way to make all of these product look just perfect ! so people would go , buy or try some of these product , and later get disappointed by the result or the outcome . in my own opinion , i think that there should be certain committee to be held responsible for the quality of any product , especially when it come to advertisement . they should make sure that the quality of product would look a real a it seems ! technology ha a major role in making these product look better , but definitely it should not determine our judgment , insult our intelligence , or deceive our eye !
