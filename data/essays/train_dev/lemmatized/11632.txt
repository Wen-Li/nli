there are several advantage and disadvantage on this topic . some people think that you can only have success when you take risk , on the other hand there are a lot of people who do n't think like they do . one of the advantage can be that you gain experience of trying something new . you can not talk about it when you never made the experience . for example the last time i went to a restaurant and ordered lobster . i have never had lobster before , and i wa afraid that the lobster would not be good . but it wa not just good , it wa great ! furthermore , there are also disadvantage of being risky all the time . when you try out new thing it can also happen that you get dissapointed . for example when you buy a movie on dvd that you have never seen . after watching it you maybe regret your decision in buying this movie . but there are also advantage of doing `` already known '' thing . no surprise , no catch , no string . la quinta for example , a well known hotel in the southern states of america , make commercial advertisement with this statement . so you know what the hotel is going to do to make your stay there a much comfortable a they can . on the other hand there is also the disadvantage that you can not develop yourself by trying out new thing . though , you always stay on the same level . from this , i think there is not only one way to go . sometimes you have to be spontaneous and try new thing out , but it 's not always necessary . in my opinion , the best thing is to find a mixture between these two statement . i think that the `` middle way '' is always the best , do n't go for extreme .
