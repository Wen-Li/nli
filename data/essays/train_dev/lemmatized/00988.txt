i think it depends on people because there are many kind of young people , but i think many young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their community . i agree this point . i would like to explain why i thought nowadays many young people do not give enough time to helping their community . i have two reason for that . young people are very busy nowadays . they do not have freetime , so they have no time to helping their community . first , they have to study hard for getting good mark on the test or pas the entrance exam . for example , they go to private school after their school for studying . of course , they will be smart and they can get good mark , but they do not have free time . second , recently many young people have part time job . after school , they go to work , part time job , for making money . then they do not have free time , so they can not have time for helping their community . nowadays young people stay home . there are many thing which can do inside . for example , computer and game . first , computer can give many thing to them . computers give many information , so young people do not get feeling bore at computer . second , there are many game in the world . young people can play game by them self and it is fan . they can get fun from many thing , so they stay home . in conclusion , nowaday many young people do not give enough time to halping their community because they are too busy to work on studying or part time job . then there are many thing which can do inside , so they stay at home . i think this sistuation is not good because people should help thier community each other . i home young people realize it .
