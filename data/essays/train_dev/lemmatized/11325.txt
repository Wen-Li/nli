success people can be defined a people who have much knowledge and have good propectives of behavior . to be successful people , i believe that peole have to try new thing and take risk rather than only doing what they already know how to do well . in that way , people can have more experience a they try new thing and also people can try their best all the timeas a they take risk . successful people challenge new thing to get own experience . if a person challenge new field , he or she will experience a new thing . thus , he or she will have more knowledge about the field . i , for example , am trying toefl test for the firt time and it is sure challenging me and pressing me . however , since i experience the test for now , i guess i could do better for the next time . it is becasue i challenge the new thing , toefl thest , and have more knowledge than before . as taking risk , people can have good prospectives of behavior while they are trying their best . when people are taking risk , they have to be careful a possible a they can and also try their best to acheive their goal or not to fail . even though people fail , they will try their best not to make the same mistake like before . for instance , if a student get wrong on the test . on the next test , the student will learn something from what he or she got wrong and will correct later . as people challenge new field and take risk , they can have much knowledge and good personality , which mean they can success for the rest of their life . if people only do what they already know how to do well , then it will make them not learn anymore , and cause them to think they are the best . therefore , i stronly recommend people to try new thing and take risk to live better quality of life .
