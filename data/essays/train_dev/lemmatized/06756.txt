in my opinion , this is a very strong statement and i can not totally agree with it in the way in which it is currently phrased . as a first general point , i think that similar statement can never hold absolutely true or false , so before discussing the merit of my opinion , i would like to narrow down the reach of the statement by specifying a particular geographical or cultural setting that we are referring to when talking about young people and their community . i will therefore take my home country a a reference . communities face constant change a society a a whole change , and most of these change result into challenge and demand imposed over individual of all age . in particular , the beginning of the 21st century ha seen a macroconomy revolution in term of the labour market - in particular highly specialised and trained labour - and information technology resource . extensive outsourcing of certain service to asian country and moving big part of the manufacturing industry to the far east caused many young people to be unemployed in europe , and in my home country too , a a result . where once community used to be wealthy and secure employment could guarantee social welfare and enough free time for everyone to spend with their family or in social activity , now the younger generation face difficulty in earning enough to mantain thei usual standard of living . i agree that they spend le time helping out their community , and therefore , it is understandable that they will have to dedicate a lot of time to job hunting or even engage into a second and a third occupation , and will have no time or energy to spend on helping the community they live in . well organised activity such a participation into charity work , or more spontaneous and ` private ' one such a caring for an elderly member of the family or a disabled neighbour will eventually have to be put aside by those young who face economic difficulty , and will only be pursued by the luckiest individual who do not have to worry about earning enough to feed themselves and their child .
