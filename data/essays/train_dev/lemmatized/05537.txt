first , we have to analize what is a successful person . in a general way , it is somebody who realize something which make him richer in a psychic or material way . do we need to act in a creative and brave manner to be successful ? is it necessary to show all those vertues to be successful ? is it the only condition to be successful ? in one hand , successsful people need to be recognized to be considered a successful . so , it mean that recognition is mandatory to be successful . in the other hand , somebody may have a lot of vertues and those two mentioned before and however being unrecognized . it is possible for people to try new and dangerous thing like basejump , but without being outstanding and recognized , this person is not yet successful , only in a private manner like in his family which i would not call successful . the second issue to look after is if it is possible to get successful without any of those vertues . first , a successful person can show only one of those vertue and be successful . somebody creating new show but based on the same rule a another great and successful show can make him successful without taking any risk . and somebody can risk his life all the time doing the same thing , a a circus member , and then becoming famous and successful . finally without any of those vertues , somebody can heird everything from another and get indirectly successful . we have seen that success is not related to the vertues enounced in the statement . then , i would say that anybody can be successful , however it is not linked to any will of the person but it is due to other factor dependant on environment . in spite of the possible random of the success , the person must act in a certain manner to attract the success knowing that could be in vain .
