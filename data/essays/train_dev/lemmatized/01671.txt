taking risk is an important part of life . it involves trying new method , living in new environment , and learning new experience . in my opinion , i certainely believe that to be successful , you always have to challenge yourself with new thing to promote your ability . when you are routinely doing an activity , you become an expert at it after some time , and you gain no further knowledge about it . take for example , a teacher who ha been teaching the same seventh grade math curriculum for ten year . at the start of his work he will be enthusiastic , thriving on new way to teach , and trying to do his best in class to convey the concept . in a couple of year time , he might develop new and innovative way to pas the concept to his student , but after he reach that , he will have no further motive to enhance because he will have reached a peak . his teaching method might even decline . consider this same teacher moving to a new school , that teach math in different way , or even teaching other level other than seventh grader . his new experience will broaden his knowledge and prospective about the subject , and will make him a more experienced teacher . although moving to the new school requires him to take a risk , because he wa already known to be good at his old school in the particular grade he taught , moving opened a new and challenging field for him . it allowed him to learn new approach , deal with different age group , and add to his overall teaching experience . he can be a more successful teacher because he dealt with different area of his work instead of doing the same thing over and over again . to be a successful person , you should never let the fear of losing stand in your way . always take risk , and seek new opportunity to help you grow and develop in your work environment or community .
