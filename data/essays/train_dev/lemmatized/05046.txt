the use of car ha increased rapidly over the last few year . almost everybody us his car daily for example to go to work . the question whether in twenty year le car will be used than nowadays is fairly hard to answer . on the one hand i think this statement will become true for several reason . first of all gas price are rising constantly for the last few year and this trend seems to continue . therefore many people will not be able to keep their car or at least reduce the distance they dirve to a minimum . instead they will try to find alternative such a taking the train or the bus . furthermore the reached level of pollution caused by car is already very high nowadays . the government will probably try to find solution for this problem , which could be either higher tax or to forbid driving to some kind of car or even completely on some day in the year . if the first thing happens , having a car will again be more expensive and like this a lot of people will not be able to keep their car . on the other hand there are also reason that support the idea that in the future the number of car will not decline . allthough there will be more alternative in the future to travel comfortably , made possible by for example new invention like the transrapid , these invention are still to expensive for most of the people . therefore it will still be cheaper to go by car . the effect of the ricing price in the energy sector on public transport medium ha to be considered a well . prices for using a bus or a train might become higher and the car could eventually still be the cheapest way to travel . apart from that many people reject going by train or bus because they want to maintain their independancy . if you go by car you have no fixed time for leaving . you can just stay a long a you wish and do not have to care about the time moreover there are not direct connection available for all place to go . you might have to spend some extra time to reach your goal through changing the train or having to take route for which you need more time . taking all this into consideration i think that there will not be fewer car in the future , because most people prefer going by car instead of using other transportation medium .
