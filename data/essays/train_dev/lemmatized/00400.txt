for considering people 's opinion about usage of car in the future , we have a variety of point of view to analyze . although some people think that there will be much car in use than now in the future , i am certain that there will be fewer car in use than present time in the future . there are several compelling reason for my position . first , the situation of pollution is getting worse than use to be . in fact , human activity keep in harmming this planet day after day . however , there is a good news that people around the world start to care about this serious issue , and start to try to reduse the damage from people daily activity . for example , in the city i live in , start to pursause the resident to decrease the frequency of using their car because the way can help to improve the quality of the air in this city . thus , this example show that there is a movement that people have started to note that car brings a lot of damage to our environment . second , in the most modern country , the public transportation become more popular than before . in order to solve the growth of population and the number of citizen , many country build up their public transportation system . take taipei , for example . recently , the gover of this city ha a topic that is `` in taipei , without my car . '' this activity want to encourage people stop driving their car into town because there is no need . public transprotation system become more convenient that before . in addition , using this system also help people save a lot of time on finding parking space in town . thus , i think there will be fewer car in use in the future by this trane . some people may think that driving thier car is more convenient than taking other transportation . however , we are mebers of this world , and we all have duty to protect our living environment by reducing pollution we made . finally , for those reason i have present above , i think there will be fewer car in use in the future .
