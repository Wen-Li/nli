the statement that it is more important for student to understand the idea and concept than it is for them to learn the fact ha to be viewed carefully and from both contrasting side . on the one hand it is of course crucial for student to learn the fact of the class you 're taking part of . this is especially important in class that contain a lot of information and fact like history or medicine . most class also end with a test or an exam and in order to pas this one succesfully you definetely need to learn the fact by heart . on the other hand it is so much easier to learn the fact if you really understood their idea and concept first . in this way you are not stupidly learning the fact to reproduce them later in your exam , but you are able to explain their meaning and purpose . this make it much easier to keep them in mind especially if you really think about the concept and discus them with others . in addition to that you should be aware of the point that you are not only learning for school or university but also for your whole life . especially on university you are able to get to know a variety of thing that wo n't only help you to achieve high grade in your exam but also prepare you for your later professional life and expand your general knowledge . you definetely wo n't learn that fast and easy anymore if you grow older and you 'll never get the possibilty to get to know so many different fact for free and with so much pleasure than you can get during your study . as i already said , to my mind it is not possible to simply decide for one of the opportunity . by expressing this i mean that it is helpful to find a way in between them , a combination of both , which mean to first understand the fact and concept and then later on learn them a a preparation for your exam . that 's the way i do it at my university study and until now this ha been a very succesful concept !
