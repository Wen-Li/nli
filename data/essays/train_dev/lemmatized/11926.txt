i agree to the statement but i do n't think that this idea it 's good . the successful people do n't try new thing and do n't take risk because they do n't want to do a wrong impression to the other people . in fact the successful of a person in many time is due to the other people idea and to the other people impression , and a person that just have the success do n't want to destroy it . in accord to that a successful person do n't take a choice that is not sure , and do n't make an action that can to pooring his position . that is not bad in all . in fact in modern time is very difficult to have successful and is not easy to take a decision that can change all that you do in your life . but on the other way if you do n't take a risk you can not to growth your success , that because when you try a new thing you take same risk but on the other hand if the new thing it 's good your success can became bigger than before . at the start of a life a person have n't success yet , only during the life your action make your success . the successful people in the past ha take risk that to have success . in general i think that only taking a risk you can do something in your life , and if you try new thing you can find a new matter that you can do very well , and this give at your success a power to large it . it 's true that try new thing is not simple but i think that a person can to search the best everytime and everywhere to enlarge his successful . we do n't have many good thing if same brave people do n't try to do that and do n't take the risk for their action .
