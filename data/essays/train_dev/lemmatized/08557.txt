all people enjoy life , and they show this by participating in many of life 's amazing activity . people enjoy life in many form . yet , people do not lose this thirst for life a they grow older . the thing people enjoy might change with time , but this doe not mean that they derive le enjoyment from them . improvements in healthcare have made old people 's life easier and they have also increased their mobility , allowing them to pursue many activity during their retirement . people enjoy life regardless of age , and this dismisses the statement that `` young people enjoy life more than old people '' . of course there are difference between the young and the old . the young are typically more active and le patient . yet , this doe not imply that they enjoy life more . this merely implies that young people have a different set of preference , and different idea a to what constitutes a fun . consequently , they enjoy different activity . many young boy enjoy playing football with their friend . playing football can be quite demanding physically . rarely , do we see senior citizen playing football . instead , we might see them strolling in a park , or watching their favorite tv show . these activity are le demanding physically , but old people do not enjoy them le . as medicine and technology have improved , life expectancy ha increased . today people live much longer than they used to . people spend many year in their retirement , and many find these year to be the most enjoying year of their life . people , who are in their retirement , have the time to do what they please . they do not have meeting and scheduals to meet , and this allows them to live life at a slower pace . this also allows them to go on long trip and holiday , and see the place they wished to see during their youth . also due to improvement in heathcare , old people are not are immobile a they once were . this allows many old people to continue to fuction normally , and even play sport like golf . the statement that `` young people enjoy life more than older people '' is false , because of the many point that speak against it . old people enjoy life no le than young people . true they enjoy different thing , but this is due to the fact that they have different preference and need .
