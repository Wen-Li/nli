cars are indispensible thing to live in this modern life . when i wa young our family did n't have a car and it wa n't strange thing at all . in contrast , now our family owns two car and also it is more difficult to find someone who doe n't have a car in these day . we need car in order to live in this morden life for many reason . however , i do believe that in twenty year there will be fewer car than now . cars are important to live , right ? however , let u think what is more important thing to live . can you guess what i am talking ? yes , i am talking about the enviormental issue . again , car are essential to live , but the earth , air , nature are much more important in order to maintain your life . the conservation nature activity are really popular these day . we have been killing our very home by overusing car . then , people started to realize how they have been doing something wrong . i am korean , from seoul , one of the biggest city in the world . in seoul , there are thousand and thousand of car . if you see the sky in distance , we can see how dark it is . we know it is comfortable to use own car . however , we also come to realize that it is the time to protect our nature . so , we have started a compain not to use a car even a day a week . i guess , some people might contend that the life is getting busier and busier , there are some work to be done asap . no time to wait the bus to come . we need a car ! however , there is another reason why i believe that le car might be used in the future . here , the advent of the internet . now you do n't really go in person to talk and to do soem meeting , you can use the internet and do video conferance . futher , i am sure there will be better way to work with a person in distant later . like alternative transportation which doe n't cause the air pollution . in sum , if all the relevant factor are taken into account , we should n't overuse a car . i do hope many people think our nature first than their own comfort . that 's why i think there will be fewer car than now in twenty year .
