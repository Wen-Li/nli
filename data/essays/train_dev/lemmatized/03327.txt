i agree with the statement that advertisement often make the product appear better than it really is -- but i would claim that this is hardly surprising if one considers the function of advertisement . basically , advertisement serf two purpose : to inform the consumer of the product 's existence , and to motivate him or her to purchase the product . the advertiser 's intention is to sell the product , not to provide comprehensive detail about pro and con . thus , advertisement will aways focus on the positve aspect of a product and omit any negative one . truth-in-advertising law and consumer protection organization will prevent fraudulent claim and gross misrepresentation of the true product , but advertisement usually still take a few liberty . a famous example is a scene from the movie `` falling down '' in which the main character is enraged by the fact that a fast food restaurant depicts a hamburger a large and succulent , while the product he get is flattened , mushy and disgusting . of course , the film exaggerates , but seldom doe one find processed food to look a appealing in reality a it doe in advert or on box . usually , small notice such a `` serving suggestion '' exempt the manufacturer from liability . another mean by which product are made to look better in advertisement is the modification of context . for example , many car advert show the car driving at high speed through a desert or such , with the driver being completely relaxed and casual . while this make the car look more appealing , reality with it speed limit and heavy traffic make it unlike that one will actually max out the vehicle in such a manner . this all might seem like a consumer watchdog 's nightmare , but one must always bear in mind the function of advertisement , a i have already mentioned . it just is , by definition , a one-sided view with a certain purpose -- selling . to assume it to be something else -- a valid , unbiased source of information -- would be fallacy . it remains the consumer ' responsibility to compare and evaluate , based on independent review and the like , when choosing a product .
