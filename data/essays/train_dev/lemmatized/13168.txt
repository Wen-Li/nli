are the successful people brave to take a risk or they are the people who keep doing what they already know without taking any risk . in my opinion , risk are needed for success and the risk mean to creat or try new think or thinking in a different way from other people . firstly , if you do not take risk and keep doing thing which you already know you are an average person and it is not that much significant , but a person who try new thing can be easly realized . for example , runing a business in a tradiniol way is normal and everybody doe that but a person who make a big changing about the admistration of the bussiness can be take a great risk however there is an opportinity to become successful . secondly , people should work more harder to try new thing so working hard can open a way to become successful a well . finally if you take risk you have to challenge to other people becouse you already take risk and if you dont want to loose you should try harder to get success and this force also help to you to become a successful person . at sum ,
