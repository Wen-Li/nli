i do agrre with the fact that successful people are those who try new thing and take risk rather that those who only do what they already know how to do well . first of all , the ability to try new thing is a quality that allows you to learn new thing all the time . by doing this , a person will certainly know many diverse thing and develop open-mindness . compared to people who only use what they know and do well , a curious person will master many different thing and be able to be really successful . for instance , steve jobbs , apple 's ceo , mastered computer since he wa very young . however , by trying new thing , in his case selling his product he became one of the most successful man in today 's world . i thus , strongly believe that this open-mindness wa , appart of his genious , what made him successful . secondly , i think that taking risk is something harder than just trying new thing . taking a risk ha , by definition , good side and bad side . the bad side are that you can take a risk beeing a enthousiastic a you want , you can fail . nevertheless , i think that risk-taking is a key to the success . indeed , taking a risk is the equivalent of betting on the future and i believe that someone who can not take this risk and think about the future wo n't be successful . of course , all of this is general speaking and each person have a different vision of what success is . however , at last but not least , i believe that knowing how to use what we already know and learn ing new thing will make someone successful .
