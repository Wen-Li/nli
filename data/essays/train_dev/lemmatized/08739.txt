i totally agree with this statement . people who are successful are people who do not hesitate to take risk in order to achieve their goal . it doe not mean that they are affraid of nothing . but they estimate the risk and then decide to take it or not . there are some good example that we can give to explain that point of view : in business , we know that people who measure risk and take some will be successful businessmen . the director of the virgin company richard brandson is someone who did took risk to succeed in creating such a huge and modern company . after selling cd , dvd , travelling ticket , mobile phone , and soda , he is now selling ticket for a trip in a spaceship . this guy also tried already 3 time to travel around the globe in his virgin balloon . in sport , we all know that people who take big risk will be the best : in formula one for example , the driver are risking their life to win a tournament . in football , a player like zidane is successful because he doe not hesitate to take risk in front of other really good player . and it is the same in all sport . and when we think about art , we can say that the major artist of our century are the one who took risk to do new thing . picasso for example knew really well how to paint realistics picture but he decided after a certain period of time to change for a new way of painting . and moliere wa hated by the public of his own time because he created a new kind of theatre . he took also a big risk . in conclusion we can say that not taking risk doe not help being successful . what is important is too measure the risk we take and assume the result it will give .
