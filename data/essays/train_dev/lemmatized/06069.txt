yes , i agree with the statement that successful people try new thing and take rather than doing what they already know how to do well . life is rapidly moving , every thing is changing , life tomorrow will definitely be different from today , the wheel of technology is accelerating , communication have overtaken the star , industrialization ha progressed and every aspect of life is developing faster than anyone thought to be . accordingly , our world need a person who can or even who must meet the demand imposed by it and keep up with the frequent change taking place . a peson ha to try new thing and experience , they can not sit aimlessly and say what i have acquired is enough for me . suppose a physician that completed his studty in 1980s . imagine he ha not kept up with the development of medicine and medication since then . i believe that his patient will not recover a quickly a if they were cured by a doctor who always run after new invention and discovery . imagine also an engineer who confines himself in what he had received at school or university . how should he design a new design that reflects today . i doubt he will be able to do so . how can an athlete be successful unless he or she take risk . how can we find people like schumacher , mohammad ali , michael jorddan and so on whose contribution in life are great and without their risk taking life would be tasteless . life must go on and go forward , the wheel of progress must run all the time , we need more and more people who open the door wider into new experience and new adventure , hence new life that is completely different from those whose life is always full of monotony .
