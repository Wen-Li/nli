`` it is more important for student to understand the idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact '' . i disagree about this statement . when i wa child really i could agree above the statement . but now everything changed . in our time student want to learn reality . students especially nowadays can learn a lot different subject from different source . these source can be internet or television . and also foreign country television can be watched fron student and they can see different point of view . also some country they can learn real history of their country and war reason . after that at class students can ask teacher some question about fact . before this wa not , when teacher whatever say student can take this idea or concept . for example before i learnt from my teacher about first world war , according to his statement ; we lost the war because our alliens lost . but now i learnt the fact from different source especially foreign source everything is different . all my idea and concept confused . globalization started in the world . after globalization lecture , teacher or speaker any meeting or any speaking place must pay attention every sentence . students now can questioned every word and every idea . therefore , giving lecture all the time should developed their knowledge . students can make for searching because of much spare time . teachers can not much time for searching time because marriage and having child can stop them . consequently , all the time lecturer shoul leran fact all the subject especially about history because now every human-being can reach every knowledge or every country all over the world . they can also meet a lot different country people and they can learn from them , from television , from internet every reality and fact . because the world is globalizationing .
