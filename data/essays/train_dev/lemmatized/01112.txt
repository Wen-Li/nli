there are a lot of people who think that young people enjoy life more than older people do . in my opinoin , i totally agree with this statement because the young have a more healthier body , also the world is new to them . we can not deny that the young have more healthier body which make they can enjoy their life much better . nowadays there are many activity and sport for people to relax themselves such a the hiking , swimming . but these activity and sport have something in common , a good body . for example , the hiking request people being strong and full of energy . even some young are not dare to try the hiking , so how could the older people ? moreover , now many travel is not permitted to the people who have the heart disease . as we know , it is a common disease among the older . for example , once my family decided to go to tibetan to have a journey , unforturenatly my grand-father wa not allowed to go there because of his heart disease . many young people are curious to the new field than older people . because the whole world seems to be new to him . there are a lot of food or scenery they have never experienced before . but a to the older people , they are always stubborn and they do not listen to others ' advice . when i asked my father to go to seaside , he always responced me that he wa not willing to go . because in his mind , the sea is no different although it is in the different area and going to seaside would not appear him any more . but the young people never have this feeling . all in all , from the reason and example given above , we can easily draw the conclusion the young people enjoy life than older people do .
