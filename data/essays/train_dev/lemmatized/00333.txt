in my opinion , there could be great success for people who have inclination to do different from others . although some might say the such people tend to have failure because of the high risk , i think that most of them have success in term of their personal acheivement . i prefere the idea that people should try to do best within their ability and resource . and , even if they fail , i think they have had their own success . this success mean that breaking the own limitation could be happiness for people . for example , there wa a man , who quitted a big company and start a small coffee shop . even though he wa so enthusiastic to make the shop profitable , he eventually went bankrupt . i saw , however , in some magazine which covered his faliure story , the man said he felt so happy because i could know my limitation . i think that knowing own limit could be success since it could be helpful for people to have good life in their future . and , it could be too much easy to do what others can do easily . in this circumstance , even though people can have some profit , i can not say it is success . for instance , after henry ford introduce a commercialized car for ordinary people , many car maker tried to follow to jump in the car industry . neverthless , they were just follower . they did just what ford did . while some car maker still making great profit , in my opinion , they are not truly succeful . they imitate what the great man did . of course , the follower can have great success . they can reduce cost and attract consumer a lot . they might be some kind of successful people . i think , however , the truely succesful people are the people who did new thing and take high risk .
