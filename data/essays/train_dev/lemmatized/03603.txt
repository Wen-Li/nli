i think that the number of car in this time will be fewer than that in tenty year later . i think above becaus of air pollution problem , improvement of other transpotation system and expenxive land . first of all , air pollution will be more serious . cars pollute a lot of duty gu . even now , air pollution is serious social problem . people will notice that we must not leave the duty environment for thier son nad daughter . so , they will escape to driving car . other people will think that they want to lung cancer . so they will not buy car . finally , many people think that driving car is bad thing for earth and all life . secondy , other transpotation system will be more improved . now government and transportation company spend money to improve public transportation system , such a lrt and bus , in part of software and hardwre . the more usuful public transportation become , the more poeol use thies system and the le number of using car is . finally , government can not get land cheeply . we have constructed enoumas road for car . but there is no land that government can get cheeply . now , in the city , land are fill with house , factory , and road . so govenment can not construct the road that people wont to in low construction cost . in conclud , i disagree that in twenty year there will be fewew car in use than there are today . i will be comfortable by reduceing the number of car .
