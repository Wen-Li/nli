yes , i agree to the statement . we need to keep broad knowladge on all academic subject when compare to specific subject . becouse in plimanary study each one of the subject is inter link with other subject . mean getting some knolwdage on each and every revelent subject is good for basic of study . vains are connect to each and every part of the body and supply blood to function in good health . if a person is suffering form internal pain from a body , the patceient is to carry to hospital and checkep by the doctor and identified some deficts . planed to do opperation each and every doctor should have some knowladge on all part of human body naither than that doctor can not make operation with out having knowladge in relivent part . suddenally the doctor is having good knowladge in vains for example , a general doctor can not read about one topic are one specific subject . in human body each and every part is related with another part , so the person who studying doctor to need all relevent subject of human body to be a successful doctor . where a in mathemetical caliculations to caliculate the estimated cost of project , need addition , ubstraction , muliplication & division . then only the final result will be appear . so some of the case there should be good knowladge in relivent subject and same a we can improve the communication and good relitaion ship between among people . we need to have knowladge in all aspect , then only we can servive in the society . having good knowladge all aparts is good . each and every genious is to have waste experan so we use to have broad knowledge on academic subject is good off specific subject
