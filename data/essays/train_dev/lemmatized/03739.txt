i do agree with the statement - successful people try new thing and take risk rather than only doing what they already know how to do well . high risk , high return . taking high risk in a planned way and executing the risk according to the plan will surely give high return . every person need return and high return definitely make a person popular and successful . entrepreneurs are one of the example . entrepreneurs are the risk bearer and try for the new thing . its obvious for an entrepreneur to bring in a new thing into the market and which is of very high risk . if the planning and execution of the work is perfect than the risk can be minimised and can earn high return . returns are the main objective of any entrepreneur . if return are achieved then he/she will be successfull . imitative entrepreneur are the one who imitate the existing product . imitating the product which is already existing product is of very high risk , so the entrepreneur try to bring the product in a new way and come with a better one . trying new thing is definetly taking risk and acheving success make the person successfull . doing the thing in a common way will bring success but it wont be a recognised a the one who try it in a different way . this statement will be more suitable for the business people . all the company / firm try to come out with a product in a new way . for example , mobile phone . mobile phone main purpose is to communicate , but the research and development had designed the mobile phone in a new way by including camera . all the multimedia feature , etc in it . some mobile phone click in the market and some are out of the market with in a short span . all mobile company have tried with new thing instead of doing what they already know how to do well . nokia is the one mobile company which try new thing and is in number one position . * here in the above essay `` company '' ha been referred to a `` person ''
