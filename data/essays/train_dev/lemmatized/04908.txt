` young people enjoy life more than older people do ' . the first question which i have to ask myself is : how to define young , respectively old ? a girl born in europe in the year 2006 will become approximately 90 year old . a couple of decade ago this figure seemed to be unbelievable . ( note : also for the majority of the world 's population such an age is quite unlikely . ) still scientist in europe agree on describing life of consisting of different ` sphere of age ' . first period : 0-20 , second period 20-45 and third period up from 45 . even within this category there are many , many split like the ` third age ' from 80 onwards . from my point of view young people are between the age of 0 and 45 , old people from the age of 45 up to x . so far we see that life expectation ha increased but the question is if young people enjoy life more than older people do . as we live nowadays in a fast changing world ( e.g. globalisation ) this ha also influenced the ` joy of life ' . for instance in europe in the late 1950s up to the late 1980s it wa easy to predict somebody curriculum , the likelihood of job-hopping wa quite low , also the worrry about environment like global warming did not play such an important role a it doe nowadays . as a result of the change of ` outer-circumstances ' ( globalisation , growth of life-expectancy , environmental question , etc . ) also the way how people ( can ) enjoy their life ha changed . from my point of view in the year of 2007 young people can not enjoy life a much a old people do . young people can not be sure about there future . things like job opportunity , environmental damage , war on resource like oil , a fast and sudden changing world et cetera make life much more unpredictable a it used to be . still young people can enjoy life but only in short term : young people can enjoy their weekend , their holiday and their free-time in general . but can they enjoy their long-term future ? can they enjoy their study at university by being always aware of the job-opportunities ? in contrast i think older people can be more sure about there future . some of them might still need to work some year until they reach a sudden age ( e.g. 65 ) and from then on they can enjoy their pension . in contrast to their younger relevants they do not have to care so much about personal impact of long-term future and it 's problem like war on resource ( e.g. there will be still oil for app . 30 year ) nor do they have to be always ` fit for the market ' . nowadays some researcher also say that old people are more financialy potential than young people which often make life easier and more enjoyable . finaly i would like to say that this gap between old and young people scare me a little bit - on the one side young people with an unknown future on the other side the old generation with plenty of time and money to enjoy future . ..
