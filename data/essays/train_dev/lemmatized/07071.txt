in order to be a successful person many people have acomplished it by trying new idea and taking risk . doing what you you already know to do will not take no anywhere if it is what most of the people do . many of the best invention on the world were the outcome of risk taken by common people , just like you and me . we should be more creative and not be afraid to try out new project . a short example to help me prove my point is the following : there is a man that ha been doing the same work over and over again , his life dosent change . he is good at what he doe but just like him , many others are good a him . if this man would try out new thing of change some of the thing he doe in his normal rutine and find a way to be more efficiently , he could change his life . he is the only person who can actually do this . taking risk is good to do once in a while . business men are known to be risk taker . in a business , many decision have to be made . once simple decision can make a difference on the final outcome . some time you might have taken a risk that you didnt want , but it happens to be a sucess . we should also learn from our mistake in order to not make them again . also everyday we make simple decision with out even realizing it . these decision can be thing just like what you will wear that day or what you will eat . for example , going to a restaurant and asking the waiter for a different plate of food which is not the one you normally would order . sometimes , your risk may not have been a success , but you may not loose anything . as an old man once said , `` you loose 100 % of the shot you do not take .
