i do n't agree at all with the idea that a young generally enjoys life more than older people do . we usually think about youth a a golden period of our life where we experience many unforgettable moment while we tend to consider the final period of our existence a the most painful one . nevertheless we have to consider also the other side of the coin a a young person usually face many difficulty an older person doe n't deal with anymore . there are in my opinion three different kind of problem you face in when you are young . first of all , everything is brand new to a you . you pas through a lot of experience you do n't know how to deal with because you lack the required experience about it . this often creates fear and doubt that is quite difficult to cope with unless you get the help of an older knowledgable person . for instance the doubt faced for the choice of a university , a crucial step in life , can be lived in a very negative way and can create a big sense of lack of direction . secondly there are many situation that during your life you experience several time thus getting used to them . but when you are young and you experience these situation for the first time you are much more sensible to them than a older person would be . a typical example is love . a young person usually suffers much more than a older one because of love relationship because they are not yet used to them while getting older you acquire the experience that allows you to suffer le . in the end , when you are young you do n't know yourself very well since you are not aware of your strength and weakness . this can cause a serious lack of self-confidence that creates very unpleasant feeling and thought in ayoung person . when you get older , instead , you are aware of your successed and failure and you get no more disappointed by them .
