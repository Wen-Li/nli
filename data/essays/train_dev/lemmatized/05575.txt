first of all i have to say that i can not give an answer which match on every young boy or girl . hence people , especialy young people , are very different from each other . but , by looking on most of the young people nowadays , i have to agree with the statement that young people nowadays do not give enough time to help their community . most of the young people were very focused on their owen life . they see only themselves , nobody other . the best example is , when you take a regulary bus , which is driving around in a bigger town . as i wa young , my father told me to leave my seat , if an older person wanted to set down her - or himself . i had to learn that sutch thing were nothing special . at that time it wa a normal education . nowadays nobody of the young people would do this . in most of the case i could watch , they did not take a notice of the older person . people do only what they have to do , what they want to do or if they think they might get an advantage out of it . for young people this mean : going to school , doing homework , playing computer game , meet friend in the shoppingmall and so on . but i do not want to give all the mistake , young people do , back to them . they did not leared how to do it in a right way . that is the mistake of their parent who did not done well in there education . perhaps becourse they did not have enought time or only becourse they were not intrested in teaching their child . most parent think the tv-screen is a good babysitter for thier child , but in the tv thing like helping your community is not shown very often . young people have to learn that they are not the only rock on the beach , but trying to explain this to them would like carrying oral to athen .
