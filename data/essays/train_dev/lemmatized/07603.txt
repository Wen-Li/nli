some people think it is not necessary to learn many academic subject and obtain broad knowledge from them . however i think it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subject . because we can use our broad knowledge to our real life . firstly , some people think it is not necessary to have broad knowledge . because they think it is waste of time and not necessary . moreover , it is really hard to learn variety of subject . for example , in korea , korean middle school force student to learn about 12 subject . but it became a serious problem in that the education program doe not consider student 's ability or interest . so recent research showed that more than 50 % of korean middle school student are dissatisfied with their academic program and waste of time . and average 30 student are going to study abroad a day . however , i think the broad knowledge that we have learned is very valuable in that we can use them someday . for example , i learned home economics and technology in school . at first , i wa suspicious about that why i have to learn about thing that i am not interested and not valuable . but , one day , i had to cook food by myself because my parent were not at house . i could n't think any of them . and then , i could remember that i learned how to make a korean traditional food called , `` bulgogi '' . so i could realize the importance of broad knowledge . overall , i think it is better to learn various academic subject and obtain broad knowledge in that it will helpful for our life . even though it is not related to one 's personal interest . in my opinion , even though people do n't feel the necessity of learning various subject , it doe n't mean that they wasted time . it ha it meaning that they had tried .
