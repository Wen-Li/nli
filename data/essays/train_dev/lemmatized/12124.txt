we live in a society that depends on technology for everything , car , motorcycle , airplains , tv 's , dvd 's , anything that we can imagine or think about needing it already there , so naturally we get bomberded by the medium with a lot of product that are not useful , a and most of the time they dont even work ! that 's why i believe that advertisement make product seem better than they really are . now day we a a society have developed , a comsuming disease ! everything new that come up we need , but eventually after month of using the product we stop using them ! so the rate star to come down ! what is the first thing enterprise do ? they tell lie ! and we have such a fragil mind that just because we saw that it work on tv , or hear it on the radio , we buy it again an , again , an gain . another problem , will be that the medium us artits in their advertisement to promote and to increase sale , this usally cause a person to buy a product that is not healthy , that not only doe not serf it 's porpuses , but in must case can harm you ! only because the girl holding the coke ha a great body , doe not mean your gonna get one if you drink one , or becauuse a a guy us a certain type of lotion he is going to get all the female to go after him , or that if brad pitt drive an audi , you have a chance to become a super star by buying one for yourself ! in conclusion , our community get affected by the medium , advertisments , magazine and all sort of thing telling u what to do or what not to do , what to wear or what not wear , so we end up buying thing that we dont need or want , product that are not effective or usefull , or what is beautiful , just because we are led to believe by advertisement that , that 's in fact what we need , just by making product seem better that they really are !
