i completely agree with the statement . today 's young generation hardly give any time to help their community . i feel so because , i have observed this . i feel if this continues , it may result in the decreasing growth of country . i had free time last weekend . so , i wa roaming around in the city . the very obvious thing which i could observe everywhere wa , teenager dancing around in pub , drinking , gaming , playing music . at the same time i could see people starving for food in slum area next to them . but , they were not bothered at all . i felt really bad and asked myself if this is the generation which is going to run this country in coming year ? our country 's future is in these hand waving unbothered in pub ? having fun , enjoying with friend is not a bad thing to do . but , one should always realize that there is a big mob of people around you seeking your help . bringing a smile on their face would surely add a lot to your community . the young generation can always spend few hour per week to help their community . they should realize their need for their community . they should realize that the future of their country is in their hand . helping out the community is very crucial for a country because , the country grows with the development of community . the implied meaning is , the teenager giving more time for helping out the community is crucial because , they can always utilize some portion of the time which they spend hanging around . there are many organization formed by group of young people in order to help out the community . but , the teenager hardly know about them and they often do n't pay attention at these thing . i think , we should make today 's young generation realize the importance of community service by publicizing such organization and letting young people to participate more in their activity . finally , i would say , the enthusiasm young generation should not waste their energy by hanging around . they should contribute to the country 's development by giving enough time to help their community and make the country grow with them .
