yes , i agree with the given statement . successful people try to do the new thing rather than doing old thing or repeated thing . here successful people mean the people who got a lot of experience in their job or in their personal problem . doing the repeated thing didnot give the new idea and we also do n't get new knowledge . rather doing the new thing we get the many idea and these idea can be used in many of situation . but old thing are also important for begining of a new thing . this mean that repeated thing are fundamental or basic of begining new thing . so we ignore the old thing in some case not in all . suppose if we neglect the old idea for starting a new one , some time new thing becomes failed . so we have to take care while doing new thing . these are some disadvantages for not taking the old idea . repetition of thing is a bad idea . inorder to improve our intellectuval ability we have to improve the new idea . once we find the new thing and new idea the organization or anyother criterion where we are working give award and also give the better position than now you are working and also a good salary . by doing new thing we have to discover many thing , these will be helpful for the future use . once we find new idea it will be useful for many generations and our name be printed in many book . if we do n't get proper reponse at the time of inventing the new thing , prosperous name will come after century or decade . so according to me finding the new one is great rather than old one . these are some advantages of getting to do new thing and new idea .
