`` old is gold '' go a famous quote . i disagree with the statement that `` young people enjoy life more than older people do '' . young people are always busy with something or the other , like completing assignment , heading for meeting etc etc . where a the older people , they completed every thing and now relaxed . for them there are no assignment to be finished or meeting to be attended . for example let consider a young man and an old man . we will consider some of their daily routine . young man need to wake up early like 5.00am in the morning go for a gym or jog to maintain his body . he should again rush to his home a he must get ready to attend his office or university . its a tight schedule . where a an old man , he can wake up whenever he want , can go for a walk whenever he want and can return leisurely . so who is enjoying life ? old man . now we will consider and old woman and a young woman . young woman. , she must also wake up early to go for a jog or a walk to remain fit and return to home quickly a she must go for an university or office , ofcourse there is an exception for housewife but if the housewife have child then again she is responsible for the child 's upbringing . on the other hand the older woman can wake up whenever she want and do whatever she want a she ha lot of time with her . some woman enjoy cooking so the old woman can try new dish or she can write peoms do whatever she want . so i strongly feel that older people enjoy life more than younger people . younger people are always associated with more responsibility than older people , building up their career etc etc .
