technology ha been constantly improving over time . this process seems not to be slowing down , especially because people 's need increase rapidly , and advance in technology are an important factor in the production of highly demanded good . obviously , car are one of those . each family owns at least one car , and people use it to go everywhere , even when it is not strictly necessary . in some country , place are reachable on walking distance , but in others people would not be able to go anywhere without an automobile . this is one of the main reason we depend so much on car , and i find it hard to believe that some day we will be able to give up on them . on the other hand , the number of car around increase incredibly every day , and we should consider the possibility that - a time pass - it could get quite difficult to drive around because of traffic . roads would be overcrowded , and it could be impossible to move freely and quickly from one place to another . besides that , a shortage of gas availability could occur , and this would definitely have a bad impact on our economy . in my view , it is very likely to happen that in twenty year there will be fewer car in use than there are nowadays . i am positive that technology will give u many more product whose main purpose will be making our life even more comfortable than they already are . moreover , a more moderate use of car would benefit the environment , and people will learn to use public transportation more often in order to live better . we only need to get used to live without a car , and then we may even forget about it completely !!!
