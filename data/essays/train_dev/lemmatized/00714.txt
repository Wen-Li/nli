there is no need to know the thing like concept and idea , which are already known by everyone . in order to be much more creative and productive , student have to learn the fact instead of understanding the concept and idea . in my opinion , there are some basic reason for that . first of all , internet ha become an important factor in student life . they can search the information which they have been looking for and they can learn the fact easily . secondly , it is much more beneficial for the student to learn the fact . if they are forced to research the information and data , they will probably create their own idea about a topic instead of understanding an old one . that will make them much more creative and prouductive . for instance , think a teacher who give an assignment to the student about a political issue . if student search the internet by using google , he or she will have some information about the issue and maybe ha a little information that already exists . but if he or she try to understand the basic of politics and learnes the fundamental fact , he or she can create his own opinon about that issue . to sum up , in order to be creative , student should spend their time by reading and researching the fact that they do not know . they must learn the fact in order to have their own about topic instead of memorising the consepts and the idea which have already been known .
