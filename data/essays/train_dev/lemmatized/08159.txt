i do n't think travelling in a group led by a tour guide is the best way . as i have a lot of travelling experince i am convinced that travelling by yourself is the best way to do it . with doing so you have much more freedom because you can make decision on your own and do n't have to consider someone else . this also prevents you from possible argument with the group or your travelling partner which could lead to a vacation you do n't enjoy fully . another important advantage , in consideration of a tour guide , is that you get to explore place on your own and do n't have to stick to a certain travel itinerary . this offer you a lot more possibility and you can stay at place you like and avoid the one you do n't like . tour guide have their program which they run through every trip . i think this is unpersonal . when i am travelling i want an individual route that 's the perfect fit for me and get the most out of my time . mostly you wo n't find this in a guided tour because it is designed to satisfy the need of a broad range of people and a lot of time cover the really touristy spot . i am not such a fan of this . you get to know a country much better if you go to place where the local people are instead of all the tourist . when travelling alone you are much more responsive to new people . while i wa travelling in australia i met so many new people which i probably never would have talked to , if i would have been in a group . but when you are by yourself you are more open for making new friend , just for the simple reason to not be alone all the time . furthermore it broadens your culture knowledge and understanding . last but not least it is more expensive to book a guided tour than to explore the country by yourself .
