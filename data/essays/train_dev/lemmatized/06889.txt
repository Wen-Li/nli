yes , i agree with the statement that `` successful people try new thing and take risk rather than only doing what they already know how to do well '' i agree with this because my friend is very successful person . he is from electonics backround but take the risk of experimenting the new thing , for example one day he had a problem with his bike . it wa unable to start . so i told him to take the bike to the mechanic but he didnt do so , instead he say it good chance for me to experiment some thing which is new to me . and he started repairing his bike , it took more then 5 hour and wa unable to start , so i said him again to take it to mechanic . but he went on like that with his work . and i wa very much surprised to see that the bike started , and even his patience and the motivation towards his work . and he wa delighted with joy a his risk wa fruitful . so because of this reason i supported the statement . there are some people who actually want to experiment or take risk but some dont want to do so they will be worried and they will not take the risk . just they do the thing which ever they know better . and more over it depends upon the understanding of the people . therefore from the above mentioned example i support the statement that successful people try new thing and take risk rather than doing what they already know how to do well .
