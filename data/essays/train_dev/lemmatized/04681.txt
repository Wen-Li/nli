i think that is better to specialize in one specific subject for to have a specific preparation in the field that is the most important for our . in my opinion the first important point of this choise it is certanly the capacity that a worker must have to arrive in the top of job field . the specialize in one specific field of the job it is an the most important ability to work because for example througth this the worker can ask much money , he can have a job that it is similar at your study , he can ask the job near to the home and also he can fell more lucky to live . another specific reason of my choise it is my personal experience because i am a specialize worker in the electronic field and this specialization i ha help my to have a job very good with a sale height . in the end i want describe the advantage also the other point of view . as a metter of fact to have broad knoledge of many academic subject it can help to have a big vision of world but i think that it is better to know one thing instead of many thing but sommarays mode .
