there is proverb ; knowledge is power . it mean more knowledge brings more power . i strongly agree with that having broaden knowledge of many academic subject is better . there are some reason why having broaden knowledge of academic subject are better because of application at other field and various experience . first of all , by having different kind of academic subject , we can apply other different field . for example , if construction company ha plan to build new modern style building in city . in this case , first thing we can think about is company must need an architecturer , who build building . if architecture ha broaden knowledge of other academic subject , then it would be better for making building . he can use various subject such a art , math and geology in order to build a building . in addition , modern society need people who are able to do multitaking job . moreover , having various academic subject can make people have various experience . for instance , i am majoring business at school . i take not only economy , which is my major subject , but also english , computer class , pyscology , and socialogy . in the future , i want to be a successful businessman , and succeful businessman need various field knowledge and experience . a busineesman need interpersonal skill , resposibility , of course economic knowledge , and language .
