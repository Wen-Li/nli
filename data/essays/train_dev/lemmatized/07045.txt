knowledge is something that the more you have the better it is . it cant neither be robbed nor taken away . it is something that is going to stay with you forever . though knowledge of all the subject is required but i disagree with the statement and believe that specialization in one subject is more neccesary . though i do not disagree that broad knowledge of many subject is required but according to me broad knowledge knowledge of many academic subject is required till say a bachelor degree when you are young and need information in all subject . i agree that that if u have knowledge in all subject then you will over all be a more educated person and have a better impact on people that you meet when u talk about a various number of thing . but according to me specialization is much more important when you reach a master degree because today world is more of specialization and only those type of people are valued that are specialized in their field . see todyay if you are specialized in your field then you have a better chance of making to the top in this field and you cant earn a lot of fame and recognition in that field and you can also become a dr in that field but incase of trying to know a lot of subject would you might not be able to a good in either of the subject . for example we can see the indian president apj abdul kalam who is said to be the father of indian rocket science but if he would try to have a broad knowledge in many academic subject like say history or geography or any other subject then he wouldnt probably be a good a what he wa in rocket science and therefore he would not have been a famous a what he wa then . so thats is why in my opinion specialization in one subject is more important then trying to be good in all subject .
