i do agree with the statement that young people do not give enough time to helping their community . todays generation is caught up with a lot of other issue which they feel are important and necessary for them to survive in this world and also to be happy in the future . these thing include getting good education which take up a lot of their time and energy , then they feel the need to earn a lot of money so that they can afford whatever they want in the future and last but not the least to spend the extra or free time enjoying life by attending party and watching movie . present generation ha the urge to study more and more so that they can match up to the expectation of the chaging world . frankly speaking it is not their fault either . every one requires a certain degree of education to support themselves and to be able to interact and communicate with the people of other country . this is so because most of the word carried out by our country is in collaboration with the developed country like the u.s.a. and therefore to match up to their educational requirement it is important to be well educated . to gain such quality of education one need to devote full time and energy and so doe not get the oppurtuinty to help their community . additional to the educational qualification a person need to have a good job in order to support his family . in the era of increasing price and low pay structure an individual need to work like a pig , a most of them put it , and then alone be able to match to his living standard . if someone doe not do the required amount of work expected from him then he is not given a chance of promotion which inturn decrease the availability of resource with him to live peacefully and happily . this is another reason why today generation is not able to give enough time to their community . finally , i think that a the world change , the priority of the people living in that generation change . earlier people used to utilize their free and extra time in helping old people or doing some amount of social severvice . every one had a feeling of responsibility towatrds the nation and it citizen . but today if someone ha free time they would want to rather go for a movie or party and enjoy themselves , instead of even thinking of the weaker and underpriviledged section of the socity . in conclusion , i would like to say that everyone in today 's world ha become selfish and therefoe want to think of themselves before others . today 's generation ha forgot what is `` service before self '' .
