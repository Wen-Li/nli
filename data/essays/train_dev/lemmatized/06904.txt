in the next future the number of car in use will probably fall down . these thesis can be proofed with some important fact . nowadays the car ' number is getting bigger bigger , congestioning the road and the city . move by car in a big city it 's very difficult because of the traffic , and move by car in a metropoli like milan or new york it 's nowadays almost impossible . in addition to this direct mobility problem , the pollution provided by the elevated number of car it 's starting to cause very serious problem in city living . another relevant problem connected to growing car ' number is the raise of petroleum price , that make fuel the car more and more expensive . to fight this problem many city are trying to promote the pubblic transport use , to reduce pollution in city area provided by car . to improve the dismissing of the car in many town expecially historycal town ( like rome and florence ) , the acr acces to the city center wa very restriced to a very little number of people with special permission , in other case the traffic in the city center wa forbidden at all . many study about car alternative car fuel are in act to reduce pollution provided by them , but the continuo growth of city and metropolies , and their overpopulation let see that in a not very far future we 'll not be able to acces city by car . nowadays unfortunatly the pubblic transport are not so good at work at your own car is , so many people are also prevented to leave their car in benefit of pubblic transport use . but also in this case many lot of study and work are in progress to give the people a very good service that can really answer their need . in conclusion i agree with the statement , and in twenty year , i think that we 'll must leave our loved and hated car in garage .
