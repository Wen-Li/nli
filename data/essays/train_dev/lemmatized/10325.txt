i agree that student have to understand the idea and concept than to learn fact . if they learn fact they can not properly understand the complete matter they have learned , they just learn about it . by learning fact the student ca n't make a note that where should we use these fact and so . students are now very effective and when they know the idea and the concept they can clearly understand where these should be used and which concept we use at a proper idea . for example we take the topic of the historical event and place . in the text book it will be written about the historical event and the fact about it but the student can not understand the complete concept of the topic . if the student try to understand completely about the topic by going through the idea and the concept the student can easily understand the topic in his view . so , in general view many concept the student understand by the idea and concept but not by learning the fact . students now easily try to know the idea and concept they can clearly understand and by learning fact they can only know about it . but when the student able to understand about the idea and the concept then the student can properly use the idea what he learnt and improve his idea in day life . it is more important for the student to understand idea and concept than to learn fact . students instead of learning about the fact it better to understand about the idea and the concept . so they can understand all matter what the topic is and can easily follow through the procedure what he learnt by the idea and the concept . lastly i agree the student to understand idea and concept than for learning fact .
