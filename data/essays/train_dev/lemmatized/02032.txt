in now day , many student learn thing by memorize but not getting the main idea . learing fact are important , but is n't it understanding the idea and concept of what you are doing much more improtant ? students ha to know and have a idea what they are doing instead of just following the instrutions in a robort way . first of all , student are not able to do the test if they do not understand the concept of the subject or unit . for example , when you are doing a physic test , how can you do the calculation without knowing how the question is asking for ? sure , you can memorize the formula and plug the number in for sure , but what if the teacher changed the question a little bit of what he is asking for ? so , understanding is really important . next , fact is truth , of course it is important in daily life , but what doe fact do with the education of student at school ? student 's job at school is to learn something that he or she is not able to learn at home . whatever the teacher have taught , if you do not understand what he or she meant , if you do not get the concept , how are you able to learn thing ? for example , macbeth by shakespears , if you have actually read the play that shakespears wrote , are you able to do the test by only reading it ? you surely have to understand the main idea of what he wa writting and what he wanted the reader to understand . this is the idea of the play . as a result , there are so many thing in the world that the student may not know yet . but since the student understand the concept or idea for being a student , they are going to learn many thing throughout their school life .
