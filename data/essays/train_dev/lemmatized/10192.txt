i think that to be a successuf people the people can try new thing and take risk much than doing only what they already know how to do well , but when became succesful they often do only one thing . in fact often the person , who becames succesful , doe one thig very very well : he know how to do something and he doe it . for example an succesful artist doe his work very well . but for some other people that do n't have particular ability , a good way to bacame successful is to try new thing and take risk . but when they know how do well something , often they only do this thing . this is a pity because this beahviour make their work so boring and i think that there is n't something that a person can know completely . in every materias there is new knowledge , for example in biology the scientist discover a lot of new thing every year . another serious problem is the `` knowledge division '' : for example an expert in lecterature can do n't know the common problem of picture . for the culture of people is a damage : every person ha to be a bit interested in a lot of thing . i think that real succesful people is people who have a great knowledge in a lot of thing .
