for old people , they have experienced all kind of event , delightful or frustrating , so the life ha already been a past process . in my opinion , what they should do is to review if and gain satisfactory from it instead of looking forward . i definitely agree with this statement and below i would explain some of the reason . every day , every hour , and even every minute , we , especially the young people , face a lot of problem either in work or at home . since the world is rapidly changing and modern life ha became more and more complicated , there are a lot of pressure , also can be called pleasure , modern people can enjoy . obviously , old people can not catch this rapid social pace , it also implies that these great pleasure resulting from work or compete are more and more far away from the old people . internet , invented in last century , with it wide availabity and increasingly prosperous information supply , ha become one of the most powerful mean of both communication and pastime today in the history , and will be more and more difficult to ignore . as it is so fashional that it user ha been basically limited to the young people . yong people ha active thought and strong curiosity . these are essetial trait for enjoying the life . take the case of a thing that one of my neighbor family , having both a teenager member and a grandfather . the boy are proficient in almost all kind of modern facility and seems to be obsessed with them . while the grandfather , with a priority to these machine , but seldom to touch them . the only entertaiment he enjoys wa the boring radio . in brief , young people is just on the arising phase of their life , and it is the right time for them to enjoy the life which is still somewhat mysterious .
