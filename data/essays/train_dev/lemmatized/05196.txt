do you want to enjoy your life ? there is many way of enjoying your life . what i think of enjoying a life is to be fun , and proud of what you are doing at all time . i disagree with the idea that young people enjoy life more than older people do , because what ever you do , the age doe not matter , have more experience , and they should understand the importance of enjoying their life . some people enjoy their life at all time , but the other doe not enjoy it all the time . some even doe not enjoy their life at all . to enjoy your life , what can you do ? for example , i would go shopping and hang out with my friend . i believe that is what most of young people would do . talk with friend , doing what you want to do . although doe this have to be young people ? the answer is no . older people can also go shopping and hang out with their friend . there is no such thing that young people can do and the older can not . older people have more experience to many thing . therefore they can always challenge themselves to do something harder . this give the gut to do and overcome what they had done before . they also can do the thing that they had done long ago and feel like they are young again . as you get older , you begin to understand the importance of time more . as young people just willing what they want to do , and ignoreing what they doe not want to do , old people prefer to do what they can do . young people tends to forget the thankness of being able to do thing that they are doing right now . although a you get old , you learn the importance of being able to `` do '' and be happy about it . older people enjoy their time so much more . feeling greatful of your life is not a easy thing to do . although there is no people that doe not want to enjoy their life . it is important to understand that you should be thankful to what you are doing and spend your time that make no regret in the future .
