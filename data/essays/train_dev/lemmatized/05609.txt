advertisement is a very important part of business nowaday and the aim is to sell . if you turn on the television you 're most likely to fall on commercial and this is very specific of the united states . i do think that advertisement make product seem much better than they really are . just by the lightening , the way it is shot , food look systematically better on tv or in picture than in your plate . there aim being to sell , they are not going to tell you that , in a month , your new vacuum cleaner will be broken or that it will leave dirt on your carpet . they want to show the best feature of the product and highlight it to the extrem . the problem is that sometimes commercial lie and that thing should be defined and ruled because when you invest money on a product and expect a lot out of it , not because you are demanding but because you have been promised something , you are in your costumer 's right to demand reparation . it seems like there is no rule in advertisement and that lying ha become a common talent but i do think that this type of practice ha it dark side . in fact , anyone can tell when a commercial is over-selling a product to the point where it get obviously and ridiculously outrageous . few poeple are actually fooled by these . we are aware of it and have come to find it rather funny . but doe this give a bad image to the company and the product ? i do think so . i have a tendency to think that they are not serious with their costumer and therefore i am not interested in buying such a product . if the first answer to `` do advertisement make product seem much better than they are ? '' wa `` yes '' i would give it a second thought and say that the ridicul of most of them totally diminish the work and the money spent on what is suppose to make the product look good . for me advertisement fail at that by failing at taking poeple serioulsly .
