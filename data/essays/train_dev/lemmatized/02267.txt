i strongly agree with the statement that say that young people nowadays do not give enought time to helping their community because our modern society is very corrupted , and one of these negative aspect is certainly social selfishness . whit this word i want to say that in our modern society every person tends to think only at his own life whitout spending time for the community or thinking to the other people . this sense of selfishness wa absent from society only a few decade ago , but whit the past of the time it is became a very common aspect of human behavior . whit the past of the time in fact people have became more isoleted and worried about their own life that they have forgotten that around them there is a society , and that to mantein a general political and social balance every person ha to solve a particular role in this society . wit the past of the time in fact every person ha tried to overcome the others to became a self made man satisfied of his or her leader behavior . the most negative aspect is not that this idea is very spread in the society in wich we live , but the way in which this teory is speading : every family in fact tend to teach to their son that the most important thing in a person 's life is become someone important and reach . i belive that this negative teaching have corrupted our society and there is no possibility to return back ; we live in a world damaged and characterized by value completly different from the real value of the past , in whic friendship and sense of helping the community were the key idea . in conclusion i would like to underline that it is true that in our society is not present the sense of community helping by the young people , but at the same time it is not correct to accuse young people to be the initiator of this fact because it is only a conseqence of a proces started many decade ago . i seriously belief that if we do not begin to rebalance the value of our society we will live in a very corrupted world in which the most difficult thing it will be simly to live in !
