nowadyas , every one want to make an advertisment for every thing that he ha . ths is because it is a very helpful way to let people know about what you have , and what it look like . advertisements are a way that helpe people to know some information about the product , but a lot of peple exagorate in advertising about their product . some people do n't know a lot about the itmes that they want , and they buy them without knowing any information about them unless when they read an advertisment . for example , when some one want to buy a computer , he may read something about it and then he go to buy it . he may not find the right person to ask about what he want to buy , so he belief what is written on the advertisments . on the other hand , some company take this thig a awy to help them in selling their product . they may make a lot of advertisments to let people buy what they have . it is imprtant to have someone ha an experions in some case because company like to exagorat in their product . when you want to buy something you sould buy something reasonable , or you should ask some that he know about what you are buying . in my case , when i want to buy a computer i ask my borther about it because he is very good in computer , and he know every thing about them . it is importnat to buy something that you know because you are not going to know about it till you buy it . companies sould care about how the people feel when they buy their product because when they do this they are not going to exagorate in their product . on the other hand people should know what they are buying beucase it is safer for their money .
