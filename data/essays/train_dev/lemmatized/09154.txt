my little sister is the most happy person in our family . she always play with her friend and toy . she is always happy . on the other hand my grandmother is very sad . every day she talk me about his health problem . some people believe that young people enjoy life more than older people do . i personally agree with this idea . these are my following reaons . first of all , the olders generally have health problem much more than youngers . body of older people doe not have enough durability like younger 's . for example my grandmother can not walk like my sister because my grandmum ha some trouble with her foot . can she enjoy life more than my sister ? of course not . second , younger have a lot of thing to learn in their life . on the other hand , older ha been learn many thing in their long life period . for instance , any child at the age of 7 is very happy because of having a class first time . but the older never be happy because of that . last but not the least , older people have a lot of thing that they have to do . for example , my mother always wash the dish and help me about my homework . i am more free than her . i can play basketball or watch tv after the lunch , but she ha to wash dish after the lunch . she can not enjoy life like me because she ha a lot of problem that must to be solved . all in all , i agree with the idea that older people enjoy life le than young people do . consequently , i am happy because i am young too .
