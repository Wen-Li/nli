i disagree with the statement that student to understand fact rather than idea and concept tthere are two reason for this statement : time and knowridge . the first reason why it is more important to student to learn fact lather than idea and concept is that they can learn wide variety of knowridge . this way student get more knowridge . the second reason why it is more veneficial to student to learn fact lather than idea and statement is time . students can use the time more usefull . if student understand idea and concept for each fact , they have to spend so much time and energy . for instance , when i wa elementary school , i learned mathmatics formura without concept . in order to remember all the formuras , the teacher gave u a song for the formura . thus , we can easily remember this formura without spent exstra enersy and time. , and it is still usefull to me . i disagree with the statement that student to understand idea and concept than fact , because student to can use time usefull and get more knowridge .
