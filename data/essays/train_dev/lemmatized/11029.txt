i completely agree with the statement , i always stood by the saying that `` variety is the spice of life '' . things have to be dynamic to be interesting . what would you want to watch ? a thundering waterfall or a pool of stagnant water . the people who meet success realise this very well , even boredom ha to be credited partially because generally when you 're bored you try to find a new source for inspiration and chance of an idea turning into innovation arises here . since money ha been a long time scale to measure success let me use that scale , i say business . the men who have ventured into new field have excelled and have been credited for both their money and idea . that 's one of the major reason that we see that the forbe 's list is generally dominated by the people who have invested and worked in new age business arena rather than traitional one . innovation doe n't always call for drastic change , it not only about the end product but also about the way in which the product is manufactured ( operation , logistics , strategy , tactic etc ) . the general perception that adventuring into unknown territory is more risky than moving around your own house doe n't always hold . the first person to start a new venture will have the maximun potential and the the word exclusivity play a big part here . a known field is always full of competition and rivalry - which doe compensate the comfort of familiarity . so risk a a matter of fact is never absolute and should always be judged by the magnitude of the outcome that it can trigger . we have to remember that had the risk taken by people have helped u advance . a sailor 's risk resulted in a great country , a soldier 's risk resulted in the end of tyranny and a doctor 's risk resulted in a saving a life .
