i fervently agree with this futuristic statement that in twenty year , fewer car will be in use than there are today . firstly , i believe that in the absence of effective and economic solution to the problem of fuel today , with pollution and traffic on the rise , there is a pressing need to revitalise our public tranport system and take appropraite measure to discourage private transport . cars , that are the symbol of private conveyance not only heavily contribute heavily to the increasing pollution in every major city of the world , but is also unnecessarily cluttering up the scarce space that we have left on the earth and it road . this also is leading to a disastrous number of road accident that are the cause of more death today than any epidemic or war . twenty year from now , i do not see the severity of these problem alleviated unless we take some effective step a reducing private transport , which i think is inevitable . in country of europe , the private transport even today is minimally used . secondly , with globalization all around u , with boundary of distance , culture and language rapidly dissolving , i see the car getting obsolete simply because our need would be larger . with technology , i believe that local distance would become inconsequential and car would give way to more advanced form of travel . already , the first space tourist ha made a successful trip and is back ! with an orwellian outlook of the world , i have a dystopic vision of the world ; a world where for stability and efficiency , the state would assume power , where perhaps personal expression is rendered unimporant and the society or the community is primary . in such a society , the car which is basically a symbol of prestige and status ha absolutely no space . today , where we stand , with the all pervasive internet growing beyond limit , in twenty year the world would be more of a virtual community . you and i would have a more predominant virtual existence than a real one . our basic need to survive everyday , chore that require u to move around on a daily basis would be conveniently done away with with the virtual world . believe me , we 'd be thriving on our virtual entity a lot more , depending on it for our daily need without moving an inch ! what doe a car have to do in such a scenario ? with the above point , i have made a cogent and strong statement asserting that car have no place in our world twenty year from now .
