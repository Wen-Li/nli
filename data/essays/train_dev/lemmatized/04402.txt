although i can understand people , who think that it is better to have a broad knowledge of many academic subject , i think that speacializing in one specific subject is better . i want to point out my opinion with the following 3 argument . first of all , in ancient time , the greek and roman needed manz academic skill . for example , aristoteles wa a philosophist , mathematic and a astrophologist . they needed these many specialisation to earn money . but since henry ford invented the construction band , the specialisation expanded . secondly , you have to be a genius to have a broad knowlodge of many academic subject . for example student need three or four year to study only one academic subject . so it would cost the person a lot of time to get a broad knowledge . furthermore study are not for free . the person would also need a lot of money , and this is not very effective , a he or she do n't earn a lot more money , when they start working . so in fact , you should study two thing side by side . but this request a high iq , which only a few people have . last but not least , a mentioned in the beginning , specialisation is needed today in every work . today company search for specialised worker in only one specific subject . the work doe not require other academic subject . so a person with a broad knowledge would propably be annoyed , doing this job . so the company will propably prefer the specialised worker . i study business , this is already a specialisation , but i have to pick out only one part of business . for example , controlling or finance management and when i work in a big company i even have to go deeper into specialisation in one aspect of controlling or finance managment . and by doing this i have to learn every day new thing , so i will never have the time to learn other academic subject .
