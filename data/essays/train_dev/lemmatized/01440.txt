i am agree with the idea that people who try something new and take risk , are considered like successful people . first of all , according to me when someone want to follow one way , he have to take risk . if it personn follow everytime the same order , he will not improve his situation . sometimes , he need to do her own idea and if he can , change all his life , or his job . for example , concerning a footballer , he need motivation to stay the best during his career . he need to like his working condition and stay in the same team is not the solution . if his motivation are decrease and his peasure a well , it should be difficult for him to be efficient for working . secondly , we can speak about successful people , only if they have change something in your own life . because when they take risk , they are able to create a new idea and this idea could be successful . if they do nothing , people will stay at the same level day after day . indeed , nowaday we have a good life quality , and why ? thanks to successful people who have taken a risk in a period where they thought that the way of life needed to change . lastly , when we take risk you are considered like a successful personn for further raison . first of all , the population majority follow the order , do what they already know for doing it well day after day . this kind of population might be impressed by someone who decide to create a new company or to improve a new idea . lastly , the successful people will be describe like an very cleaver people , but it is not he case . they only take risk , it is the only way to be motivate . as a conclusion i will say that we need successfull people . without this kinf of people , we will live in a life without innovation
