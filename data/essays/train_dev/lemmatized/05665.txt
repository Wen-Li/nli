some people believe that young people can enjoy life more than older people do . other people believe in the other way which is older people have a more enjoyable life than young people . as far a i concern , the latter is more reasonable than the idea mentioned earlier for the following reason . in the first place , young people have more responsibility , which would allow them have le time to enjoy the wonderful thing in their life , than elderly , as a older people , in a sense , there is no duty , such a rising a child , paying tax , and educate the next generation ; on the contrary , these responsibility are , now , weighted on the shoulder of younth . they need to worry about many thing , including how to hold their job . and it is also the truth that an increasing amount of time is being spent in the work place in order to hold the position they hold now . that mean le and le time will be available for them to enjoy the life . in the second place , older people have a more peaceful mind to enjoy the life . these is a growing tendecy for people to lose their ambition a their age is going up . comparing to the young people , elderly feel more comfortable with the life they are having now ; unlike older people . young people are always on the way to seek something better , something they think deserve better . this make them always on the process of chasing , leaving no mind or mood the enjoy the life they are having now . finally , older people can do numberous thing that young people are not able to do . with the repect for older people taking more and more important place in an increasing number of people , people now build many place only for old people , and make more entertainment for the older . these programme are more suitable for elder . that 's reason some of the show can not be understood by the young people . all in all , young people cant not enjoy their life a much a older people do beacuse they are having le time , and ambitous mind to chase others thing . in addition , they ca n't understand something that elder do . however , i believe that in the future , young people will enjoy life in a same amount that older people do .
