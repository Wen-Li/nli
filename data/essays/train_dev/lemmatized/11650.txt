i strongly agree . i would like to say these day `` age of pr '' . when i buy something , there is a very difference between i have seen advertisement or not . for exemple , when i buy and eat a mcdonald hamberg , i can trust before i eat . i would think what it ha high quality and taist no matter what it have because i have seen mcdonald 's advertisement long time and a lot of time , but when i buy and eat a hamberg which i have never seen advertisement before may be i can not trust it before i eat . sometimes people know what every advertisement are not really . sometimes advertisement ha problmes which make confuse people , but even like that advertisement make product much better . so i would like to say `` advertisement make product seem much better than they really are .
