in my opinion , travelling is a process for people to broaden their view fo world , to learn and share with others ' culture and to adjust their mind and body into a harmonic way . and this whole process for travelling is neither necessarily in group nor led by the tour guide . first of all , with the fast-pace improvement of information technology , one can go on the internet and search for any detailed information for any area . there is not so many need for a guide to tell you what the history and riddle of the scene are , instead we can easily find those information we want on the internet . secondly , the guided group are more likely to have a schedule on when and what to travel . this is obviously against the nature of the travel , we need more time to talk to people and share the wisdom of life , which seems a tough and even impossible task for the tour guide , since to some extent , they had to follow the simple principle , time is money . if we travelled by ourself , we can arrange our time freely , if there is a point of intersest that attract you a lot , we can reschedule it to go back one day later or even more . thirdly , we can know where our money spend when travelling by ourself , there is no way that you know the same thing when you give the money to the tour guide . it sometimes ruin my mood of travelling by suspecting that the guide may keep some of our money to his own pocket . also , some guide may pull you to some restaurant or local shop that are not attractive to u at all , which in return the restaurant and shop give bonus back to the guide . to me myself , i will feel cheated under such circumstance . in summary , i am against the statement in the question .
