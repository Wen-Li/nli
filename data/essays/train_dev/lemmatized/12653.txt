i agree with the idea `` it is important for the student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact . '' there are some reason for this . firstly , understanding idea and concept is an abstract process . namely , they are the thing which are difficult to learn or understand for the student . so , if they are learned by the student the student would be one step further in the teaching and the learning atmosphere . for example , love is a concept . students can love their mother , father , or friend . this is a easy thing to do . however , their understanding of the love concept take some time . it is more difficult than loving someone . moreover , being realistic is an idea . maybe , in their daily life student can be realistic , however , learning the idea of being realistic is more difficult than being realistic . so , it is more important for the student to learn the idea and concept . secondly , the fact can change in time . moreover , some fact can change person to person . for example , the fact that the world is flat changed today . another example is , there are some ritual in some culture . namely there are some culture specific fact . for example , according to the culture of turkey people cry when a person dy . this is a fact in my country . however , in indian culture people never cry for the death person . they think that the death person is saved from his/her agony in their life . namely , a fact can change from culture to culture so , learning all the fact are not always useful to the student . as a result , a the understanding the fact are easy and the need for learning the fact change from person to person , understanding idea and concept is more important , a it is more essential for the student than the other .
