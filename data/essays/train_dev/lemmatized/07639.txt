in my definition the enjoyment of life is living life to it fullest . and thus , i believe that young people enjoy more life than older people . there are various point with me to discus this issue . firstly , young people are mobile . in other word , they are young mind , young blood with dynamic energy . if some one is mobile he can reach any where to satisfy his need to live life and make it at it full wihtout any compromise . whereas olders are at the age at which they have atleast one problem , which make them immobile . at this age they are out of energy and liable to have atleast one health problem , make them to stay at home and dependent . secondly , young people are doing atleast one task like studying , job etc. and this make them to come in touch with lot of people and new friend . this give them the opportunity to make new friend , with whom they can enjoy life by week end , long drive etc. on ohter hand the olders are handicap in this regard . since they are compromised through health . which make them to seat at home and alone with his health . so , no health , no going out , no friend and no enjoyment of life . moreover , in other word young people are twenty first century people . young people utilizes all the latest technology by gaining it knowledge though the reliable source , since they are intellignet enough to utilise it and convert it in to the new source on enjoyment of life . on other hand the older people still have the older mind setup which is out dated enough for the enjoyment of life . in conclusion , the younger people do have the enough energy , chance to make friend and adequate knowledge to live life at it fullest , which olders lack in .
