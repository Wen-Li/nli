with the advent of the `` electronic era '' and other significant technological development , it is true that there are many attraction which may divert the youth a little . but it is not true to state that they are not devoting enough time to helping their community . the following reason will substantiate this view . firstly , every young person grows up with an ambition . some would want to become doctor , some engineer and some even accountant . ultimately they get a job . in effect , by being a doctor or an engineer or taking up any profession , they are providing service to their community . some may work abroad like the nri 's and send money to support their family , thus raising the economic status of the society . thus , even if they are not aware , they are providing useful service for the community . secondly , the central theme of any religion ( or most of them ) is good work . thus any pious youth will definitely work towards the improvement of their community . so one can not make a vague statement that all the youth do not give enough time to helping their community . thirdly , many college and university have club that focus on improvement of the community . for example in the college where i studied , there is a club where some student decided to provide basic education to the under-priviledged . finally , one can not deny that many hospital would require their intern to go to some remote area and provide free treatment . some country like germany make it compulsory for the youth to commit to either social or military service . in conclusion , it is true that modern gadget , to some extend , have made people more selfish . but one can not deny ever that young people do take pain in helping a community a expounded above .
