yes . i agree . because a the tv , internet , developed to help people get the information really easy . to make people notice is not a problem . but the product is not only sold by one company . in order to let people spend their money buying the product become really important . advertisements always use something shacked word and well noticed senctice to effect peolpe 's desire of shopping . for example medicine . some company will use many people to show how their product work and compare with different company . but a we know it depend on different body 's effect . in some fast food restaurant the picture of the meal usually look like full and hot . for some reason to make it fast and commercial way , it is really difficult to make it look like the picture . in the company , there must have different people make the product and the advertisement . in order to finish their job . they both want to do the best . advertisements is the first line to the customors . sometimes the product may be just ok but if it had a good advertisement it could probably change customors ' mind . that work , the company made money . and the people not only buy their product but the most important thing the ad . advertisements made people fight with their desire . when people paid the money and find out that they did not satisfyed . because we always want better or more . sometimes in our mind feel that we should n't spend that much just for that thing and find a reason to argue . but anyway advertisement work . that is why the company rather spend their money on the advertisement than on the mass of product . consider to the product , if it just ok and not really far a the advertisement people still accept it . take a look carefully before we buy .
