i agree with the statement because i think that if you only do what you know and even if you are very good at it you will not learn anything new from it . and i think that to take risk it might not be successful everytime but it a new way to learn . if you risk and is not successful you should go back and look what you did wrong and learn from those mistake and how to not ever make them again . so i look at taking risk a a way of learning somthing new . if you do n't risk your live will never change and you will do the same thing over and over and if you ever have to be on a situation of taking risk you probably would do n't know what to do , or what to say , or how to react . taking a chance to do somthing with your live like liveing in a different country , with a different language , different culture , and a lot of different situation , it to take risk because you dont know how people will act , or you do n't know people costume , or even if you do n't know the language . but with time and a possitive actitude you will eventually learn about it . i belive that opportunity is taking risk and opportunity doe n't come very often so i think even if you do n't end up been successful after it , i 'm sure you would learn something from it . i took the opportunity of liveing in another country than were i wa born . and i did n't really know where i wa going and how wa it going to be . but with the time i have learned a new language and new culture , a different way to look at the world preaty much . so i think that i 'm preaty lucky because not a lot of people ha done what i have , but i the same time i took a risk and i did n't know if it wa going to be succesfull for me . that risk i took it 's made me enrich my person .
