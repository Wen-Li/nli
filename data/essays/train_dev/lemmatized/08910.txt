travel is always a good experiencia , no mater how we doed , but i really think is better to traveld leded by a tour guide . if we traveld alone is like having a big aventure , but maybe we are going to experience some problem that can ruin the vacation . in firts place , in most of the place we go to traveld , we know nothing abauted , so maybe we are going to get lost . with a tour guide we cant visited all the important place od the place we are going to traveld . in second place , a tour guide can bring u key information to undestand the place and culture that we visiting . every culture have a particular history , that is the base of their actual status . knowig the culture , give u the oportunity to tasted the soul of the place we are . most of comun people did n't know a lot abaut culture , son is a very good thing to have a tour gide that can bring u this kind of information . in third place , a tour guide can bring u especial information about how we can satisfy the usual need we have . places to dinner , palces to rest , place to spend the night , place of entertaiment , place to by remainder , etc . also a tour guide also can help u if the language represent a problem to u . ther are some many language around the world , so is imposible for a person to know every speaking language . a tour guide it can be a instrument to comunicated we the people of the land we are visistig , so comunication is not have to be a problem to enjoy the traveld . finally a tour guide can bring some stability and a sense of secure . traveld with a tour guide it is the best way to traveld .
