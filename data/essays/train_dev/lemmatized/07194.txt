cars are very useful to u in many way . they transport u to our destination quickly . they help to save our time instead of walking . cars are widely used by million of people around the world today . their price is not very high and they live for a long time . after mentioning all the useful us of car above , i totally disagree with the statement that say that in twenty year there will be fewer car in use than there are today . i know that technology is becoming more and more progressive everyday and another invention could be invented , but the use on car will not decrease . in my opinion , car are very essential to every person now in the world . a person can not go to any place that he need without a car . whoever doe not own a car is obliged to ride in governmental or public car such a bus and microbuses that transport individual to certain place according to the destination of each bus . so at the end , the person ride a certain type of car and doe not go to his destination walking a it will take a long time to reach his destination . in my second opinion , i think that in the next twenty year the us of car will increase a new and many feature will be added to car which give the opportunity for driver to get greater benefit from car . by that way , more car will be used than today . for example , about 50-60 year ago , the car that were used were very old-fashioned and were very large and some were moved by horse . now , everything ha changed and car became much mor good-looking . they became smaller in size and are no longer moved by horse . that is what i mean by adding new feature . in conclusion , i totally disagree with the topic sentence and propose that the use on car will increase and not decrease .
