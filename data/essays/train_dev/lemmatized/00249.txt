although it may seem like young people do not contribute to the development of their society a much a in the old day , i strongly believe the opposite . in my opinion , daily life and social issue have become so interrelated that it is difficult to distincly see the youth 's contribution to his/her society . consequently , youngster help their community in the form of joining social affiliation , taking active role in political discussion and even working while they take part in educational activity . one way that youngster contribute to the well-being of their society is through community work they do in their free time . it is possible to see many university student voluntarily participating in club where they have the opportunity to help child , people with disability and people who are in need . another solid example of youth 's contribution to the society is their desire in expressing their political opinion and taking the necessary action . in my opinion , a strong society is the one in which politics can exceed the wall of the parliement . in the country where i live , young people form active group to contribute to the well-being of their country . thus , their contribution can not be neglected . finally , it is not so difficult to come across university even high school student working on part-time job . to be more specific , half of my friend are both working and studying . considering the time they need to allocate for their study , working while studying is not an easy task at all . thus , it should deserve the society 's appreciation . by doing so , the youth make a significant contribution to the economy of their community . there are various example suggesting that the youth is still actively helping their community . thus , it would be wrong to thing that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their community . it is just that they do it in a different manner than the usual .
