i partly agree with that statement , but there is no point in lowering the neccicity of learning fact . they built the basis for further understanding . for example in biology , first you have to learn the fact , the term and their definition . it 's like learning a language you 'll need for comunication with others in your field . so you have to learn the basic fact and term and know them by heart to actually express yourself , your thought and question . well , the fact are the tool but understanding the meaning of idea and model is the actual work . one can use the tool for understanding the fact . and understanding is sometimes even harder than learning fact , because you have come to this point , i would call it `` aha '' moment , and this can take very long . you probably have to repeat thing you did n't understand at home on your own , and read secondary literature for better understanding . i would say , that understanding can be much more time consuming than just memorizing the fact . but once you really understood a theory or a problem you probably wo n't forget it , and you can built up on this . real understanding of idea and theory can built the foundation for further question or even own thaughts and theory . for example a student wo n't be able to present own thaughts in a topic he doe n't even understand . additionally , understanding concept is a cruicial requirement for a carrer in science . in science you have to understand the work that wa done on your fild to built up on it , to add new idea and create own thaughts . to sum this up , learning fact and knowing them by heart is neccecary to comuicate in your field and understand it , but understanding is the part that is cruical for own creativity of thaughts .
