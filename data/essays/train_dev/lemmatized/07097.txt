to travel is one way to learn and extend our horizon about the world and life . i have some important reason to travel without a tour guide . yes , i do n't prefer to travel in a group led by a tour guide although i can not deny it pro . i believe to experience new thing in your own world for yourself should be private . you do n't have to give up from your freedom a well . secondly , when we do n't have any schedule to follow travel may be more relaxing and be more stretching to expose thing which are not familiar to u . one of my aim to travelling is to experience new thing and be faced with beautiful or ugly thing during this travel . to read about one place 's history brings a mental challenge and give deeper and extensive knowledge about that place . to find out the most beautiful but hidden place are unique experience for me . also , not to follow a tour guide that mean not be tied by a incoherent group can give much space for your discovery . you wo n't have rush to follow any schedule or you wo n't wait someone whom is taking your time at all . it may seem harsh thought but i count on my experience . in sum , i suppose that i am more individiulastic one that led my decision favor of travelling without a tour guide . i like expose and experience freely and myself .
