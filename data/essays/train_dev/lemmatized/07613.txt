most advertisement make product seem much better than they really are , yes of course , i agree with this . the way advertisement used now a day a lost the meaning of it purpose , early day it pupose is to bring to the people , make people aware of that certain product is available in the market , which benefit the customer in different way , in that advertisment they clearly give the description of the product , and way that could be used in real life . the very purpose of that advertisement is lost now a day , they are just showcasing the product , then it orginally exhibit it characterstics , comparing it with other product and fooling the public of the worthiness of the product , then really it ha . they use some girl , for advertising face cream , before they use this product they look not beautiful , but using the product for a few time brings chane in them itseems , they wiil be looking charming , how this happens , it just the camera trick and the make up they are given , if we use it orginally will we get that change , no definetlty no for example take an product , namely toothpaste , the company related to it are pepsodent , colgate , closeup , all this product have same ingredient and mixture of same level , but while advertising each company showcase it own product , differently , comparing with others , not mentioning name of the differnt company , that their company product ha better feature than others , u just tell me how the product desingned with same formula , but with company different have different feature . so the way advertisement is now used is just showcasing the product than it orginally be , make product seem much better than it really is . another example is soap , the company jocil designes soap , and they sell those to bonded company , they just label the paper on it and advertises about the product and simple express the feature of it with out knowing it . for advertising , now a day , the famous body is used , such a actor , sportsman , singer so on . .. so the people who liked the famous body , will automatically buy the product and others who doesnt like it , they dont go near the product , and this is one of the way that product is being showcased more than it is worthy of , a people like the word of famous body , they feel that the product is really worthy of being purchased , and they simply buy it a his/her famous body advertised the product . thus i feel that , the advertisement , is just showcasing the product than really the worthiness of it , make product seem much better than they really are . there is no doubt that certain quality are there in the product , but all the quality mentioned in advertisement , not neccessariliby in it , it just added quality to attract the public to the product .
