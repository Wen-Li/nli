probably in the past there wa a much greater sense of community than we have nowadays . everyone , since ancient time , had to do his or her part to help the community . childhood did not last for long , soon people had to learn to work and fight , and get married . what is changed now ? the time we spend to actually become `` adult '' is much longer , leading to a new stage of life , in which we are no more child , but not yet mature . young people , during these year have to understand what they want for their life in order to be helpful for others . not an easy task , but young people still do give time to helping their community , in different way . in the first place , young people depend on their family for a long time from many point of view . so their resource are limited . the range of possible helping actvities is often reduced to volunteering . and there are people who do that . many of my friend have been volunteer for at least one year . i wa part of several group , and now i support some association , like unicef , for what i can . another problem is that nowadays you can contribute to your community by working . this is something hard to do while young people are studing . i have just one part time job with child , because i do not have much time left from university . but i give my contribution anyways . many student do . by helping themselves , they help society . finally , it is not easy to give a definition of `` community '' today . in the age of globalism , community tend to be more virtual than physical . that is really common among young people . we create and join community on the world wide web , almost a second life sometimes . do we care le about our community ? i do not think so . instead there might be a more serious problem : young people feel like they do not belong to these communties anymore . and people should think about why this happens . we do spend time for our community , just in a new personal way .
