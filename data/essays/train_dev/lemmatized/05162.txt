something that we have to have in main are the differents between being a young people or old people . what can you do when your are young rather that old ? this question will give you which one is better . night live , responsabilities and money are the differents between then . we have to begin night live . some young people between 15 and 20 do not even what a night live is , so if you are an adult , you can enjoy a night culb without any restrition . other inportant point is that you do not have to tell anyone where are you or what are you doing because you a old and you do not depend of your father . also , other important point in the live of a young or old people is the responsability . if you are young you allways will have school and that is a big responsability , but if you are a old , you just will do whatever you want and you just have to worry about yourself . the last and most importan point is the money . when you are young you have you father and they are the only one who are worry about the economy . however , you will not have everything you want only because is not you money is their money , so if you want to bay something the do not want you just can not bay it . in conclution , the life for the old people wa , is and will be allways better and if your are young you can enjoy but not a much a you want . but you can also wait until you grow up and become a old man .
