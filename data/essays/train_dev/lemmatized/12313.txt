i agree with this statement . people try thing that they do n't know very well . the risk is a part of live and many people believe that this is the only thing to carry on live . i thing it 's very sad . the quotidianity is also very important and to appreciate small thing of each day is an other way to live . this statement can carry negative effect to people 's life . the teenager try often thing very dangerous to be appreciate by other member of a group . they take risk only to be part of something . they do n't hear what their parent tell and they do what kind of stupid thing . they drive a car at high speed , for example . recently , i wa watching television when i saw a girl that she had an accident with a car . she killed three guy and she only sayd : `` luckly , i wa n't in our place '' . incredible ! . she killed three innocent people . i think that people can try risk , but only a risk without consequence for other person . an other risk is , for example , start a business . i think that it 's very difficult to create a new company , expecially today . i study business management and i understood in my university 's course that only few people can realize this thing : people that are clever , ambitious , they must understand what they are doing and this last carachteristique is the most important . maybe , a man with a family spend a lot of money to open a restaurant , but he doe n't have quality to organise , to calculate problem and to solve them . he lose all for a dream too bigger for him . it 's very important know what you 're doing only in the small and le important thing . know the effect of own action and imagine the action of the others . an other risk is the bank investment . i do n't think it 's a good idea and my money will stay in a security place .
