people do something because of very reason such a compulsory , to be happy , however , something is not enough for some people ` successful people try new thing and take risk rather than only doing what they already known how to do well . ` i definitely agree with this term . i believe that succesful people believe themselves this is very important issue for me becuase if person believe yourself would not lose easy . firstly , many people are doing same job or thing in the world and sometimes it can be boring for example many parent want to chose a specific job for their child like an engineer , a doctor , a lawyer . it can be normal but if people have to do this they can do another one . this should not a compulsory for life . for example person who wa the fourty five year old and he is a doctor , suddenly he change your mind and want to be a captain . in this time i believe , this is success and he is successful . sometimes life can be bored our passion , ambitious are gone in this time some risk are taken to do better for own life . also we can be much more successful than past . secondly , try new thing can be difficult for some people , but somethings are not known when they are not trying . maybe failure can be waiting to u , but it is not an important , if galio or ainstein did not try , today we do not know science a now . all the thing i mentioned above , i completely agree with this term . successful people try new thing they do not afraid , sometimes they take risk . however , others are always afraid or because of the some responsibility such a family , child , they do not try . at the end success is not always coming with trying , but at least we would try and we would learn .
