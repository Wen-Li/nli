i do not agree with the statement that young people enjoy life more than older people do . rather , i would suggest whether people can enjoy life is dependable to their belief and it is not related to their age . let me define what meaning of enjoy life is . to me , enjoying life mean that we should learn from each other , humble otherselves , be interested in relationship . moreover , we should learn to understand ourselves - our character , reaction , etc and utilize , share and enjoy what we have to one another . firstly , if we are humbling ourselves , it would make u easily learn from each other because we would not look down upon the others . it could prevent from self-fishness . for example , there are many war nowadays and most likely , the cause is that we are doing thing out of pride ( i.e. , not humbling ourselves ) and we are not thinking from the others ' perspective . with war and conflict , how can we enjoy life in an easier way ? however , if we learn to humble ourselves , we would know how to express love to each other and we would feel joy to be loved and love another . there would not be so many war and conflict such that we would easily enjoy the life . most importantly , being in a position of being loved is amazing . if you have felt in such a state , you would know that having such a joy in your heart would be called enjoying life . secondly , if we would learn to understand ourselves and others from time to time , we would feel amazed how we are created in such a wonderful , creative and unique way . for example , you can not imagine how our eye can view such a complicated object . i.e. , with reflecting the light , we would know how dark the object is . we can find not only the appearance but also the character . for example , there are some child who are extremely interested to talk with people while there are some child who are extremely interested in thinking . with learning ourselves and the others , we would easily feel amazed how it could be very complicated and very unique . with searching this kind of knowledge and love , we would also feel joy in our heart that through the joy , we would enjoy our life . finally , feeling beloved is easily understandable to have joy . how could it be possible if all of u are just willing to be loved ? hence , it is easily to be confused that loving and share with others would not contribute to joy . selffishness would be . however , it is not the case . while learning to understand others and humble ourselves , it is so natural to share with others with what we have . for example , if we are keen on hiking , it is so joyful to help others to hike with u through the difficulities . though it seems that it is difficult , the final achievement through toughship could bring u to have joy with one another . it is just like that a couple could feel very warm when they can share their life with one another . hence , loving another could let u enjoy one and another and it would finish the cycle of love and being loved . in conclusion , if we can follow a good belief , we could learn to enjoy life easily no matter we are young people or old people .
