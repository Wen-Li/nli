before discussing this statement , we have to think about what `` enjoying life '' mean . it could be simply `` having fun . '' if it is the case , we have to say that young people enjoy life more than older people do . but i want to say that `` enjoying life '' can be attained after we recognize `` the meaning of life . '' when we follow my own definition of `` enjoying life , '' then we can say that old people enjoy life more than younger people do . young people may have fun during their school life by discussing topic that they newly discovered , traveling foreign country or simply going out with friend . however i want to say that these experience would be merely `` fun '' rather than enjoying life . because `` life '' is such a serious thing , it will take time for young people to recognize the meaning of life . also , young people are busy and poor . they have too much thing to do to prepare for the future . they do n't have enough money to spend to enjoy . older people , on the other hand , through their abundant experience , would get their own idea of `` life . '' only after they have some idea of life , they will think about what would enjoying their life mean . it could be helping others , reading book and discus about , or travel to diffenent country . but their experience would not merely fun . we could say these experience are `` enjoying life . '' facinating thing for older people would be that they have time and money to spend for enjoying their life . as a conclusion , i would like to say that old people enjoy life more than younger people do . so i disagree with the statement .
