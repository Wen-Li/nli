the issue at hand is chosing weather young people enjoy their life more than old people or not . i think that the answer to this question is obvious , the young people enjoy their life much more than old people for four main reason ; young people can go to to entertainment place , they have a lot of friend , they can be hierd easily anywere , and they are not counting down for their life to end . young people can go to different entertaining place and have fun in their life , they can go to party any time they want , they can do most of the sport the want to do , even the hardest thing such a climbing on mountain , or sky diving . however the old people can not get the entertainement the want wheever they want , that is because of many reason , first thing they can not go to party because it is not appropreate for them to go there . also old people can not play all sport they want to play , and that is because their body are not able to play these game , for example an old man can not go skydiving . young people can easily get new friend whenever they want , and that is beside their `` living friend '' , so they will enjoy having friend , and they can even do anything thay want to do with them . on the other hand the old people face hardness in meeting with new people , and also we can assume that many of their old friend are dying or will die . youth can get most of the job , even employer usually are looking for youth not old people to hire , and so all of the youth can get the job they like and enjoy them . but the old people can not get the job the want , and most of them can not get any job , simply because they are retierd , and if they got a job usually it would be a boaring enterprenural job with no peer to have fun with . finally youth can enjoy their life much more thn old people that is because the do not have to worry that they are going to die any tiem , but old people are fearing from the moment they will die . in a conclusion , youth have much more fun in their life than old prople do , and that because young people have the opportunity to see life .
