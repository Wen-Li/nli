successful people try new thing and take risk rather than doing what they already know is very precise and exact on it part . because a successful person is very ambitious and intrepid . he is full of spirit and ready to face any type of struggle or danger in any face of his life . they have a innate quality to invent new thing and generate new idea . it doe not that successful people dont face failure in their life . but the fact is that they are not like other common people who lose their strength and determination in any part of difficulty . but rather they are people who spend their life only to face challenge and danger . they follow on the principle `` failure is the stepping stone to success '' .doing only the thing which you are confined to or which you know how to do well is very common and usual which can be done by anybody . the point lie in doing something different from others . there are certain example showing how successful people are different from the common individual . firstly , issac newton is the one who had invented the bulb and due to his contribution we are now in this time are available with energy source else no source wa available to u for lightening . secondly , there are many freedom fighter responsible for the freedom of india like mahatama gandhi , rani laxmi bai , subhash chandra bose and etc . , . without their help and contribution it wa very difficult to achieve the freedom . thirdly , scientist invent new thing and provide u with innovative idea so a to make u aware of the fact which are not known to u . ofcourse they face many failure in this course but they continue to work hard so to achieve their goal . if they will not work like this then we will be unaware of many fact which and will be left . so , a successful person doe not care of the negative impact on it finding or work but continue to sustain in field of various irresistable crushing force to fullfil the demand they want to acquire and to reach the acme of any enigma .
