i certainly agree with that statement . in my opinion this is due to a common sense of selfishness that is so widespread in young people . only a few teenager spend their free time in rewardable activity , such a driving ambulance or helping blind . the others , the biggest part , think that only enjoyment ha importance in thier single life . so the key phrase is enjoy yourself and do n't care of anyone . this is so wrong : if you always think to youself , you will never note how the world need your help . you can give your contribute only with a simple deed and with a simple attention towards who is suffering or is asking your help . at this common sense contribute the bad example that television and internet give : almost every famous person s only interested to go to the party , to have vacation in wonderful place , .. about my personal experience i can say i have never helped my community . in part , this is due to my past and present involving in study but also in sport activity . in my normal day i have to stay up to 8 hour to the university and then i have to train myself in my favourite sport , the taekwondo . when i come back home i neither can watch the tv without sleeping in front of it . honestly i also must come clean that i am really really lazy . in fact i desrcribed above not my life in the weekend , but also during the weeek . if i could , i would help my comunity in the weekend like some friend of mine do . but , on friday and saturday evening , i want to enjoy myself until the earlier hour in the day . this implies that i am too tired on sunday for help my community taking , for example , dinner or lunch to old people who can not move from their home
