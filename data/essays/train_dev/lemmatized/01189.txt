`` half knowledge is always more harmfull then not getting it at all . '' it is always important to understand idea and concept rather than learning from the fact . however one can always support idea with the fact and figure of day today life . for a student the more knowledge one get , the more beneficial it is . if everyone will start practicing learning through fact then there wo n't be any room for the reserch to take place and people will stop showing interest towards the innovation and new thing . for example the fact is that a school bus fetch kid from school to home whereas the idea and concept behind is to make their journey more comfortable , safe and enjoyable . understanding a subject in the depth is the basis of getting knowledge about it . it always good to support your idea with a fact but if the knowledge is totally based on the fact , then one ha to make sure that it is complete and accurate when my mother inlaw got admitted to the hospital every one knew that he ha gone through a massive heart attack and the underline fact that everyone wa stating wa that she is old enough to survive . me and my husband were more interested in knowing that how to take better care of her so that she should not have much complication afterwards , so the doctor took time out to explain u that how heart work in a human body . the impact of fat rich diet on blood vessel and heart and which may lead to the process of atherosclerosis , how heart ha to do more work . after getting the concept cleared on the same , i think both of u are in a better position to take care of her and to discus this topic with her and our family . i strongly feel that it is important for student to understand idea and concept and it always advantageous to learn fact about the same so a combination of both is important
