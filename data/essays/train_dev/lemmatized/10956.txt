i agree with the statement young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their community . young people of this modern world do not care about the community around them and being a human being it is our prime responsibility to help the community . as man is a social animal he try to live in a society and mingle with the rule in a society . the young people nowadays have changed a lot due to the freedom given to them and independence to do any thing they wish to do , the young people are least bothered about their community . instead of helping the community when they are free they go out and have party with friend . the young people are given the financial freedom by their parent to such an extent that they even never bother about their parent a well a community either . moreover all the youngster are not alike , some people are busy in their study and job and they do not have much time even in spending with their family and also with their community either . so they will be unable to give enough time for their community . the young people nowadays do not try to take any responsibility which they think are not necessary . the young people more often think that it is not necessary for them to help their community and go out and enjoy with their friend when ever they have some free time . nowadays the young people are interested more in refreshment they are required from their daily routine work and get relieved from their responsibility instead of helping their community . in contrast some of the young people inspite of their busy schedule find some time to help the community and they fell that helping their community brings a change in their routine work . this is the case of few people who still fell their moral responsibility of helping , where a most of the young people nowadays fell no responsibility about their community . some of the young people are only concerned with their job and their family and nothing else . so young people must soma have find time to help their community .
