i strongly believe that each subject you learn ha a long lasting contribution on your life and on your personality . my dream is to learn and know everything in order to bring myself to the fullest potential , the question is : is that possible ? in fact , it is not ! our life is too small for acieving a dream like mine with all the other issue surrounding u and need our care and time . furthermore , different subject may not always be in the same field , e.g : physics which is an essential subject in the science field doe not match history - a part of the humanity family . in conclusion it is better for u and for our precious world and time to take a one way decision that we will take for our future according to our personality , self image , tendincies , capability and all the other requested needed information . specializing in one acadimic field and not subject is the most essential for me , for instance : if i chose a way that is most suitable for me and wish to pas it then i have to take a look on all the subway and instruction and neither pas it straightly nor blindly . i other word if i chose to specialize in aerospace engineering then i must have a wide look on the other branch like physic , chimistry , mathematics ... at last i want to point that this section of argument is so wide and complicated but virtual , what happens in the real world is that we go with the river , we finish our school with an unefficient material , register for the university with no clear image to all the field that may fit u and then ... then we are in the hand of distiny .
