i strongly agree on the statement that young people are enjoying there life than older once . as per the changing of the time the people have to change . in the older day there were be certain restriction given to stop thing tobe done which give lot of happiness . consider the situation of my parent . they have certain to point out , many restriction over there life 's . the education what my grandfather insist to study , my father continued . but it is different in my condition , i have my own view to which i can and i do probably . in the same way many case , consider another example in which older peole are not that much free to their child , a the thing they missed lot of thing to share to their parent for example some college situation . but the child now are enjoying each and every moment of their college life with their co-students and sharing the thing to parent and commenting . and the other more is improvement of technology . in olden day there were not any amusement park , recreation club , theatre and stuff like that . but the improvement of technology gave lot of fun over life . the younger people are able to enjoy themselves by going to park , recreation club , party along with friend and tour . and the tour will give lot of fun along with the information about the place where people are going . in this way i can give the example like this to tell many thing and the young people are having the ability to do there thing of their own with fun , but previously people have to depend on some one to complete any work which they want to do . so i strongly agree with the statement that younger people enjoy life more than older people do .
