i agree with the following statement because maybe people try new thing because they 're bored with the normal life they have , thats why they decide to take chance and try new thing , take riks because they may know that if they dont do it correctly they can try it again , because they think they will gain a feeling of power and selfness , they are bored and they know that by doing something new and risking it while knowing they may have nothing to lose , for example a millionaire who ha a a computer company and kows that he make more money a year than a chain of restaurant owner , and suddenly decides to try and take the risk of opening his own restaurant he ha to know that at his own risk he could be looking at failure , but if he ha a lot of money he wont have a problem because he could find out what he 's doing wrong and try to correct it with advice from professional , at the risk of not having to face failure , he could also invest it in other kind of business , and guarantee that if he a successful person at what he doe , he might think that he would also be good at what he trying , people often want to change thing they do because a i said before they get bored , they want to try out new thing , because they also think that with all the success they have gained , they could really do what ever they wish , but being successful really doesnt mean that you can be successful at anything you do , but i definately agree , because life wa made for taking chance and if they want to try something new , the should take the risk maybe they will succeed of maybe they wont , but anyway they know that if something go wrong , they could also return to the thing the allready know how to do .
