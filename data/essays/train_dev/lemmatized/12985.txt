i srongly agree with the statement that most advertisement make product seem much better then they really are because i think in some case this is the basic purpose of the advertisement . there are several example to justify this statement . firstly take the example of shampoos , now a day everybody ha the problem of le hair and falling hair . in the market you can find a large number of shampoo that will help you in reducing the problem . in that case the advertisement will gave you the idea of which shampoo you should buy . a well directed advertisement in which a girl is having le hair started using the product x regained hair by using it for say 14 day , this kind of advertisement will provoke you to buy the same product but the reality behind it may be different . only after using it you will came across the actuality . the advertisement main aim is to attract more and more customer and it doe not to give the real information all the time . its the case in most type of cosmetic too . second take the example of yogurts , or any other food product , if you see any thing in the advertisement then you will surely try to buy the same thing because you would be curious of know whether the product doe the same a shown in the advertisement , but my personal experience suggests that the advertisement are the ostentacious presentation in case of most of the thing . they are not what they look in advertisement . finally i believe that if you take the example of politician you will find that in order to grab maximum vote they present themselves to be most promising among all others , nobody will show himself a a demagogue , so basically the purpose of advertisement is to make everything look perfect which could be far behind the reality . to sum up i can say that in most of the case the real purpose of the advertisement is to make product look good , beneficial and worth buying .
