i agree with the statement that indicates that young people enjoy life more than older people do . there are several reason taken both from my life and my environment , which i will cover in the following paragraph . firstly and maybe most importantly , the main affect that make people enjoy life le is the obligation of working . people who do not work for their , say , first 21 year of their life suddenly face with a harsh professional working environment . it may include a low salary , hard working condition or the lack of holiday . working everyday from early morning to evening ( or even night ! ) consumes all the energy of the body and leaf nothing else to do in the limited time left to live your own life . especially , if you do not have the job of your dream ( much-paying and less-working ) , everyday would be a nightmare . it is never like the good old day you had before , when only 20 hour of lecture and some studying were sufficient to pas the course and have much time to enjoy in the university campus . responsibilities are another factor . it also includes the professional life . but there are other aspect too , like the effort needed to form and run a family . having child bring joy to life for sure , but greater responsibility ; such a the education of the child , having to face almost impossible-to-handle situation , are factor that make the life taste bitter . finally , health-related issue are a big part of the deal . the difficult life condition mentioned above bring other unwanted guest which are also known a illness . the mother nature also help these guest , a we all know that the resistance to unwanted situation of a living creature decrease a the time proceeds . there would be exception to what i mentioned before . working child , unhealthy-born baby or improving ability to taste life with the gained experience etc . .. but still , i do not believe that they are enough to overcome the fact that being young feel great .
