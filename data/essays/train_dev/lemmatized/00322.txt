i think that this statement is a real view of the today 's life of the young people and not only . because the first reason for this problem is that today , young people have not too many time to stay with their really friend and so do n't have time to help a community . today this boy have always the same size of work at home for the school assignment , but when this is finished , they start to play with the computer or to do something of similar . in this situation they have only a few time to try to help a community , but in this time they think to other thing . this community , i think that may be helped by everybody , also in dayly life but with the today 's life , with only the money at the center of everything , only few people there is that think to them . now , infact , there is changing in the life not only of young people , the dayly work is different also for the time that it had in a day , with a lot of people working from the early morning to the start of evening , so they may try to help the community only in the weekend if they do n't work . but the family in the weekend try to do something together . so with all this changing that there is in the dayly life of everybody , young or not , it is difficult to improve this sector of the world . also i do n't give enought time to helping my community , and i know this . but i had not too time today to support this and i hope that there will be some change in the life , to give some importance also to this sector .
