i definitely disagree with it . for the most people , youth is not a time for personal enjoyment for one 's life but a period to thrive themselves desperately to accomplish stability in their later life . in today , almost every country in the world ha a system of capitalism . as we know , a society can never make the fair distribution of wealth under this system . of course , some people might can acieve stability by getting money or fame earlier than others , but they can also lose this easily by various unlucky event . also , many young people ( usually teenager ) have many limit on enjoying their life . for instance , they can neither smoke nor drink , they have to follow their school 's order a a student , and they are forced to learn more and more which they regard a an unnecessary thing . increase of population give a big impact on this , too . since many young people are thriving to get an accomplishment of their learning , it is impossible for them to compete with each other . increasing population make this tremendously harder .
