i agree with the statement that successful people will defenetly try new thing and take risk due to the following reason . one reason to agree with the above statement is that success is out come of several trail and hard ship , success is result of sweat and labour . one must be ready to face the trouble and hurdle in the way of acheiving success , and more over there is no guarantee that success come from single trail it self . in certain case luck doe not favour u even though we worked hardly to achive our goal , though we trust our hard work and self confidence some time thing go wrong when we were trying to achieve success by single trail it self . another reason why successful people take risk and try new thing is to gain new experience from challanges and that come to them , they test thier mettle against them and ass themselves whether they will be cope up with that challange or not and judge thier performance against new problem and chalanges they faced in thier life . more over the imporatnt lesson one can learn from trying out new thing and taking risk is that gaining experince and paractical knowledge from past failure and it out come . with this practical knowledge he gained he will definitly have a chance to progress in his life . he also gain ample exposure to new thing and new experience . another reason is if we do thing already know how to do well we can attain perfection in that field but we are not up to the mark when we face new thing and new challanges , so it is better to try new thing all over our life , finally it can be better illustrated with an example by considering an employee in an organization , if the employee do the thing he already done , he attains perfection but when he wa given a new work to do or he attains new position , definitly he wiil struggle while adapting to the new situation . with this factor i conclude my essay
