i think that it depends on what is the field of the academic subject you are studying . if the acadmic subject is about science or other similar subject which need some professional knowledge , that will need to specialize in the specific subject . if the academic subject is about education , bussiness or other similar subject , that will need to have broad knowledge of many academic subject . in my concentration , education , i think i need the broad knowledge of academic subject . to have broad knowledge of a lot of subject is very important in studying education . teaching ha a lot of work to do . if you want to make the learner understand what you are talking about , you will need to explain . but if you know le , how can you make your learner understand what you want to talk about ? the only way to solve the problem is to try to explain in many different way untill your learner can know what you are talking about . that is why you need to have broad knowledge . because when you know more , you can teach more and you can make more people understand what you want to talk about . in other hand , if your subject is in those subject which need professional knowledge , it is better to speclialize in one specific subject . take science a an example : if you are studying the molecular biology , you need many professional knowledge about biochemistry or molecular biology . if you can know more , you will study more . that will need more specific knowledge to make you learn more . that is the reason you need to keep on studying specific knowledge . to get the conclusion , my opinion of this topic is that it depends on what kind of subject you are studying . if the subject you are studying need to explain or combine other knowledge , you will need to learn more from other subject . but if your subject need the professional knowledge , you would better to keep on studying more in your specific knowledge . that is the only way to help to learn more and better .
