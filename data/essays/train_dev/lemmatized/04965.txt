in the world there are people with different behaviour , tradition and way of think . moreover there are people more or le rich and the statement young people enjoy life more than older people is not always true above all for the african , asian and south american people where young people are like older people because they are in a difficult situation and they must work . i live in italy and i see that in europe the situation is different because youg people have parets with a secure work so boy like me can live a beutiful life while older people like my parent can work for me . i think that older people live in different way respect youg people so they enjoy life in other thing .
