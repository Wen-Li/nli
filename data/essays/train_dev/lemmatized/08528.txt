today we can see on television many kind of advertisement . these kind can attract our attention or not . many time television 's advertisement attract my attention about some product that really are not interesting for me . but the scatch and the music are made so carefully that i ca n't refuse to watch them . these advertisement attract so much my attention that i want immediately to buy that product also if it doe n't is usefull for me really . only after i understand that the product is not how i imagined it watching it on television , but it 's really different . for example when i saw a really beautiful advertisement of a watch on tv , i immediately went to buy it . but when i took it in my hand , it looked really different from the watch i saw on television and i wa not so happy to have bought it a i thought . so i understood that what i liked wa not the object watched on tv , but his advertisement . some other advertisement are not so good and often , when they pas on television , i do n't watch them very well . but often these advertisement present an object that is much better than the one well presented on tv . for example i never paid attention to a particular pair of jean that often i watch on tv ; the advertisement wa not really good and so it never took my attention . but when i went to buy a pair of jean , after i tried many pair of them , i bought the pair of jean i saw on television that never paid my attention . it wa really confortable and i liked it . so i agree with this statement because many time what seems to be good on television is not really so , while what on tv seems not so interesting perhaps it can be good and can like me when i see it in my hand .
