as a mater of fact , the issue of whether there will be fewer car than there are today is a complex one , requiring subjective judgment . different people hold different view due to their distinct background . therefore , there are no easy or certain answer to the question and final answer would rely on my own experiencr and personality . i do agree with the statement that in twenty year there will be fewer car in use than there are today . in the following discussion , i would develop my poins of view and constitute aspect of detail a sufficient a possible . in the first place , the most important reason that i can not ignore is that nowaday , people have realize that the car will produce seriously air pollution and this situation ha became a big issue around the world . to illustrate , it is apparent that air pollution ha rais the attention of the global citizen and the most effective way to solute this problem is to decrease car in use . in the second place , another reason for my statement is that the oil price would be more expensive twenty year than today . the amount of the oil will decrease but the demand of the oil will remain the same even increase . therefore , there will be ferwer car in use because only a very small portion of people who might be very rich can afford the price . last but not least , i believe that people will use mrt a their transportation in the future because mrt is not only convenient but also in a reasonable price that everyone can afford it . therefore , there will be no need to buy a car a transportation . to sum up , the air pollution cause by car and high price of oil made me agree with the statement that there will be fewer car in use in twenty year than there are today .
