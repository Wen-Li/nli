nowaday , rich and poor gap in the society is getting wider and wider in around of the world . i agree with this statement that successful people try new thing and take risk rather that only doing what they already know how to do well . there are several reason for it . first , people who work on doing what they already known how to do well could get uniform money and can be succesful people a well but i think it is not really successful people . i think real successful people is a peson who made huge money and everyone would agree that person is successful person . second , it could be risky but try new thing is more chance to be successful people . for example , bill gates , he wa a normal bussiness man with normal salary . but he tried new thing to earn more money to be a successful people by making the first computer and the micro-software . by this product , bill gates made huge effect on information technology to the world and earn ton of money . from tho reason , i think people should take risk and try new thing to be successful people .
