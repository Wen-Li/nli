i do not agree with the statement that successful people try new thing and take risk rather than only doing what they already know to do well . to my mind , it is true that successful people are willing to take risk , but i think that they balance out advantage and disadvantage of an occasion better than people who are not a successful . they apply their knowlege to the topical situation and know how to cope with it . most likely successful people have had many experience and thus have learned when they can take risk and when it is too dangerous . stereotypically , successful people are wealthy and thus have to consider their capital . as a contrast to these people , i think that people who are not a successful are willing to take more risk , in order to become successful because to their mind it might be their last chance to reach what they have worked for . in my opinion , they do not have to care a much about any disadvantage or about the risk certain step bring along . they do not have a much to loose a very successful people . however , there is another group of successful people : the successful people who only see the money , the success and the fame and therefore take any risk without considering negative effect . they are willing to risk a good working climate and even friendship to become more and more successful . these carrierists are very ambitious and most likely very egoistic , too . they just see the benefit for themselves and do not care about anybody else . to my mind one can not divide people in risk taking successful people and careful non successful people . it always depends on the situation they face . if it is someone 's last chance to rescue a company , even the most careful successful person might consider taking the risk . and on the other hand a non successful person might not take a risk because of any consequence , even if there is not a much to loose .
