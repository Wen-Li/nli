ideas create imagination , create creativity , create an independent perspective . the human mind is more likely adaptive to an idea than a fact . so , i agree with the statement `` it is important for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact '' first of all , i would like to present a description of what idea and fact are ? ideas are the outcome of the human enthusiastic and exemplary brain processing , on the other hand fact are mere proved and universally accepted theory , led by the various and respected scientist , biologist , academician , and philosopher . conceptualised thought and idea present an organised and extra ordinary image of the brain working with the human sens proving to be equally creative . ideas produce imagination , which on a more groomed level arise creativity in an individual . ideas create history , innovation . concepts and idea combined create new invention while fact are confined to what they mean . their is also liberality in extending an idea and concept . for example the revolutuionaries and celebrity like mahatma gandhi , martin luther king , mother theresa , nelson mandela and not to forget the great adolf hitler , never relied on fact for getting a mass historical transformation and revolution , rather they all used their experienced and practical idea to implement and bring change at the global level . ideas , though can be percieved in different way . for a student , i think ,, the most important way to relate to different aspect of his career is through his reasoning ability and logical interpretation which are enhanced outcome of the basic idea he or she cling on to . students , in the contemporary world like to be independent , practical and solution oriented . hence at time fact can help them by proving informative and a short cut to major solution but finally , it the idea which help a student in his or her long term accomplishment . an idea repetitively creates an ability to think beyond certain limit , imbibing certain aspiration in a student . to fulfill these creative and practical idea and to implement them in his or her daily life , he or she can reach to greater height of success . this mentioned success can be through an artistic idea , a technological idea , a philosophic idea , a mythical idea , or any creative instinct based idea . so , concuding i strongly believe that an idea or a concept brings out that extraordinary individual in a student which a proof dependent fact can not .
