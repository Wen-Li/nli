in my opinion , having broad knowledge of many academic subject is more important than specializing in one specific subject . in other word , i think one should do the former first , then do the later . from my experience , i insist like that and i can explain more detail . first , we can easily find the good example through the system of education . you enter elementary school and start to study there . following middle and high school , you may learn various thing thourghout many kind of subject . after that , you could find your specific talent or concern , dedicate yourself on that . it mean learning basic and common thing first , and then concentrate something special chosen after that . second , it 's my regretful story . i neglected studying when i wa high school student . as a result of that , i selected wrong major which wa mechanical engineering for bacholar 's degree . anyway now i become military officer and prepare to enter into post graduate school public policy majored . i could say this route is paved way . if i had been diligent to learn many academic thing when i wa in high school , i could have found right specific subject for me and followed the shortest and effective way to be myself of nowadays . lastly , specializing early may make one be partial . as balanced nutrition is very important to toddler , balanced learning to youth . if one go into specific thing too early , of course she know very much about her subject but not about other thing . it can make her concentrate more to the specific , neglect more to all the rest . it mean unbalance . so she may have the limit even on her subject a a result of partiality . people say that reading is food of mind . as you know reading is main method we can get the knowledge . so it is very important to get nutritiants balanced . when we feel like healthy a growing good balanced with knowledge from various part , it 's the very time to select the specific for u .
