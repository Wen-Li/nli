it 's very difficult to state if it is better to have a deep specialization in a certain subject or instead to have a broad but more superficial academic knowledge . reasons for mantaining both position are several . having a complete knowledge of a subject may bring to a full comprehension of what is under it . it involves understanding cause and consequence of all principle included . for this reason i think this kind of high quality specific culture may be very useful for investigation . research program take advantage from people that have specific competence about the research objective . and it is surely from this people that further developements can come . moreover , i think that a strong competence on a subject may be a great personal satisfaction . knowing everything about a process or a specific matter would certainly create a deep satisfaction in a person , that in a certain way pay him back of all the effort made in achieving it . on the other hand , i think that a broad culture brings much more satisfaction to whom hold it . it may be true that having many competence implies not to have very specific concern . but i think that knowing a bit of many thing allows to understand better the world we live in . i mainly think that life is n't all inside a research laboratory , nor all in a university . in my opinion , meeting , exchanging impression and relating with people is one of the most interesting thing to do . having many knowledge allows to stay with everybody , without being exluded from any group . it is true that in this way any subject will be accademically achieved in a complete way . but the essential thing that lack may be aprehended from others . in conclusion , i think that the advantage brought by a deep knowledge of an academic subject are not sufficient to balance the loss of many interest that this achievement would imply . spending the same amount of time , a person who go too deep into a subject experience a loss , due to the many other thing he or she could have studied .
