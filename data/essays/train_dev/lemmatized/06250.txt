we all love advertisement . one the one hand woman like the nice jean advertisement guy , on the other hand men like underwear model in the same way or even more . but , are we really influenced by advertisement ? do they really make u feel that some product are better . in fact , do we really taste mcdonald 's in another way if we have seen an advertisement before . do we really feel better if we drive a bmw x5 , which is delivered fresh from the enterprise in munich ! i 'm of the opinion : it depends ! refering to the two example from the introduction , i want to explain why i think , that it depends if advertisement make product seem better : firstly , i want do deal with the mcdonalds example . i claim , that we do not taste a big mac in another way if we see an advertisement . the reason is that you feel or taste food and thing like shoe or other thing that relate to your body . consequently , i think you can not betray your body . indeed , i believe you can do it for a short period of time , but if you bought the wrong size of a pair of shoe you will have to confess to yourself after a certain time that it wa a wrong buy . i think eveybody of u ha bought at least one time shoe or a pair of jean which did not fit , but we wanted to say to ourselves they are just perfect ! on the contrary , i claim that if you buy a car , advertisement make it seem better . just think about the nice winter landscape , the car drive with his four wheel system through the snow like it would be a normal street . you would love to say that this is your car . in fact , i learned at the univerity , that especially car manufacturer are often placing ad in newspaper and television , just to make their buyer secure they did the right thing . hence , car manufacturer do exactly what is stated in the question of this essay : they try to make a product seem better through an advertisment . also of my own experience , i can say i have experienced that a product get better through an advertisement . everywhere on the university are ad of ibm , and i glad i have an ibm laptop , because otherwise , i would ever feel like i have a bad pc , because nowhere is an ad of it . to conclude , i want to summarize my opinion . an ad just can make a product better if it doe n't harm yourself in a way . all personally related product can only be made better for a short time period , whereas other , just technical thing , like car , video game or even a microwave can be made better through an advertisement .
