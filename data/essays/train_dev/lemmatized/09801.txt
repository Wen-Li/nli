in television , paper and magazine a lot of people discus , how our street will look in twenty year . a lot of these discussion focus on the amount of car . reasons for this discussion are the change energy supply and the pollution problem . the main reason , why there might be le car , is that the petroleum resource are decreasing . some expert say they only last about ten year . another reason might be the increasing pollution . politicans might introduce stronger law or raise the tax on fuel to reduce the pollution . this could result in a decreasing amount of car . a seldom focused reason migth be : several people are going to share one car . this development can already be seen in germany . in the last year the amount of car shareing station ha raised . a raisuig usage of public transportation might also decrease the amount of car . on the other side , there are a lot of reason why the amount of car will not decrease . the amount of car ha been raising through the last century and this trend may continue . there are also a lot of new engine techniks . these techniks allow car be driven with solar power or hydrogen . these resource are not expected the be lass availible . even an combination of an fuel engine and these techniks is possible . so the amount of car will be constant , because the price for these new technology will fall . i think , the amount of car will not fall . there will be difference in the type of car . i think the car will need le energy and produce le pollution the current car . but since the car always ha been a status symbol , a lot of people will want a car . the public transportation will not have an big rule in the future , because most goverments do n't have enough money to support this .
