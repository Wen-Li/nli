i strongly subscribe to the statement and support the thought that , in twenty year there will be fewer car in use than there are today . the reason that i agree with this statement are detailed in the following passage . in recent year , improvement in manufacturing techonology ha ushured a hoard of car manufacturing company . for example , economically and technologically developed country , like the united states of america , have witnessed a growing automobile industry in the late 1980s . this growth in the automobile industry linked with increased consumer spending power and lower interest rate on loan resulted in million of car being produced and sold yearly . further , globalisation ha spread this market worldwide and the recent asian development ha seen addition of more car to the already large number . however , this growth come with a debilitating factor . earth ha a constant pool of resource , which all human have to share . due the sharp growth in the number of car and other transportation mode , the petroleum resource are under great stress . there ha been great emphasis on alternate fuel source and transportation mode . many company and goverments have initiated technology program seek solution to the current problem . as the old saying go , `` necessity is the mother of all invetions '' , humanity will be able to surface above this problem with ingenuity and innovation . there are effort already in the direction of mass air transportation system which would make car redundant . new energy source have been discovered to support air transportation , and corporation such a airbus are already dreaming of providing individalistic air trasport solution . this would greatly improve transportation speed and availability . in conclusion , i would like to use example from the great visionary of science fiction , arthur c. clarke , who said that there shall be personalized air/space travel module avaible by the third millenium , and we would n't waste time building road through air for our car ! and hence , there shall be no need for car in twenty year from now .
