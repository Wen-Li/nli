i think education is a combination between the understanding of concept and the learning of fact . concepts are important in the way they are the essence of the knowledge that the teacher need to transmit to the student . they are the structure , to built that strong construction that support all the academic task . without concept we will live in a world that doe n't worry and take the time to penetrate the deepest part of the understandiyng and mental capacity . sometimes education can turned to square and bored the learner , because everything is about idea and how to get them . to pill the onion or to get to the center of the point , we need detail , little fact that decorate our life and the way we learn to see and understand the universe . good educator are the one that can awake their studendts throught a simple fact a a date o a number ( that can be eassily fogotten ) using it a door to walk and search into an unknown universe full of posibilities that let her/him to understand the idea that once we introduced we never forget . it is like a game . when we play to find the treasure we can not forget our objective , but we have to be carefull of the fact and the extra information that we can collect during the search . the middle way is the best way to educate and help student to understand different discipline from mathematics to art , because is the perfect combination between body and what is inside it . when we fallow thios way we find the gold , the wisdom .
