i disagree it is more important for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact . facts have more verious phononems and interested for student to understand . it is more interesting to see the fact than just memorize the idea and the concept . people are more likely to see the phononems than to read a book . for example , in a chemistry class , if the teacher intend to show the reaction in front of the students. , what will they do ? they prefer to do the experiment more than just talk about it and let the student to image . it is the easiler way to show the process of the reaction , like the color , sound , smell . also , it ha the variaty of the fact which can attract the student attention . if a teacher do not use the fact in class , the student maight feel tedious and boring to listen . at that time , they will move their attetion to another thing . thay will cause bad effect to undetstand the knowledge . in conclusion , it is interesting to use fact more than memorize . it is also a good way to help the student to remember the mathod by prove it through the fact . sometimes people maight not understand what the teacher are talking about in class . they need a better inprovement to improve them understand . for example , the student may not understand what is the wave like . because of wave is not seen by people , it do not have the color , smelt and sound . at this time , if the teacher use a fact which is like put the method into a experiment . the teacher can show the wave by press the water and the student can see what is the water wave like . that is why the fact have the better way to make the student understand . in conslusion , using more fact are not only interested but more easier to help the student to understand than just read idea and concept .
