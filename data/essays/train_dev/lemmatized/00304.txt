everybody could tell you this : young people enjoy life whereas older people do n't . to me , it ca n't be absolute , for several reason . first , we know that young people know how to have fun . they always go out with friend , they always laugh ( most of time for nothing ) ... older people do n't know it . they used to know but now they are adult and adult have a lot of responsibility , adult always think about their work , adult always worry about everything ,,, and when they are older , they worry about death and always talk about when they were young , when they knew how to enjoy life ! we also could say that young people enjoy life because they do n't think about the future , they seize the day . . that 's true but older people , if they like to plan everything can seize the day too . do n't we say that the better time of your life is when you do n't work anymore ? what about these grandfather and these grandmother who travel a lot and begin to live the life they want ? that 's why i think middle aged people are the one who enjoy life the least . they have too much thing not to forget , too much thing to do , too much thing to care about . . young peole enjoy life because they have nothing to think about ! they go to school , go out with their friend , have complicated relationship with their boyfriend and girlfriend and that 's all . . ok , they have to do some homework , but that 's not a horrible life . they enjoy life because their life is perfect ! to finish , i would say that although they have a perfect life most of young people do n't really enjoy life . adolescents are always in a bad mood , they complain everytime , they always disagree with you , but what they do the best is `` to not care '' . but older people , even if they have a quite more difficult life , know the value of life .
