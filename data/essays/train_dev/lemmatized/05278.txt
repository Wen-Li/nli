i agree with it . when i wa young , i did not give my time to helping my community . becouse my community did not need not only me but also my friend . and i did not know how to help my community . even now i do not know . of course i did clean my town , but my porpse wa not to help my community but to talk with my friend . and i sometimes helped old people with heavy bag . but it wa natural . moreover when i wa about to help with a preparation of my community 's festival with my friend , an adult said to u that you child did not need to help u , went on play . instead of helping my community , i want to play and talk with my friend . i know it is important to communicate with my community . but i do not care about my neighboor . anyway my community consists of old people without young people . if i get older , i will give time to my community . but young people should spend their time to do whatever they want to do , for example studying , trip . they are better for young people .
