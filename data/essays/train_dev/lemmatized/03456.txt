i agree with this statement because i think that a person who ha a different specialization can be help in his / he professional carrer . in fact we can understand how difficult is to found a job and for this reason i think that a person who is able to do a lot of thing ha some facilitation . economy and work want that a person is a good worker , with different experience . as the matter of fact my opinion is n't correct , in fact i undestand that it is important also that a person is able to do his/her work in a good way and this is possible also if that person is specialized in a particular field . for all these reason i think that it is important to have different specialization when a person is looking for a job , but , when he/she found it , she/he must specialize in his/her own work . sometimes it is not requested a licence in a particular field . a simple course can help you to found a job . so i think that it is important to know different subject , but this knowing ha importance if it is specialized .
