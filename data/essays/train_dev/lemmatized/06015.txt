generally speaking , i think i may agree with this statement . that being said i also think that this is not a rule . in business , large success are often due to the fact that the entrepreneur take big risk trying to break through new market . once you 've conquered a new market you have virtually no concurrency , and that make you succeed in your business . the same may happen with new idea that improve a product already existing . in music , trying new way , using diverse and differt instrument may open up new world and new possibility . it may help you find unheard tune . back in history there are many example on how , people that took risk then have succeed in their profession . every discovery mankind ha done , is due to someone who took the risk . america is this way because someone ( namely columbus ) had the courage to sail the sea . the same can be said for technology or medicine innovation . in general , taking risk , experimenting , brings mankind to a new level of knowledge that can better his life . at the beginnig of this essay i wrote that i agree with the statement but that it 's not the rule . i mean , with that , that everything depends on what one considers a `` being successful '' . obviously if you do n't take risk is going to be hard for you to succeed but at the same time is not said that taking risk is the only way to succeed . you can be good at what you do and have success in your life or you can have just an avarage job but a nice family with wonderful kid and consider that the biggest success ever .
