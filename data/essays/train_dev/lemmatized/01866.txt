what is the purpose of advertising ? selling . can you sell a bad looking product ? definately not . to sell , you need to make your product look good or even beter than it really is . that my friend , is exactly what advertising doe . if you show bad quality , you 'll be broke . juan perez just opened a burger restaurant . to promote his restaurant , he make t.v. advertising , on which he show he 's burger . the burger are totally nutritive , but their their look make people think they are disgusting . evem though the burger are very rich en vitamin and protein , nobody buy them . finally , juan go to bankruptcy on his restaurant . but do n't worry , this case happens in very few advertising . it 's all about the look . company such a mac donald 's , burger king and wendy 's , which sell the same type of product juan did , worry more on the way burger look rather than the way they really are . for example : it is proven that the big mac ha an excessive amount of fat and it is very detrimental for men 's health , nevertheless , when someone watch the tv commercial on which the big mac appears , the first thing that come to his orher mind is `` that burger look good ! '' . the way the big mac is shown ha a huge difference with the way it is in reality . this strategy is done by almost every advertising company in every part of the market , not only food . it is completely obvious that product are need to be shown in an `` almost perfect '' . almost every advertsing company do this because of one single reason : if they do n't , they do not exist . this mean that they will suffer juan 's problem . the principle of advertising is exposing the best part of the product . and if ther is n't , well invent it !
