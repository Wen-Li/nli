i basicly think that young people have enough time to helping their community . it should be understood that the young are the major sector of the community . if the community , for example , offered schooling and public service to the young , then the young would respond and cooperate with their community . they take part in public ceremony , social campaign and many other assisting service . this , of course , would create a mode of trust , confidence and cooperation between the young and the community . generally , the young people are of highly percentage of student and le of worker . in other word , most of them are literate and they recognize the need of their community for them . i really appreciate the young who have a mutual integriation between their effort and the community 's . they form a one body where they find each others ' need , and it help solve their problem and to share the same experience under the same medium . one may wonder where is the young people 's time running out if they do n't give enough time to helping their community . in fact , i do n't find any excuse to secure those who pretend that they have no enough time to be dedicated to their community . actually , living in a community is not a tragedy of the common . benefits must be common among all the young a well a the old . finally , the young people are the core of all community , and the community should serve them and give them the most opprtunities available to develop their skill and potential . in this way , i think , the other side - the young people - will take care of their community and share it experience cooperatively . this woluld make the young give much of their time to helping their community .
