it is a controversial issue whether people should have broad knowledge of many academic subject or specialize in one specific subject . depending on personal experience or pesonality type , some will support the former one , while others will choose the later one . but it is too absolute to say that having broad knowledge of many academic subject is better than specialize in one specific subject . in short , to have broad knowledge of many academic subject ha countless advantage , otherwise , to specialize in one specific subject ha a great number of advantage too . as far a i am concerned , to have broad knowledge of many academic can help you to have a more colorful life than the to specialize in mere one specific subject . some people do not like to focus on one single subject for it is too boring for them to learn due to their own personality . futhermore , to have broad knowledge is the significant skill because all the thing are related . it is much easier for the people to deal with the thing in other field of area . maybe it will help the people to earn more money . though to have broad knowledge ha the many advantage , to specialize in one specific subject also ha great advantage . if people specialize in one specific subject , he or she can learn more about the knowledge and have deeper understanding of the subject he or she concentrate on . there is no doult it will help the people to get a good job in their area . in my point of veiw , either to have broad knowledge of many academic subject or to specialize in one specific subject should be according to the personality of different people . if you can enjoy yourselve in either , this will be the perfect choise you make .
