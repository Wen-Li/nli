in the contemporary world , a new meaning to the word ` time ' is added : ` money` . today 's young people , with the conscience of this reality , think about the most effective way to use their time . money a the root of all evil push today 's young people to research for the way of self-masturbation but not the communities` . the most important fact that can not be denied is that humanity is in the middle of a technological transition . among this transition , every new gadget attracts their attention . a new mp3 player , a new cpu with four chipsets or a new software that allows using the same desktop ; they are stuck in the dream of what is going to come next . because of this kind of innovation , they begin to think in micro instead of macro and they become isolated from their community . this isolation cause to associalism and end by becoming self - centered . when they need help for their own problem , they just have to browse on some online forum and get the answer they need . however , this generalization would not be all accurate . there also exist some situation when young people help their community such a teaching english language and computer utilization to homeless child , organizing visit to old people , cleaning the street of the hood they live in , preparing theatral sketch and concert with the goal of a more compaq gathering . all in all , i do completely agree with the statement because young people nowadays are totally busy because of the obligation of self-improvement . this selfish point of view is the weakness of their relationship with the community and i think that the cause of their organization problem is that they become more individualist . creation of some ` e` - campaign in the name of cultivism , is a must that ha to be done for the future of the community .
