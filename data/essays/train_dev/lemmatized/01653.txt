in my experience , understanding idea and concept are more important than learning fact for student . even student know lot of fact about subject exactly in the book or from other source , it would be nothing if student do n't understand the concept of the idea in the subject . through my experience and from teacher , understanding concpets is more worth than learning fact . for example , when i wa taking international business class , i wa learning about the cycle of stock market that how it worked . before the test of that subject , i memorized all the fact that i learned from a teacher . however , i did n't get good mark on the test because i did n't understand any concept or idea of the cycle of stock market . like this , even the teacher also think that understanding concept of subject are more important than the other thing because if student do n't understand it or not able to apply their idea to the subject , it mean knowledge that student learn from teacher or class are nothing useful . basically , understanding idea are harder than learning or knowing the fact . students could learn the fact easily from the book or other source . on the other hand , understanding concept require lot of reading and understanding what is happening in the subject . therefore , it is not important than to understand concept because they do n't know how they use the concept into the fact that what happens . it implies that understanding just few concept or idea are more worth than knowing every fact . even if you do n't know a lot of fact than the other student , you could possibly guess the fact throught the concept that you understand . due to these reason , i think that it is more important for student to understand the idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact . some people would say that fact are more important than the concept of idea or subject , however , if student are not able to apply the concept or idea of subject into the fact , it mean nothing to study the subject .
