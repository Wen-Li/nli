a lot of young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their community , because thay think that they always have a full timetable . i totally disagree with this statement for two reason . first of all , most young people do not help their community , because they want to avoid the dirty tesk . for example , there is a park near my house . when i wa a child , my friend and i always went to the park to pick up the litter after school . but nowadays most young people think that kind of tesk should belong the pedastrian servents . secondly , most young people spend a lot of time playing the computer game and watching television , so they say that thay do not have time . but in the past . when young people did not have such a variety of recreation , the young people usually did a lot of community service . for example , my mother ha gone to the hospital near her house to be a volunteer for nearly thirty year . thus , the excuse that the young people say that they do not have time is just an another excuse of unwilling . some people may disagree with my pionts , claiming that the young people indeed have other thing to pursue , like the job competition , the pressure of school work . however , i still consider that the young people can squeeze a little time to help their community .
