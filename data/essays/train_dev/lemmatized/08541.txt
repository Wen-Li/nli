i i totally agree with this statement for many reason . firstly , our ailing planet is in a bad state and i think that people will realize that we have to halt destructive pratices . cars emit greenhouse gas which are partly responsibles for pollution and global warming . i believe that government of developped country will carry out measure in order to cut greenhouse gas emission . some say argue that my point of view is not realistic but i think that natural related disaster like drought , coastal flooding caused by a rise in sae level . . .0 will convince people to find alternative energy and way of transportation and use public transportation . i think really that it is possible to sensitive people to environnemt problem . to support my point of view we can cite the exemple of hurricane katrina which ha showed to the wehole word that it is urgent to decrease pollution otherwise we will have serious problem in the future . secondly , on my opinion an increase of oil cost will encourage people to walk or to use public transportation . indeed oil is scarce and it will become more and more difficult to find and extract it . until now , the high prize of oil ha been responsible for some economic crisis . moreover , there are no other energy souces which can entirely be used instead of oil . another reason of my opinion is that thingsd are always changing and i believe that we we will find more interesting tranportations and that researcher will succeed in imagining more pratise , faster transportation . to sumup , i thin
