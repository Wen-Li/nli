i am essentially agreed with this statement . understanding idea and concept is more important than learning fact for student . but in my opinion they must learn fact too . as far a i am concerned one thing implies the other . if a student doe not understand idea or concept , he will not be able to learn fact in a proper way . we shall see this clearly with an example . if a student ha to learn for his history exam the main event of the french revolution , he can just study the main fact ( such a king 's prison and death and robespierre 's government ) but if he doe only this , he will forget them easily , even before the exam . what he should do is trying to understand the cause of the revolution . if he know that french people wa almost starving while the queen made costume-parties at palace , he may be able to understand why the furious inhabitant of paris took `` la bastille '' , france 's most important jail and , consequently , he will remember easily the fact itself : the assault of `` la bastille '' . it is true that in earlier time , when my parent studied for instance , the student were told to learn fact . professors paid almost no attention to idea or concept . nowadays , it is quite the contrary . at school , and even now , at university , we , a student , are supposed to be aware of idea and concept , but not of fact . they are misregarded , a unimportant information . i think that a really good education ought to cover both concept ( which are basic to understand the cause of fact ) and fact themselves . if we do otherwise the only thing we achieve is a partial idea of what we learn . in order to clarify it more , i will give another example connected with the french revolution . if we know that `` la bastille '' wa assaulted at 1789 , that fact signifies nothing , it is only a number . if we know that french people wa upset with the king and queen in the later year of the 18th century we do n't know that at this moment the assault of `` la bastille '' took place . we must be familiar with everything in order to get a deep , a complete knowledge of the matter .
