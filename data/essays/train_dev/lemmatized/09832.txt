there are a diferents situation that successful people trying new thing , and successful people who do not tried . i think that successful people always try new thing because they try to success in diferents aspect but i think this is not correct . obviusly that if you want to be succes first you have to know well what you have to do it . in this circunstance you will have to have a good preparation in the aspect or in the situation that you want to success . for example i want to success in my career i am a lawyer and i wanto to be a well know lawyer in my country in that circunstances i know that i have to work very hard to do it , no trying new thing just doing what i really know and doing well the ting that i really know in this way i sure that i wiil success . because if you tried to succes doing new thing i think sometimes you can doing something that is nor correct or bad thing it doe not matter your intention , the thing is that that you have to be sure what you are doing . in my specific case i can not try to do new thing becuase i am a lawyer and i wa prepare for a specific area that is commercial and civil law , and i wa study a lot about this subject , and i really honest with me and with my client when someboy ask me if i can help them with other area such a criminal law , human right or enviromental law , that are very interesting but i do not know anytihing about and them and is not correct for me to tell that this area that mention above i know and help them becuase in this way i will never success . in conclusion i think a reall successful people just do it what they already know . i am not agree with this statement becuase you can not tried new thing if you do not well what you are doing . always in better to grow up carefully taking all the value that it is neccesary . and doing well what you really know .
