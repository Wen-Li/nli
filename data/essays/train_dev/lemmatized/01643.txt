i agree with the statement that the young people nowadays donot give enough time to helping their community . the young generation nowadays in more and more engrossed in their own world of cut-throat-competition than pondering about the problem faced by their community , let alone work to solve them . for example - according to a recent survey the young generation , thegen y ( those born in the eighty ) spend most of their spare time on the computer playing game than interacting with the people near them , and thus shutting out the avenue for even knowing the problem faced by the community . the community is itself somewhat responsible for this , by weighing success of an individual in term of personal wealth , not on the selfless work that a person doe for the community . the emphasis given on the ranking of the `` richest person '' of the world , stand testimony to this fact . thus the young generation is more and more involved in making money in this rat race and spending lesser time trying to solve the problem faced by the society . the medium might be in part responsible for this , a is evident from the interest in publishing the un-necessary crap like the celebrity gossip , than to highlight the problem of the community , and sensitizing the young generation about it . the news paper and magazine that we read these day stand testimony to this . another fact that contributes to the problem is political turmoil . political turmoil cause increasing inflation . with the inflation on the rise every year , the people have to work more and more for satisfying the same need a compared to the previous year , and hence are left with lesser free time to deal with the problem faced by the community .
