this quetinos reminds me of my father who passed away two year ago because he said before about this topic . this question give me what worth life is for me . i think that young people enjoy life more than older people do for several reason . first of all , you people have more opportunity to get someting . for exaple , young adulthood can try someting new such a new field of studying in college or university for their purpose . they can study abroad for a better life . also , young people can join a lot of activitives with many people even if some activity are dangerous they can do . in other word , they can be satisfied with their life . however , most old people can not stand for a long time to do something such a studying new field or joining club with new people . in addition , i think young people 's health is better than older people 's , so young generation can try more than older people for their happy time . for example , young adulthood can go a long distance for a long time for traveling or challenging , they can easily endure some risk and hardship . therefore , they can enjoy more to spend time for travelling in the world . in contrast , old people usually have disease and show weak to do someting . also , they always need someone who help them to live without thinking about lesire time because it is difficult to do someting a a patient . finally , young people can meet many people such close friend relaltved job or college . because most of young people have many friend who still live near surrounding them . they can share their emotion and idea for a their enjoyable life . meeting people make them more energetic and dynamic . on the other hand , old people can not share their time with close friend like young adulthood becaus most of friend passed away or live far away from them . they often feel longly and stay alone without having a enjoy time . i know a few old people have opportunity and a time like young people for enjoyable life , but it is not many . it is true . my father said to me , before he passed away , it wa difficult to enjoy travelling and doing someting , i know why he memtiond like this . therefore , i belive that young people enjoy life more than the old .
