in the world there is a great market of exange in which people have to do many choice buying a product . so it is difficult for a single company to get a considerable part of this market to take advantage from it . so i think that a common method used by a company to reach a wider part of the market is that to use advertisiments . an example supporting this statement is that a company present a product in a way thanks to which you see it better . you know only the good quality and not what is wrong with the product . this is the purpose of advertisiments , to enchant yourself in a lot of different way such a using famous actor like people who use that product . on the other hand , a company should use an expert to present it product saying him to enphasize the new concept of the product . i know from experience that advertisiments make product seem much better than they really are . for example , one time i ordered a product by internet because i wa very fascinated by the way in which it wa described . but when i had had that product at home i wa very unhappy because the product did not function a it wa described . this wa a very bad surprise for me . another common method used by advertisiments is that of fulling the page of a newspaper or the screen of the television with a lot of colour . in this way , people ' s attention is focuzed not on the product but on other thing . it is a very successiful practice . summing up , i think that advertisimets change the real characteristic of a product in order to convince many other people to buy that object or that solution . for me , this is a very bad way to sell and to trade a product . using these method , company make only trick on people and before or after they will be discovered . on the other hand , the best advertisiment for a product is it good quality .
