a very common question posed by student revolves around what it is better , either having a broad knowledge of many academic subject or specializing in one specific subject ? grounds can be held to support any of the two possible answer . in fact , both have advantage and disadvantage , but a far a i am concerned , to specialize in a single field seems to be the right answer . i will give three reason to back up my choice . first af all , it seems undeniable that nowadays the labor market is demanding for very young and capable employee , usually already holding a master 's degree . neither this young people nor the educational system can disregard this fact , and the universities must encourage their student to specialize and focus specifically on certain and well-defined subject . moreover , we have to put special emphasis in the fact that recent psychological research are showing that acquiring expertise on a specific field of knowledge , is a way for people to feel fully happy with themselves . a third point refers to the fact that studying a subject seriously and at great length take a great deal of time , and make it very difficult to deep in any other subject . we do not want our student to become second-rate proffessionals in their career . to sum up , given the current expectation on the entrepreneur ' part and thus , in the labor market , it is important for society in general and for academia in particular facing up to reality and encourage the student to follow the right direction : specialization . nevertheless , argument holding the other way round , that is , the importance of acquire a broad knowledge of many academic subject can not be completely swept aside either . in my book , well-educated people need to have a very high level of acquaintance of a certain field ( law , science , literature , etc. ) , but at the same time , it is very satisfactory to devote some time to different activity ( cultural activity , sport , and so forth and so on ) .
