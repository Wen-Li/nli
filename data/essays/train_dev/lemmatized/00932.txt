the traffic , the huge amount of car in the way or street and the problem of road travel is being discussed for many year . it is wanted to be solved and to solve this many solution are developed . i do n't think this problem will be solved in twnety year and i do n't think there will be fewer car in use than there are today . there are two reason why i think like this . first reason i think the manufacturing never stop . i mean the manufacturing of the vehicle such a car bus which carry people one place to another and occupy the road . the firm produce many many vehicle every year and there is an absence of the rule about the older car . furthermore , older car can be the main problem about traffic . the newer one fill the road every year , every month and even every day . in contrast , the solution is being thought that underways , undersea travel , metro , railway and sea travel may be considered to reduce the traffic jam and so do the number of car in use . but i do n't think it is enough . secondly , people usually choose their own vehicle to travel beacuse of many reason , for example they may want more comfortable travel by their own vehicle and moreover it may be cheaper than the others . besides , the train , for instance , carry many many passanger in a day , however these many people can disturb each other when they are in the train . therefore , there may be little decrease in the number of the car . to sum up , there are two reaons i mentioned above that it ca n't be possible that there will be fewer car in use in twenty year with today technology . besides , the firm have to produce more and more car to exist and the people will always like comfort and their own car . on the contrary ; may be flying car can change my mind if it is possible to manufactured .
