the human knowledge can be formed by different topic , subject , expiriences , memory and very important ; by many academic subject . then , if we are able to broad knoledge of many academic subject , why to specialize in one specific subject ? . on the one hand , when people often specialize only in one specific subject their basic knowledge is , obviously , going to be all about that specific subject . but , in the other hand tho who learn many subject , and do not focus only in one , in my opinion are the one who are closer to succes . i am going to support my opinion with two ordinary and essential example . first , in our ordinary life we are expose to many different situation and expiriences , which we do not know if those are going to be easy or difficult to handle . for example , an ordinary conversation with your parter can be easy , but if you are talking to your bos you have to be prepared by having the necessary knowledge in a variety of different subject . for this reason , we have to be prepared and to have all the necessary knowledge to be ready to defend any topic or subject that we are expose . by knowing all the information about only one subject will not help you to escape of a problem if it is based in another subject . second , the fact of wanting to be a good professional give you chance to work in many different area . for example , these are can be : bussiness , advertising , law , and many more . so , if you are specialize only one subject give you limites . in contrast , if you are well prepared with knowledge of different subject you are able to establish a conversation in any topic . in conclusion , is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subject , than to specialize in one specific subjest . for the reason that it make you a prepared person in every way .
