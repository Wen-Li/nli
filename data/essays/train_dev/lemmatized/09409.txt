i disagree with the statement . in my opinion the best way to travel is alone by yourself . travelling alone you can wander for many place knowing the culture of the place that you visit . also you can spend your time with native people who show you the identity of such society . when i go abroad i try to travel alone because you can know the culture and the way of life of the people . if you travel with a tour guide you could probably know about the history of the place or other topic that you can read in a book . when you travel alone you can wander for several place not only to the common place such a landscape or museum . you can walk throughout the city without a fixed schedule visiting the place that you want . i like to travel alone instead of travel in a group . if a travel alone i can spend a lot of time knowing native people . i can share their custom or their way of life and learn the native language a well . when you travel in a group you should do anything that the majority want . if you travel in group you would spend more time with your group than native people . i have visited several country and i have tried to spend most of my time with native people . i believe that is not the best way to travel led by a tour guide or travel in a group . if you travel alone you can learn the culture of such place like a native . you can know many issue that you can not know if you travel like a tourist in a group . i like to travel alone because i can spend a lot of time with native people knowing their problem and thier way of life . therefore , i prefer to travel alone by myself than to travel in a group led by a tour guide .
