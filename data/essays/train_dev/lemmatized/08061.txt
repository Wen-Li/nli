personally speaking , i do n't think the best way to travel is in a group led bt a guide . firstly , travel is a course for relax and feedom for sight seeing . if we do everything in the trip follows by someone , it just look like working a usual . when i take a trip by myself or with my friend , we could go everywhere we want , we could eat everything we like . we talk and laught loudly , and we enjoy myself . secondly , in the jounry , the time we spend in the place we loved is depend on how much we like . if we find some place beautiful , we can have a good time there for long . once we feel tired during some part in a trip , we can stop and have a rest , we can have a drink in the cafe in the way , too . no one could stop you . thirdly , it is said that the tour guide may show you manythings so you would learn more in the trip , however , in my opinion , it is not neccssary for me to know much by hear the guide said , also , it make me tired , during the holiday , we should enjoy and learn thing by tring and seeing by outrselves . we will find more while we take a try in everthing . the best way to travel is to travel yourself or with your few good friend . it will give you a hard forgetable time , and your frinendship would be deeper . i am not here tosays the other choice is bad , but i think , not a good a mine , you know , travel in group may make you tired . . so , i do n't think the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide , enjioy yourself in the travel .
