although fact provide a clear and better opinion for a particular subject but personally i think that to understand the basic concept and the main idea behind the subject is much better a compared to simply knowing the fact . so i agree with the statement that it is more important to understnd idea and concept then merely learning the fact . a we see that student in their school or college perform much better when they understand the concept well and have a clear idea of the subject that is being taught . they never have to cram the thing when the basic concept is clear in their mind . also they never forget that thing for the entire life . knowing the fact may fetch them good mark but they forget the subject within a short span of time . secondly , the worker in an office show much better performance when they understand the basic concept and the main idea behind the project they are working on . simply knowing the fact would not generate an effective result . so in order to get a better promotion they have to learn the concept well so that they perform well . like in today world one must have the idea and concept of a computer to perform well in office or in his or her job . thirdly , it is very important for a player of any game to know the basic concept of the game rather then the fact . when i learened to play football my coach told me the main concept behind the game and hence i play the game well . simply knowing the fact about football can not make me a good player . thus we saw that how knowing the concept and the basic idea behind a subject is much better than by simply knowing the fact .
