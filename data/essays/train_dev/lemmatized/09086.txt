some peple trust the advertisment that is real . sometimes it 's not ture in my opinion . soi agree that most advertisement make poducuts seem much better than they really are . i have tow reason . the first reason why is i do n't belive the comercial on tv . i think some comercial said make a story that it 's not ture . for example , i watch the seans about first food . they said that is fresh vegetable and showing big meat . it seems not like a junkfoods . it seems really good apatize . though someday i visited there to eat . unfortunantry , it wa not like on tv . it wa just humberger . they do n't have a big meat like on tv . moreovre it wa not fresh vegetable . i wa very frustrated . thus , i do n't want to tust the kind of advertisement . i belive that we need to see before to try some fistfood . and we are supoused to hear a suggestion from before
