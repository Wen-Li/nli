successful people try new thing and take risk rather than only doing what they already know how to do well . i agree with the following statement because success come with hard work . those who know the taste of hardwork they will try and do more thing in life . this can be explained with a very well known example of mr. mittal . he tried new thing like coleberating with the top steel manufacturing company arcelor . initially there are lot of problem arised . they are like competition from other company and racial abusements etc . . but still because of his hard work he ha successful in making his dream true of coleberating arcelor . now it is named a arcelor-mittal steel industry . successful people know how to overcome risk . success in life can not be achieved overnight . success is a hardwork and determination of a person for many year . successful people like taking challenge in life . they will fight for success . successful people like trying out different thing in life . they want there name to spred all over . to be a verygood successful person he must have good leadership quality and ethical principle . we can have many more example of successful person . reliance ambani is the most successful person in our country trying out in many form like cellular , petroleum , steel , etc . . therefore by these example illusrated above i srongly agree the statement that successful people try new thing by facing risk . therefore successful person always win in life .
