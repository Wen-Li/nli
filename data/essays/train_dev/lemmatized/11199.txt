in twenty year the number of car is increasing . i agree with this statement because is true that people have more car than few year ago . in my opnion the invention of the car wa the most important invention in all the human life . from the beginning of the twenty century car became an important way to move but initially wa used only by rich people while the other people used horse . after many year this invention became so important that today is impossible to find a people that ha not his car . and this situation could be interprise a a positive situation because if all people ha a personal car that mean that all people ha the money to buy and to maintan car . but this situation in my opinion ha also a important negative consequence , the consequence is the increasing of pollution . infact few year ago the atmosfere wa better than our atmosfere and people life in a better world . people seems that are not very interisting of this important aspect and this is a problem because thanks to the pollution a lot of people dy . this is in my opinion the most importance negative aspect but there is also an other aspect that is important to analyze . the aspect is the exagerated and eccesive use of car and for this reason people never go out on foot or in other way such a bus . go out on foot is important for people at all the age specially for the adult that they work all the day so for this people is important to walk because help them to think about their life . so in my opinion the increasing of car in this period is certianly a positive aspect because help people to move in thei city but ha also a lot of negative aspect .
