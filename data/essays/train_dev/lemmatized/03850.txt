i agree with this statement that most advertisement make product seem much better than they really are . in my opinion , an advertisement is in the between reality and imagine . for example , if some medicine company advertise made by rabbit blood by showing the ingrediants and the real processing method , nobody do n't want to buy or sell . i know this example seems like over-expression ; however , let think about reality , it totally depend on mild imagine . the mild imagine is cute and humorous . the second reason that i agree the topic is that . the main objective of advertisement is to persuasive buyer or costomers . it is the most important to advertise . at this point , to get agreement some product become more beautiful and gorgerous using new high technology such a potograpic technic , various grapic technic with computor . so the development technology is creasing to stimulate customer 's view . as a result , many company use the effect and then the result make it to be see most advertisement make product seem much better than they really are .
