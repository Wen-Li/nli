since i am attending the final year of secondary school in germany right now i am about to choose my major for college . there are many thing that i am very interested in . i like politics and economy . but i would also like to study history or law and i absolutely love to learn language . now , i could decide to study only one of the subject i mentioned above . but since it is more important and more interesting to have a broad knowledge of many academic subject than to be an expert in one subject i choose to enroll in the major called international relation . it is a combination of all the subject i mentioned above . firstly , i strongly believe that one should follow a many of one 's interest a possible . the human mind is able to connect different subject area which , combined with broad knowledge , result in a better ability to understand complex concept of the world . additionally it is always hard to sacrifice one passion for another . secondly , there 's a different approach : what if you suddenly loose interest in what you are doing at your job ? is n't it wise to have access to a `` second door '' ? this way there 's a much better chance of finding a different job which will still provide you with enough income to feed your family . or suppose you loose your job ? if you have a broader education there 's much more job that you can apply for . it make it easier to find a new job . thirdly , studying many subject at once is more interesting than just one . this way you do something different every day . even if it might be more challenging to concentrate on so many thing at once , it will be much more fun . it make it possible to combine you 're knowledge from the different area . what is more , every subject show you a different view on the world .
