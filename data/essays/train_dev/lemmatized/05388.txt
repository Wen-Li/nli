i actually did n't get the question very well . i mean i could n't get what you mean by this , but i 'll give a try . well , i totally agree the statement a understanding idea and concept are the key element to undertsanding the fact . without giving the understanding of the concept one can never expect the student to the reason behind the fact ! i believe that it would be better for them to get the main topic first , before they actually get to know the fact . understanding the idea and concept would give student teh chance to analyze the fact . when the student simply learn the fact and do not enough understanding and the background information to think about the reality . the understanding of the idea and the concept will not only provide background information but also help student to create their own thought and comment on the given information . in the academic study , student are introduced the theory first , and then they learn the fact . with the theorotical acknowledgement provided , they get the chance of the understanding . the idea lying behind the theory and the meaning of the concept . after that , they 're introduced to the fact , what really happens and why . they try to analyze the situation and detect the reason why something specific ha happened and why others have not . this clearly demonstrates the need of the understanding of the theorotical basis-filled with idea and concept right before the learning of the fact . the more they are familiar with the leading thought the easier it would be to understand the topic completely and accurately . although i 'm for the argument , i 'm also aware of the importance of learning the fact . one should of course eventually learn the fact . otherwise it would only be a brainstorm activity . applying the information provided in the theory part is crucial . as i said before , describing the idea and concept is really necessary , it would n't mean too much without the fact . in order to be able to find the answer to the question you need to look at the result which are lying in the depth of the fact ! consequently , there 's no doubt that we need to face the truth at the end , it would be better to understand the idea and the concept that are very useful in understanding the fact .
