i agree with the statement that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide . there are certain factor that need to be considered while choosing a travel plan . first , my idea of a travel is to take off on a vacation to a new place . from my experience , i realize that during such trip , i spend much time locating the interesting spot and finding my way to them . on the contrary , traveling in a group with a guide would help minimize the effort required in planning the trip and provide a real sense of holiday . it also help explore the place much effectively and hence realize the benefit of such a trip . second , i relate travel to fun and excitement . traveling in a group is always fun a it give an opporunity to meet with people from various background and geographic location . hence , it serf a a platform to make new friend and share experience . it also add to the fun part since we could organize activity and event that promote participation and interaction in the group . further , traveling with friends/family in a group is all the more exciting since it provides an opportunity to spend time with the loved one . also , having a travel guide relief u of any hassle involved in the planning . third , i hate to have a stranger feeling when i am traveling , it give a great comfort feeling to travel in a group a you have people around that you know . though there may be certain shortfall in traveling in a group , the benefit , by far , outweigh the any such shortfall . in sum , i prefer to travel in a group with a tour guide since it meet all my expectation of an ideal vacation .
