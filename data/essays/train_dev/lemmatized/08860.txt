i disagree this statement , but i think that this idea is not totally incorrect . in twenty year the thing change and i dont't know how we will travel with . the today car are a very important problem because the car create a lot of air pollution . the car are the most pollution producer on the earth . in this case i think that people in future want to change theyre abituds and so travel with a different transport ( train for example ) . but i think that in twenty year car change too . i see a not pollution car use a clean energy and the problem of pollution will be stopped . my preoccupation is about the number of people that in twenty year can becameing too much for travel with car . what that i think is that in the future can persist only the taxy and the bus because the space will be full in the street . people will travel most with airplane because the journey will be longer than at present . my wish is that we find a solution for the air pollution and not only obviusly , and i dream a modern wonderful car go with a particular new energy discovered from a new particular planet . i think it wa possible . the solution if the people want is behind the corner . i have studied for became a designer and i want to se car forever and in my rouls i want to understand what is possible to do for resolve the car pollution problem . the problem of air pollution in twenty year becaming a very very serious problem . there are now a new solution with new engine wich go with gpl or new oil
