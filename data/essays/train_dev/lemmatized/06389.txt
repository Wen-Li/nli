in my environment i can find a lot of example of young poeple helping their community . examples like scout organization or similar one show clearly that youg people nowaday give enough time to helping other people . that is why i do not agree with the statement . first and foremost , think of all this organisation like scout or christian yough movement . in each country you can find this kind of organisation . they all have the same goal . they want to make young people more involved in the community and more over , teach them how to become a responsible adult . in my country this kind of group are very popular and they have a lot of activ member . i also used to be a member of such an organisation . that is why i can say that they do a lot for their community . for example , they help parent to guard their child if they do n't have enough time , they collect money for caritative organistations . all member of such a group give surely a lot of time to help their community . by the same token , i would like to say that you can also find young poeple involved in individual action . let 's take for an example young people who go shoping for older poeple . they also help immediatly their surrounding . other go to help older citisens in cleaning their house , or doing their garden work . all this are nice example of young person giving time to help their community . of course you will always find some young , respectless , and egoistic young poeple who just want to make profit and to enjoy life . but this is nothing new . this kind of poeple have always exicted and of course exist also nowadays . but they are not the majority . not where i live . to sum up briefly , i really do n't think young poeple do n't care about their community and do n't give enough time to helping them . i really think it is like it always used to be , some poeple care and other do n't , but the majority is involved in social life and give enough time to helping their community .
