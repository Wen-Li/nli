i agree and disagree at the same time . some of these product are good and some of them are no good . for example car . most of car adverting are really so nice and good . half of these car i do not like . like korean car and french car . they do not live long . when driving them you do not have a lot of control in case of any dengoures thing happen . and most importantly they are too expensive to buy one of these car . in the other half there are german and america car . i love driving one of these type of car . they have a lot of nice option . a lot of computer that involves . in the high way you can go a fast a you can and you have almost a total control of it ( i wrote almost becuse nothing is totally a hundred persent ) . one thing i want to montion that most of the german car are too expensive . so the advertisments for these car are worth it and truthful . let u see some other product that advertisement make them look better on tv than the real life . and that is food . i like most kind of food . from cold food to hot food . wither it is spicey or not i do not care . i will eat it . i like italian food . i am in love with chineas food . i do not mind mixecan food . i mentiond that becuse if i see a comercail on a tv about any type of food or a big picure of a hamburger on the wall that say come and taste it . i have to try it then i deside weather the advertisement of this type of food is good or not . in the end advertissing aggences are really smart doing what they do .
