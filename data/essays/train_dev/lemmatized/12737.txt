i think that it is more important for student to understand idea than it is for them to learn fact , and i will take a controversary example , which is history . first , when you learn history , it is important to be able to give their relative importance to the different fact . for example , it is impossible to understand different fact of french political life , such a the popular front , without any idea of what the left and the right mean . moreover , sometimes idea happen to inform reality . it would be absurd to learn a factual history of the ussr or the history of the cold war without any idea of what communism is . more profoundly , there is no discourse about fact without an interpretation of the fact . nietzsche and , more recently , michel foucault have explained that all the fact are constructed . there are no `` natural fact '' that we should examine without a theory . even the selection of the fact reveals an idea of what is important and what make history . economics provides u with countless example of theory that are necessary to explain fact , and even to construct them . however , it doe to mean that there is no escape to general relativism , and that there is no necessity to learn fact . it is important to cast light on the hypothesis that are made in economics a well a in history , but it is also important to give some information about the fact . at the same time a they improve their critical view , student should be able to learn precise fact . to take another time the example of history , the chronology is very important : it would not make sense to explain the facism thinking that it occured before world war i. as far a economics is concerned , it is important to test empirically economic theory to demonstrate that they are useful to understand real economic relation .
