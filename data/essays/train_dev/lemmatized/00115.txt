did you go the most famous market in taiwan ? did you eat the best local food in japan ? i think that you might be asked these kind of question after you travel somewhere . many people like to travel around the world now . they want to have different experience of different country . they also want to see and eat the special thing in every country . however , some people like to travel by themselves ; some people like to travel in a group led by a tour guide . i like to travel , and i have traveled many country . in my opinion , i like to travel in a group led by a tour guide . the reason why i like to travel in a group led by a tour guide are meeting new friend , saving time , and knowing more local thing . first of all , i like to travel in a group led by a tour guide because i can meet new friend in my group . when we travel in the group , we can meet many people who we never have met before . we can get know each other during the trip . i have many good friend who i met during the trip . i still contact with them all the time . some time we plan to travel somewher together . if i did not travel in the group , i could not meet them . second of all , i like to travel in a group led by a tour guide because they can arrange the time for u . when we have trip , it usually take a week . we might not have enough time to look over everything in a week by ourselves . we might waste a lot of time on looking for place . however , if we can travel in the group led by a tour guide , they can arrange the time for u . we can visit a many place a we can . we will not waste our time on looking for the place . last of all , i like to travel in a group led by a tour guide because they can interduce many local culture , food , building , and many thing else for u . you might have some experience about when you visit some country , you do not know what can eat and where you can go . i have this kind of experience , too . when the first time i went to japan , i went alone . i did not know where i should go and what the good food i can eat . i wasted my time and money on eating fast food in japan . however , when the nex time i went to japan with the group led by a tour guide , i had a good time in japan . i went to many famous place in japan . i also ate a lot of goog food in japan . all of them , i would not know if i did not go with the group led by tour guide . in the conclusion , i think every one want to have fun when they travel somewhere . i think if we can travel in a group led by a tour guide , we can have good time , and will not waste our time and money . we also can meet many new friend during the trip .
