i agree with the statement that young people enjoy life more than older people . young people look at the world in different way when compared to older people . young people have the opportunity to mould their life in the way they want . i feel that young people are persistent and are more confident . young people look the world a a sphere containing numerous opportunity . they have the tendency to prepare for the future and reach their goal through hard work . young people are more energitic unlike older people . this help young in fulfilling their goal . for instance , a boy at seventeen can aspire to become a pilot and even accomplish it through his hardwork and energy . this may be difficult for older people because the resposne to react to any kind of situation like moving the accelerator hard reduces with the passage of time . moreover , young people are more persistant . they think that they should respect their elder and should not hurt their feeling in any kind . on the other hand , older people need not respect their younger one and have the rigth to behave a they wish . every young person enjoy being persistant . people at an young stage can plan well for their future because they have lot of life and time infront of them . every person at this stage considers this a a big opportunity and will make their life happier by choosing the carrer they wish ti persue . another reason is that young people can appear attractive by keeping up with the fashion . they can wear any kind of outfit they want . in conclusion , young people are more energitic , fashionable and persistant . apart from all these the attention that young people get in the public is one main reason that young people enjoy more .
