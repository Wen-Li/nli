i disagree that ` in twenty year there will be fewer car in use than there are tody ' for the following reason . first , car are very convenient . no other tranportations can replace them . for example , car ha been ` a people 's leg ' . when i lived in hiroshima , one of the local city of japan , i can not move anywhere without a car . social system are in the condition people can use a car . additionally , i find it more in the countryside , people can not go to shop without car . i believe that car are convenient and have been the tool for living . second , i think that car will be developed to adjust our life . the feature of car can change and can solve the problem . for example , car comsume a lot of energy and pollute our environment , but now improving their mechanism to reduce bad inpacts . i believe that car will be developed better in twenty year and will not lose their possition . in conclution , for the reason mentioned above , i strongly do not believe that there will be fewer car in use than there are today in twenty year .
