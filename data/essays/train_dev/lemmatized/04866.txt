i agree with this statement . it is more important to understand basic idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact . if someone doe not understand the idea behind a concept , it doe not help to know all the fact . fact are normally written somewhere and it doe not take long to look them up when they are needed . but if the whole concept is not understood , it is impossible to realise it . that shall not mean that i believe that learnig fact is unimportant , the believe of the bigger importance of understanding the idea is just bigger . i would like to explain to you where this believe is based on , on a practical example . emagine you sit in a restaurant . you are obviously hungry and have pleased the waiter already to hurry . he seat you , hand out the menu and start explaining what all is new in this menu . you look at him , begging with your eye , while he start to present the specialmenu for the weekend and the actionmenu of the month and so on . that waiter definetly know all the fact , but still you will be unsatisfied because he did not get the point . you are hungry , and all you want is that you get good quality food in a fast time . he should have suggested the daily menu and you would have been pleased .
