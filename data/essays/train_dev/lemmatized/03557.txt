i do not agree with the opinion that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide . there are three reason why i think it is bad . first , traveling with group mean we can not decide where to go by ourselves . we have to follow a tour guide and we have to see sightsd in limited time . however , i believe that one of the best thing in traveling is to visit place where most tourist do not go . by doing that , we can experience different culture that communicate with local people or exprience their life . to give an example , i have been to thailand and visited a karen village where tourist have never visited . that experience made me broaden my knowledge and so on . secod reason is that we can not spend a beneficial time in the place wherer we visit . my swiss friend once told me that japanese traveler often come to the sight only for taking picture but not for walking or seeing the sight carefully and have a good time . this come from the limited time that we are allowed to see one sight . in this sithation , we defenately can not spend a nice time eventhough we travel to enjoy our life . third , it is not comfortable to travel with group member . since we can not decide which people to go with , there maybe some people that we i do not like . i think traveling with a person who i do not like is the worst thing to do . we should have confortable time during a travel . as you can see there are several de-merits of traveling with a group led by a tour guide . i prefer to trave alone or with friend , to enjoy my traveling and experiece different culture .
