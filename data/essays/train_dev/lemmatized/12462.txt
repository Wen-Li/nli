i agree : 1 : have alot of fun with friend . 2 : do not have any mental tensoins . 3 : they are the fresher of the world . conclusion : in this fantastic world the young people are the back bone of every country they enjoy alot in roaming here and there . the young people have alot of fun with their friend a they chit chatting , making joke on others , going to picnic and they are physically strong to do what ever they want . these youngster do not have any mental tension a they are not at the level of thinking about their family they enjoy themselves living with their parent and doing their job in fresh world with alot of satisfaction . in this fast moving world there are many thing to enjoy the life so that these young people are fresher to the world which have not yet started to see the nature 's beauty etc. so that they roam here and there with their parent or relative or friend and enjoys by seeing all of these . where a the old people can not enjoy all these a they have not enough energy to do all the thing that youngster do . the old people have all these enjoyment in their young age itself so that they simply enjoys bye seeing the enjoyment of young people . disagree : 1 : alot of peace . 2 : not bothered about the future . the old people too enjoy but not a the young people a they have alot of peace because they have done all the work that they have to do it just remains to take rest and not botherd about the future a there is nothing to do for nation or to thier family in that age . hence i conclude that young people enjoys alot than the old people .
