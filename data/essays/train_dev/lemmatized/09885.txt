i agree with the statement that young people enjoy their life more than older people . young people are quite energetic , enthusiastic and eager to know various aspect and in their way they really enjoy a lot . however , since older people experienced and enjoyed a lot probably when they are young they considerably will not have much interest to enjoy . young people are higly enthusiastic to go to new place and to have fun . me myself a a young woman really wish to move with my friend to highly entertaining place where i really enjoy a lot . i am a resident of hyderabad and i consider it a the most lovely place because there are lot many place here where i think that young people can really enjoy a lot . during weekend i regularly spent my time with my friend going to movie , park and also play game which help me not only to enjoy but aso in relaxing . i think that older people probably have no much interest in enjoying because of their professional and personal reason . young people are even energetic and many of the young people usally have large network . young people will have various way to enjoy than older people . since young people are more energetic than older people they travel a lot . they even plan many tour a a part of enjoyment and so visit new place . thus , a a result of this they not only enjoy but also get highly benefited in other way such a they can get much information about that place and also how to deal with people in various region and also communication skill . thus , i strongly beleive that young people enjoy their life more than older people do since young pwople are highly energetic and enthusiastic than older people .
