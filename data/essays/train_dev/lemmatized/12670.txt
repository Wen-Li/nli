it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subject than to specialize in one specific subject . it ha been controversail issue weather it is good for student to have broad knowledge of many academic subject . some people may insist that student specialize in one specific subject in term of saving time . as for me , however , i believe that it is desirable for student to have broad knowledge of many academic subject for the following two reason : not only develop varies knowledge but also enhande sence of responsivility . firstly , to have broad knowledge of many academic subject is to develop many kind of knowledge . if one student will study five subject for one year he can study many thing . they make him to smart on varies section . additionally , to have broad knowledge of many academic subject is to enhande sence of responsivility . studing many academic subject is very hard work . but during a studing time he can learn sence of responsivility .
