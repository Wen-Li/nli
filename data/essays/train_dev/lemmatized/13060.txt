i do not agree with what the statement because i think that the young people are not mature enough to really enjoy what the life offer day by day , while the old people can do . let 's go to talk about the level of mature in the young people . most of the young people think only about material thing like cloth and do not really pay attention on the other thing that are present in thier life . for they , how they look like is most important that anything else . they think that the cloth can define how they are treated and how importan they are . however , it aspect doe not have the same impotant for a old people who is more focussed on see what are behin the cloth . the old people is more interested in know the other person and enjoy it . another thing that i can mention to support my opinion is that the young people just waste their time without think on the consecuens of their behavior . they want to enjoy their life a they want and not a they shoud . the old people , on the other hand , have more time just to admire what they have done , they have done everything already when they were young , so their time is better invested . in conclusition , i think that considering the different interest that move to the young people and the old people , and also their different level of mature , the second one have more capacity to enjoy more what the real life offer and can be able to notice the beautiful of the thing that surraround them .
