every day people are speaking about controversial topic like this . some think in twenty year is going to be a masive number of car , more than today . however others think is going to be le . both of them have reason to support their idea . on one hand , the reason which support people who think that in twenty year is going to be more car , they are based in the society , in the way that society is going on . each day we are most consumist people altough there are some against consumism and some organization that try to stop it . in fact young people is worried about to have a house and a car and to be comfy in life . the announce in televion , radio . .. are making car publicity brecause car 's company are not worry about people , the pollution , enviroment , road , safe life . .. and they are only worried about money , to get more money each day , and this is the problem . they put in the mind of young people overall , feeling to consume . they want to have the best car , to get the best woman and thing like that . on the other hand the others believe on people . they think the mind of people is change because we have a lot of problem a cause of the car such a people who is dying on the road , pollution , not enough petrol in the worl , war a cause of petrol , and overall they believe in the tecnology , because new thing are made instand car , maybe diferent car . there are many control in some city ; the restriction in some country which for example some day if you have a red car you can not drive on monday . there are regulation , and rule like that for exaple in italy . maybe people is fed up of these rule and they decide to not have a car . also , they think that young people waste a lot of money and they are independence of parent later so maybe in the future there are le car than now . in conclusion i short of feel that i agree with people who think that in twenty year is going to be a masive number of car for the same reason . finally this topic would remain in controversial . who is the true way we do n't know actually , but we 'll see in twenty year .
