i am agree with this fact that it is very important to undersatnd the idea and concept . what you are going to do and what are the option . if you know the idea it will be lot easier to follow them . you can follow those consepts . you can go step by step by following them . you are studing in college and every day you learn some thing new . you can learn it only if you understand that . if you do not understand you can not learn that . it depends on how smart you are . if you are very smart you will do it very soon . if you are not very smart it take time to learn . it totaly depends on how fast you understand . to understand something you want to learn . you have to pay attention on it . even in your normal life you have plan to do something or make a plan for something . even for that you have to understand the situation . how will you manage on time . in the class if you have to do some assignement first you have to understant that then you can work further . facts always come later when you do some thing . facts are learned by experinces . you can not learn it all of a sudden . even to learn the fact you have to understand that . in your regular day when you go to college to attend the class understanding is very important . if you do not understand what professor is saying what are his concept . it is not possible to work on that subject . it is a kind of impossible to do something that you do not understand . they main idea of the topic is understand the thing you are doing follow the concept and you will get the result those are fact .
