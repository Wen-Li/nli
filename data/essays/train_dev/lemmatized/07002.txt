in my opinion , i would rather like student to learn fact more than understand idea and concept . i will describe why do i think so , and give an brief example in the following paragraph . let me say we have some issue , for this essay . first of all , idea and concept are just surface of an issue , while fact are clarified matter . also , idea and concept are sometimes people 's opinion or imagination which often unreliable , while fact are reality and truth . those factor let me think idea and concept are le important than fact ; wchich ever contains detail and truth are more valuable . to give an example , several year ago at kyoto , japan , there wa a political meeting where president bush refused to sign the issue of co2 . many country were upset about it . in the argument , there were lot of defferent opinion and idea which were criticizing or supporting president bush . for some country , they even changed their mind because of the president reaction . the fact in the wa that the president did not sign the issue period . fact never change , but people 's idea and concept do . i do not say having one 's own concept and idea are not good . but when in the learning process , student need to know truth first before having their own opinion . i think it would be wonderful when a student ha his own opinion based on the truth .
