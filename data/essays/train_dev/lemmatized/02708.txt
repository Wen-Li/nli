do young people nowadays do n't spent enough time in helping their community ? i strongly agree with the speaker in few point . first of all , the youth nowadays simply do not have to help their community because of they lack the interest of their community . because of the arise of the individualism they now focus on their own self-interest and happiness . we now see alot of young people just enjoying their life or prparing for their future carreers . they do n't have time to look after their community or those who are sick and poor . many of them just simply enjoy going to party and get drunk and give their time in making girl-or-boy friend . second , the young nowadays do n't have time to help and participate in helping their community even though they are interested in helping others . they are unfortuantley caught up in their school 's study or assignment in order to survive in our over competivive society . they get up early in the morning for school and they might attend after school activity or academic insitutions that will help their course . many young student work in a part-time job to finance their tuition and board . lastly , even though some student do spend some time in helping their community , it is not a long term participation but becoming more of an one time event without enthusiasim or passion . because of the economic growth and increased the notion of quaility of life , they do n't feel the real need to help others who are disadvataged . they were hardly never in a situation when they hungry without food and with no place to sleep . this might be a reason for them to actually not to have some sympathy towards helping others which might make them le active . in sum , because of the reason stated above i strongly think that the youth nowadays lack time , interest and effort in a long-term activity in helping their communuities .
