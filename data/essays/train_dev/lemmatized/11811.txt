i do not agree with the statement . that is one-sided and not considering the meaning of what is really to `` enjoy '' . young people seems that they are more energetic and full of hope and potential . their interest might be focus only on future . in a way self-centered . to them , life seems going forever and ever and never end . they are enjoying youth . not life . some of the younger people , they have n't even lived yet . also , life doe not always go a you wish or planed . when you 're younger , you do n't have much patience and it seems frustating . we do n't live alone , noone doe . life mean including all other people come in our life . as we get older , we realize that . when you focus on only the future and yourself , how can you appreciate and enjoy ? i like the old saying : stop and smell the rose . surely the future would be always there no matter how old you become but your priority shift a you get older . but a you get older you realize what 's matter in life . people who once realize the priority , more likely to enjoy life . in most case it 's the freinds and family in your life because they are the one you ca n't live without . also a you get older you realize what is the quality of life . in younger day , you would think youth would be there forever then once day you realize that is not true . i also believe it take some maturity to enjoy life itself . i know some older people who are retired and not much so called excitement in life going on like younger people but they seems happier and more satisfied of their life . everytime i ask them if they are happy , the answer is always yes . you 'd be wonder why or how can they , old and boring but they are happy with themselves and knowing what they have accomplished . they are pretty much content with what they went through and gained some confidence from it . so therefore , i do not agree with the statement . it take some time until you make peace with yourself and your own life . older people enjoy life more than the younger people .
