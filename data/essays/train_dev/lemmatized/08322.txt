i agree with that people had better have broad knowledge of many academic subject . there are two reason . first , it make people who do not have broad knowledge oto have difficulty in the companie or society . when we get job or enter the school , we have oppotunities of talking with many people . at the time , however , we have only one spcific knowledge , for example the knowledge about mathematics , we can speak only about mathematics . it ha possibility of giving other people the impression that you are boring person . it is very dagerous and we may be not able to lead a nice our life in the society . second , to studying one specific subject make your future very narrow one . for example , when the person who have been studying the mathematics in order to be a professor change his or her mind and the person want to be a animal doctor , what the person should do ? he or she ha the knowledge only about mathematics so he or she can not change his or her future job now . the person who have studied only one specific subject can not change or dicide their future again once they decided thier future in thier childhood . in conclusion , to specialize in one specific subject have dagerousness possibility in deciding of the future . therefore , i agree with the former statement .
