nowadays many people dream to be a ` succesful person ' in his or her society . in my oppinion those succesful people try to express something they already know well rather than try new thing . that is why i disagree with the statement saying ` succesful people try new thing and take risk rather than only doing what they already know how to do well . ' most of success come from doing something you already know such a drilling oil , developing upon something somebody already made , and having comfortable family . idea of drilling oil and selling them existed since the industrial revolution in england . however , people drilling oil are still one of the richest people in the world . my friend sanjar 's dad wa just a high ranked government officer in small country called uzbekistan . when his dad started to own a oil drilling business . now his dad drive mercedes , owns summer house in 4 different country , and give his some 100 dallars a day . another example of getting rich without trying the new thing is developing upon something someone already acomplished . in this way you can just pick up an idea of someone else , modify it and sell them . for instance , ipod , one of the most famous mp3 player brand just copied off an idea of one south korean company . all they did wa add bigger memory and create new attractive design . last exmaple of being succesful people is people with happy family . creating happy family and managing well existed for century . yet they are not admired by some people it is very hard to acomphish and it is very pleasant to acomplish . i can say people like my dad have very succeful life since he never divorced or never have kid that smoke or drink . eventough , who is succesful or not can be differ from person to person . i believe most people who have succesful life are people who held on to their knowledge and skill they have rather than try whole new idea .
