in my opinion in twenty year there won ' t be fewer car in use than there are today . in such a short period of time nothing so important like using car will be changed after all . many people think that in twenty year everything will be changed and we will have roboters doing our work . on the one hand it will be possible that we will use more technical for many daily problem and there will be more technical discovery . but what can make our life more flexible and comfortable than car ? how should we transport or export our product in other country or how do we get our post or go for holiday ? you ca n't reach any region of the country by bike or by plane is n't it ? and when we drive car we are faster in every situation of life . but on the other hand we hope that the use of car will be fewer in a couple of year because they cause so much pollution and by time destroy our environment . everybody should use it car only in situation which are essential not to drive to the neighbour e.g. but in my opinion it is n't impossible to realize all over the world . in addition what will be the cause of a fewer using in a few year ? that everybody ha got a relationship to a partner in office so that they can drive together or do their weekly shopping tour together ? i do n't think so . for many people a car ha a status of comfort and will help them in daily situation like bring their child to school when they live far away from there . from my point of view the using of car will rise more in twenty year than everybody expected and not will be in a fewer use .
