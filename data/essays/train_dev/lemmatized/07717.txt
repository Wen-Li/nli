what should one focus on , fact or idea ? that question remains one of the trickyest issue of pedagogy . some tend to put forward fact , others idea and one 's ability to understand and explain idea . the problem is not only pedagogical , it is also philosophical . both of them fact and idea are pretty useful to one 's education , yet should one deserve more grace than the other ? facts are necessary to the comprehension of any matter . how could one get the idea of the roman empire wa without any fact ? accordingly , knowledge transmission should not leave fact aside for it appreciation a reality . an assertion few historian could contradict . however too many fact tend to be disturbing . the expert who always focus on the same fact allows himself one single reality . his comprehension of the situation can not be innovative and his behaviour will remain static . facts lead to exception . on the other hand , understanding idea , can help one understand issue he might not be familiar with . understanding the dynamic of the fall of the roman empire can help one explaining another situation . ideas have a got a plasticity that fact do n't have . but the notion of idea itself remains quite blur . for a philosopher , idea and concept are fact . in that letter heidegger us this concept whereas in this lecture he did n't . why ? he asks . that same professor while having spent too much time in the pool of idea ha made it a tank full of fact . one ha to be cautious with idea a well . moreover , idea tend to lead u to abstraction . even though abstraction is attractive , it can end up on dramatic mistake . the commitment of several french intellectual along with communism testifies of it . students should therefore be a keen on fact a they should be on idea . one doe not prevail on the other . they should be intertwined .
