to be afraid to do something new is inerent to all hummans . failing is a very unpleasent thing and the best way to avoid failing is not to do anything . but if history ha teach u something is that the only way to improve and be successful is to try new thing and take risk , no matter how hard or painful this might be . the western world a we know it , came hand by hand with the industralization . this period of the history is known to be time where steam and dream made able massive production , better good and incrisse in quality of life . without people taking risk and failling hundred of time before finding solution , none of these could happened . another good example of the result of risk taking action is the development of the airplane . probably all of u have seen some old movie of the first plane prototype . crazy machine that look more like game than real plane . but after year of trail and error someone got it right . and thanks to that , it is possible to travel in hour to place that otherwise would be impossible to reach . i have apersonal personal exaple , a a brand manager of a wine company . no one believed that we could develop a wine to be a fun a beer . `` it is simply not wine essence to be fun '' an important manager one said . but me and my team strongly believed that it wa possible to do it . so after a lot of mistake we finally developed `` fressco '' a new brand that combine wine with fresh fruit in a completelly innovative packaging . the result , fressco is now one of top 3 wine sold in chile and it ha become a real competitor to beer . so , concluding , even if been afraid to do something new is always a challenge for any person , is fundamental to know that innovation is the only way to progress . it is true , mistake can really be painful , but the reguard of doing something new compensates all .
