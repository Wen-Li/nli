yes i agree that the best way to travel is in agroup led by tour gudi . traveling abrod is what i like this life . traveling in a group can be a better for many people . traveling give oupprotonty for a lot of people to descover the world and to know about other culture . people who travel a lot can essaily travel in a group which gane be a great oupprotonty for the group to descover everything by them self . so traveling in a group is the most importnat idia i ever had . i will maintain this in two way . first , choosing a group is the most esstional step before any traveling . you need to choose the correct group for your traveling . so do n't choose any group for just traveling with them , because this trip can be very important for and for your family to enjoy in this trip . for example , i choosed a very good group of people in my traveles before and they helped me much than the tour guide . this group had a lot of experince in traveling for that reason you should choose the right group . second , choosing the right time and place for travel . some place are not good choise for traveling with a group . if you want to travel in group you need to choose a good place like to travel to a safe country that all peopl know about it , because you do n't want to put yourself and your grup in prablems . for example , i saw a group of people had a prablem with the local police in asian country last year . in conclusion traveling with group can be woundrful for the people . they will have a lot of fun togather , and they will share experince from traveling in a group . they learn how to help each other and how to find soultions for their prablem while they in trable .
