in twenty year there will be fewer car in use than there are today because there will be more and more other public transport , such a airplane , train , bus , ship and so on . i think that if there were more and more public transport people could not use car . public transport are always late so people prefer to take a car to go to work . every day people buy a new car instead of taking a public transport because the car can follow your time , you do not have to waste too much time to wait for . but i think that in this period public transport are more and more necessary because car are too much . so it is difficult to find a car park and moreover car pollute the air . in my opinion in the future every state will work to find solution to eliminate many car . gouverment will try to do something to not pollute the air . the pollution is the great problem at this time . so we have to work hard to reduce it . for this reason is necessary that we spend more money in public transport . public transport are the future because i think that if we go on in this way , so we continue to buy car and car , in twenty year we will have any place to move . so we have to find a solution for this great problem . the right solution could be in public transpors . moreover in this period there are a lot of car that people have to wait so long time on road . i think that is more useful to take a public transport because it is cheaper than car and moreover you can spend le time on it . as the matter of fact in this period there is a lot of traffic and you are not so sure to arrive on time to your destination . i do not really know how the world in twenty year could be , but i know that if we do not do anything to change our position we would have serious problem . we need to change our actually position because problem will not find a solution by themselves . we have to stop the growth of car to be free to make easy our movement , and also to protect u to the air pollution .
