travelling in a group led by a tour guide can have disadvanntages and advantage . i prefer travelling without a tour guide or even without a group . what i like about travelling alone is that you can make every decision very spontaniously . you can choose where to go next and what to visit each day depanding on the weather , your mood or your finance . in comparison to travelling with a tour guide , which contains a very rigid schedule without any leeway , travelling alone is preferable if the target of your trip is pleasure more than obtaining a much information and fact a possible . a different perspecitve is travelling with a tour guide provides you with detailed information about culture and history that only expert can deliver . and you do not have to invest a much time to plan out your whole trip . the trip ha already beplanned by the tour guide . this can cease in a deeper insight with le effort . on the other hand travelling independently could open opportunity that tour guide can not offer . for example , two summer ago i traveled to spain fore two week . in those two week i learned more about cultuer than every expert could have brought to me . i got to know a local girl my age and we became good friend . she invited me to her family house for dinner and even to a wedding of her sister . i gained a deep understanding of the intrinsic cultural difference a well a difference in every day life . a neagtive point of travelling independently is that it involves more effort . i you want for example not to stay in one specific town , it need a lot of encouragement and knowledge to find out bus schedule and upcoming fee . and at the end the trip might not even be worth it since you do not know what to expect and where to go .
