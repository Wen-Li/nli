i disagree that succesful people try new thing and take risk rather than doing what they already know . because tring new thing are very diffcult . if people get a lot of money from success something , they should n't try new thing . they should expand a job which same category from befor they successed . first , i would like talk about why it is difficult that people who sucsessed own job try a new job which they do n't have any skill and knowledge about it . i think if autally diffarent category job , people who try to new category 's job need much time to make a base . now , our world wa developed with technology , so speed is very important for work . if take a much time , it might br bad effect . second , it 's difficult to paticipate new category 's job , because there are many company already . of course , tho company have had better skill . thay also have good relationship each company even though they are enemy . for example . my friend eho ha a own company which is it successed on his job , but after that , he build a new compane which is model production . he lost his money . because he did n't know the relationship about other company , so other company hit his company . thereforer , i disagree that succcesful people try new thing and take risk rather than doimg waht they already know .
