in my opinion enjoyment in life ha lot to do with age . it not only requires a source and time to enjoy but alse the spirit and energy required to spend in enjoyment . young people enjoy alot than the older people doe because of various reason . reasons like enery , experiance , spirit and time . young people are completely satiated with energy . as their muscle are in a growing stage or in an already developed stage , young people find it very easy to enjoy . whether it is a matter of sport , party or disco or the matter of learning . some sport like the baseball , football , basket ball and many other require an energetic body and grown muscle like in boxing or wresling . older people lack this source required for enjoyement . due to lack of experiance many young people takin many difficulty a challenge and strive hard to overcome it . this in turn excites them , thrill them and provides a mean for enjoyment . for example when a boy for the first time approach a pet animal like a dog , he ha no knowledge about how the dog may react . but when he find the animal very kind he enjoys in spending time with it . another reason is the confidence and the spirit which the young people have than the older one . when we feel more confident we try to undertake even the most difficult task . getting some tuff time in completing that task surely enjoys u . spirit is an essential requirement to begin and even give an end to something . old people having faced many difficulty in through out there life , lack spirit to do the similar job . they find it boring to do the samething which thay have been doing since many year . on the other hand young people find it really exciting to start a task to which they had never been before . older people especially those who ha a family and a job to take care of , work lot of hour in their office . these people can hardly find few hour from their busy schedule to even watch a cricket match . they spend almost ten hour in their factory , office or other working place for their earning . and the young one they readily find time for enjoyment . as soon a their homework got finished and preparation were made , young kid they just go outside their home to spend a pleasant time playing with their friend or dancing in a party . in summary , i will only say that young people with no responsibilty of anyone enjoy alot than the elder people . whereas the elder didnt get a chance to enjoy a they have many responsibilait . howevwer they enjoyed when they wenwere young .
