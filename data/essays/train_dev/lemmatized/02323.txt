will the advertisement make product seem much better than they reallt are ? i 'm going to have to say that i agree with this statement because i am one of the people who watch advertisement show and buy product that i want . i do n't think this is a good way to choose which product to buy , but how are we going to buy the product without an advertisement ? and why dose it make product seem much better than they really are with advertisement ? the answer is really simple , it 's just that some compnay make look the product better in advertisement . basically what they are doing is lieing . in oreder to find a good product without using the advertisement , people should ask their friend about the product they want to buy . one day , i bought this watch that wa said in the advertisement that this watch never brake and could hold on to great amount of gravity . when i went into the deep pool , it wa broken . i wa really sad and mad at the same time . advertisements make the product sound better , but the product it self is n't good a what is said on the advertisement . since the product it self is n't good a it say on the advertisement , the company who pruduce the product would not make a great amount of money . like i said in the beggining , i do agree with the statement , but i do n't agree using the advertisement to sell the product . without a advertisement , it would tough for the compnay to sell . same a people who want to buy the product . for doing this , only the good product which cost le and ha good quality is going to be sold . what is the purpose of making an advertisement ? customers could be the advertisments .
