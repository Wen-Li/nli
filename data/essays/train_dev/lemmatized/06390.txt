there is a problematic situation : business ha the main pourpose in selling and getting the heyer profit from anything and at the same time a correct life-style tell u that liyng is not correct ; it ' s not always possible to follow both statement . of course i agree that advertisment make a product seem much better than what it really is , because that 's it pourpose : make a product look wonderful so nobody will resist buying it . not only publicity want a product to look fantastic , it also want you to think that it ' s the best idea somebody ever had and that you can no longer live without it . advertisment want ' s you to think that there product will better your life ; so why not buy it ? advertising us those instrument that have the bigger impact on human personality : image , sound and psicology . psicology is one of the most powerfull wepons of control on people . if you are able to enter there mind with a powerfull and sensational icon you did it all . if you want to sell a hair lotion that will make your hair grow back eaven if you are sixty year old , you can ' t say it will also seriously damage your hormon sistem or else i think every prson in the world would prefere to have a little le hair but a better helth . i think every person in the world should stop and think of it ' s role in society and of what impact it have on people , each one of use should be aware of it ' s own responsabilities and decide eather to take one way or the other : one lead , maybe , to a better world where everibody really ha what is best , the otherone brings to a a world where each one of u think for him selve and think he is doing the best for him selve but he is not .
