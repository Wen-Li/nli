cars were a wealthy sign twenty year ago . only , those who roll in money and live in good condition of living could buy a car . in today 's society , in western country , the majority of the population have a car . we can wonder if the increase of the purchasing power have increased the number of car for the last year and if this increase of car is a reality or just an illusion . to my mind , it is true that in twenty year there will be fewer car in use than there are today . the fisrt reason of this incresing of car is the increase of the purchasing power . twenty year ago , in western countrie , there were clearily two socila class ; the have and the have not . so , the upper class outnumbered the wealthier . cars were considered a a luxious good . nervertheless , for few year , the middle class ha represented the majority of the western population . at the same time , car have been developing and their price reduced . as a consequence , with the emergence of the middle class and the decrease of few car ' price , several person could buy a car . the second reason is the development of the mobility . in fact , in today 's society , a lot of people have to take a car to go working every day . commuters are more numerous and they need a car to work . furthemore , many firm need that their employee work in many city and not on the head of office . what is more , we can see every day that there are more car today . in fact , every evening and every mornig , we can see on the road many traffic jam at rush hour . we can wonder if the increase of these traffic jam , that we can check every year , will not dilusionned many person to take car . to conclude , we can notice that in spite of the development of train and plane , the increase of car is growing up .
