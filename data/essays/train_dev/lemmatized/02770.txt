some people may feel that successful people try new thing and take risk rather than only doing what they already know how to do well and some may believe that successful people do not try new thing and take risk , they just stick to thing they can do well . however , i strongly believe that successful people are innovative and have the risk taking ability . i feel that successful people do take risk . business is another name of risk . profitability depends on the amount of risk taken . the more the risk , the better the profit . however , the risk should be calculated and should be evaluated carefully . successful people do not take blind risk . little bit of risk is everywhere . when we buy share of a company we are subject to some risk . even the movie actor may take risk in order to satisfy their audience . a very good example is doctor amitabh bachan . he is a superstar in bollywood . he took a risk by changing his image of an angry young man to that of a comedian by performing some comic role . he did this to prove himself a a versatile actor . today he is praised for his successful attempt . innovation is important to expand the business . in the world of competition , it is necessary to be innovative , it is necessary to try something and create something new . technological growth , cut throat competition , changing preference and taste of the customer make it necessary for any organization to be innovative . successful business man mr.dheerubhai ambani wa innovative . his story of rag to rich is very popular among people . his innovative idea contributed to his success . he wa the person who first introduced the concept of public share in india . his decision made him a millionaire later . in conclusion , i would like to say that successful people do take risk and are innovative . however , their move are planned . they take calculated risk . so in order to be successful one need to be innovative and should have the risk taking attitude .
