i disagree that it is more important for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact . in my opinion , learning fact is more important and efficient for studemts . there are three reason . first reason is that fact are efficient in a real situation . second reason is that fact always follows a reality . therefore , it helpes to solve a problem . third reason is that people learn the idea and concept through the fact . first of all , the fact are always efficient in a real situation . for example , in business , people do n't know what to do when they face problem although they have knowledge about a concept of business . concept is just a concept . fact and the skill that business people need in real situation is mostly different from the concept . business people who know pefectly about concept and idea do n't always succeed in business because a market is very complicated and always change . in another word , the fact in the market is always changing . therefore , they have to flexibly keep up with the cahnge of the fact . secondly , the reality doe not always follow the reality . there are so many accident . therefore business people need to know a many case and solution a possible which may be needed in reality . thirdly , people can learn concept and idea through the fact . learning concept through the fact and real experience is more efficient for u to work in reality than learning only concept and idea . if i do n't know about the fact , i will not be able to have a good solitions
