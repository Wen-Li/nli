how would you react if an adult tell you that he wa more happy when he wa a child ? does it mean that becoming an adult , dissipate happiness and good time ? according to my own experience , i think that people were getting happier when they were child . they just live how there mind guide them trough without thinking about consequence . firstly , i think that young people are happier than adult because they do not care about anything material . they live their life without thinking about the consequence . indeed , everything they wanted to do is possible , so they just have to realise what their heart tell them to do . people are used to say that mankind are lead by money and interest , contrary to child who are only guide trough life by happiness and pleasure . for example a young boy doe not care about what his mum is doing . but her mum must take care of her baby , and she ha to safe ihim and protect him from danger . we can also say that young people are in good heealth that able them to live their life without money problem , job problem and more . .. they spend most of their time playing with their friend without being disturbing . according to my own experience , i can say that being a child is the best period of your life . you do not have to care about anything than just playing outside . you are not stress by your destiny and by the world around you . but saying that adult do not enjoy their life is wrong but it is a question of priority , yopu hqve le think to count of .
