successful people try new thing and take risk rather than doing what they already know how to do well . i do agree with the given statement absolutely . it is the inclination for taking up thing that are different from the conventional way and mean of doing thing , that set the successful people apart from their plebian fellow being . for e.g. had it not been for the wright brothers , we would not have known the face of the aeroplane today . it is their determination to do something different that made it possible . they dared to take the plane into the air . .. up and up . .. and their reputation soared even higher . successful people tend to take the le trodden path and achieve success at the end of it . it speaks of their determination and perseverance . take for instance , thomas alva edison . . the inventor of electric bulb . he failed many a time before he could succeed . the failure didnt deter him , instead they motivated him to try still harder . complacence is not a virtue of successful people . they try to improve on the thing further . if the invention ha stopped with the bicycle , imagine how would the world have been today . if people are content with what they have , then their is no progress in life . some people , people with vision and passion , take upon them the task of doing new thing and take risk instead of going along with the routine , and they are the people who stand apart from the common and become exemplary .
