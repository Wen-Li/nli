in this era of immense competition , modern youngster spend lesser and lesser time towards ` giving back to the society ' . there is a downward trend in the number of hour spent doing community service these day . the sense of belonging ha decreased over the year and we tend to take most thing for granted . community service is considered to be ` someone else 's job ' . firstly , student are faced with more workload from school and college so they have lesser leisure time . they feel so exhausted after class that there is little or no motivation to take up some community work . also , there is high competition , so the student tend to spend after-school hour doing extra research or preparing for test . say a student is not doing a well a she expects . in such a case , she will obviously concentrate on making an extra effort and studying harder . thus community service take a backseat . secondly , when a student doe have some time to spare , he or she may have an option to take up a paid job . for example , when a one ha an option to make money by working in the local cafetaria and earn a good chunk of money , the community service option doe not seem lucrative . this is due to the tendency of seeking personal benefit before caring for others . in other case , the leisure time is spent ` hanging out ' with friend , watching moveis , going for concert , chatting on the internet etc . for instance , after a full day at college , two friend prefer to meet up at the mall rather then tire themselves out doing more work . usually , the the motivation to do community service arises from a desire to present a more ` attractive ' resume or for college admission . however , it would be incorrect to generalize this staement because there are a few individual who genuinly like to do community service out of personal satisfaction . some people enjoy interacting with elder at old age home and get happiness when the old express their excitement over having someone to talk to ! sadly , such youngster are fewer in number . hence , community service is declining these day .
