learning begin at home , even a small thing that happens in our daily neighbhourhood affect the student 's learnin capability . will just understanding these idea or concept help the student ? or will he have to learn the fact ? well , the answer lie in the question itself , it impossible for one to learn the idea and concept without learning the fact about them . for example when someone is asked not to do something , he want to know , why is that particular task prohibited ? , and when he is explained `` why he wa asked not to do so '' , he will tend to ignore them , than abide by them or he would try them and then learn either through the punishment or through the factual behind it , perhaps that would help him to analise the situation throughly and then he would act wiser the next time . so , it of more important for a student to understand the idea and concept or learn the fact ? my answer would be `` both '' , the student should get the oppurtunity to learn about it from the teacher a well a learn it by doing task practically , and if the issue is about thing that can not be done practicaly then he should try and find out some material or fact about the particular issue , and then he should be allowed to prioritise and analise the fact and draw a conclusion , rather than just letting himself beleive the doubtful concept . he should make a note and then consult the teacher or professor and get more detail about it , this idea not only give the student abundant satisfaction but it also help the student generate keen intrest in the topic because he is constantly looking for the right answer and almost aware of the whole concept , while he never struggled a lot emphasizing himself to learn it .
