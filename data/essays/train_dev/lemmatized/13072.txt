with new useful invention or working method someone can make much money in le time . the question is , if this person need tu be risky or not - or if someone who doe it the old `` normal '' way , could not succeed . first of all in my opinion everybody can be very successful in every little job or thing he doe . if he want to , he will do good and will not need some new way or risk to work it out with more success . he perhaps will last longer for that thing he want to reach but he will reach the end much more safer . if you dare more like other company , do not mean that you risk more . you can check and double check and if your idea is not good , you can try again . in modern world nobody will throw a new product on market without several test of customer . everybody try to reduce the risk to a minimum . on the other side a really new idea need a big starting amount . this big investition doe not guarantee the profit and the success . this of course could then open a door to a higher level of money but is very risky , because nobody can say , if people will accept the new product or not . in the fast changing internet and mobile world , often you just have to be the faster one and this person . new invention like ebay are able to have million of customer , it is just the idea , that count . in conclusion i think it is not necessary for a new company to be risky or to dare too much . first of all you have to check the guarantee of success and if the idea of the company is good , the success will come in a much more safer way .
