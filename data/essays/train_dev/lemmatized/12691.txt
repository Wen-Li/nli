yes , i completely agree with this statement . and , this is the whole idea behind getting the product advertise to lure the consumer and compete in the market . in today 's competetive world everything is all about presentation , especially if you want to sell your product in the open market . you really have to prove and show to the people that your product is better than others . advertising help seller in marketing the product and in the process sometimes it show the product better than they really are . in the age of cut throat competition , advertisment company try to show the best of the best thing about the product which is sometimes incorrrect . i have a real life example to further support my thought - i wa watching a coca cola advertisment some time back where it wa showing that a person drinking the soft drink saw a girl drowning in the deep ocean . he jumped into the ocean to save that girl and later on they highlited that the person is so brave and courageous becaue he drink coca cola . ofcourse , this is nowhere near to reality but still good enough to generate interest in the soft drink . every year million and million of dollar are spent to get a thirty second slot in the super bowl game in united state . there is no harm in showing your product a a perfect one but at the same time one should not make it look like totally different than what thay are . for instance , in us we get flier everyday in our mail box about various deal but you reach the store only to find out that the deal is gone or that commodity is out of stock . but , the advertisment accomplished what wa intended there most of the time - generating traffic for the store . most of the advertising company promotes themselves by saying that they can change the look and feel of the product . they know the trick to charm the consumer and in the process they make product seem much better than what they really are which is unethical but unfortunately true .
