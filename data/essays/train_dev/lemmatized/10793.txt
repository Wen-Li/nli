it is important to have a good background and have a broad knowledge but there is a point when specializing in one specific subject is needed . there is no doubt that a proffessional need a broad knowldege of many diffferents subject to build a strong background . for example a petroleum engineer , like me , must take a lot of subject which could appearently not be related to what a petroleum engineer need to learn in order explore , exploit or process oil . such is the case of subject like learning technique , computer programming or environmental education but those subject definetely help on the way you learn the specialized subject a in learning technique , or how a program can be used to solve a problem on computer programing or even how to prevent an environmental impact during any stage of oil process . although all those subject mentioned before and others , can give an engineer a good background , after that point an engineer must specialized to focus the atention on a major in wich , a i can see , the more work an attention you pay on the more you will be able to succed on . continuing with the example , on petroleum engineering , there are three major specifique branch : reservoir , drilling and production , acording to wich the attention will be focussed on find and characterize the location of the place where the hydrocarbon is , to create the condition to bring the oil to the surface or to handle it when it ha reached the surface respectively . in order to specialize on one of those field or branch , specific subject must be taken . according to what i 've previously pointed , i think that is important to specialize , a in the example mentioned above , in one mayor field wich can lead to an focused attention environment in a major that would be studied and researched resulting on an improved and focused knowledge .
