nowadays , there are more and more advertisement showing on tv , magzines , and other medium . as a result , people increasingly depend on advertisement to know certain product . i believe that most advertisement make product seem much better than they really are . advertisers often make appearence of good more beautiful than they really are . for example , i often buy clothes through internet . i found the fact that clothes doe not have same color and style a it wa shown on internet . this often make me angry . another example , many house are advertised through medium . some house look more acceptable than they really do , with lovely shape and beautiful color . however , when you go to see the true house , it is not the same appearence a it look like on advertisement . also , for the purpose of attracting more buyer , advertisement make product seem much convenient than they really are . for example , seller advertise for the car . most of advertisement show that owing a car is a symbol of high level living condition . there is often a scene on the tv that whole family go to beautiful nature park for camping happily and wealthily , of course , a luxurious car always exists in the background . however , this advertisement doe not consider the side effect of car such a sending out smog and making noise . also , family may spend much on gasoline and repair fee . in sum , since most advertisement make product seem much better than they really are , a buyer , we should pay attention to and try to adoid this problem . also , i advocate for true advertisement which can give the reliable information on good .
