in my opinion , young people in various community from several culture become le concentrated on their community and this should be conceived a one of the main sociological concern for the society in the world . so i do totally agree with the statement put front . as country develop economically and socially and relation within the society in question becomes more complicated in various term . the young people are getting isolated from their own community . however this situtaion is valid for all of the society . and this concept is getting affected from a wide variety of sub factor ranging from governmental policy aiming the country match up with the rest of the world , to easiness to reach information with the help of the technological advance . in a world surrounded with above-mentioned condition , the young people are put forward in a race of getting the best in every field . with this motivation , the young people mainly concentrate on themselves rather than participating in assistance activity towards their community . rather they do deal with studying a lot , getting into other activity towards self development , attending new class , etc . of course it should not be asserted that this kind of activity are bad but their role on affecting youth should not be underestimated . to decrease the negative impact , there should be some incentive and couraging factor for the youth to associate with their community and socialize . because by this way , the youth will find the opportunity to get interacted with it society and feel and conceive the factor and cultural aspect forming his/her society . within these frame , i think , the fact that youth can not assign enough time for helping their community is mainly based on the environmental condition a a whole and some measure can be taken by the society in order to prevent this alienation of young people to their society .
