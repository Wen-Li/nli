to answer that question , we need to ask another question '' is success measured by the thing we do or how we do thing ? '' , if the answer wa `` by the thing we do '' then i dissagree , because people will always take risk a a fact of success and not a a choice , the reason behind that is that people tend and rather feel safe than to take risk with a big possibility of failure , for example : if there is a shoemaker who worked in that field for almost twenty year and have no experiance what so ever in any other field , then that man have two choice , to continue his work knowing that it a failure - we agreed that success is measured by `` the thing we do '' - or changing his field to any other practice that he know nothing about , and taking a huge risk by changing his field . fundimintaly this man will have a very low rate of success , and may lose his furtune by changing the work he doe to thing he dont . at the same time this man wanted success and that what we all want , so in fact he had no choice , he had to follow that path . if that wa the case , we will find that many of the business will collapse beacuse of the shifting of field done by non-specilized people , the doctor want to be a pilot , the accountant want to be an engineer and the cat want to be the mouse . on the other hand ; if the answer wa `` by how we do thing '' , then we can achieve our goal and success , for we will do our work in a well planned and organized way , even if risk is there , it wont efeect our work to the point of failure .
