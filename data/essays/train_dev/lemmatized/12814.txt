many people spend their time in different way . like chidren spent more time by playing a they enjoy it and similarly younger people find enjoyment by spending with their friend and so on depeding upon their interest and way of getting enjoyment . which doe n't mean that some enjoy alot others donot a all get enjoyed well in their own way . from this i dont agree that younger people enjoy more than older people , because even older people enjoy in their own way . as older people become weak enough a their age go up , so they might not able to move freely and comfortable a like young people . even if they do them they would suffer from pain and injury . they enjoy alot in their own way by telling story , or by telling their past experience to child . also they find lot of enjoyment by going on for small walk near by . when i wa a child i got a great time in giving enjoyment to my grandmother a he feel alot a happy in telling story , flashback and even we used to go to garden and pluck some carrot and ate which made by grandmother to have lot of enjoyment . so by this we can say age doe n't limit aperson in enjoying his life . every one got their own way to spend time happily . similarly young people find their enjoyment by spending time with friend or by going to party or even by participating in extra curricular activity . as they have got a good health and energitic they can participate actively unlike older people , but this doe n't mean that the older people do not enjoy their life . rather i feel that older people enjoy more than younger people . as younger people participate in the event which need alot of energy and make easily tired up . so all these state that enjoying life can be done different way according to personal fitness and interest . so i strongly state that like young people older people also enjoys but only the difference is the way they get enjoyment .
