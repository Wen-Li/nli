some people think that it is more important for student to understand ideaas and concept than it is for them to learn fact . others do not think so . in my opinion , i prefer the first one because the goal of studing is to how to use the knowledge . for high school and college student , it is important to understand the idea of the course . if you just can remerber some fact and can not know the reason , then you will not deep understand the main purpose and some implied meading behind the fact . usually , this is essential for studing the article or reserching some science experiment . for example , iwhen you learn some history episode , the more you can learn background , the more understanding you learn the content . in addition , you will be flexable to apply your knowledge to what you need if you understand the course . forexample , in the exam , if the teachear give some question on the exam paper different from the content in the class , but you still can deal with it if you really understand the content but not just depending your rememory . on the other hand , learning is for practising . when you grasp some knowledge and can use it to deal with problem , in this way you can be competent in the job market in the future . of course , learning fact is very nessessary for the student especially for the primary student . young childern must learn some primary knowlege that is helpful to them . to sum up ,
