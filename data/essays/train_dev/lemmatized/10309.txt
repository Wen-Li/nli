i agree with the statement that the successful people try new thing and take risk rather only doing what they already know how to do well . there are many reason for this , some of which i would like to present in this presentation . the success in one 's life make people to explore many thing . they get intrested a they succeed in the thing they do and try to take risk rather than fixing to the thing they have done before . they some time try to see the same thing in the different perspect so that they can do even better . the statement `` successful people try new thing '' can be even much explained with an example . let 's take thomas alva edison , the great scientist who had many invention to his name . edison had more than 1000 invention to his name which prof that successful people try new thing . let u consider the invention of the bulb . if edison had convinced with that invention and try to do the same thing repeatedly would not have fetched him anything . he being a successful person tried the new thing and took the risk involved in it . eventually , he succeeded in everthing . he kept on inventing many new thing which were very useful to the people . this show how the successful people try different thing . in my view , successful people should try new thing which would help him to gain not only knowledge but also increase the creativity , seeing thing in different attitude . trying new thing even help one to learn more from his mistake which would be very helpful in his further thing . successful people influence the surroundings in which they are , helping the other people to succeed in their part . in sum , the success which the people get make them to try for many more new thing rather than sticking to the thing they already know .
