i disagree this statement . although we do not need to consider about the schedule , we may loose the chance to talk with poeple who live in the tour place . i think it is one of the interesting incident we have some opprtunities to talk with such a people . recently , there are a number of tour which is planed by tour company . most of these tour is led by tour guide . parhaps , we have to go the place where we do not want to go , because the other member want to go . i think one of the reason we go to travel is to separate from our own society . sometime we want to escape from the society which we belong to . however , if we go to a tour led by a tour guide , we may travel with the other poeple who applyed the same tour . in this situation , we have to construct new society while we travel . if we could not get along with the other poeple who take part in the same tour , we might be tired , in conparison . in addition , the one of the interest thing about travel is planning the tour course , in advance . i think travel start when we decided to go . no matter how tour guide construct the tour which is suitable for u , we become to loose one of the intrest thing of trip . for these reason , we should travel by ourself rather than led by a tour guide . i would like to fun the quality of tour from planning , when we start , where we go , how we go and with who we go .
