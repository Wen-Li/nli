there are discussion that in the future , there will be fewer car in use than there are today . although some people think that using the car increase than nowadays . because they think that the car is the most thing to not improve and they do n't have side-effects . but i think that there will be decrease in using the car in the future . there are several reason . first , nowadays , there is problem that oil , gas is reduce because of unplanned excavation . so it cause to lack of oil to move . it mean that although we have a lot of car , we can not drive because there is no oil to move . therefore we need to other substitute oil or alternating method for movement . i think that find alternating method for movement outweigh to find other oil . second , the car cause pollution of air . actually the car produce co2 , nox . it increase earth 's temperature . so , the height of sea is increase . maybe our land will be under the water . imagine that condition you do n't have land to plant and to live in . from these problem , many human is studying to find other method to move that it is not cause to pollute the air . third , the car is unconvenient . because it can not only out of order frequently but also ca n't cross the other continent . nowadays , there is global world . so to increase the power of nation , we should invent free-cross continent like ship and plane to trade easily . for these above mentioned reason , there is no doubt in my mind that there will be fewer car in use , in the future . because it cause air pollution and gradually the oil is reduced .
