risk to succeed success is a path , not a situation ; so it need skill for adjusting to the new circumstance , and more importantly creating own opportunity by taking risk . i also agree that successful people are different than the conservative one ; because thay have a different view on trying and also the skill to accomplish their target . of course risk taking doe not mean to make stupid investment , but plan and coordinate everything . in every risk you take there is a chance of failure , but if you get afraid of failing you will also wo n't get successful . in chinese alphabet there are two icon for the risk concept . one of them is opportunity and the other one is loss . if you do n't take any risk you will never find the make benefit from an opportunity . john d. rockefeller who wa one of the richest people of the world , once said : `` do not be afraid to give up the good to go for great '' . he is considerated a a successor because of his attitude in risk taking . he cleverly saw the american 's need in changing in transportation from railroad to the motorway and used his chance in creating the world 's greatest oil company . people who are doing only they know , will mostly do one thing on their life . maybe that will give them a more stable life with very low risk but they will never have to become very rich . i am a risk-lower myself ; and i try to look behind the scene . because i know there is always an opportunity behind . because success is kind of a comparison
