i agree with the statement . in my opinion it is more important to understand idea and concept , than to know fact and just repeat them . you can talk about an idea or concept if you really know the background of it . so if you have the knowlegde about a topic and you take part in a discussion you really know what you are going to talk about . also fact are important to understand point but they are better to underline your knowledge , but if you just know fact you can not express yourself . so you have to link the fact you know with your own knowledge to build a concept . with a concept you can express yourself so that other people will understand you . it is not like telling them some fact they will not understand if they do not really know what the topic is about . with the concept you have you can explain every small detail they want to know and they will understand , because you know what you are talking about . another point is about idea . in contrary to fact you do not have to copy idea , you can make your own mind of something . understanding an idea mean to understand someone opinion , you can support the opinion or you reject it and build your own opinion . this special point is very important to me , i really unlike people who do not even have their own opinion , because i can not talk to them and they just agree what i tell them . to come to an end i want to say that it is very important to give idea and concept to student , because they are going to learn to think on their own and to build an own opinion . we should not leave out fact , because their are good to keep in mind but not to express yourself .
