as for a i am concerned , i agree with this statement . young people enjoy life more than olderpeople do , because young people have activeness in body , eagerness in mind and health support by the age , which are not related to old people . as i am a representative to young people , i support my openoin in my word . most probably we are like to advantures , from those only we get more enjoy ment . try to catch a running bus , get down from a fastmoving van and trecking so on are some example of the source of enjoyment for young people , which are not possible for the old . because these thing can be possible only if the muscle of the body cooperate . similarly to introduce new thing to the world , like by completing more and more project in lesser time . normally young people do n't have the problem like lack of memory , which is a common thing for old . completing the project lead to invention of some new thing , from which we get heartful enjoyment a we are part of the leader of the world , where always `` the new '' can be appreciated . health support is another most important facot for enjoyment . as young people , we can play game and sport , where the most people getting relax and work hard for the next event . another important thing is that some people getting their enjoyment by helping to the physically handicapped and very old people by properly let to cross the heavy traffic highway through some society ( social service ) , this type of enjoyment is not adopted by the old , because they only have to get help from others . but the old people are very much important to give guideline for the youth , without the guiding of old people to youth , they cant do thing perfectly . so , i can conclude that youth can enjoy a lot than the oldpeople because of the stamen , activeness and memory power .
