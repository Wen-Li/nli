i agree with the statement a i believe that a person can be identified a a successful person only if it is able to face different situation and to take it own risk . an example that can support what i wrote is the analysis of the attitude of one of the top manager a such people , to be identified a successful , have to be able to deal with every kind of situation . thinking about a top manager we can conclude that it added value is to solve a problem when it appears by risking it own name . reading newspaper we know , for example , that company facing a difficult period look for people that can be able to find solution . the manager is able to analysis the problem finding a solution by using it own expertise and knowledge . a the prblem is solved and that company is no more in trouble , the real successful person doe not feel any more confortable with a calm reality and tend to look for something other . successful people have the great skill to have something more that normal people and they have the `` moral duty '' to offer such knowledge to others . trying new thing and affording risk is the only way a person ha to show others the skill it ha and the capability it ha to express . i conclude by saying that if a skilled and potentially successfull person doe not want to isk and to try new experience loss a great opportunity and can not be identified a a successful person .
