i think to be succecssful you do n't need to do different thing but to do thing differently . success : what is success and what the essential ingredient which make a situation or a person successful ? in simple term , success is acheiving goal with maximing efficiency . to set goal for himself and envision the future is what successful man do differently . in life everybody make series of decision and it depends on the permutation and combination of tho decision which destines how a person or a situation will come out finally . how much a person is ready to take risk will determine how commited he is to his goal . coupled with this commitment an innovative approach will imparts maximum efficiency to an endevour . i want to give example of mr. dhirubhai ambani who established reliance empire in le than a life-time . he started his career in a gas station a fuelman in some distant middle eastern country . he decided to quit his job there come back to india and use stock excahnge to new height . he ha to his credit making stock market familar to common man . stock market did exist before his advent but common man wa quite aloof from it . he gained most of his financial strength from people 's money . he also used the political spectrum of the era to greater use for the well being of his business . he wa most political savvy businessman of his time which others never though of using . things were existing before him entering the business sphere but he gave a real meaning to them and shown the world how to use thing . this example make it amply clear that it is how you do a thing that matter and not what you do .
