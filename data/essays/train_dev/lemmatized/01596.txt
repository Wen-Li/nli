i do not agree with the statement that in twenty year fewer car will be in use than there are today , because of the importance of car a a mean of transportation . in a globalized world car have very much influence on our whole life . they are an important mean of transportation in trade a well a a mean of a flexible lifestyle . without car the exchange of good in a globalized world would be much more complicated . also the exchange of people , in the sense of employee and worker , would be much more difficulty . many people depend on their car to reach work . for example people who are working in frankfurt or other big city are often forced to drive many hour to their place of work , because they can not afford appartments in the city to life in . without a car they would be forced to move house or to find work next to their home , which is in many case because of the high unemployment not possible . without a car people would not be flexible any longer . they would be forced to take the bus or the train , which are often overcrowded , late and in the case of train in germanz very expansive . the limitation of car would have a deep impact on the whole society . if there would be le car it would be necessary to replace them by other source of transportation , like train or bus . today many city lack the financial capacity to finance such a big project . because car vary in their price and are therefore also accesible for people with a smaller amount , many people will keep buying them in the future . to come to a conclusion i would say that today car are an important mean of transportation a well a a status symbole , and will therefore increase in the future .
