when we reading the newspaper in the morning , watching tv or walking along a mall we indirect recognize that the number of advertisments increasing . all these advertisments promise that this product will be the best and will make you successfull and provide you a comfortable life . the question is , if the promise will get real ? short time ago i read an article of an bulb supplier . this brand supplier promised that the bulb which this company produce are have a better quality , a higher lifecycle and the efficency is any percent higher than all competitive product . in order to save energy i trust this ad and bought a lot of these bulb and i payed more than for a competitor product . i wa happy to get a high quality product . a few day later the first bulb wa defect . i brougth it not back to the store beacuse it is more expensive to drive to the store . a few day later i met a friend . he told me that he visited the factory which produce these bulb . he explained that million of bulb where produced and the last process of the production is the brand stamp on the glass and the packaging . he explained that the same produced bulb will get different brand or noname stame and will get different packaging box . this mean that the same produced product , with the same quality and the same effectivity will be sold with a higher brand price and a lower noname price . i checked the different brand and noname product he told me and found out that only the price ha a difference . as conclusion of this i will no more trust any advertisments . advertisements are designed to sell product . they promising a lot but not the truth .
