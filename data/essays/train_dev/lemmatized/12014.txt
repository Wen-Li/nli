nowadays we see many advertisement everywhere , on television or in newspaper , on radio or in all street of our city ; furthermore the advertisement business is always bigger and this is the reason for the importance of spot . i think that a lot of product shown in advertisement are worse than they appear . in my opinion there is one mainly reason for this situation . first of all the purpose of advertisments is to get people to buy the product , so producters try to show u that their thing are the better on trade . there are many way to make product much better than they really are . thanks to tecnhology we can make many change on a photo or on a imagine in order to show it better , and all of advertisement are made in this way . in addiction we see many advertisement in which the product are n't in their natual `` habitat '' ; we must think about water spot : the bottle is always near a river or at the top of an high mountain to make water seems pure and genuine . i remember a motorcycle spot in which a man with his scooter followed a militar airplane in order to convey much power to the motorcycle . .. have you never seen a scooter that can follow an airplane ? in our society we give much importance to movement ; according to this situation many advertisement are much movimented ; i think about a machine that trasforms himself in a monster and dance exactly like human . in conclusion i think that most advertisement are worse than they appear because of business scope .
