nowadays student have lost their interest on the procedence of idea and concept . as time go on , there are fewer student interested in answering question such a `` how newton 's law wa conceived and what is it mathematical basis ? '' or `` how steel wa first created from it natural constituent ? '' students are loosing that curiosity in how fact are conceived due to lack of interest in thing they think already exist and do not need to be studied again by them because it wa already clarified century ago by someone else . insteed they rather learn and understand the final result obtained year ago , which have been put under evaluation several time through all these year . to explain further this point , let u take a look at the two example mentioned at the beginning of this essay : newton 's law . back in isaac newton 's time it surely wa surely important to prove his second law of motion by measuring the time a body last in free falling motion frorm a determined height . nowadays student do not care for proving this theory by implementing their own experiment : they rather studied the formula developed by newton and applied it in a physic problem with only one purpose : to get a good degree at the end of the course . now let u take a look at the second example : the manufacture of steel . there is a big theory on this field and research is still carried out on it . many culture were involved in the early year or the iron era , and a lot of experiment were carried out to study how iron reacted with air to produce steel : many manufacturing thecniques were studied to come with the idea of using high temperature furnace to produce steel . this last result is the one that matter for student ; they are only interested in understanding how steel is formed in a chemical reaction in order to get a good grade once again . they do not care on proving themselves that steel can be manufactured in such way . the reason why student act this way ha already been mentioned : they are told to wory only about a degree , and they are not allowed to let the mind think about what they really like . it would be better if student were allowed to study what they really like . in this way , a student who really like chemistry and physic will be surely wondering about the fact , while a student who want to developed an artistic talent such a painting , doe not have to worry about thing he doe not really care .
