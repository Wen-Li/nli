i strongly agree this statement . i think sucessful people mean people received reputation , money , status and so on for rewarding what they 've done good for the society . the thing which society appreciates are something simply new or something which give society new value or new perspective . so it ha to be in some way new - no one else found the same way before . if i define sucess 's meanig a above , people need to be brave to take risk to find `` new '' . and i think only doing what they already know how to do well is not enought to find new . they might find something new by chance , but it is not enough to succeed . for examle , we can say wright brother in europe , who are famous for invention of airplaine , `` successful people '' . they are still remembered by people for what they 've done for so long time . they took a risk of dying by failing to fly and looking insane by doing something which nobody else had done before as a result , they found something new - how to fly by airplaine . this is the typical success by trying new thing and taking risk . and i believe these attitude are essential for anyone to be successful people . for another example , in our society , if we pick up someone who are well-known - bill gates , calros gone and so on . if we read the biography of them , it tell u how they found their way and received reputation . they do n't afraid to fail . even if they fail , they never give up and stick to their motivation to explore new thing and never stop taking risk . history tell u
