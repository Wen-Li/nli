the way to travel that someone can choose is highly related with her/his personnality . there is basically two way to travel : the first one would be to travel in a group leading by a guide and the itinerary is known before the departure , and decided in an certain amount of time . the second way would be to travel on our own , and the itinerary will be mostly directed by the people we meet and place we outlined before the departure . in this essay , i will discus in the first paragraph the advantage that a travel in a group ha , and in the second paragraph , the disadvantage that it implies . when travelling in a group , we are more lucky to meet people who share the same way to think . it can be a way for people who have issue in communication to meet people and open themselves . it 's also probably for people who doe n't want to travel alone , and enjoy having time with people they do n't know . on the point of view of the travel itself , travelling with a guide ha the advantage to learn thing about the country visited that would be propbably harder to know if travelling alone . tour guide travel are also made to see the most of thing and landscape , to experience local tradition in a few amount of time . however , this kind of travel give not place for the adventure and for unexpected experience . by travelling by ourself , we have the right of decision on where we want to go and when . we can decide to stay longer in a place that we enjoy . it 's also more probable to meet local people and directly experience the culture , in contrary to the travel tour , in which culture are translated and explained by the tour guide , in our own language . the fact to be in direct relation with the local used language is , for my part , of importance in travel . to conclude , for my part , i disagree on the fact that travel in a tour travel is the best way to travel . however , i do n't think there is a best way to travel in general , but everybody ha it own best way to travel . for me , the adventure and liberty in decision are important to travel .
