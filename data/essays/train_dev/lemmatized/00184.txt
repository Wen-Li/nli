successful people use to take risk in the project that they are involved in . in my own opinion , these people are success because they innovate , they are not scare of the risk and they are confident in their posibilities . i believe that these three personal feature are requiered to be a talent and succesful person nowadays . firstly , innovating is necessary to achieve better result . if you prove always the same thing in the same manner you will obtain the same result . innovation could give you a new way of doing think . for that reason , i support that those people who innovate could be closer to successed than those who do not . secondly , to be a risky person mean not be scare about the future . from my point of view those who are not afraid about the future bad consequence of their action have more time to concentrate in their action . therefore , think more in how to progress and inprove their day to day life than in regreating about what they did in the past . third , be confident is a very important personal characteristic . because , those who have a winner opinion their believe in their possibility . in addition , this kind of people dare to perform whatever they have planned . so , they do in an optimistic way . to sum up , successful people have the combination of these three personal quality . the strong point of their achievement is do not do the thing that already know that work . these people innovates , risk and prove themselves that they can do it better .
