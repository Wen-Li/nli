there is a general notion among the older generation that today 's youth are irresponsible and are not socially concious . they feel that young people do not care about their community or their nation a a whole . i disagree . true , the older generation can proudly boast of all the help that they have done to their community and their nation . take the case of the fight for indian independence in the first half of the 20th century . the youth at that time were very social concious . they were passionate about their country and involved themselves in various freedom movement . some of them were ready to die fighting for their country , such wa their vigour and devotion towards their country . similar case can be seen throughout the world at that time when the world wa undergoing a change with two world war and decolonilisation taking place . but in no way can the older generation assert that the younger generation do not give enough time to help their community . today 's youth may not have the social and political awareness that their parent and grand parent have , but it is incorrect to see today 's youth a irresponsible and bound by consumerism . young people are wrongly accused of having a do n't - care attitude towards their community . there are many instance that overturn this notion . for example , in my colony , it is the young people who organize festival and program to celebrate and rejoice with their community a a whole . i can often see college going student give lift to old people who are too old to travel in public transportation , in their vehicle . the recent bollywood movie ` rang de basanti ' depicts four young men who eliminate a corrupt politician for the good of the society . therefore , it is wrong to believe that young people only think about where their next date will be or when they will see their next movie . they are very respnsible towards their society .
