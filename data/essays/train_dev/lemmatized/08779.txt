successful prople try new thing and take risk and not just confining themselves to field they already know . they do use their existing knowledge to try new thing . using their existing expertise they develop courage and bent of mind to look into new aspect and find out the new thing . successful people try new thing . they look into other aspect and do not fear from looking deeper into that . every body knew that apple fall towards earth but only einstein aked the question `` why '' and dared to find out the reality . he didnt simply accept that thing are like this . he investigated into this and today we have the explanation for many phenomenon based on his theory only . today we have many technological advancement going on . many scientist are working on those finding . if these scientist had not taken the risk of exploring new thing we would have been still in the same state a our ancestor . these scientist were successful a they tried new thing and worked hard to find them . all the discovery owe their allegiance to successful scientist who tried to find new thing . had the columbus not set on a sail to prove the earth is round he would not have discovered a new country . success always favour those who take risk . industrialisation is occuring at rapid pace . persons setting them up are not neccessory technocrat . but they want to try new thing and hence taking risk . ideas are no one 's property . every one can think new and work for them . but only those who beleive in them and work on them are successful . they work and gain the expertise slowly . the fear of being getting failed and not taking risk can not bring success . if a child doesnot take the risk of running he will never become good athlete . all the successful businessmen are there a they tried new thing that were later on accepted by the whole society . at the same time some may say that if a person work on what he know he will be more successful . this is true to some extent but in the same field also he need to think differenly and try new thing . if a persn continues to work on what he know , he will not be able to expand his horizon of knowledge . to gain perfection also he need to try new thing and take the risk . thus it can be said that for success in any field whether known or not there is need to try new thing nad take risk . the fear of being failure and not looking at new aspect can not bring success .
