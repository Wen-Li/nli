i personally would n't agree with that statement for few reason . first of all , young people , sometimes , enjoy life in a very stupid way , not taking into account the result and sequenses , while older people usually have more wisodm that younger people . it is hard to argue about this topic for a simple reason . since we have to consider different point of vews , `` enjoying life '' have so many different meaning . for instance , a priest might be enjoying his life with no wife or child , stuck in his house and the church in what might be enjoyable for him . other people might be enjoying their life by addicting to drug and smoking . i might not seem vey right for me , but that 's the fun of life for other people . so what i am trying to say here is that it is important and crucial to know and interpret what doe enjoying life mean . another thing here is that we have to take the circumstance . for example , if i am living in a country of people . in the simplest case senario , let 's see how people in different regoins on earth are living . i don not think that young people in poor country of africa or in iraq are enjoying themselves ver much . if we now compare those young people to older people living a better life , them i can assure you that those older people , having a better taste of life , are enjoying themsleves much more that young people . i know that i wa supposed to discus the statement it self , but according to the information given , i could n't tell who is going to enjoy life more . the statement doe not tell the circumistances of people , so at the end i will ask you this question '' ; who is going to enjoy life more ? is it misrable young people or old peple riding fasny car , living in million dollar house ?
