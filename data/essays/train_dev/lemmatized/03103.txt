young people are the futers communitie . i disagree whith that for several reason . first , they are helping there community by living in it . second , they are studing real hard to acheave something to represent there community . finally , they are doing community project all there life . the existance of young people in a communite give it the strength to survive . young people usually spread joy , happyness , and movement whithin the place there at . for example , a house full of child is usually loud an crouded which brings the sence of life in the speret . on the contrast of the childe free house which are quite and boring . the student are bulding there community . when a student is studing to become a doctor or an engeneer or a fireman , he is doing his communety one of the biggest help his community could ever get . he is going to give hid community someone who could cure the sick or help the fritened or give the homeless a shelter . the young people are project for there community . the successful life of the young is the hope of the old . the young people have alot of goal to achive , alot of dream to presode , and every acomplishment for them is an acomplishment for their community . when a young person achives a high goal he make his whole community proud . to conclude , the young people are the harte of the community . they are the doctor , angeneers , fireman , and every important thing of the futer . they are there commities success and faliar . even if it doe n't seam that there making time for community serf , they are serving there community all there time .
