before responding to the question , it 's important to consider actual problem that young people have to face every day . nowadays it 's more difficult for young people to find a job than in the past . they must study very much and hard to increase their chance . competition is a key point that stesses people who need also to be a more skilled a possible . so they need to attend university and more time is required to end their study . for the same reason , their parent have le time to look after and educate them , expecially if the mother is not a housework . in fact , the society demand is greater than in the past in all field , and it requires more speed . so people run from one place to another to respect their appointment . the result is that young people are more stessed and not enough educated . my experience suggests me that this guy will grow up with many problem than people who have parent who love them and teach them how to behave . generally , they are more individualist and prefer to spend their time playing videogames and not helping their relative or the community . this could lead to problem in the society that are difficult to resolve . this is the common sense , but i do n't completely agree with this thesis . there are many young people that spend their time in good activity . for esample , when i wa a teenager , i frequently helped my relative in their job , or the prist in the church that i frequented . i know many teenager that every day spend their time in hospital , or simply they help their grandparent at home .
