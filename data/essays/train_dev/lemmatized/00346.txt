we can wonder how the amount of car in the next twenty year will evolve . in the one hand , we can think there will be le car in twenty year . we can imagine that the development of public transport will keep going in the two next decade . thus , people would avoid taking car for bus , metro or train . moreover , car need energy to work , and this energy come at the time being from oil . the cost of oil ha been increased for the last ten year and it is absolutely possible that it will be the same thing in the next twenty year . if the situation of oil price will be worst and worst , so people will not want have a car any more . it would be too expensive . finally , the environmental matter will force government not to promote car selling , despite of automobile firm . in the other hand , there also are argument which tell the amount of car will increase . one of them is the possibility of car using high technology , a electricity instead of oil in the motor . these car , if they exist , could be cheaper because they would need a common energy . besides , in many country , china for instance , have currently a big increase of their economy . a huge medium class is being formed in china and china is already the third market in the world . if the purchase power keep growing in the next decade , it could have more car than now there . the example of china can be applied in many developping region . one complicated question is difficult to answer . will people move more and more , and by the same use their car more and more , in the next twenty year ? i think that it depends on the coutries . in europe , where the population will be older in twenty year than now , we can think that people will work by being retired , and use more their car . in developping country , the population may work le than now , thanks to best social condition of living . there would therefore use more a car . so , i globally disagree with this statement .
