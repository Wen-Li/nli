nowadays , more and more people like thaveling , may be i think the reason why is that those who live in the big city will always feel so busy and noisy , so so traveling becomes a part of their life , but traveling ha many way to reach your requirement , some people like traveling with a guide in a group , and others are not , although the more people you travel with , the happier you will be , i think , but , i like traveling with myself . first , if i travel by myself , there is nothing to limited me , i can go anywhere whatever i want , i mean i can get rid of those sound from the guild and noisy people , for example , if i want to go shoping , but the guild is calling you , so i think i have no mood to buy or to see , on the other hand , you will feel so bad noisy form those people in your group when you buying thing , all of these will destroy your mood . secondly , if i travel by myself , i can assign the time instead the guild do , such a going to the hotel , when should i get up next morning and so on , for example , if i watch a football game tonight , so i think i ca n't get up early next morning , i have alternative choice , or if i eating thing , i can relax myself to enjoy it , but if you travel with a group , you must follow the time which arange by the guide , so i think there is no freedom for me to do everything . third , i think every one like to do something which they want to do , so travel by oneself is a good choice for these people , and they can get relax , freedom , and get rid of noisy form big city , so i prefer to travel by myself .
