some people say that it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subject than to specialize in one specific subject . in my opinion , i think it is good for a person to have a background in many subject . however , he must concentrate on one subject which will be his major in college and the field of his job . each person should ha one specialized subject . a doctor can not be a civil engineering at the same time . there are many reason why i think specialization in knowledge is better . first , every society must consist of people that have knowleges about different subject . as the human body contains different member that work independently and consistently , the society need individual with different job and way of thinking . in addition , people are different in what they are interested in and we can not find a person who interested in all academic subject . for example , i like computer engineering but hate medicine whereas my brother 's interest are just the opposite of mine . besides , human brain is limited and a person can not be creative in many field . this century is not like the past when one scintist , like newton , wa shining in physic and mathematics . as we have noticed , society must consists of people of different knowleges and it is impossible to find a person who is creative in many academic field . therefore , i disagree with the idea which say that it is better to study many academic course than to specialize in one specific field .
