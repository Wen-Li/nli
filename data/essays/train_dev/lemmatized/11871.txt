i gree with the statement that people who try new thing and take risk usually turn successful than those who only do what they already know how to do well . first of all , i believe creativeness is one of the most fundamental essence for human invention . all valuable invention in the past happened because people then were creative in responding to specific difficulty or need of the situation . without creativeness , one need to abide by the negative condition or hardship . i strongly believe one can learn greatly from failure a well and taking risk will eventually bring the person a profit in the long run . some people may argue that some traditional culture are better preserved a they are , and i agree with this opinion in principle . however , preserving the culture can take different way than just leaving them unchanged or untouched . for example , it is often reported that the traditional craftmanship is at danger of being lost because of the change in people 's lifestyle . in such case , the tradition can be preserved by adopting it style to the modern way , still using the accumulated knowledge or skill to make that happen . without such challenge , that specific tradition may be at more risk of extinction than taking up a creative change . in conclustion , i stronfly believe that being creative and ready to take risk is a very important factor for people to be successful , and hope i will be so in the face of upcoming challenge that i may encounter by studying abroad .
