in my opinion , young people enjoy life more than older people do for three reason : the younger people have more energy to do something fun , they have greater choice in living their life , and lastly they are not a serious about life a the older people are . the youg people enjoy life more than old people do because they have more energy to do something fun than older people . when people are young they have better body structure for producing energy therefore young people can do anything they want to do with that energy whereas old people can not because of their age and health problem . another reason why i think young people enjoy life more than older people do is because young people have greater choice . while people are young , they like doing something adventurous therefore they tend to bring in a many choice a they can in to their life . in the other hand , most older people doe n't like to do adventurous thing because they usually have family under their control and they do n't want to risk their family and settled life being advantageous . lastly , because young people are not a serious about their life a the old people are i think the young people enjoy life more than older people do . usually young people do n't worry about being so mature and serious a much a the old people do . as a result , they are more progressive in living thier life . when old people often think what they should do and not in deciding something , the young people just try to do whatever they want do to . therefor
