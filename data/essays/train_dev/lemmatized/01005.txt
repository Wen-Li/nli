i agree with the statement . a successful person might take a risk instead of doing what he or she already know . a successful man is a person that know nearly everything about his work . his knowledge is the fundament of his good work so he might be successful . the question is if such a person would take a risk to gain maybe more money or more success . if a person know everything about a topic he or she might be better in speculating about the futur . a successful owner of a store must know how to lead the store . because of his knowledge he might know how much money he could invest in making the store more effective or more successful . it may be a risk to invest a high ammount of money because the owner speculats that there will be buyer that will buy his product . but if the owner is right , and in the next time is something like an unseen event that make the place where his store is more atractive to the people he will be more successful . not only the ammount of money but even the time of investment must be right . a successful person must know when the time might be rigt to invest . if this person know the system the risk is more transparent to him or her , so he or she might take the risk . a successful person might be also creative , thats one of the fault he or she is successful . a creative idea is always something within a risk , but the difference is that a successful person might know the risk better . another point is that a person that never failed with their work doe not know how it is to be wrong or to be not successful . this person might feel save in every action he or she might take , so this person will try something new without fearing something bad . a person that is not so gifted might not have investment idea or any idea of improving the situation so he or she would continue their work a the already know without any risk . so from my point of view the statement given in the question is correct .
