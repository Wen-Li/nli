i do not think travelling in a group led by a tour guide is the best way to travel . there are some reason i do not prefer . first , tour will limit u where to go . although it will be much cheaper than going alone the tour might not be a what you have thought . you might want to see around other place but since it is moving with group , you will not able to go by only your feeling . secondly , the tour guide will decide the time they are looking , so you are not able to see it a long a you want . different from travelling by yourself , a tour want to go many place a possible to have more customer . so they are not able to take enough time to see each place because they have to go next on time . this might be ok for some people , but others might think they are not satisfied . thirdly , there will be many other people that you do not know each other . this will make you feel tired and no privercy . it will make you feel tired by it is not only by yourself , so you have to make rule to have the trip smooth . but for any reason you are going to the trip , i think they want to get away from every day life . so this will not let you feel freely if you have to make rule . from these reason , i prefer travelling by ourselves might be the best way to travel . traveling by ourselves might cost higher , but you are able to plan the trip freely a you think and do what ever you want to make it satisfied . i am sure this kind of trip will be greater than going in a group led by a tour guide .
