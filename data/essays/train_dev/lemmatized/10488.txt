during thier study , student face different approach to work on different material . these approach focus either on the learning either on the understanding . they depend on their teacher and on the material itself . so is it more important for the student to understand idea and concept or to learn fact ? first of all , from my point of view , learning fact seems to be a good way to study . according to scientist the memory work like a muscle . therefore it ha to exercise to become more and more efficient . in addition i agree on the fact that learning fact is an efficient method to get a big amount of knowledge during the study . however , a far a i 'm concerned , learning fact is necessary but not sufficicent . on the one hand , this approach should be undertaken in order to get a background on different materails . on the other hand it doe n't efficiently prepare student to their futur life . so this method ha to be completed by the other approach . for me by understanding idea and concept , student know how to adapt to different situation they could face later . for example , in their professional life they wo n't only be asked to use the fact they have learnt during their study . for me by understanding idea and concept they learn a particular way of thinking that could be apply in differents case . thus this last approach is more important for me . indeed their availability to analyse and adapt to a special situation come from their faculty to understnad . to conclude , i approve that it is more important for student to understand idea and concept . however these two approach seem to be complementary . in a certain extent .
