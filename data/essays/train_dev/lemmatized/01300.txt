advertisments are very influental , they can form somebody 's opinion about a certain product or even change an alreday fixed opinion . the bad thing about that is , that most often it make product seem better than they really are . advertisment on tv or radio can show product from their best angle . if you look at food for example , how perfect a hamburger from mac donald 's look on tv . makes you feel hungry doe n't it ? have you ever seen a hamburger look that nice in real life ? another example is the realty business , you can make a property , house or flat look really good on photo in magazine but if you would be able to see the house in reality it might not have a back wall ! another point industry often make in advertisments , is the cheap prize , yellow shoe from humanic for example , are so much cheaper than the one from clarks . that kind of advertisment tempts you to buy the product because of it low cost , but if you had never heard about the product you would never have needed it at all and could have saved all the money . companies manufacturing cosmetic article , cremes for example , they state what kind of ingredient they add to make your wrinkle show le or even vanish in short time . but when you look at the law that the cosmetic industry ha to follow , something totally different is revealed . they are not allowed to use any ingredient that change the context of the skin . so how is it the new anti-wrinkle creme supposed to work ? of course advertisment not only ha bad point , it also show you new thing that have been invented and what product is the cheapest at the moment , but you have to think carefully before deciding what to buy , never believe everything that is said in the advertisments and always decide if you really need whatever is on sale . always take what is said in an advertisment about specific quality of a product a a base knowledge but make enquiry and look in person at whatever you want to buy ! a beautiful gold necklace might be made to fit your daughter 's neck instead of yours !
