i agree with this idea . because , i think for be successful people they need have confidence themself decision and think . so , i think if , people who scared of risk or do n't want to take risk . that kind person ca n't be successful people . because , i think this word is realistic and useful for this world `` no risk no return . '' `` high risk high return . '' successful people they have confidence themselves . so , they can creat new thing and they can try to new thing . if people do n't have confidence themselves , they ca n't creat anything . how they even can try new thing . that mean is they even can take a risk . if , people feel satisfy and they tend to defence itself about sociallity position and money . according that word `` no risk no return '' i think they just will lose money and position . if people feel satisfaction about their potision and money , they do n't want do anything without difende themselves . people gearn money from their move . even smart people or people who do n't have any creer and skill , they ca n't earn money without move . so , simply people who only do defence , they ca n't earn money . although , they need money for defence themselves .
