i remember me surrounded by my friend planting tree in the backyard of our neighbourhood . those day are gone , now we do not have time to plant tree , to organize charity market in which we sell old close to save money to decorate or beautify or community . i totally agree that young people do not use time in helping the community . but the question is why ? in my opinion young people should be spending more time in the activity that involve the neighbourhood , just because we are young , and with this i mean we are strong , with energy . .. so we are in the addecuate state in our life to do this . the problem is that nowadays life is really different a it used to be . today you have to be competitive if you want to have success in the real world , and young people know that . we are concerned about the lacking of job so we spent our time studying and learning language , getting skill and knowledgements that make u overweight the competence . and a a result we do n't have time for other leisure activity . the other point is that now the neighbourhood system is regulated by the townhall , now it would be unimaginable for me seeing small child planting tree on the street , there are law that regulates the decoration of a city . so that is another reason why young people can not help in their community , because the system doe not allow them . but anyway , sometimes i think we have gone to far , that nowadays we are so worried about our economic future that we do not have time for other important activity . maybe a cure to this business blindness will be to obliy u to take part in some social work , like a community service , of course regulated by the townhall . so helping others might open up our eye a little bit and we discover that sometimes helping people around you provides you more personal benefit than a good job could do .
