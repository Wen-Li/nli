i believe that in twenty year , there will be more car than there are today . population is increasing , the age requirement for driver 's lincenses are dropping , people choose personal car over public transport and the building boom in third world country have increased the need for transportating matirials . with all of these reason , it is more likely that there will be more car in the future despite minor setback . the population in the world is rising , and with more people there will be more car for them to travel in . in many third world country , like china and india , where economy is booming a family normally ha 6-10 child who grow up to fill up the ever growing job caused by the growing economy . and although not all of those child survive , half of them grown up to work that requires car becuase most of their work place are not walking distance . also , many people today seek comfort and so a family might own more than one car so that the father could go to work , and the mother could drive the kid to school , ect . i have seen many family that have more than two car actually . also with more and more people today choosing to stay single and not marry , this cause there to be more car because family share their car and single people own their own . ( or maybe even two ) this double the number in car and will continue to do so a long a people choose to stay single for a longer period of time . also many people also get sick of their current model and covets a newer model without selling their old car which double the car number in each household . the age requirement to aquire a driver 's license ha been decreasing . for example in kansas it is now 15 instead of 18 , in the philippines it is 17 instead of 18 , and in korea it is now 18 instead of 21 . the younger they allow kid to drive car , the more car you will need , because there will be people reaching the required age sooner than before . i also would n't be suprised to have the age requirement lowerd even more within the next 20 yeras . another reason that we might have more car in the future is that we are a growing world , economically and industrially . there are a lot of factory , resort , hotel , house and other building being built and they all need car ( truck ) to transport matirials to the alotted place . cities are expanding and more and more people are wanting to find recluse place that they can reside and rest in which require truck and car to haul thing down to those place . you might say that gas price keep going up which will counter act the increase in car , but statistic show that if people really want to use car , ( and they are very convenient ) gas price will not daunt them from driving and owning car . also hybrid car are being developed , which can be charged by solar battery rather than using gas consumption . so with the increase in population , decrease in age requirement , increase in builidng construction , and the increase of comfort seeking people , i think that there will be a lot more car in 20 year than in the present .
