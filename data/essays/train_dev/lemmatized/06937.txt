i disagree with the idea that it is more important for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact . this is two reanson . first of the reason is we should learn fact because we have to know what happen in the each country and get a information from learn fact . for instance , when i learned some fact by someting . i got to understand what happen nowaday and if i do n't know eveything about fact . i can not explain to people waht happened yesterday or today . second of the reason is we do not have to understand idea and concept . because we could understand idea and concept any time . but fact have to learn than understand idea and concept . if we miss to learn fact , we could not learn anymore that happen . so we can get more skill and knowledge if we lerned fact . for examle , when i tried to understand idea and concept , it wa much harder to understand , but when i tried to learn fact , it wa easy to understand and i wa interest them . therefore , i disagree with the idea that it is more important for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact .
