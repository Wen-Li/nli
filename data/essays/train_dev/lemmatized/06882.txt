in my view it is always helpful to have lot of interest in acquiring a much information in every field or subject rather than to concentrate merely on one subject . as far a i am concerned individual will shine if he continues to gain knowledge through out his entire life , more so in different field a world is changing faster . as a child i wa doing lot better in most of the subject during my secondary school . but i never wa domonating in any one subject . this continued when i wa in intermediate , which used to worry me a bit , a after the higher education there wa an entrance exam for which i had to score very good in academic subject . but my maternal uncle who wa close to me suggested to make a slight alteration to my study pattern and concentrate on subject which will be tested for the exam , but said to remember one important thing that jack of all trade is better than master of none . while i wa studying 10th standard i had a friend who wa good in natural science . but he never used to concentrate on other subject a he found them uninteresting and worthless . because of his attitude he got lot lower mark in the final and could not qualify for the state government higher education college . he had to settle with a private college . the main important reason for his descendancy is by gaining lot of knowledge in one particular field , he might have thought that he ha nothing to learn further and stop learning all of a sudden , which is a dangerous pattern for any individual . also he might have got bored and stopped concentrating on other topic a a whole . the above example in my life convinced me that by gaining knowledge of many issue and topic will help you interact more expressively with your colleague and make you more socially interactable . also with changing world all the time every second , by keeping this attitude in your mind , will help you adapt quickly and smoothly .
