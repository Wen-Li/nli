i think that it is good idea to go trip a a group with a guide . this is because tourist are able to know and get knowledge from the guide who know a lot of thing about the place . if it is possible , people should have a guide and get knowledge from them because it can be nice oppotunity . the point is that people are travel to see other place where they are not live in their usual daily life . therefore , it is more reasonable to study other culture and thinking . those idea will probably help to make their thinking wider . in other word people who have seen many different country or place are able to think everything more critically and logically , because they know why the culture are differnt by taking a lecture of guide . also , it is important to make the group . the first reason is that people can learn from others , not only from the guide . if somebody in your grop can share the knowlege with you , it is great oppotunity to know other cultural thinking . if i compare group tour to private tour , it is clear that a person who is in a grop tour can think more different way beaacsue ther are others who ha another idea which he ha . in other hand , a person who take tour by himself is going to keep his own idea , beacasue there are no others who provide othe point of view to him . the guide is the person who is specializing to teach history or local knowledge about him or her palace . as i mentioned in above , it is neccessary to know other culture because you may think everything from many point of view . also , making group is easier way to understand how other people feel and think . therefore i think that the best way to travel is a group led by a tour guide .
