it is hard for me to choose on whether learning the idea and concept are more important than learning the fact . the two concept given are kind of completing each other so choosing one and leaving one out would create problem . still i would say that when starting to work on a new subject or issue it is really important to first understand the concept and idea because without them it is worthless to learn fact that you would not have something to base the new information and the new idea given or tought to you . as a metaphor i might say that the idea and the concept can be seen a the cement and the new fact can be the new room being decorated in an apartment that wa built with that cement . leading from this metaphor still i can say that the fact so the room are important too because without them why would you build an apartment ? as a student what i generally do is that , firstly i start and try to understand the deep concept and idea then i work on with the fact which help me to understand more in a much deeper way and the most important thing with the concept and idea part is that they are most effective tool for me to analyze the fact offered and given .
