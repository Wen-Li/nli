the tour in group is always an approved hobby for many people around the world . the vacation become easier a the plane and other transportation become usable . people will travel in group because it is more fun than traveling alone and it will remain a the long time memory . the tourist group can be on the bus or by walking the city or other palces by the tourist guide explains the significant of each place such a it history and us . although a group can learn a lot from tourist guide leading them while explaining each place , it is more fun and best to tour in group by themselves looking at the handy travel book . the travel to europe , pacific islands , asia , and many other place is becoming famous now a day . these place are popoular to travel in group with friend , family , or relative . i have been to hawaii a a band trip a year ago . when there , we did have a guide when we were riding on the bus and visting many recreational place . it wa fun to learn from those funny guide and walking around with them , but most fun part of the trip wa a free time . at free time , we did not have any guide with u that it wa fun to get to go to anywhere we want . those place were beach , the dole plantation , the polynesian cultural center , and many other place . it wa really fun to walk around in the palces with my friend . traveling by ourselves 's most crucial part is that we get to any where we want , because with the guide , the tour is already setted up and we do not have much time in our own . because the trip to hawaii wa with the school field trip , the guide and sheparones were needed in our trip . if i have a chance to go to hawaii or different place another time , i would definately go in group with my friend without the a tour guide .
