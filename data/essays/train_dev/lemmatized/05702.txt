many people have diffrent idea about whether they have to chose the risk or a normal life . i agree with people who take the risk to successful by trying new thing . to be a succssful person intends to take the risk for several reason . first of all , a successful peron ha more ability to discover thing than the other . he or she will be able to develope her or himself in many thing . for example , to be a good singer you have to try to go in front of people and let them lestian to your songes . i called that a risk because not all people would support you but they will give you thier oppinon whether you get the level where you are ablr to start . the second a succssful people have to take many chance whether they get a benfit even thought they make mistake . no argument about whcih learning any thing come with make mistake . trying to do thing and you faild doe n't mean you lost somthing . it mean you get more information about what have you been doing . for example , one day i wa trying to fix my laptop suddenly i broke the keyboard . so i learned that i have to pay more attintion with these machains beacuse it is a flexible . third , we are not be able to survive if ther is no one take the risk . most people are rely on the others so they wo n't do anu thing . however , if people will have done that we woild gotten any technical thing a whay we are using now adays . these thing come out if taking it risk . for example , findig the oil under the ground wa a drastik decition had been made by the united england back in many year . they work hard to find all vaulbe thing that help u to live our life . in conclustion , to be a successful persone ha it own risk but it help for many thing . we are not be be able to accomblish in our klife if did n't take these riskes .
