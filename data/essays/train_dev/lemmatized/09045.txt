today , we can see a lot of people who are around u enjoy their life happily . some people go abroad and have good experience . other people go to the beach and relex . however , i think , most of people who enjoy their life are order people . in my opinion , young people do n't have many opportunity to enjoy their life . firstly , most young people have to study for their future . they have to go to school and stay in school for half of the day . so , they do n't have many chance to play around . for instance , i am in grade 12 and go high school and so busy about doing a lot of homework and choosing an university for my future . although i have no time to enjoy my life , i went to rocky mountain with my friend . however , the experience wa not that greate because i had to keep thinking about school and university . morevoer , order people can enjoy their life more than young people because they have much time to enjoy . many order people quit their job and have enough money from the job to relex . so , they can travel around the world for a long time rather than young people . for instance , my homestay mom 's mother is staying in canada for four month . she can stay even for a year because my homestay mom provides food , money , and room for her . furthermore , young people usually do n't have enough money to enjoy their life . usually , young people get money from their parent . because of that reason , they may not have enough money to travel or enjoy . in conclusion , order people enjoy their life more than young people because they may have much time to enjoy their life , and posse not much task to concern . however , young people have to attend school , need to study all the time that they have , and get not enough money to enjoy . so , young people do n't have many chance to enjoy their life . therefore , order people can enjoy their life more .
