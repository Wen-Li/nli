in my opinion it is better to study all subject regarding his academic then only in one subject , which offer better career . even though ther is chance that many thing will be confusion and the le thing will be much effective and also we will have good job if we are good at the subject . unless we will be effective in all the subject any body will not get good job . having broad knowledge it will also use full in daily purpose for example if he doesnot know any thing about science that regarding to the medicens then for every small sake he should go the hospital for regular checkup . but if have some what knowledge about the science we can able to solve the simple problem . if we have knowledge in many subject it will have it own adventages we wil get good job and also we will have good career and will be well settled . but unless we will have prefect knowledge in al lthe subject we will not settled for example if a person whoes specilisation is communication he should have software knowledge also why bacause it will provide much job and we will be verry use full inorder to well settled . and also if the person is well in only one subject if ther areless job then how can he get good job ha there are no job regarding that subject , so it is better to have knowledge in all academic subject then in only one subject so it is better to have broad subject knowledge then only in one suject .
