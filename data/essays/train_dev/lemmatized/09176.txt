i 'm agree with the statement that young people enjoy life more than older people . the young are happier , have more energy , and do n't think to much in the consecuenses of an action . young people like to enjoy life , going to the movie , beach , party , going to ride bike , traveling , listening to the music , dancing and a lot of more activity . they want to be happy . old people usually have le energy to do a lot of thing than the young peolple can do . when you are old may be your healt is not the same and you ha to expend time going to the doctor , therapy , going to the farmacy for medicine and be at home for more time whith responsabilities to do , work , grandchildrens to take care . you think more is you want to going to a place . young people and old people have a different way to think about live , resposabilitis and having fun . old people are more conservative . most of young people just think in having fun whith their friend and most of the old people just think about work or rest .
