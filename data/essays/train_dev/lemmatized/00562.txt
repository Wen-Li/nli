the product i disappointed at the most wa my kichen knife . i bought it through the tv shopping channel when someone showed that the knife could cut the cutting boad . off couse , i found it wa not ture after i got it . therefore , i agree that most advertisement make product seem much better than they really are . i think there are two reason : the producer try to explain their product seemed attractive , and the world the producer explain are vertual . the first reason why i think the product seem nicer than real one is that this is the puroducer 's purpous . as they want to sell their product a much a they can , they try to make show perfect thinking about the biggest effort by advertising . for example , they hire the advertising company which ha artist , copy planner , and strategy proffesiona . as aresult , they make perfect advertisement which atrracts the consumer . the second reason for my opinion is that the advertisement show virtual world . to make the customer think the product is so nice the producer explains the beautiful world which is the people want . unless the producer show real worl , nobody wouldl not be motivated to buy anything . to take an example , in the tv commercial of a aprticular cleaner , the famous actress act smart and pretty wife using the product . because the watcher may think they want to be a beautiful wife like her , or they think they are same to her , or the man think they want to marry with her , they tend to use the cleaner . we know this is not real world , but we want to be by using the product . in conclusion , i think most advertisement must seem better than they really are . although it make freaquantly confuse me , we can think this is an advertisement when we buy some product .
