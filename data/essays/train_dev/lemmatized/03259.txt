the topic at hand is whether it is better , having a broad knowledge of many academic subject or detailed and specialized knowledge of one particular subject . i feel that depending upon the scope of application of the knowledge of a person , the requirement can be broad or specific . the reason are a follows : certain profession for example that of a medical practitioner , requires him to have a broad based knowledge of the human body , the interliks between various part and what effect a medicine for a particular disease could have on any otherbody part . software professional on the other hand donot necessarily need to have broad based knowledge of the functioning of the computer or it part . for them a specialization in programming language , web page designing etc is what is required . basically it is the application of the knowledge and using innovation that is important . for the case of a doctor , the more he know the better he applies the overall knowledge . then teacher of physical science for example need to have proper knowledge of subject like physic , chemistry , mathematics , so that they are able to impart knowledge in a comprehensive way to the student and not poder over the doubt of the student . a chemist or a molecular bilogist need to have specialized knowledge on the specific field , but le of other academic discipline . students on the other hand need to have broad based knowledge upto a certain level of educaton wherein all those subject are addressed to which may find application , though not in great detail ahead in his proffessional career or practical life . after a certain level it depends upon the career path of the student , whether he chooses to specialize on a subject or increase his range of broad based knowledge . due to the endless ken of knowledge that could be accumulated , the nature of knowledge that could be possessed really depends upon the task at hand , the purpose for which it is required .
