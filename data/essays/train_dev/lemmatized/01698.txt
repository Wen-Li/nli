i desagree with this statement . the car are one of the most creative invention of the human being that have contributed with the tranportation . the invention of the car come from a long time ago when someone discovered this new way of transporation that would change their life forever . and since then the human being ha been trying to improve the car in all of it aspect . growing like a trained dog , following every step that the humanity take , satisfying their transportation need . now car are maybe the most succesfull way of transportation and people is not still satisfied with the last innovation of this car , in fact they want more , they want better car that can be able to satisfy their personal demand . so now year with year there is more people born , people that then grow and develop new ideolgies and new demand for the car designer . so with the time passing by , and the technology improving day by day future car design are gonna be maybe 100 hundred time more succesfull than they are nowadays and still , people will be looking for new innovation . in twenty year the scientist and car designer could be able to get these car to the sky , and just imagine how many demand for this new car are going to be made . i 'm sure that some day there is not gonna be more space for this car but i am also pretty sure that people are not gonna care for this , instead they are going to develop new way to store them but never get rid of them . i think that the car have left a very big footprint in the heart of the humanity and it going to take a while for it to disappear . they are gonna be used for a long time .
