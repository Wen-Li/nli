i strongly agree with the statement which successful people try new thing and take risk rather than only doing what they already know how to do wel . i have three thing to support my opinion . first of all , people tend to like new thing very much . once people get used to with something , people often look foward new thing . for example , i pod is one of the new technology and is very popular product in the u.s today . before i pod wa produced , people satisfied with cd player , but once i pod ha been on the market , no one would go to buy cd player anymore . moreover , people are already looking forward new version of i pod even having a newest i pod . therefore , people like new thing more than old thing . another reason is that we need to creat and try to make a new thing which did not exist before because life doe not stay and go back to the past . a life is always going forward . to keep producing the same product which exists already doe not change any thing . we have to have new thing to live a life more usufully . car is one of the example . if we dont have a car in the u.s , how can we live in this country ? everyone ha to live in the town , and no one want to live country side because of unconvinience . people are required to make new thing to satisfy people 's want and need . finally , to compete with others , i think there would be needed to have new thing even if taking risk . if everyone ha the same , there is no way to win the competition . to win the competition , having a new thing which doe not have others becomes very strong point . taking risk is needed to make and try new thing . in my country , there is the word that `` high risk , high return '' . what this mean is that taking high risk would lead higher returen later on . from these reason , i strongly agree with the statement . in a everyone 's life , we can not stop there . we have to move onto forward to successful life .
