before giving my opinion , i would like to clarify that each thesis can be right beacuse nobody know the future . however , i believe that in twenty year there will exist more car than they exist today . i think this for three reason . fist of all , people and the word is getting richer . we are increasing our power of acquistion , and by consequent , we will be able to buy more item . for example , a family who ha only a car , but they need one for the father , one for the mother and another for the child , is not going to hesitate to buy another car if they can financially . moreover , driving car and the world of the motor belongs definitively to our culture and we can demonstrate this idea when we observe young people . for instance , i am a young person and since i wa eight year old , i have been dreaming to have my own car . furthermore , my friend who are nineteen year old , drive their own car , and they would like to buy always another one . besides this idea , price of car are going down and we can notice that nowadays even poor peole have their own car . the reason that price are cheaper , is because there are lot of seller and that is why these people need to increase the market , and by consequent , there will be more people with car . nevertheless , i recognize that the price of petroleum will reach a considerable amount of money . thus , buyer will be afraid to buy more car and so , to spend more money in gas . fortunately , scientits will discover another way to provide energy to car . another important point is that people are getting more ecologist , and the idea of using car will be seen in a bad way . ecologists will have an important word to say in a soon future . in conclusion , i think that there will be more car in the future and that it will not be avoided by some reason like energy or he ecologist . personnally , i would prefer to live in a healthier world .
