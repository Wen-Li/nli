the problem of the new trade is directly connected to the fact that we must understand which product have really true effect , and which not . today a lot of people go to supermarket to buy their product , because in these place they can have a lot of chosen . at the same time we must take attention to what we buy , because a lot of product seem much better than they really are . generally we buy an economic product because we think that it must have the same effect than one expensive , but i think that there is a reason if one is cheapper than another , and this reason is not only connected to the fact that one bring an important name , and another not . generally when we buy a product that have a maior cost , meaning that we have buy a sicure object , that we 'll can use without any problem , also if we must remember that this is n't always treu , because we always find some surprise . at the contrary when we buy a product cheapper than another , we can find bed surprise . for these reason i buy always product that are n't so cheapper , but also not expansive ; however it depents to what i must buy . when i buy a dress i want somethingh that give me a garancy of quality , and generally it 's directly connected to the cost of the object ; the same thingh happen when i must buy the meal , or somethingh for my house . .. so i prefer spend somethingh more when i buy a product that must during , and i spend le when i buy somethingh that doe n't have much importance , for exemple somethingh that i 'm not sure that i will use a lot . in conclusion i 'm agree with the fact that most advertisement make product seem much better than they really are , and for this reason i try to do attention to what i but , trying to buy somethingh that ha a middle cost among the product that i can find . at the same time i want remenber that it 's not always true that an expensive product is better then one that is cheap .
