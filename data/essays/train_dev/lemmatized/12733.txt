i have always been told that you can never get what you want if you do not try , or in other word , if you do not take risk . i totally agree with that statement . as i told it previously , i admit that people who take risk by trying new thing can get what they really want and thereafter be very successful . i mean that if you never try to do something different from what you are used to do at least once in your whole life , it is too bad . let 's talk about the actor for instance . some of them always act the same kind of character and that is nice person or on the contrary a bad person . this is a good thing for them because they always know how to act since it is always the same thing . however , some other actor sometimes try to act an opposite character that the one they are used to perform . morgan freeman for instance ha often performed nice character in his movie and one day , he accepted to play the '' nasty '' in the movie called '' dreamcatcher '' . it wa a very surprising to see him a a nasty but in spite of all that , the movie wa great and had success and so the actor is .
