helping our community is a very important point in our world . do young people not give enough time to helping their community ? lets see . first of all , young people are often independant , so they care more about themselves than about other people , they think those people will never help them in return and they can only trust themselves . a young person will often want to do what she want when she want and she may not understand why she should spend more time helping her community . there is also another problem , the study . studies for young person are very important and it requires a lot of work and a lot of time to spend , because study will help them in their future to find a job and win money , again they care more about themselves than about their community , for example in my university people say that their first wish is to suceed in this university and be able to work in different country , so it is a pressure for them . so it is mainly a problem of priority , young people prefer being an important person who win money instead of giving time for other people . there is an intersting sicilian setence which say : `` the only person you can totally trust and you can help is only yourself . '' i agree with this sentence because you will always do your possible to be someone , and the most important thing is our life . so we can not often help other people because help ourselves take much time and it is necessary . as a conclusion , i agree with the following statement , but i would also say that i understand because life in nowadays is very difficult and we must first take care about ourselves .
