experiencing the convinience of the car , we can not keep car away from our society . most citizen living in advanced society use car almost everyday . many parent drive student to school every morning , and many wife send her husband to their company . in this environment is it true that in twenty tear , there will be fewer car in use than there are todat ? i disagree with the statemet that there will be fewer car in use that there are today because there are still lot of people who will use car in 20 year . what accelerate the nuber of car within 20 year ? now , there are still lot of people who do not have the licence of car , especally in developing country which ha billion of population but whose people do not affort that now . however within 20 year , they seem to develop more than now . if chinese people , more than12 billion , will become affluent , the number of car is absolutely increasing . no one can deny this fact . since the area of china is extraordinary large , the need of car should be high . postulated that the one-third of chinese will get a car , the number is 4 billion !! ofcouse the country that have possibility to increase the number of car is not only china . india , kenia , levanon , or cuba have great possibility . therefore , the number of car must be increased with the development of those country . having said that there are people who insist that the nubmer of car will decline in twenty year . however they tend to ignore the possible number of people who use car in the future . therfore their idea should be disimissed an inapproproate . i believe that the nubmer of car will radically increase becase there are many people who know the convinience of car in the future especially in developing country .
