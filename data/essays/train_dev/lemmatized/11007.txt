according to the question `` young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their community '' i agree to the fact in the question . i feel that this issue is not in a specific country or community but it almost in the entire world of human . life compared to the past ha changed a lot today . the generation today have a busy life of their own and may have forgotten their responsibility of giving a helping hand to their community . in today life the young people are busy with their job , own family , kid and are trying to give better comfort , good education and a luxirous living to their child . talking about job or a busy profession there is so much competition among the co-worker to update themselves and go to better position through promotion . in certain situation the young people forget the sacrifice their parent did for them , in bringing them up to a good position by giving them good education and providing all the nessicities they required in their childhood . there are a lot of old age home comming up every where all over the world for the older community . the strong reason behind this is the older community is being neglected by the young one . there are other reason too in a developing country like india where the population is very high and there is a lot of unemployment , in such situation the youngster have nothing to do for themselves and are helpless in their own situation and can not do anything for their own community or older community . financial burden is one factor that everyone face today and the greed for a better position and a greed for more money make the younger generation selfish at time . so according to me the younger generation do not concentrate in helping their community either the older or younger community .
