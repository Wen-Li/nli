communities always need help from engaged people . they look for young people to organize a kid 's club or choir for example . but community nowadays have trouble finding young engaged people to help them with their work , i agree with this statement . to my mind , some young people are very engaged in community work and are willing to help other people , even today . but in general , i think , young people are more interested in meeting friend , doing sport or work in a job , where they are able to earn extra money . to my mind , young people do not give enough time to helping their community . one reason , why they are not willing to help in a communtity may be , because it is a lot of work , but they usually will not get money for their work . another reason why young people are not interested in doing community work is because they may seem boring and le exciting to their peer . young people nowadays have to risk something and have to do fun thing to be accepted from their peer group . in my opinion , not only the young people nowadays play an important role in not helping the community , but the community themselves have to become more interesting for young people . they could make the job they have to offer more appealing to young people by honoring their work in front of the whole community with certificate , for example . another point is , that community could organize more meeting for young people who help . they could offer trip to those and they could try to engage a lot of friend to do the work together . so , not only young people have to be more engaged , but also do community have to be more creative in order to get young people 's attention . all in all , i can say that on the one hand , young people have to show more respect towards their community and be willing to help , but on the other hand community have to make their work attractive to young people .
