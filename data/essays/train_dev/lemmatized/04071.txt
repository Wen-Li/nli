i deeply agree to the statement that advertisement make product seem better than they actually are . in fact , i believe that many product would hardly be bought at all if people only knew the product itself and not the advertisement that go along with it . my opinion on this ha been influenced by experience and by academic study , and i would like to state several reason for my answer . first of all , the psychological mechanism behind advertisments are rather obvious . it is easy to see that a galopping horse and a handsome man have not much in common with the taste of a cigarette , but the positive feeling created by the descibed image do influence a person feeling towards the advertised brand . this can be explained psychologically and physiologically , and i am sure that studying psychology ha helped me understand the underlying principle better . the advertisement industry is a huge and powerful one and the quality of an advert thoroughly influence the selling number of a product . in one lecture on the psychology of advertisement i heard about certain technique that are employed by advertiser which have only deepened my opinion on advertisement . an example of the fakeness of the presented product is the fact that the thickly streaming milk one can see in an advertisement for cornflakes is a tasteless a the flake themselves : the milk is actually glue and the flake are made of plastic . i am convinced that most advertising company employ similar technique to make the product seem supernatural and generally better than they are . it is unlikely that a company could still compete with others if they simply stated that their product wa good . it seems like a good idea to have certain regulation in advertising . these do already exist and it seems almost necessary to protect consumer from being lured into purchasing a product that only seems attractive because of the idea sold along with it . it make sense that a producer want his product to shine in the best light . however , i think that the technique being used in advertising these day go far beyond what one could call a realistic image of a product . therefore , i can only agree to the statement given .
