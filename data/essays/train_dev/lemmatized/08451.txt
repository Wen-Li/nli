in our modern society , there is a lot of competition around the world . young people nowadays become very buzy . therefore i agree that they do not give enough time to helping their community . due to the fast pace for development , young people have a lot of pressure on for their school . such a extra lesson , pressure cause them stay in the laborary study for whole night and sport time . everyday is fully occupied . take for example , at my school , all the student time is followed by the program that made by school . students really do not have time to do theri own thing . after get to home will be very tired . normally they will take a relax . such a play computer game and listen to music . hence i personally think that young people really not give enough time to helping their community . another factor is because that yong people become very selfish this day . they think helping theircommunities is not part of their business . they rather go for shopping in order to obtain their good or stay at home play game , but not heping their community . also , young people nowadays are very violent . seriously , so many people have aids or hiv this day . in instance , in south africa . due to the high rate of hiv and aids . people start to hate each other . try to destory other people 's life . therefore i really think that young people do not help their community . some young people might think that they have gave enough time to the community . for example , in some school , school allowing young student to see the orphons . try to donate money to them . sometime they may sweeping the street for people . but unfortunately , this is very few school doe that . from above , i can tell there are more reason to support me that young people do not give enough time to helping their community .
