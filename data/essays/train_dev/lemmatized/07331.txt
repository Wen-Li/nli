although many people think that there is nothing to worry while there is a guide . he would be responsible for all the need they want . i personally disagree with the assertion that to go with a tour guide is the best way to travel . first of all , traveling with a group could waste much time waiting for other person . and it is very unconvenient to go trevel with a lot of people , especially they are all stranger to me . there will be several rule that you should follow . it is not romance and happy at all . second , the tour guide often want to have a aboundant impression that all the people in the group . the plcaes are arranged too much ; in the end , there always no enough time to spend on each place the group been . i could not remember or experence the environment where i only spend five minute to stay with . i need more time and enjoy the difference between where i live . last but not least , i have heard more than one time that people have the same impression about the same country they have been . it is because the guide always take people to the same place . for example , it is the same that the picture of my friend and my parent which they took at frence , only the face are different . however , i want something more than all the people 's experience . to see the real thing happening in the foreign coutries is more attracted than the photo on the post card . in conclusion , it is not interesting at all if i can not decide where i want to go . the most interesting part of traveling is to study the country and decide where to go , and it would be better if there are some thing unexpected happened . going with a group is definately mot one of my choice .
