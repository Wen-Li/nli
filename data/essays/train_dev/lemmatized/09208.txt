recently , we often see various adverisments on the tv and boad in the city . i agree with the statement that most advertisments make product seem much better than they really are . first , advertisments can attracts u more than the procuts really are because the advertisments highlight the good point which the product have . most product have several charactoristics both good point and bad point . in the advetisments , producer want to explain that the advantage , convinient usage , good appearance and so on . especially in the small miniutes of advertisment on tv , they can explain only good point of product . also , in small piece of paper advertisments such a flyer , they can also expalin the merit to buy the product more . additionly , we rarely see the disadvantageis of the product in the advertisments . as a result , we can understand the only part of product . so we can not understand the product fully . this is likely to cause the product more attractive and we recognize the product a much better than they really are . second , advertisement force u to believe the product is better by keeping the adversitments in our mind for long time . when i turn on tv and walk around town , we often see advertisments many time daily . then , i remenber the advertisments and the product . in the case that i go to the supermarket , i often select the product which is introduced at the adverisment of product because i know the product more than other producta which are le advertized . in this situation , even though the product i choose is not better than the others , i choose that i know well it . as a result , product which is often advertised is selected for me because i have a mind that i know well the product even though the product might not good . in couclusion , i think that most adverisments make product seem much better than they really are because the advertisement attract u by highlighting the good point of the product and are kept in mind long time .
