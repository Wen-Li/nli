i disagree with the statement because i think that people can risk also when they are not sure in their experience . in my opinion it depense , principal , for thre personal behaviour of the person . if i wa a brave man my instinct could involve me to risk , for example , in activity where i can have an elevated damage ( like economic business , private live ) . if i wa an afraid man my instinct could be involve me to put a brake in my activity and in all of aspect of my life . personally i wa an istinctive man and usually i take decision without think the negative aspect but only the positive . an important example in my life wa the decision of live with my girlfriend . it wa a decision that i took looking only the positive aspect . .. i took my baggage and luggage and i fly with her in an other country . after some day the situation changed . .. the risk that i had n't considered wa very very high . maybe the logic solution can not be an other but in my mind i know how to doing .
