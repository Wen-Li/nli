nowadays we can often hear that young peole do not have enough time to helping their comunity . i agree with this well known idea because i think that young people must spend a lot of time to study to be sure to have a brillant future and they use the little amount of free time that remain to help their family , to coltivate some hobies or to keep some relationship with their friend . young people are colled to attend a long study trail , and they have to spend a lot of their time to read book and impruve their knowledgement because of their future work . infact if they want a good job in a well known company they have the necessity to take high mark at school because nowadays there is a huge competition to find a job . moreover young people usually spend their free time to dedicate some moment to their family who , probably , need help . for example some family need economic help to allows their son to attend good school and often young people are colled to make some extrawork to pay their school . this people do n't have enough time to helping their comunity because they have enough time only to help themself and their family . finally young people , unfortunatly , prefer to spend their little free time raising their reletionship with their friend . they spend the last time that they have to save their reletion with some important frinds who they will miss if they 'd help their comunity . in my personal experience i had tried to help my comunity before i overwhelmed with my study . i had to make a choice and i chose to study and coltivate some friend instead to help my comunity . helping own comunity is very difficult , becase young people have to study , to help their family , and to coltivate their friend . the time that remain is very short and it is n't enough .
