i do agree . not only what you know to do would help you acomplish thing , but to try new risk would help a well . it 's true that a risk could lead you to lose everything , but it 's also true that you may gain more a well . for example , a successful leader must have risked something very precious to him/her in order to get to where he is now . i like to point out leader , because i personally admire one who left everything behind , family , homecountry , friend , mony-savings , etc. for his dream of success , and took a nation up to it highest point ; in every matter , such a , economically and more . i believe it is always good to take a risk , even if you fall while trying , there ha to be something good learned out of it . it is when we risk that we understand that a fall is jut a steping-stone in our way of success . and you learn to stand up againg and never give up , and keep on your way . if you just stick to what you know , no matter how good you are at it , you are going to get stock in a simply way of life and never progres up rather than to risk a bit and get more instead . a good risker always make sure to get the most out of a fall . feeling confident of yourself at all time is also helpful when taking a risk , keeping in mind `` i can do it '' would help you get what you want easily . you also know what are you best at , so just take a little risk and improve your knowledge way farther . a risk doe n't have to be consider a a problem or something bad , it could also be a chance , an oportunity to prove yourself that you are up to higher challenge and that you can acomplish what you want ; that there is not limit for someone
