in my point fo view the successful people try new thing risk rather then only doing what they already know . so meny people like successfull men 's or woman 's there are will at studes and job there are coming from good background at studers and envornment . they think about what . why , how and so and so question . the people like will at studes and think in different way the people the learn new think . they want to learn think 's for usefull so they want to learn new think 's taking risk rather current . for example take take on software proffeson . for example he is working java technology . he is good at java and successfull working on java , but in that some new thing are add to the java technology for example swings , hiber net . it is us full for the next project . so that person learn that thing taking the risk rather tan the doing what they alresdy . successful people try new thing for developing thre future . for second example we take music payer they work at some instrument only , but they want learn the new thing in the music . thay tearn the thing taking the high risk then the doing thing . i thing that the person is successed that is he or she taking the risk on that what they do and doing thing . so many successful people successed by taking the risk and interst in thar pariclar take . so meny risk and hard work give the so much result to the human 's . we agree with the statement .
