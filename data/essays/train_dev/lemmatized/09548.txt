i do n't think young people enjoy life more than older people do . i have three reason for my notion . one is the difference of pleasure which young people enjoy and that of older people do . second reason is that young people have a lot of the seed of annoying comparering to older people . third one is the the amount of property they have . first reason is the difference of how young people and older people enjoy their life . young people enjoy more activity something use their body like sport , going somewhere far from they live . on the other hand , older people have a lot of time they can use freely . they can enjoy the time when they are be able to be relaxed , they can feel the stream of time comfortably . even though the kind of the pleasure is different , both are great . what 's more , older people have already experienced the joy which young people feel when they were young . as a second reason , we can say that somethimes it is difficul for young people to enjoy their daily life wholeheartedly . it might be because of the relationship between friend in their school , the assignment of home work . some child even do commit suacide . although older people have fewer problem they should do . third reason is the about how much money they can use . older people have much money they have earned , but young people , especially young child , doe n't have enough money they need . to spend the time doing part time job to earn money sound like waste of time . for these three reason , it is difficult for me to state young people enjoy life more than older people do .
