i agree . the student should understand the idea that they are studying . the learning process is not about memorize chapter and concept , it is about understanding and analyzing . if they understand the idea and concept they would not have problem to `` learn fact '' . they would be capable of solve problem , which is the idea . education is about what the student is capable to do , per example , if the student ha a bad situation , a problem or other struggle , his proof would be try to find by himself what he need to do to get out of the situation . his level of education would help him to analyze the problem and then , solve it . this man will think about what he ha learned and after that he will find a conslussion for his problem . other example , would be a person without any educational level . this person would not be capable of get a fast conslussion because he ha not had any educational help in all his life , which mean that he ha not developed his razoning part at school . for this reason , education is not just a word that indicates `` go to school '' ( college or university , in other case ) , it is a word that indicates : `` analyzing '' , `` logical '' or `` learning '' . if some subject is too difficult for a student but he must pas that subject , he would use his logical skill to solve the problem . the most logical response to this situation would be go with a tutor to get help . i do not agree with the idea that it is important for student to learn fact because would be a support to those people who just memorize thing and they call smart to themselves . in some situation would be good to learn fact , but it would not be the point of the educational matter . the point is try to learn and analyze situation in life . for these reason , the understanding is most important in a student ' educational process .
