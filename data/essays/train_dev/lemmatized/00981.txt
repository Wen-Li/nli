i agree withe this statment , that itis important for the student to understand idea and concept to learn fact . every one should pay attention towards the lecture , idea or concept . during his/her acdemic section which help him more during his career . for example a grduate student of computer science should learn concept of programming language so that it will help more in his career . another example is that a graduate student of mechanical engineering should learn the main concept of mecanical unless he can not survive in that field . a student from primary stage should learn the the conepts . at initial stage if he persue it effectively his academic career becomes an increadable . if he does't his career may spoil . if a person understand the idea and the concept he can learn more fact for example if a grduate student undrstands the concept he can learn more fact which make him better than others . if he learn the fact he will apply which will give a good result by understandindig the concept . our scientist observe the fact behind the concept so they are doing meraciles . the common people not really undrstood the fact behind the the concept so they were living like that . by really understanding the fact behind the concept one should do evrything in his own field so it necessary for a student to learn the fact behind the concept and idea . which make him to elivate during his career . finally i conclude that a student should understand the idea and concept to learn real fact which make him better through out his life . the concept and idea are really needed for a student to learn the real fact .
