cars have been played an important role . they influence the economy and techology all over the world . i disagree with that fewer car will be used than they are today . there are four reason . first of all , citied keep developing and people keep making road , so a lot of car will be needed for people if the road will keep increasing . second , not only the road increase , but also the population keep increase . more the population increase , more the demand of using car will increase . if there are a lot of demand , people try to make more car to satisfy the demand , which is the relationship between demand and supply . this relationship are necessary for develop the economy , and especially car have influenced the world market . therefore , car will be needed more and more . next , using car are one of the way to transport . it 's so convenient to go to place which are even far away and also comfortable to use car because we do n't need to be accustom ourself to the public atmosphere . in contrast , when we take other transportation like a bus or train , we always have to pay attention to others . thus , we can feel relax and enjoy our own space by using car . finally , while some people may think using car pollutes the environment , we have studied for the new way to develop car which do n't give bad influence to the environment since technology ha kept developing . in fact , we have made the new tipe of car which doe n't cause co2 by making energy from solving water . these attempt will contribute to solve environmental problem . for the above reason , i disagree with that fewer car are ufs
