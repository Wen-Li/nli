i have always enjoyed travelling . every year i have the chance to come to the united states for three month by myself to improve my english language skill ( i have been doing this for more than five year now ! i guess i am very lucky ! ) . since i have the chance to spend several hour a week at my friend 's travel agency i noticed that most of the people prefer being led by a tour guide , i wonder if that is because they are afraid to get lost or not being able to enjoy their vacation at the best or because they are too lazy to organize their vacation by themselves . but it also true that if you want to go on a cultural vacation you do need a tour guide who show and describes you all the place , the monument , the history of the place that you are visiting and all those beautiful thing that every place in the world ha to offer to the tourist . plus if you go to a place where a foreign language is spoken you might not be able to enjoy the vacation because of that . personally i think that , since i am a `` free spirit '' , i love organizing my trip by myself . i just like to wake up in the morning when i want to without worrying too much if my trip mate are already downstairs with the tourist guide , ready to go to explore the new place ! but i also think that if you decide to go to a place where there is a little danger , having a tourist guide who tell you where you can or ca n't go is really important for your safety . i think that a long a i will have the chance to travel by myself i will keep doing that . maybe i will change my mind once i get older ! who know . ..
