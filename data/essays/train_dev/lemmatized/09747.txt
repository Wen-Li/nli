` young people enjoy life more than older people do ' - i completely disagree with this statement . i believe that one can not generalise this concept based on a criterion like age . one can definitely enjoy life irrespective of age . it is all a matter of individual preference , taste and situation . i have seen very gloomy young people with absolutely no spirit or enrgy to enjoy life . at the same time i have met very energetic and joyful old people who ensure that they enjoy each and every moment of their life to the fullest . one can enjoy life if he ha a good company and good circumstance too . its not the youth or old age that decides this . it may appear that young people enjoy more a they hang around with friend in big group making noise , smoking , drinking and partying all night . but i believe that the concept of enjoyment is different for different individual . for example - i do not need to go to a disotheque to enjoy life but i enjoy life a it is - i enjoy the first rain of the season , i enjoy the fragrance in the air after that first rain , i enjoy my morning cup of coffee with the newspaper , i enjoy sitting at night and chatting with my freinds - and all this i will even enjoy when i am old . in fact i feel that old people have more to enjoy . they have ample time especially if they are retired from their job . they have the entire day with them to enjoy . they do not have to worry about work pressure . they have beautiful memory and experience of life that to cherish and feel happy about . at that age they have an entire life to look back upon and feel relaxed that they have achieved so much . whereas young people have so many worry with them always - first school then college then work then marriage then kid and so on and so forth . in nutshell , it 's not the age that make one enjoy life - rather it 's the spirit that make you live life to the fullest enjoying each and every moment of it .
