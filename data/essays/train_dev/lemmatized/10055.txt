i totally agree with the idea that young people enjoy life more than older people . young people have a lot of lifetime , healthy , and have many good community . the first reason is that they have a lot of lifetime . most of people in my country , japan , live more than 75 year . therefor , young people like my age , 25 year old , we have more about 50 year lifetime . we can buy a lot of thing with money ; however , we ca n't buy any time . time is one of the most important ting to enjoy our life so i think young people can enjoy life a lot . the next reason is that young people are really healthy . to be healthy is really important to enjoy our life . if we are healthy , we can do everything what we want . we can do every kind of job what we want , and we can study a lot in everywhere . we can do every kind of sport to have enjoyable time , and can travel everywhere that we want . even if we do n't have much money to do enertainments or other thing , it is possible to make money to do what we want . the third reason is that young people have a lot of community . young people unsually keep in touch with their friend from their hometown , school , and so on . they both young and have a lot of time , so that they can enjoy a lot of thing together . also if we have a lot of community , maybe we can get a lot of help . it is really healpful and that can make our life going well , so that we can enjoy our life itself a lot . it is really fun to spend time with other people . to keep a good relationship with others can make our life great . thus i totally agree with the idea that young people enjoy life more than old people .
