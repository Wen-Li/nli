i am agree with the statement `` most advertisement make product seem much better than they really are '' . actually most advertisement can help people that have any kind of problem to see this in another way . this can help people not also for the really mean of this advertisement but also , and over it , for the reaction that they create in the mind of the people that heard their . for this reason the advertisement make product seem better than they really are , because every person that heards advertisement think on this one and interpreter this one in the way that he prefer .
