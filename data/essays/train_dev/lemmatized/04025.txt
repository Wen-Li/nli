i believe young people nowadays do give enough time helping their community and i do not agree with the statement . in this century , the number of elder are increasing continuously . by that , it became more important to maintain elder in the community . the point is that it is usually those teen and yuong people in 20 's who help old lady on the street or go to nursing house to serve the elder . i had volunteered many time with friend to take a walk whth elder who live alone . adults are not doing these work saying that they are tired of work or they do not have much time to do so . adults are also using young people to do additional work . school teacher are a commom example of this situation . teachers order student to pull out grass and pick out small stone out of school garden after school . i rather believe that adult are the one that doe not try to help their community . i also saw many young people volunteer on their own and they were willing to do it . in korea , young people work a helper at subway station and mostly at the nursing house . they also go to police station or post office to clean up the place . as university are putting a rule on additional score to those who volunteered for the community , more young now have chance than past . accordingly , more people will try to help the community . although it is not an active way , it is good to the community considering that adult are busy working and there is not much people to work for community . for the reason and example above , i disagree with the statement and young people put enough time to helping their community . however , i think there need to be more improvement to both adluts and young to actively help their community .
