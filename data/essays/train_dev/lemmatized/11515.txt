the car is the main transport vehicel in the modern time . nearly every houshold in germany ha one or even two car . with this sentence i point out that i do not agree with the statement given . from the time car were invented until now their is a high rise in the manufaturing of car . because of mass production of car , they are availible to more people now , than it used to be in the past . since peple want to save more time , car are very important to travel . people do not have to wait until bus or train arrive . they are more flexible in their time schedule . as an example i can say that i like to get up very late in the morning to leave my house for an appointment . in this moment i have to calculate time for the bus . the bus doe not run every minute , i have to go to the bus stop and this cost me time which i could spend in bed . it is much more relaxing for me to go by car , because i know were i parked it and i do not have to hurry to be in time at the bus stop . but another important point is that bus or train are often too late . i would not be at my appointment in time . if i go somewhere with my car i can choose who i will sit in with . buses and train are public transport vehicals . i have to coupe with all of the people joining the bus/train . in winter it is a bad situation . because it is could people wear a lot of cloth and when they come in the bus they may start to sweat . if there are a lot of people it can happen that there is a bad air and this doe not let me feel confortable . these are only two reason why i do not belive in reducing car appearance in twenty year and it is only my point of view . but i can image if there would be a public questioning about this most of the people would point out this reason why in twenty year there will be the same or even more car than today .
