a lot of people belive that it is more important for student to learn fact . however , i agree with that it is more important for student to understand idea and concept . here are some seficific reason to support my opinion . first of all , if people just learn fact they would think just result and they would care about only fact besides any processing . when i wa in high school i wa that kind of person who just care about result and fact and i just studied and memorize a lot of thing . it seemed worked couple of time . i got good grade until i wa in freshman but i got really bad score in history class . i wa upset because i thought i knew pretty well about history so i complained to history teacher . at that time , my teacher said that i logically remember everything for example if she asked `` which year did it happen ? '' i could answer but if she asked `` which happened below that happend ? '' i could not answer . that is because i just remembered the fact i did not care about why i happended . after that i changed a style of way to study and tried to understand concept and idea not only fact and i got higher score in history class and even other class too . second of all , if student just studyed fact it would also not good for their patient . they would learn what is the begining and result . thesedays lots of people can not be patient they can not wait only a few minute . in conclusion , it is more important for student to understand idea and concept .
