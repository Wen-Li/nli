i agree with the statement that young people enjoy life more than older people for the following reason . most impotantly , young people can travel anywhere and anytime . for example , my family used to spend our summer vacation in hawaii about twenty year ago , because my parent liked hawaii and really enjoyed traveling to hawaii , such a swinming , plating golf , going shopping . but recently their enjoment of spending hawaii during summer vacation , because my parent recongized their weak point in their body because of old age . the notice of disadvantage tends to prevent from traveling anywhere , especially , hawaii . contrary to old people , young people merely recognizer their weak point in their body because of their age in cluding me , and young people travel to anywhere where they want to go actively , also including me . but old people a like my parent tend to be limited to travel because of their condition . as the above example show , young people can travel anywhere and anytime . additionally , young people try to do what they want to do . i enjoy doing yoga in owder to keep healthier . also , in spring and fall , i enjoy playing golf . howerver old people tend to bear doing what they want to do . for example , my father also enjoyed playing golf in younger age when i wa littele child . but , when ten year ago , he had the operation in his eye because of accumurated stress for a long time , he came to pay attention with his body , of course including his eye . and he stopped diving car because of the affair . therefore he stand up plaing golf . instead he go for a walk every morning to keep his good condition and to maintain health as the above example demonstrates , old people tend to be limited when they want to do anything , wheras young people try to do what they want to do . in conclusion , i agree with the statement that young people enjoy life more than older people .
