`` in twenty year there will be fewer car in use than there are today . '' i am not agree with this statement . the reason are following : 1. as the year go on technology will improve and this will result in manufacturing good car in much cheaper rate than today . so a the price of car decrease more consumer will buy car . this is simple demand - supply principle of economics . 2. also population of world is continuously increasing . the more number of user will be there and they will use more car . this will imply the usage of more car than today 's era . 3. cars are mean of transport . in twenty year business will grow rapidy in differnet area . more package will have to be delivered or transferred . so this will recquire larger number of transpotaion hence increase in number of car . 4. in next twenty year fashion/glamour will also increase . so each individual will want to have his own car . this will also led to increase in usage of car . 5. in next twenty year number of industry will increase . also industry have to set up in different location other that residential area to avoid harm from pollution . so more we have to travel greater the need of car and greater the need larger the number of car used . 6. time is money and time will be much more valuable then . so we will want to cut our time in going one place to another , will want to decrease in travelling time hence to use more good car a private vehcile . 7. more advertisement and product poppularity will also force user to but new advanced car hence increase in number of car used . these are some of the reason thats why i think usage of car will increase in next twenty year .
