i totally agree with the statement given above . first of all , advertisement only show the advantage of a product and not the possible disadvantage . i made this experience for my own for quite a several time . i remember the first advertisement of the ipod from apple . the customer really got the feeling , that the ipod wa not only a simple music player in a good looking design , but even that it is the most handiest player on the market . i wa one of the first people who bought an ipod but after a short period of time i wa a little bit depressed about my decision . the advertisement did not show , that for example it wa only possible to change the recorded music with one single software program and only one computer at once . i have still got the ipod , but in fututre i will be better informed about the feature of a product , before i buy it . furthermore , quite a lot of product do not aim the characteristic in the way the advertisement show . a good friend of mine is working in the marketing business unit of a company , which is doing the advertising for different company . it is allways very intersting and funny when we are getting together for a drink and talk about our job . everytime it is the same that he tell me about new of his customer and their product . my friend and his collegues sometimes do not even see one advantage of a product which should be advertized by them , but it is their job to present the product in a kind of way that people have the desire to buy it . as i have shown above , advertisement do not allways show the truth about a product and put much better light on it than it is . i made these experience for several time and i learned from this . i think everybody should be aware of , that the product she/he buy is perhaps not a perfect a the advertisment of the product showed .
