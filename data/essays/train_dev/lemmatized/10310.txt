one of the thing which make life more easier is the technology . technology is not improved in one day . every single person put his/her effort to it . when they are finding something they study on what they are expert on itand after study they get success . in my opinion no development come in by chance and people get the success on what they know . in our century people are educated to twenty age on a specific task to make a job . if success come wtihout any knowledge and only taking the risk no one should go to school . however people go on a standard way like finishing a college to success in their area . moreover generally succesful people do n't try new staff . let 's think an engineer working on construction business . he work on building new building and he is very expertise at his job . when somebody want him to write a program and take risk . is he risk his permanent job and start to write a program . think that he start to write a porgram is it successful ? to develop new idea new thing need knowledge . new thing occur after many research and test in our life . for example before finding an ampule edison try 1500 specie of material on his experiment . he wa an engineer and he studied on a topic which already know .
