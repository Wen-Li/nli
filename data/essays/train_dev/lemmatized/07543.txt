the number of car in use have been dramatically increasing during last three decade . although only very wealthy family used to own a car in early 1900s , now nearly every family owns a car and even more than one car . but i think , this is the peak number for the car in use . i strongly believe there will be fewer car in use in the future . i have several reason for this idea but the most effective 2 reason are ; people 's awareness of air pollution and chaotic traffic . let 's have a look how people 's awareness of air pollution will decrease the number of car in use . people did n't know much about air pollution and it effect on our world in the past . however , now we are well aware what can air pollution cause a we are witness of it result . many people are getting sick more often , the hole in the atmosphere is getting greater , there are acid rain that destroy the nature very badly . these are the only a few result that we have seen . this led people to become more considerate about the environment . for example , many enviromentalist people do not use car for transportation . they prefer public transportation or use their bike to get to the work a they are aware of bad affect of air pollution . what is more , problem about air pollution is told in many school . as people will get more sophisticated about air pollution , fewer car will be in use in future . the other reason why i think the number of car in use will decrease is that many people are complaining about traffic . traffic ha become one of the biggest problem of daily life . you can see many people travelling by bus although they have car . since this is becoming a bigger problem day by day , more people will prefer using train or their bike for transportation . finally , i would like to say that great number of car in use lead to many problem and a people are aware of these problem , the number of car in use will decrease . air pollution and traffic that i have mentioned are only two bad result . to make your life and other people ' s life better , prefer other transportation way ehenever you can .
