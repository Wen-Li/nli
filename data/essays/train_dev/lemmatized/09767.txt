i do not agree with the statement of fewers car will be in use in the next twenty year than today . first of all , the cost of owning a car is decreasing by time . only few lucky family had car 20 year ago . today , an average middle income family ha more than one car . new technology allow automobile company to produce cheaper and better quality car . not only car are getting cheaper , income level of the world economy is also increasing . for instance in developing country with high population , such a china and india , gdp growth is more than ten fold during the last decade . imagine , if one forth of the population of india and china can buy a car , that will approximately sum up to 500 million new car . that is the motivation behind the desire of buying new automobile factory in those country . one argument against this statement may be the pollution effect of the car . although conventional fuel create pollution , many scienticts work on project which are trying to use alternative energy source for transportation . electricity might be the major energy source for car in the next twenty year , so enviromental problem related with car usage will be irrevelant . finally , individualism is another factor that will support car demand . people of 21th century enjoy to be different . people show their difference by their clothes , watch , car etc . generally speaking one person 's car show his social identity . maybe in the crowded city , people commute their office by metro or bus , but this doe not stop them buying car .
