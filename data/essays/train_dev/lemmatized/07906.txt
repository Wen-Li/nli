i agree in this following statement . in twenty yea no body know what will happen to u . maybe there will not be any car or may be there will be more ca than we have right now in our time . there are many stuff in the world that ha not been discovered yet . and no body now about them . in my point of view there will be many discoverings will happen that maybe more than the three fourth of the worls wo n't believe that this is discovered . i would like to be there in that time and also whants to do stuff that i never dreamed of doing with these new discovered stuff . i suppose that instead of car , in twenty year there will be car that could fly . if that happens i would like to live and see that before i die and also like to try it also .
