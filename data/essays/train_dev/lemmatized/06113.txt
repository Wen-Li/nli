there are several reason why it is believed that young people enjoy life more than older people do . because of their freedom recentely discoverd and the amazing and new oportunities that keep appearing all the time . because of this time of exploration that youth ha , i can affirm that young people enjoy life more than older people . young people feel free to do what they want . they are in a period of discovering new thing and finding out their path and knowing who they really are . because old people have already established a life style , with bigger responsabilities , they are not especting anything and their experimental time ha passed . nevertheless , older people have their own wat to enjoy life , but i can not tell it because i have not experimented the adult period yet . as a youth , i can affirm that i enjoy life because i take advantage of every new adventure that came out , and i dont have much bigger responsabilities than university . in addition , university is enjoyable when you learn and at the same time , make friend and have fun with them . it is the time in which you share your moment of joy with others . young people are independiently . they have the wing to fly werever they want , travell in and outside the country , work in different place only for experience and not because of financial need . youngs aspire for the future and project themself , so they still have hope and view , and live their life especting and enjoying . however , not all young have a pleasent life . there are young people in the street , homeless , and definetely not enjoying life a many other youth . in conclussion , the adolecense period is fun , but the truth is that each period ha their benefit . old people find their way to enjoy life too , a well a kid and baby . the key is in enjoying every moment , because the present is a gift called present .
