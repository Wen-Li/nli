trowgh the history of knowledge , there have been many idea and trend about the best way to get and approach it . may be the most common one that are still present in our academic life , and command most of the present teaching model we can find at school and university . the fir of them and may be the older one , inducts the knowledge , that men some one have that knowledge and give it to others , that person is the master , the autority and almost superior , and their alumns follow him . in to the other hand , we can find a more modern concept that promote the construction of knowledge , that mean each person can approach the knowledge in their own way , can get the idea and concept and construct whith them . in that case there are facilitator who give that concept and the tool that student need . that we can usually find this day in school and even at university is a combination of both so depending on what is strongly enphasised we will get different result . personally , i studied in a waldorf school that emphasis the construction approach to knowledge and later i had to go into a traditional school , that emphasis in induction of knowledge . now i am sure i had an advantage over the other student in the traditional school because i primarly lern how to get and understand idea and concept and construct knowledge . if you just learn fact , with time you shurely forget them . if you clearly understand concepst you will be able to construct again knowledge .
