in present scenario of diversification of knowledge a well a introduction of new subject everyday , it is a matter of great concern among people of academic fraternity that to which subject they should concentrate upon . whether it is better to have a diversified knowledge or to have a specialization in a particular subject . it is a very arguable matter . before rendering my opinion let 's analyse the possible pro and con . being specialist in one subject doe n't mean that the person is not able to learn other subject . it ha been proved time and again by different great people in history that , a person may have equal mastry over two subject of opposite nature . i would like to present example of the great leonardo the vincii who is a scientist , sculpturist , painter , philosopher and many thing more , at the same time . now a day invention of computer ha made life much easier and knowledge easy to access . with the help of computer and setellite technolgy we can save our time much and devout it over other minor subject also . also in research area the demarcation between subject is on the verge of extinction . for example the cappilary rise equation in physics is given by a scientist from medical stream . in my opinion a person should have to diversify himself in multiple dimension a much a possible . however a english proverb go `` a coin ha two face '' , person having opposite opinion may have some reasonable ground . but in my opinion pro overweigh the con . a person should be multideciplinary genious rather than specialist in one subject .
