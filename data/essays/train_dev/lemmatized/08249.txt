i would have to say that i agree with the statement : `` young people enjoy life more than older people do '' and here is why : when you are young ( i would say under 35 ) you have more energy to go around , you definitively have le commitment and responsabilites ( family or work ) , than when you are old , ( over 35 ) you are more of a free spirit . please allow me to explain my idea with some example . when i mean you have more energy to go aroung , i am talking about vitality and being in shape , it would not be a easy or comfortable to climb a mountain and camp outdoors when you are in your twenty , when your body is tone and strong . than when your are in your fifty even if you stay in shape , there is always the risk of a heart attack or other condition that normally appear with age . and thing that seemed okey before may be uncomfortable or even dangerous now . as for the commitment and responsabilites , i gravitate towards family and work . to me these two are the center of my life . i could not do the thing i did in my twenty now that i have a family to support and i am tied with a mortgage and credit card bill . so i guess i would call this the `` settled life factor '' , which could be pretty tight in both sphere but more manageable when young . finally , i belive that when you are young , you are more willing to take risk , go for adventure and take chance a you go . as people mature they some how change their way , and settle for something secure which i would translate into a calm life , with much of the enjoyment used already or waiting to be `` used '' during vacation time , maybe once a year . and a i have heard people say : if i did n't do that when i wa young i do n't think i could do it now .
