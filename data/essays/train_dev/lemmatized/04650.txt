as the whole world is confronted to pollution , some decision and reglementations have to be made to avoid the environmemtal destruction . cars are very concerned by these new measure and they are bound to be fewer in twenty year . first , the trend , in most city is to develop bus and subway to encourage people to use it instead of using their own car . it ha two advantage : the reduction of pollution and traffic . moreover , sometimes , when the pollution reach a certain level , the circulation of car is forbiden . if the pollution continue to increase , in twenty year , car will not be allowed to enter city . cars will disapear . some city have begun to take big measure . london for example rule the circulation in the center of the town . people have to let their car in the suburb aroud the city and to take the bus . it can be surprising but it could be the case of many city in about twenty year . however , it still remaims a problem with truck , we can not ask the bus to deliver the good . maybe , we can find a solution with new energy . experts say they can produce oil with vegetable but not for the entire planet . what about focusing on truck ? besides , most of the car 's company try to adapt their car to environmemtal reglementations because they know they are threatened . some try to reduce the pollution produced by car , other to make them function with electricity . i think people have to get used to a new way to travel . by bus in the city , by train to go from one city to another , by plane to travel abroad , by boat to cross the ocean , etc . everything follow this trend : transports are more and more developped and le expensive . look at the bus : they can bring you everywhere to conclude i do not expect a great futur for car . behaviours are starting to change : people travel a lot more by train than they used to .
