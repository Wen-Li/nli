the development of science and technology have implied a permanent increase in product and market 's option in our time . the public need to know which product exist and which are thier caractheristics and quality . for this reason , the advertisments are playing an important rule giving u , the comsummers , the posibility to know about what we are going to buy . but the advertisments need to offert a good product for sale and then they can give to the people a false valoration of them . the advertisement always are going to express a partial opinion about the product : the owner 's consideration . first , he need to create the idea that you need it . later , he will convincent the public that what he is offering is the best . in all case , he will try to give you the best opinion . even , without see the thing or taste it first by himself a person can think that this product is the wonderful and buy it . in addition , a product can not be very important for you , but if you see it in the commercial you can think to buy it and you can create a reason for this purchase . in many case this product will remain in the garage or in some place of the house you can not remembar later . the adverstisements are going to express every time acceptance and good opinion about the product because they pretend to catch the comsumer 's attention and make it enter in the market in a competitive way . when a new thing arrives to the market , it must show sufficient quality and presence to compite with the others product of the same kind that already exist and win costumer . for this reason many product only have a good presence and there are not a well a thay must , in account to the commercial . i agree that most advertisement make product seem much better than they really are and they lie to the public with bussiness porpouses . costumers must be carefull of the purchase and try to warranty it too .
