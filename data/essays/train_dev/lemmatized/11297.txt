the definition of enjoyment , the very feeling that brings you joy and happiness may defer from one individual to another . even though most people enjoy their life in their own way i agree with the claim that young people enjoy life more than older people do . there are various reason for the opinion i share . firstly yound people are much more healthier and energetic in contrast to older people . a lot of activity that an individual may enjoy require physical energy . this physical energy diminishes with age in most people . they have to worry about their health at all time since it deterioates with age . they might have a particular activity that the enjoy but it may be restricted due to different reason . for example an older person who enjoys listening to good music may have a problem with his hearing due to age . such people are highly dependent on medication which ha it share of side effect of drowsiness etc . on the contrary , young people have all the energy in the world to enjoy . they do not get tired easily . they are very enthusiastic and in the best of health at most time . their lifestyle is at a faster pace a compared to the older generation . youngsters can indulge in adventure sport , travelling , partying , eating and drinking without any restriction which would be troublesome for the aged . seconly young people are far more independent than older people . they are not dependent on somebody to take care of them . nor are they dependent to ask someone to drive them to somplace . moreover the older generation spend a lot of time on worriying about trival issue and restrict themselves experimenting . they are more orthodox in comparison to the younger generation and consider a lot of thing that youngster refer to a enjoyment a taboo . the older generation by far ha more value for money and they believe it in saving it for a later day . youngsters on the other hand may use up that money for luxury , or for a pleasure activity that will assure him a feeling of fun and happiness . i conclude the essay by restating my opinion that young people enjoy more in life , and i 'm sure most older people would also claim to having enjoyed more in their youth .
