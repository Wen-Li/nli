the decision on the best way to travel is dependent on a several factor . these include the similarity of the region being excursed with that of where the traveller hail from , cost and availability of information about the area travelled to and the personality of the traveller . the best way to travel differs in different situation . if the traveller is absolutely unaware of the culture of the place he or she is visiting , travelling in a group led by a tour guide may be the best thing to do . eg . if i do not know french and i want to visit france , travelling with a tour guide will be beneficial since i can enjoy my trip and learn everything i want to about france without letting the language barrier hamper me . i could escape the mammoth task of learning french and planning trip and comfortably rely on the tour guide . travelling in a group in this situation help provide me with a sense of security which is important to get in a foreign country . it may also provide interesting social interaction when friend and family are sparse in a foreign country . in this situation where all the travel detail are on the burdened on the tour guide , it becomes imperative that the tour guide is proficient in his or her knowledge of the region and make the right decision about place to visit and sharing the history of the region . in another situation , if a person is travelling to merely a different state or city in his or her own country or a neighbouring country where the culture are similar , it might be beneficial to plan the trip by the person himself or herself . this might give the person the maximum flexibility in travel plan and the person can avoid any dependence on the proficiency of a tour guide . there is little fear of insecurity since the culture is familiar to the traveller . besides these two main different situation described , another factor to consider is cost and the availability of internet resource . nowadays the internet ha alot of information regarding travel destination and if a person spends a little mount of time , he or she may be able to plan their own trip in the most cost effective way . on the other hand a tour guide may be an expensive proposition since the tour guide ha done all the hardwork of planning the trip and is sure to charge a hefty fee for it . the last factor regarding this decision is the personality of individual . some people do not like to be constrained by another person ' decision , in this case the tour guide and want to plan thing their way , while others may be more than glad to leave the travel planning to a tour guide . in summary there is no `` best '' way to travel . it is wise to take into account one 's personality , familiarity with the place being travelled to with respect to culture and cost consideration while determining the best way to travel .
