industrial engineering is a profession having a broad area becomes more popular in our country recently . it is thought that studying everything a little is better than specializing in one area . however in my opinion it is not a good idea . firstly , people with a broad range of interest can not learn and use everything well . it is obvious that human being have a capacity and this can be only enough for some extend . specializing on a specific subject make it possible to use all your efford for it . hence you will be more powerfull on that area . secondly , studying everything may be usefull for someone to see the big picture and sawing some problem easier . however fixing the problem usually need to be an expert . for example knowing accounting and computer programming may help you to define a problem in the accounting software , but only an software expert can fix it . lastly , think about the invention that are really essantial for our life . for example electricity , engine , computer , and so on . all of these are a product of a long training on a certain subject . this process is an increasingly learning process and it doe not have an end . hence , people should use all their efford to achieve the point that they can achieve . in conclusion , it may be said that having broad knowledge is better to find the problem or something else . however this is not an effective idea for being an expert and fixing the problem or improving the quality of life . thus , specializing on a certain aspect is better .
