do young people nowadays give enough time to helping their community ? it seems to me that the answer is negative . on this modern society , young people face more and more pressure under their school work . they may go to private school in the evening and burn the midnight oil after going home . tey are expected only the good grade . most of the adult only focus on their performance on test . they have n't been taught to care more about our society . the sircumstance of this situation is very serious . we may ask ourselves what kind of people these young people will be after finishing their education . they may become selfish and do n't see the big picture . it will be a disaster that if they would be the leader of our country in the future . there are still lot of thing we can do to change this sircumstance . we need to let our young people spend more time to helping their community to let them be more familiar with our society . it will help they to think they are part of the community and should do something good to our community . they will feel more connection to the society during the time they spend on the community . it will help not only our community to have more people to get involved in it but also the young people themselves to have the chance to get matured by the process they experience .
