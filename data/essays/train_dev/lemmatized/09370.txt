it is often said that young people enjoy life more than older people do . when you are young , you are le aware of the difficulty you can meet in a life . i think this sentence is in some way true . but i also believe that when you are older , you can enjoy life more than young people . first , when you are young , your life is ahead . we can say that anything is still possible . you are not conscious of all the reality of the world and your mind is still full of dream . when you do n't have a family to feed , life seems so much simpler . moreover , you are still healthy , health matter are not there to stop you . what can deprive you from going in club all night then ? if you do n't do this now , when will you do it ? when you are young , you still have illusion that you drive into doing thing without much concerning about the implication of your decision . however , it seems important to me to notice that nowadays , the reality of the world ha changed and young people are probably more worried toward their future than the past generation were . second , i guess that when people get older , they find other way to enjoy . i think it is difficult to compare the joy of going to a club every night and the joy of taking care of his/her young grandchild . i believe when you are more experienced about life , you do n't see the thing from the same point of view and you can enjoy some little thing in your life that you would n't have noticed when you were younger . if enjoying life mean doing crazy thing , then you have to be young to enjoy it . if you understand it a feeling happy to live , then i think you could be a happy at any time of your life .
