it is a well-known fact that car are one of the major cause of pollution nowadays . however , will we give priority to the environment over our own good and comfort ? on the one hand , there is a current growing awareness of the terrible risk that pose the pollution which ha been generated throughout the last decade . knowledge about what is beneficial or , on the contrary , harmful for the society is increasingly being spread among both youngster and adult by ecologist . on the other hand , people living today will not be alive to see what the world becomes in a few century . therefore , they do not really seem to be affected by the issue . personally , i consider that twenty year is very little time to make people get used to going on foot to work or to using public transport . we are still in the era of technology . as long a new car are invented , there is not way to stop people buying them . in fact , the more the seller offer , the more the customer demand . thus , the evironmental situation might even worsen by that time . let 's take my father . he can not avoid buying the last model in the market . he is passionate of car ! despite the fact that we are aware of the threaten that this uncontrolled use of car pose to our health , people are likely to continue with their life a if there is nothing outside there to worry about . but people will soon realize that there is a real need to stop polluting . otherwise , pure air will totally disappear and we will not be able to breath . even though i do not think that two decade is enough time to concious people about this worrying issue , i believe that politician will get to an agreement in which they will look for the population 's protection , since it is an issue which concern u all . for instance , a good measure to be taken would be to put a ban on driving a personal car more than twice a week . from then and on , i am positive that people will think it twice wether to drive a car or to take the bus !
