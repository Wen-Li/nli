at first glance , we could easily think that young people enjoy life more than older people do . however , i disagree with this statement . there is no denying that young people seem to be much more dynamic , excited and ambitious than older people . as far a i am concerned , i have the feeling to do many more thing than my parent do . i study science , i practice different sport , i play saxophone and i go out with my friend every week-end . by contrast , my parent are le active and prefer watching tv . in addition , i will not reveal the number of old peolple that told me that i wa lucky to be young a if they were suffering from their life . hence , young people give the impression to be really excited by life whereas older people seems to be le enthusiastic . however , beyond these appearance , i feel that young people do not enjoy life more than older people do . first and foremost , young people are not a happy a others could think . especially in france , the youth face lot of social and economic problem that affect happiness . for example , last year , thousand of french student demonstrated in the street to blame the government for not taking seriously into account the dramatic unemployment for young people . lots of them can not find a job even if they have a good degree and thus they do not succeed in making an adequate living to provide their future family . moreover , it is frightening to see how great the number of young people who killed themselves is . these example provide the evidence that young people are not a happy a others might think . lastly , we should not forget how happy lot of old people . being parent or grand parent might be one of the most important thing in a human life .
