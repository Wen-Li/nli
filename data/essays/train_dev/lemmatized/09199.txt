i disagree about young people nowdays they dont give enough time to help their communuities example some people doesnt give time for their family they go to work or with friend but they forget about their family , and some people in work doesent give time for their work and they dont come at time and dont show any reasponsebility . that all become back to the socaity cause we think that we can help any one just in word and in other way we can make communication with people so we will have more friend more work more from anything good we need , young people is looking about something silly like going out to have fun with out caring about our responsablety , now we can make many thing to help our community by teaching them giving them from our time to help them getting more happiness and more good feeling , when we forget about them we are making them disappointed so by our mind we can help them to get better we can make a party so they can share the happiness with u and taking them trip so they can have fun and feel that there is more people young once caring about them it will not take anytime from young people to make all this it just need some free time for taking a break and make something personaly for community but we ask always about silly thing such a going out having fun alone and that is so selfish why cant we think about someone else that will make u also happy i hope that young people think in that away and make something to help the community not only community will feel better even we will feel better cause we did something good and we gave something special .
