as the famous wise thought go , `` the biggest risk in life is not taking one '' . in order to be successful one ha to take that extra risk in today 's world . we are currently in the era of globalization and the world is getting flat day by day due to technological advancement and improved communication . oppourtunities are enormous , we need to go out there and grab them . every oppourtunity brings with it it own advantage and risk . in order to be successful one ha to take that risk associated with the oppourtunity . i would like to quote my own example for this topic . i worked a a medical editor and transcriber for a company for three year . i wa happy with my job and doing fairly well . but , my dream wa bigger and i wanted to make my own business someday in the domain of medical technology . at one point of time , i had an oppurtunity knocking my door wherein i had developed contact with few client with whom i could start up my independent business in medical technology . in order to accomplish this dream , i dared to take a risk of leaving my job and going ahead and setting up a small firm arranging for the finance through a bank loan , and leasing premise for an office . not having a management background , i had a tough time setting up a business and meeting end , but i reliazed that i learnt through my own experience , i faced downfall but learnt from it and didnt repeat the mistake . careful planning , hard work , and delevering timely to the client paid off . today , i have a succesfull running business in electronic medical record processing . the risk that i took at one point of time in life ha paid me back and i am doing much more better than i would have done if i continued to do what i could do well on my job .
