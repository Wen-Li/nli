i disagree with that stament . younger people do not enjoy life more than older people do , they just enjoy it in a diferent way . younger people still have the energy to do a lot of thing older people can not do , such a swimming and running and staying up with friend partying , so they enjoy life with a big group of people , often their friend from school and neighborhood . they also usualy do not need to work and worry about payment and loan and all of the problem troubling the older person , they only need to worry about education and their future , so they tend to play game like football , soccer , baseball and basketball , and have hobby like swiming and riding a bicycle , going to rock concert and dancing . older people enjoy life in a diferent way simply because they no longer have the time , or energy , to do the thing they used to do . they are too responsible , too caring about the example they set for their son and the time they give to them , to remember that they , too , need a moment for themselves . a grown person ha to worry about diferent issue , like working and paying for all of the thing they use , about not being a bad example for their child , and about their education , among other thing . so an older person tends to have fun with their husbands/wives and child , people from the neigborhod and job , but often in smaller number , and they tend to enjoy and remember the little detail more than the younger people , like that time their son started to walk , or when they said their first word , or that time away from the kid and alone with the loved one . they tend to have more patience , and have hobby such a model-building and collecting thing from their youth , and they tend to play game like golf and chess , and they remember past experience .
