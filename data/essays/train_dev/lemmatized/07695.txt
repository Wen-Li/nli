the world is developing day by day . new thought , new technology are being applied to make developements . i disagree to the point that there will be fewer car than there are today . firstly , we can see that different bank are emerging today in this competetive market . these bank provide loan at a very affodable rate of interest such that any one can think of buying a car . besides this , the car seller are comming up with different type of intresting and profit making scheme such that everyone prefer to buy a car . schemes like providing insurance free of cost , free equipment along with the car and many more thing which attracts people to buy the car . secondy , a i said earliar that competetion are increasing daily , so car manufacturs are making car having so many facility that people are tempted to buy it . facilities like a small refrigerator , rack for keeping book , mobile charger , music system and many thing . we can take a example of a very busy person . if he get so much facility in his own car then he dont have to wait or go any where for water or dont have spend any time in charging his mobile a all these thing can be done while he going somewhere . at the same time they manufacture car that requires very le maintainence . then , now a day people are giving much attention to the health a pollution made by factory and other thing are increasing day-by-day . so instead of buying a two wheeler they prefer to buy a car which is more safer and at the same time they can be free from pollution . so a the world is moving forward so fast people also want to cope up with everyone , regarding status , health , wealth and everything . so i think that the number of car are surely going to increase twenty year from today .
