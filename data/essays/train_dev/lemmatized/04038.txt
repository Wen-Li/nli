i strongly believe that student should understand idea and concept rather than they just learn them a a fact . i found that important since this is more beneficial for student for their future life . to begin with , while student understunding the idea and concept , they begin to set connection between all the idea they have learned . lets take an mba student . if he understands the different business concept for a company , he can understand how a whole business work . for example , let say he take accounting course and marketing course . at the end , he should make a connection between them to have a profound idea about that business . if he learns the concept just a fact , he can not have a broad point of view about that business . moreover , student who learn the concept a a fact tend to forget them much easily than the student understanding concept . for example , if a student try to memorize matematical function , he will most probably forget all those equation in a short time . on the other hand , if a student understand those function , he will le likely forget them . concequently , i agree that for student it is more important to understand idea and concept . therefore , student should take into account that how they learn make a real difference .
