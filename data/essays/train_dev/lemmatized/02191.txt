with the introduction of mass medias into modern society , advertisement ha developed a new , important role in modern life . as it became important , it also had to develop new way of attracting people , becoming more and more similar to a work of art than to a businnes-related expedient . one of these new way wa to present the product in the best possible way , in order to attract more people to it . some company during this process have also made the decision to lie about the real characteristic of their product . personally i do n't consider this part of the game , eventhough sometimes it can be really annoying . advertisements are supposed to show a product in the best way , and i can understand if a company decides to hide the bad characteristic of the product in order to make it more attractive . but i really ca n't accept when advertisement boast about something that is not true . i 'm not talking about child 's toy advertisement , where product are shown in a `` fantastic '' way in order to attract the child . i can understand that in this case we are talking about a product that is in some way related to the child 's fantasy , and the adult who are supposed to buy it are well aware of the fact that the toy will not , for example , fly , a it is shown in the ad . i 'm talking about advertisement that are directed to an adult audience and lie about the real characteristic and possibility of the product . this is in my opinion a real fraud and these ad should n't be allowed to be broadcasted or printed . fortunately in these day , new law about this problem have been created and hopefully advertisement company will not make a fool of u anymore .
