i do not agree with the statement that ` it is more important for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn facts` . i dont think that you can understand idea or concept of something when you do not learn the fact . facts are more important than idea . they should both know the fact and concept about something so they can analyse the situation themselves . they can not know something by not learning the fact . they can not be completely concious about a subject if they do not know the fact . the only thing they know is the idea about it . i also think that just understanding concept and not learning fact , do not encourage student to observe or investigate . we all just learn to understand others ' idea . maybe i would not agree with those idea if i had known more about it . you can not ask question about thing that you dont know what the fact is . hence just understanding idea will not let u asking question . mostly in history lesson we only understand idea or concept about lot of thing that we can never be sure if it is the truth or not . also i know it is hard to know all fact about history but i just wish i could . beside all those above by thinking a the meaning . fact mean something totally objective and can not be changed . however idea is opinion of other people and mostly are subjective . the fact are always objective . so it is more reliable . to put it in a nutshell for being more objective , asking more question about and making the situation more understanable for ourselves we should learn the fact .
