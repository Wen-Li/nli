understanding idea and concept is more important for student than learning fact . i am agree with this statement . there are several reason for this . one do not have to waste time for learning fact and also experience can help student to learn fact . just understanding the idea and concept can also help to be more creative . it is a waste of time to give student everything about the topic . they need to run their own brain to understand what the whole lecture is about . for example in an art class , theacher want from student to create a new tool for kitchen . he give the idea about what he want but if he give the fact they do not have to search anything to increase their knowledge and ability a well . they can not look from a different perspective . experience is one of the most important point to learn something . for instance , you studied your lesson and you had your driving licence . without having experince how you expect to drive a good a the others can . experience is more important than learning fact . you give the idea and concept . afterwards they experince it in the real life by facing them . being flexible in our creation depends on how free we are . just having the idae can help being more creative . in order to think well , sometimes we should learn fact by searching about them . in conclusion , try to learn fact is a kind of waste of time and without experiencing the concept we learn do not help u to improve ourselfs . according to these reason i am disagree with this statement .
