i partially agree with this statement . i think that having a broad and wide knowledge is a really good thing : if you are open minded and can discus about many topic , you can get many opportunity , and you can also have more immunity to market variation . for instance , in case of macro-economic problem in a certain productive area , you can be able to change your work more freely , and more rapidly respect to the one which are very deeply specialized . otherwise , worker ( and here i refere also to manager , and people who have great responsabilities ) also need to be specialized in a certain field . according to my opinion and to my knowledge , today the market need people who are specialized , but also need people who can share their knowledge with their colleague , in order to obtain revenue by sinergy and cooperation practice ; for this reason i think that while you are a student you need to widen a much a possible the spectrum of you knowlegde , investigating a many field a possible ; according to me , it is reasonable to improve a specific tecnical ability just after finishing your study ( or during the last year of your academic career ) ; behaving in such a way , you could have both the basic wide knowledge to effort change , and also the specialization , which could make you the best worker in a certain field at a certain time and in a certain region . for example , worker with a low istruction level , may have many problem in case of change in the strategy of their company , or ( and this is a more dramatical problem for worker involved in the process ) in case of market revolution , which make a certain product obsolete , or generate the so called `` killer application '' . so , in order to be an attractive worker for the labour market , you need to specialize your knowledge , but in order to minimize risk , and to avoid market change , you have to widen your knowledge ; you also need to improve your capability and knowledge after you have finished your study : this is the so called `` life long learning '' , which i believe is the best model in modern society .
