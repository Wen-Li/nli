the young people these day do not give sufficient time to help their community . in this fast moving world young people must allocate sufficient amount of time to help their community . i certainly agree that young people do not devote enough time to help their community . firstly , the world ha become so materialistic that everyone think in term of monetary gain . people do something if they get money out of it and are least interested in offering voluntary help to the people in their community . let u take the example of a graduate student who is willing to teach undergraduate at a university since he is monetarily rewarded but , is completely reluctant to teach the poor student of his neighbourhood a he is not paid for it . secondly , the population of the world is increasing at a very rapid pace which result in tremendous competition . there is a decrease in wage and people have to work for longer duration in order to survive . as a result of this a person earlier had more time at leisure to help the community wheras the current generation would like to do other recreational activity rather than helping their community . thirdly , there ha been a drastic change in the attitude of the current younger generation . the current generation lack the moral value that existed in the past and have become very selfish these day . take the case of a young boy who are influenced by movie which do not believe in doing anything that doe not give them anything back in return . nevertheless , we always find some good young people who make it a point to find some time and help their community despite having hectic schedule . they feel that by offering service to community they are serving the almighty . however , i firmly feel that very few young people give enough time to their community due to change in attitude , greed for wealth and increasing competition .
