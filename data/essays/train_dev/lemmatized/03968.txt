the statement that the , `` young people enjoy life more than the older people do '' , appears very vague to me . it is a very generalized statement . in my opinion age is just a number and it is the attidude towards life is that matter the most . i believe , if we have a positive attitude then no matter what our age is we will be optimistic and have a zest for life and for other social - cultural activity . in fact a we grow old , we mature and start making wise decision instead of being impulsive . young people in my personal opinion are hyperactive and prudent . when young we just want to do thing which will give u short term happiness or pleasure . during the growing up year , the tendency is to enjoy and to experience everything without considering the ramification of their action . but when we compare , the enjoyment that comprises of physical activity , like sport or other adventurous outdoor activity ( like biking , hiking , surfing etc . ) then there is no denial that the young people enjoy and make the most of it ! also when we are young , we face the hardship of life , education , job which at time can leave a little time for adventure or enjoyment . but a we grow old , by that time , we have taken care of our responsibility , achieved and accomplished our goal . then we adopt a more relaxed attitude to enjoy the benefit of our hardwork . so in a way it can be a debatable question who enjoys the life more , the young or the old ! as far a i am concerned , i do not agree that only young people enjoy life more . enjoyment and happiness are also associated with the way we human percieve thing . so enjoyment of life by younger generation can also be dubbed a an ambiguous entity .
