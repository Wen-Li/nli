it is sad to say so , but i am afraid it would be completely the opposite . not only there will not be fewer car in twenty year but there will be more car that our road , fuel resource and specially , environment will be able to take over . it seems that in these day everybody ha a car , new , second-hand , blue or red , compact or station-wagon , whatever the shape or model , when a young man or woman reach the appropiate age to drive , they get one car . and this is specially true in the case of usa , where a person ha nothing to do without a car . everybody get a car a soon a possible , not only because it is cheap . also because long-distance communication throughout usa may be really good , but that is not the case when it come to short distance . moreover , when you are driving , if you take a look around other car next to you , what you see is that most car are only filled with one person . maybe most of the people are heading towards the same direction , but nobody agrees to share the car , which will result into le fuel expense and from that into le air pollution . my opinion is also based on the fact that public transportation is already well developed , except in city where there is a possibility of building an undergrown net . i do not see any future perspective of an alternative vehicle but who know what will happen in twenty year . those futuristic film where we could see spaceship floating on the air seem to be very faraway . it is true that every day there are more low-cost airline that provide very cheap flight . but car will never be replaced for short-distance travel . there will be more and more car and this will have a terrible impact on our environment which already damaged by the pollution that car produce . the best thing would consist on finding a new type of fuel , based on natural component instead of petrol , a new efficient and friendly-environmen
