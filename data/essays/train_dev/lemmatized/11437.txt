nowadays , some people think that there will be fewer car in use than there are today . technology is growing everyday and also transformation is improving too . this make people use bus , train , ship and plane . on the other car are getting cheaper everyday with technology improvement so everybody can buy a car today . today if we look to car prires , we can see that there are car for everybody 's budget . in my country nearly everybody know how to drive a car and they say that they ca n't live without their car . they drive to shool , to work and also they are driving for hobby . when you come to turkey , you can see the family which have three member , have three car . we can understand that car have big part in our life . i think in twenty year everybody will have car and the traffic problem will be more than today too . car firm are improving their self and they are producing more car than last year . we can see that the firm such a audi and bmw are re-newing their model with new skill every year aproducing new car although they . according to a article in the autoshow magazine the smallest firm are producing at least 350 million car in a year and it show u that trafic will be more crowded in the future . as a result there will be more car in use than there are today . in my opinion goverments should build more road .
