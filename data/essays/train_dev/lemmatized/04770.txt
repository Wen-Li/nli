i absolutely agree with the statement that it 's more important for student to understand idea and concept than it is for then to learn fact . the only information from school that never left a person 's mind is the data that he understood clearly . about 14 year after i graduated from university , it is interresting and curious to see how i can explain most of my knowlegde to my son . most of those information were very well understood not just memorized . after a couple year , even if a person have a good memory , he wo n't keep in mind the concept and knowlegde that he never understands . i learned when i wa a child a lot of verse on the bible , because my kid 's school had learned me those verse . but now , because i do not repeat then all the time , i forgot a lot of then . i di n't care to understand them , just learn then to have good grade . but now , now all i can remember are verse that they explained to me and those wich have a importance in my life . i think education today should focus more on explain thing insteed of just let student learn then . our world will be better .
