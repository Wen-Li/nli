i agree with the statement which say that the most advertisement make product seem much better than they really are . although there are some legal rule for advertisement to prevent it from being advertized with wrong information , there still are some problem . for example , when you were to do online shopping , you can easily find some product which are advertized completely different from they actually are . once i bought a necklace online from a store in other country and when i received it , i wa very surprised how different it wa from what i thought from the website advertisement . i am sure that many other people must have experienced this kind of situation . i think this online shopping example clearly show that many product are overly advertised to seem much better than actual product . when you do the online shopping , all you depend on is their advertisement and maybe it picture . sometimes picture show only the good angle of the product which attracts buyer . even the advertisement on tv have the same problem sometimes . tv advertisement for food product are one of the example . usually , when they advertise about their food product , they would not say the food doe not taste good or they are ok to eat . they always have to show that the food product taste very good . you see a advertisement of a food product and you expect it to taste good from the impression of the tv commercial but sometimes when you actually eat the food product , you think ' it doe not taste a good a i thought !! ' . i think it show the fact that those advertisement on tv make the product seem much better than they are often time . it would not be an advertisement if it make you an impression that the product is not good , but i think that they should at least not let the buyer to surprise a lot . they should either produce better product or not to advertise them at all .
