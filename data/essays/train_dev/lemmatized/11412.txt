imagine the earth ha nearly 7 billion inhabitant . almost 60 percent live in asia , which is a growing market for the car industry . yes , there will be fewer car in use than there are today . according to the market in asia let u assume that almost every citizien ha a car down in asia . the car industry is going to be a happy a they were never before . for instance they are going to raise their annual income to a never forseen hight . which is good for the economy of the whole world . because the rate of unemployment is going down enornormously . and every person who is working for the car industry will benefit from that boom . firstly the employer live more savely because they are going to have more money to spend for luxury . but what is more the surrounding economy like the travel branche or the apparel industry is growing too . these are just two example i like to indicate . on the other hand all these car are going to cause havoc to the environment . most importantly to the air because the car producing a lot of chemical stuff like co2 which will harm the atmosphere . according to the atmosphere which is our weather kitchen . it produce rain , snow and even oxygen , without these element we are not able to live . to put it in a nut shell even if it rain the rain is not free of chemical combination . so the rain cause harm to the forest and animal and yes even to the whole mankind . unfortunenatly none of our well payed scientist have discoverd a system to prevent acid rain , which is the main problem to the environment in which we live . so it is our task to save the nature for our fellowers . to ensure this task is going to be succesful we have to put more money into education . let me sum it up , more car of course , but not with more danger to the environment and mankind . let u build even more environment friendly car , like hydrogen car or with solar power . than there will be no harm the the atmosphere and everthing is okay for our future genarations
