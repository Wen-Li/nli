whether successful people try new thing and take risk rather than only doing what they already know how to do well is an interesting staetement and , in my opinion , it is quite extreme , too . i think it mostly depends on the situation you are in : because of this i said that it is an extreme affirmation . it is impossible to generalize such a variable thing . in fact , everyone of u can find himself in so many possible situation , all different one from eachothers , that can suddenly change his behavior : in some situation he can first be a person that try new thing and like risk , but in other occasion he can be just the opposite of who he wa . let 's make some useful example in order to support my position . my father is a very successful man : he is the chief officer of the family enterprise and he usually like tring new thing and taking risk . for example , one of his principal activity is to buy and to sell stock on the stock exchange market . this is a real dangerous business , because you can loose all you have in just one bad and unlucky `` bet '' . in this case , my father usually act riskly : he always say that if you do not risk you do not make money . but occasionally it happens that my father change his behaviour : sometimes doing this activity , in other word exchanging stock , he transform himself in a really aware person . i think this is due to some particular event that occur to the market , and because my father know them and ha a lot of experience , he pay attention to them . to sum up , what i really want to say concerning to the topic presented in the title is the following . it is true that in order to become a successful person you have to be innovative and you have to like risk too . but , there are many situation that obbligate you to become aware of what you to and to avoid a risky behavior , unless you want to loose your characteristic of being a successfull person .
