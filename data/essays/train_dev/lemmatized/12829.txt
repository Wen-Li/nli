i agree somewhat and also disagree somewhat with the statement that successful peopletry new thing rather than only doing waht they already know how to do well . in the world , there are succesful peopie who are succeeding beacause they are not trying new thing , but also there are people whpo are succeeding because they did start something new . i disagree because not every people who are sucessful ha done new thing so they can become sucessful . for example , there may be some company that ha succeded in the past with the current bos . if the current bos dy , his son may take in his position . his son ha been living with his father for year , and so he know how and what to do in the company to keep the company sucessful . i agree because of the unsucessful people that are trying to become succesful . unsucessful people will try more new thing . the unsucessful people will try more new thing , because he want to succeed . if he keep what he is doing now that is n't giving him success , he will come up with more new idea that could lead hiom into a successful life . also , there are people who want to start something new but they ca n't . like the son in the first example , he may want to start a new company , but he will not be able to , because he will have to start a new company while still keeping the current company succesful aswell . if he make the current company unsuccesful , he ha caused thousand of worker to lose there job , causing them to find new job . this make the bos of a company think twice about starting a new business while currently having a successful company in progress . because he hold the life of thousand of other worker , he can not just go off and start whatever he feel like starting . that is why i think that not every successful person try new thing rather than only doing what they already know how to do well .
