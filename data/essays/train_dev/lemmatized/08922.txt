nowadays , a we all noticed , advertisement have been becoming more and more atractive . as far a i am concerned , i totally agree with the fact that most advertisement make product seem much better than they really are . indeed , first of all because i believe that it is a kind of marketing just to make people choosing one specific brand and not an other one . for instance , you can quickly think that you want to buy something that you had see on t.v. whereas , if you did not have see it you even may not know that the product exist before . moreover , secondly i am convinced that advertisement are liable to lie about the quality but also about the apparence of the product . infact , most of the time , a product can seem the best of the world on the picture and when you go to buy it , you are generaly disapointed . finally , even if , sometimes , the product conrespond exactly to what the advertisement show , that case remain very seldom today . furthermore , because of the progress of new technology , you can now modify picture even on television in order to turn them more atractive and interesting for people . as a conclusion i would say that we do not have to trust in apparences but better in our own opinion of the product just to avoid falling in the new consomation society . that is the only way to be le disapointed byt
