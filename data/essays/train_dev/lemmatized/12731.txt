whether understanding idea and concpets is more important than learing fact is a good point to discus a there many talk going around regarding changing the study pattern in many university . i believe that it is very inportant for student to understand idea and concept because the main aim of education is to gain knowledge . the student go to school/university in pursuit of knowledge which is based on concept and idea . the fact can not be understood or related unless the concept behind the fact is known . for example , one can enjoy beauty of ranibow , but can not understand how it is formed unless he/she know the law of dispersion . secondly , understanding idea and concept will help student to focus on the study . the fact can draw student 's attention in many direction that will not help him gain enough knowledge and depth about the subject . the understanding of idea and concept will help improve thinking ability of a student in right direction . it can help student concetrate more on any subject . the idea and concpets are usually scietifically proven thing which make them are trustworthy . with only fact , the student can only guess about the reason behind the fact . no one can answer the reason behind apple falling down from tree without explaining law of gravity . the next reason for me to support this point is that understanding idea and knowledge can make student organize his/her study in timely manner with proper focus . this would help a student to gain sufficient knowledge about variety of subject in a given academic year . if the student concentrate only on fact , he/she will not be able to pay attention to all the subject taught in the curriculum . this will narrow the future scope for the student . lastly , i feel that understanding idea and concept can help student to come up with new reasearch on certain thing happening around u . the student can form baseline with the help of idea and concept already known and can explore the unknown thing . thruogh their research . this can result in many further developements in our life such a new medicine that are more effective , technology to help improve our day to dat activity , etc . . with all thes point , i strongly feel that it is more important for stduents to understand idea and concept than to leearn fact so a to gaim more knowledge about variety of subject wihtin give academic time which can help them to broaden their future scope and carrier .
