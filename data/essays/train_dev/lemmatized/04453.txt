i agree that travelling in a group led by a tour guide is beneficial in a number of way but with a few reservation on group travel . i would explain my reasoning in the following paragraph . firstly , tour guide is a professional who know alot of place , thier history and how to reach the place , where to stay , what food to eat etc . , . also tour guide is proficient in the native language of the place . these two advantage overwiegh any other disadvantage of travelling . secondly , travelling in a group led by a tour guide will be cost effective a more people will share the travel expense . tour guide will explain the history of the place visited which we can not know unless we do some homework on what place to visit and read through it history which we often donot do . travelling in a group will help to build new partnership with fellow traveller in the group which can not be done if travelled indivdiually . thirdly , travelling in a group with a guide help u to avoid problem with native language speaker and also fishy shopping trick by native speaker . also a a group , more number of place can be toured with same amount of money if spent on individual travel . but , there are a few disadvantage for group travel led by a guide . limited knowledge of the tour guide will make u to tour fewer place which tour guide is familiar with . co-ordination effort among the group of people with different mindset is difficult . privacy during travel will be be voilated during group travel . travelling individually allows the individual to see place of his/her interest rather than constrained by the group travel . in conclusion , group travel is advantageous in most of the scenario in many term but it depends on the individual preference and his/her fnancial limitation .
