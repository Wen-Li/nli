in the course of they study , people are often confronted to a dilemma : should they focus on a single subject or study a broad variety of topic ? let me examine argument in support of the two option , and finally i 'll explain why an intermediate answer is needed . in the harsh competion of modern world , finding a job often requires a high level of knowledge and performance , which can be achieved only by focusing on a speciality . i also personnally ca n't help covering a subject in it totallity whwn i have begun to study it , else i fell frustated i had better not to start ! however , although being highly specialized and knowing little aside can ensure you a good job and intellectuall fullfillment , it can be very disturbing in your social life . imagine you meet someone specialized in engineering while you are spezialized in music , there can be no conversation between both of you ! the range of people you are likely to meet anf appreciate would be very short . .. and even regarding job , let 's think a bit further : to the extend a company us to develop it product various field , it technitians must know enough about the others speciality in order to work together . for example , if a telescope manufacturer 's optician are unable to communicate with the mechanist to share their need and constraint , the company will never be able to manufacture any instrument . that 's why i think we ca n't really give a sharp answer to the question . we need to be specialized for certain thing a job and academic career , but an enjoyable everyday life requires that everybody know a little about everything . in can be extremely important , have a look for example at the nuclear debate : here are some decision to be taken that ca n't be left to specialist only , a every person is higly concerned . there are several way between the two extrem position , and people sould be allowed to choose the specialization grade that suit them .
