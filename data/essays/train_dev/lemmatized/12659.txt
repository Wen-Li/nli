i believe that successful people are successful because thay have taken risk in their life , however some people could argue that a successful life stand on what you think is being success for you . it probably depens on the way you have been educated . some people find their success in doing what they are doing good . others are always trying to go a step forward . the unexplored part of going a step forward ha a strong risk that people ha to take only if they want to . and this is what i believe make u being different or at least , not being a everyone el . successful is related with being strange , in a unique way , to stand out of the rest of the people . however , i think it is totally related to you own culture . being successful in the united states is not the same of being successful in china or a small town in africa . my personal experience travelling aroung the world ha given me a different idea of what is mean to be successful in life . usually , i relate the success with my own culture and place it in what we call the first world , which mean being successful in bussiness enviroment or economy talking . however i think it is neccessary to take a step back and think of other culture : being successful could mean be the leader of a small town in india were it is related to the one how wa able to do something ( for example bring water to a village from a long_distance river or to be able to kill a lyon in the middle of a forest ) . in all those case people needed to take risk , but risk that had a meaning on their culture and circumstance . in this sense only people how is brave enough to take the risk have the chance of being different can be successful . i definitely agree with the statement , and actually i believe that people is successful becasue those risk they have taken , have given them their success .
