i agree that successful people try new thing and take risk rather than only doing what they already know how to do them well . in my opinion they try new thing to make themseleves more interesting people or just to show the intention from the other . those people always want to go further new thing which isnt a good idea . taking risk is a very dangerous thing to do because they know what consequence they could get by doing something wrong . for example many famous actor are very popular for they good acting or they beauty but we always hear that there taking risk such a trying drug which they know it very bad , instead of not taking those risk and do thing wich are more inteligent . everyday we hear in the news paper about those successful people who are doing bad thing and always talking rish instead of taking care of themselfes , looking after there familyes or enjoying life with happiness . most of them doesnt think that life is very short all they whant is to try new thing wich dosnt help them only for dangerous risk . i never understand those people why do they have to take those ridiculous risk and they dont know that it can bring them to very serious consequence like death , and some of them have a family with child and that may effect the childrens behavour . they already know how to do thing well so they should be intellingent in not trying risk and give good example to everyone so that people always had a good thought of them .
