it is more important for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact . i agree that it 's more important for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact . because the student , they need idea and concept to understand the lesson or what they are watching . if u give a child a picture or a photo with no explaination , he/she wont know what is happening in the picture . the child need atleast something to talk about the picture or what is happening . for example , just a picture of a guy standing doing nothing . the child will not know anything , but if there is a picture of a guy doing something he/she will know what is happening . the guy might be eating for playing or anything like that . but if only giving fact to the child , he will not think , he will just do what is he told to do and never think . the best solution is , and what i think and tried , is that giving idea and concept and teaching them the fact are much better . they can think and give example of what is happening . sometimes it just easier to memorize something but it wont help if this thing happened in real life . for example , just memorizing the rule of the chess game and never played it , you wont know how to play unless if u try it many time . its good that the person know how to use the fact and know how to give sample what is happening . for example giving fact of what 's happening now between israel and palestine that israel conquered palestine and will never leave it free . this is what i think about the important for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact .
