learning a wide knowlede of academic subject is strongly important to nourish a person in univerisity . although there are various method of gaining educational program through life , the university is necessary a the place for the pre-step to work in society . let me explain these reason a follows . my primary reason is that a broad knowledge could stimulate student ' interest or help student find their interest . when i enrolled to tokyo university , i wa thinking about majoring in civil engineering . however , though many academic class in first two year in the university , my interest expanded into a wider academic world . although i majored in civil engineering , i could solve problem according to buiding structure or environment engineering with various aspect of thought such a economics or chemical science , owing to a boad knowledge . next , various skill will be required in workplace . even one project of a constructing building need many knowledge and skill . to research the site to build precisely , scientific knowledge is important . skill to make blue print for it is also inevitable , in addition to the basic technique of using personal conputers . in order to exoplain this building plan to other people and share this concept , limitted knowlede and skill are impossible to work better with others . if a student hope to concentrate on the specialized subject , he or she could enter the graduate program . in the graduate , student can pursue own interest more deeply and take a step to ahieve a career goal . however , the young ha great potential which an individual never find it by themselves . then , absorving the knowledge in the unknown world could play an important role through life . i believe that unknown subject of many academic subject could expand student ' interest and ability in university . provided skill and knowlede in academic institution also are required in the workplace someday . it is important the young to gain a wide variety exoerience though many subject so a to solve many probelms and deepen own interest for good .
