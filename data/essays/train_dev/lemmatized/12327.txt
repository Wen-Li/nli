i disagree with the idea that it is more important for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact . i think that to understand idea and concept is very important , but i think also that to learn fact are not le important thant idea and concept . they are at least at the same level . i think that idea and concept are at the base of a theory and so they are at the base of our knowledge , but sometimes fact can replace and modify the original theory , so it is important to know real fact ! in italy there is a famous affermation that is `` la migliore teoria e ' la pratica '' that can be translate in english with `` the best theory is the real pratice '' , and i think that this affermation represent perfectly my opinion . in our world there are a lot of job that need a lot of experience , and experience can be `` reached '' only by fact rather than with idea and concept , that they are also important of course , but without fact nobody can `` reach '' an high amout of experience . another example is a normal math exam : to prepare a math exam we ca n't only study theory on the theory book , we must do a lot of exercise if we wont to understand how the theory is used in realty , or at least how the theory is used in the exercise that will be in the exam . in the end , i dont know if my thought about the importance for student to learn fact is condivided by all other people , because i know that there can be a lot of people that thought that is important only to understand idea and concept , but that is my opinion and i think that is right .
