actually , i do n't think that the statement `` youg people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communties '' , is completely truth . personally , during the week i am always busy because of the university and the work , and during the weekend i usually enjoy with my friend and unfortunatly , this kind of life is similar to all my friend life and the main part of young people life . but i have acquitance with some boy , who really feel the needed to help other people an the community . for example , one of them , who is just 23 year old , decided to give all his free time working in a hospital a volunteer . now they are 3 year that he enjoy working there . he spends all the weekeds , every saturday night working for the community . another boy i knew last year , left a voluntear an now he ha been working for 6 month in the south america . in the village where i live , lot of people give part of their money in charity : rotary association is very popular , and there is one minority club that it is only for young people . but also lot of other association are supported by everyone . i think that this kind of action mean that we can support an improvement not only giving our time but also giving a financial support , and that we are not indifferent about the topic . probably , the majority of people are not used to think very often about helping their community , and fact refelect this ; but in this last year the government ha put lot of advertisement on the radio and on television , and my view is that now people are getting more confident with the problem that we have in our own community . i think that we are paying more attention at this topic in this year than in the past . so probably young people in general have n't lot of time to helping their comunity , but they are interested in doing this , and someone of them choose helping people a the main activity of their life .
