there is a big gap between the generation of young and old people . and of course my mind will be biaised because i am young . but to this question , i will try first to discribe the young people 's view of enjoying life , then i 'll put myself in older people 's shoe . so , let 's begin with the young people . when you are a child , your parent try to educate you and most of the time , they argue . that 's why i do n't think that between 0 and 18 year old you enjoy in each case your life . but after 18 you become a student and i am sure that everyone had liked it life at this period . you can do the study you like , eat your prefered food instead of always thinking about to the vegetable your mother cocked . you can go out with friend and meet new people by travelling . it 's the moment you can best develop your open-minded capacity . then , let 's switch to the older people 's point of view . anybody want to grow up and get older . but it is a fate . however , it urge you to try new thing , discover new horizon if you do n't want to stay behind your television . furthermore , your thought may be turned to death . so at this moment you want to enjoy life at maximum . when you are retired , it 's the best period to go on holiday , read many interesting book . .. as a conclusion , i can finally say that every year , at every step you have problem with different rate of importance but the most important thing is to try to escape from the treadmill of a boring life . we all expect a slower pace of life , of course life is not simple , but young and old people have to enjoy they life and those of them relative .
