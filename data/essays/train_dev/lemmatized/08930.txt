to specialize in one specific subject is really very useful , but in my opinion it is always better to have broad knowledge of many academic subject in this competetive world to excell in life , i.e `` jack of all trade master of none '' . specialist are people who specializes in one specific subject and have a very detail information of that subject , so he can excell in field which is only concerned with his subject moreover having a detailed knowledge of the subject will provide him with and extra advantage of doing research in his subject . whereas a person who have a broad knowledge of many academic subject will be unable to go ahead and work in detail in any particular subject . but in this highly developing world , where developements are going at a very fast pace it always happen that to invent something it requires people who have knowledge of various subject rather than being a specialist . e.g i am a student of of mechnical engineering very much interested in my subject and looking forward to pursue a career in mechanical engeering . but in an industry many thing go on , many mechanical process are combined wiyh electrical process to get some result so it will beneficial for myself to have the knowledge of the electrical process to have a complete understanding of the complete procees . secondly it is also an advantage of a person with a broad knowledge of many subject that he can select his career from a wide variety of choice and not just confining himself to a particular subject or field . so summarizing the point i would like to favour the point that it is better to have a broad knowledge of many subject than to specialize in one specific subject , because knowledge of many subject is reqiured to get the total information .
