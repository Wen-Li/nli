i am very interested to discus about this topic , young people enjoy life more than older people do . i disagree about this topic , because young people are a lot of learn for their better life , young people 's body is more healthy than old peopel so they have to work hard for their future . there are many imformations that we have to know for our better life . when people is young , their brain is more active and knowlege so the young people study and learn more when their brain are active briefly . and when we want to live more comfortably in older . we have to make a lot of money for good when is older . there is reason why young people have to make money in youth , because it is easy to make money and to have passion . another reason why i disagree about this topic is people work hare for their future when their body and brain are healthy . the young people have more health and powerful , so they have to work hard for their country and themselves . if young people do n't work when they are young , there is nothing to work for their country . the world is made by young and inteligent people . many young people want to enjoy their life when they are young , but if they enjoy their life when they are young , there is no time to work hard and to make money for themselves . enjoying their life is not late when they become old . many people need people who have talent and inteligent . if young people work hard and learn something , they are going to be more comfortable and more joyful when they are old . these are the reason why i disagree about young people enjoy life more than older people do .
