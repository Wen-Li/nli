i think it is not easy to answer because you have to respect several aspect . on the one hand i think this statement is correct , because today there are some people who think only on theirselves . they think that they are the most important person and if somebody need help they say : ask somebody else . this is a very hard opinion and i think ( and i hope ) that this is only a minority of our population . on the other hand i think that especially some old people have a wrong opinion . they often speak about an unfriendly and unpolite youth , but i think this is not a correct opinion . i think that this is caused by those people i have talked about in the first paragraph . i can tell about my friend and me . we are a group of five people and we work in a home for old people . there , we do lot of thing to help these people to have a nice day . we stay there two time in month and the old people are very happy to see u every time . another example is my big sister . she is cooking in my old school for lot of pupil with some other parent , because the village ha not enough money to pay for a good food . so many parent decided to do this job on their own to give the pupil a good meal . i think this is a good help in the comunities . what is important to say too , is that there are many pupil who help other pupil with their homework and learn with them for test or other thing like that . this is also a kind of help for others . at least i can say that i think that the majority of our population is doing lot of thing for their community . of course it can always be more , but if everybody help a little bit , i think it is a good start for the future .
