nowadays , knowledge is something crucial in our society . people tend to study more in order to have the necessary knowledge to work and live in society . but they need a specific knowledge for each situation . we are going to see first of all , why it is essential to have broad knowledge of many academic subject and to finally conclude about why it is necessary to specialize in one specific subject . on one hand , when child are at school , they learn many subject such a history , geography , mathematics , language . they can have an overall view about their culture . it is essential for people to have broad knowledge in order to express themselves and not to be narrow-minded . for example , when people are discussing in an every day life conversation or about news from the world , they have to know about what they are talking about . if they have a lot of culture and broad knowledge , they could talk with other people and have different point of view about many subject . on the other hand , when child grow and become student , they have to specialize in one or a few subject in order to work in company . for example , a marketing director is specialized in one subject which is marketing because it is his function in the company . but being specialized in one subject is not enough . it is obvious that you have been hired for your specialization but for your knowledge in other subject too . the marketing director must also have knowledge in finance to fix his budget . in conclusion , being specialized in one specific subject is good but it is not enough . you need also to have knowledge about many subject for every day life but also for the labour market . it is very important to develop this knowledge in order not to be narrow-minded . you have to be specialized and have also broad knowledge . culture and knowledge are two thing that can not be dissociated .
