some people may think that young people tend to enjoy life harder than older people do because the young have been brough up in a society which teach people to enjoy . however , i do not agree with the statement ; the older are the one who truly understand how to enjoy and what to enjoy . admittedly , young people are more likely to accept the newly developed technology , such a the chatting on line program msn , more quickly than the senior do . in such condition , they can enjoy life better . however , it doe not mean that the young enjoy life more . in most case , older people are also eager to learn new implement which can benefit their both academic career and leisure time . although to a cartain degree , older people are slow learner , but their motivation and their experience they have will help them to finally manage the technology and use it for enjoyment . the only difference between the young and the older is the time when to manage the technology to enjoy life . some may argue that , being young , most people do not have the family supporting burden , thus having enough money and time , and being able to do whatever they like . but when having the finacial burden on themselves , the older are incline to cherish time and money and will not chose a expensive and time assuming way for enjoyment . further more , being older , they have experienced much more than the young people and consequently know more about what are the most important thing in one 's life , and will chose the meaningful way to kill their time instead of doing something senseless . on the contrary , young people lack the experience to judge whether something is good or not , so they tend to have the wrong mode to enjoy life . in conclusion , a older people have experienced more the young do , they have more motivation and knowledge than the young do , on how to enjoy their life meaningfully and wisely .
