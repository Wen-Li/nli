the thesis on hand is that succesful people try new thing and do not only do thing they already know . i think that this is true because it is a key to succes to make experience and learn of your mistake and problem and then improve yourself . first of all , it is very important to make experience if you want to be succesful . when you try new thing you will automatically make the experience if it wa good or bad what you did . as a consequence you can improve your acting . for example , all ingeners are kind of people who try new thing and do not always what they always know to do . this lead to very important invention which would not have been made if people did not take risk . the best example is henry ford who invented a new kind a producing car . this wa risky but in the end it paid off and he wa very succesful . second , if you want to be succesful you have to learn of your fault in order to improve yourself . when building a house for example , you will do some mistake in putting all the stone together . afterwards the problem occurs that the house go broke . now you can infer what you did wrong and the next time you will be more succesful . this show that you can always be succesful by trying new thing and learn of your mistake . finally , if nobody ever tried new thing humanity would still live in cave . i mean that every step forward is risky but it ha to be taken otherwise there would be nor progress and no success at all . to conclude it can be said that succesful people try new thing and are more likely to take risk because they will make valuable experience and learn of their mistake in order to improve themselves . this is a very important key to success .
