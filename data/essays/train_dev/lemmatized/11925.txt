the main idea of traveling is to enjoy and to know a different environment . take picture , spend some time enjoying new place or walking around are some of the activity people do during a trip . these activity require time and going with a little group of friend who have the same taste or just alone is the best idea to totally enjoy and take advantage of each minute . choosing a place to go is a difficult decision . there are a lot of choises where to go during vacation and if a person chooses a place it is because he want to take the best advantage possible of that trip . two or more people who share the same taste are more likely to have fun in the same way , a group of advetured friend or a couple of lover can be some example of it . in a guided trip people will be forced to see the place given by the agency so there will be no chance to change plan . during a trip people like to spend the money in souvenir or gift . going without a tour guide will safe a big amount of money because people can look different way of transport , restaurant or hotel . these money that they will safe can be more wisely used in new place or just gift . in a vacation trip people want to have more privacy and time to spend with their family and friend . a moment enjoying the sunshine in a new place is reason enough for changing plan at last minute . in a guided tour this is just not posible , the prepared schedule ca n't be change because that will disturb the other people who want to continue with the trip that they already paid for . as a conclusion , the best way to plan a trip is with a group of known people without a guide . that , will help the trip to have more surprising moment and to safe some money that can be use for other different purpose . the explanation above can explain that i desagree with the statement : `` the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide ''
