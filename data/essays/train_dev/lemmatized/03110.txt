i do n't agree with this statement because i think that having a deep knowledge in one specific subject is much better . i think this because , even if a broad knowledge of many academic subject could be important , in my opinion the world of our day require particular skill to the person . if a person had a knowledge of many subject , he would n't be able to have a deep knowledge of every these subject , and this could mean that he could n't be able to solve determined problem which require a deep knowledge of a pattern . for example let u think about a manager who know all the kind of problem which could happen in an enterprise but who who ha n't a graet preparation in order to solve them because during his academic career he did n't specialized in one particular subject . in this case i think that even if this manager ha a great preparation due to his enlarged study , he would n't be able to give his contribute to the company . i also think that a broad knowledge of many academic subject automatically implies the fact that it ca n't be the result of a deep preparation in all these kind of subject . i think that this kind of knowledge could be important to a person own satisfaction but if we assume that every subject could have been studied in deepth , it would have implied a lot of time spent ( ten year or more ) and i think that it wouldn'be of great importance becuse in my opinion the world requires our skill a soonest a we can ! beside i also think that the world doe n't have the will to expect u completing our long study in all the subject , but it expects that we will able to provide it a quick solution it problem .
