most advertisement make product seem much better than they really are . i do not completely agree with the above statement because advertisement have both advantage and disadvantage . firstly , i will discus about the advantage with quite a few example . what exactly a person look for while buying a product ? may be the price , quality or some other factor . more clearly , we can say that he or she is not sure in certain situation . finally , they make a decision to buy something new which they have seen last night in the commercial ad . simlarly , when people doe not know anything about a particular product , in most case , they rely on advertisement . thats an other plus point of advertising . apart from this , most of the time people spend their leisure time by watching television and reading book , which are the excellent source for advertising . as a result , public come to know about the new product through the ad . coming to the disadvantage , the first and foremost is with the child . whenever they found the ad to be attractive , they want u to buy the product for them , regardless they use it or not . when come to the food stuff , they always try to go for the junk food , where the ad cash in by showing them attractive . sometimes , we see some of the product to be le expensive . we usually get attracted to and purchase them . but the final result is that it get damaged after a short period . we have to compromise for the quality . in the conclusion , i would like to say that advertisement doe not make u buy le quality product all the time but they do sometimes . it is our mental ability to think what to purchase and what not ? in most case , the advertisement make product seem much better than they really are
