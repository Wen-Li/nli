i agree with this statement that in twenty year there will be fewer car in use than there are today . here are my reason : more and more people concern about the polluted problem of environment , and not only government decides to pas bill that can protect our nature environment , but also people reduce the damage to our environment . and car are one of vital damage to these pollution , because they release carbon dioxide . if people reduce to drive car by themselves , instead , use the mass transportation , the amount of carbon dioxide , which is a vital reseason that cause pollution can be eliminated . so i think car will be fewer than today . second , city are developed grauatedly , more and more city will have their mass transportation , such a mrt , train , or bus . these useful development can provide a more ecnomical way to transport for citizen . in order to save money and priceless time , people will choose to use mass transportation rather than drive car by themselves . for example , although many teacher of mine have their own car , but they only drive car by themselves in rainy day . because the mrt in our city provides a cheaper and comfortable journey for u . and they do n't need to drive . in addition , the expenditure to maintain a car is very big . for example , the expenditure of gasoline , the tax of car , etc . this huge expenditure would effect the willing of people having a car . finally , crowed traffic situation would also make people do not want drive car by themselves . and there is still a big problem to driver : finding a parking space is extremely hard . to sum up , the idea of environmental protection , more conveinent mass transportation , the expenditure of having a car , to avoid stuck in a traffic jam , worry about how to find a parking space on time , all of these consideration would make fewer and fewer people to plan to have their own car .
