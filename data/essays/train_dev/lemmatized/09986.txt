even though joung people usually like enjoying themselves more than older people do , this is not necessarily true . for exemple , you could meet a really cool 60-years-old man that doe everything in his power to have fun and make life worth of being lived , and a very boring 20-years-old boy who will never step out of his house except to go to school . on the other hand , iif it 's true that joung people do enjoy life more , it could be because of the belief that one would better take advantage of it youth before it is too late . i do not totally agree with that statement , in fact i think that people should have the courage of enjoy their whole life , without wasting all their chance while they are just teenager or waiting too long to start following their dream . talking about real fact and people , i could nominate a many teen a older people that are enjoying their life . today 's world offer chance to have fun to people of all age : there are a lot of park and resort where a child can go and enjoy a few day and where it parent would have a great time too . holiday resort where my grandparent would love to spend a few week can be found almost anywhere , and of course there are a lot of structure that offer amusement to teen between 15 and 30 year old . so , if a person want to `` enjoy it life '' , there is nothing keeping him from doing that . nevertheless , we will always meet someone who is not wanting to do any of these . and if we really pay attention to it , we will find out that this kind of behavior is present in people of all age , there in not a real average . if one want to have fuun , he will do it , and if he doe n't he will not . maybe it 's just another way of enjoying life , even though most people consider it boring and worthless .
