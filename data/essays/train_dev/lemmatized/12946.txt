` it really work ' this is what i can hear every commercial . every product are not best in the world , and sometimes it doe not work . however in the commercial every good are fabulous . in my opinion , i agree that most advertisement make product seem much better than their real . advertisements exist for advertise the product . even though , the product is really good . there is a limit of until everybody know about this product . because of this reason , people want to make commercial . for instance , near my school , there is a really delicious restaurant . almost every my school student know about that restaturant . we get imformation from our school friend . however , my friend whose are not attend my school , never know about that restaurant . the other day , the restaurant itroduced in famous tv show . after that the restaurant is all the time crowd . even my another school friend know about that restaurant . the restaurant ha a purpose when they are on the show . it need to provocate customer . many people buy product that they do not need after watching commercial . the advertisement need to stimulate to customer . owner of product want to sell product a many a possible . getting to result , they need more strong tihings than their real product . therefore , they make their product more fancy and looking good . if it work product can earn lot of money . when i wa young the castle for doll wa so wonderful in tv commercial . i keep asked to my parent to buy that castle . finally i got that , however it wa so different from the commercial product . colore wa different and there wa no bell and it wa not automatic . even though commercial disappointed me , it wa enough to make me buy doll castle . in conclusion , most advertisments make ptroducts look good better than real , i think that advertisment ha a purpose . because commercial 's initial work is advertise to people and via stimulate customer make them buy to product .
