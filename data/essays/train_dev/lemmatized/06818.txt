in my opinion an individual should posse sufficient knowledge about his key academic subejcts along with possesing excellent skill in his choice of specific subject . in this competitive world , one is supposed to have an all rounder personality with a specialization or in other word mastery over that specific subject . from my experience , an all rounder person will be able to achieve greater success socially and professionally a he 's sound in all of the related area of his study but at the same time ha sufficient knowledge so a not to fall back on any discussion other than his specialization . to start discussing about my opinion , let take the situation when one choses to study all of his key subject without mastering anyone of those . this practice will result him being vulnerable to loose to each opponent who ha at least one of these subject a his specialization , not ignoring the increased possibility that the individual will be able to participate in any event or conversation pertaining to any of his subject area . another situation to consider will be , when one master only specific subject without giving considerate attention to his other subject , will lead him to a situation where he 'll excel in his subject area conversation but at the same time , he 'll not be in a situation to participate in a conversation about any other topic which is not his subject . in this situation the individual ha greater chance of successding in his area of specialization . we can clearly see that the number of benefit an individual can gain by following either of the two statement will lead to number of disadvantage a well . as both of the statement ha it 's own set of pro and con , i would disagree with any of these two statement taken alone . however , combining both of the statement would lead to a much more sensible and pragmatic way of advancing in competitive world .
