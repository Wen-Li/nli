its more important for student to learn more about the fact . the fact are like thing that are already done , and the idea and the concept are in our mind , so if a student care more about a fact it because he is secure about what he already now . the fact of a thing it close to what it already exists . for example , the boy jump to the bed and hurt his head . thats a fact , and idea and concept it like , the boy could fracture a leg or arm , it like an idea it all it matter , but what ir really care it what it really happened . in school the teacher or professor thought more to u about imagination , it near to the concept of a thing . i never got the idea of what should be done , if i already knew what happen for real . the student need to now how to compare about the definition of fact and idea or concept , cause if it not he is not going to inferred what the people it talking about , he wouldnt now . i absolute disagree of what the statement say , cause it not really good not to now an important fact before to now the idea or the concept for use . but i can said that to now the idea before the fact it is such a good thing too , cause im not saying that it bad , it also important but not more than the fact . we have to now the importance of what it real and not of what are we imagine , talking about the concept and idea . we should care more about good thing , and pay attention to all kind of opinion of each person , cause not everyone , even the professor think like we think , so we have to defend our opinion and leave it clean till the end of the discussion .
