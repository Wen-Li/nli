many people really do n't know if it better to know a little about everything , or to know everything about an specific thing . sometimes it could be better to know something about everything that you see . some other time you could wish to know more deeply about the subject yo are specifically interest in . to have a broad knowledge of many academic subject may be interesting at the beginning . you can be considered a very wise man among people , you can talk in a conversation about a lot of different issue , in other word , you could be seen a a super student o a super teacher that know it all . but when you get in a more deeper conversation or when your are trying to apply your knowledge in the real wold or in the real situation that work can give you , you can get confused or maybe you ca n't seem to find the answer to an specific question on a requested field . when you get specialized in one specific subject you may not know a lot of thing about everything , but when it come to your field of work you will be the only one who know everything about it , from a to z. for example , in a soccer team you can not be the goalie , a defense , or all the player at the same time . everyone ha it exact position on the field , and everyone ha their own chore during a game . each and everyone make a team , not just one player who know it all , but the fusion between all the playes into one team is the one who lead to win game and to have a great team . in conclusion , i think it is better to specialize in one specific subject than to know a little about every subject . speakin about our own field of study , everyone should know more about an specific thing and make a team , in everything we do at work , with the other player to make a winning and a strong team .
