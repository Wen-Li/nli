i do not agree with this statement , car have been the most effective tool of tranport for half a century . i do n't think tool , such a airplane , ship , or any other can easily replace car in twenty year . cars nowadays need petrol a feul , this ha become a great problem because the amount of petrol we can gain access to is limited on out planet . lots of scientist say that a long a we do n't find other effective fuel for car , we would n't be able to drive in a few decade . however , corporation such a toyota , ford , hyundai and many others have developed their technology to use hydrogen and electricity a the main power source of car . thease car do not require petrol , and therefore we will not need to find a substitute for car in twenty year . the world ha grown rapidly during the past century . city expanded it size and population saw growth in most city . this growth brought new need to people , a fast and cheap transport . cities have grown enormously , place that we can go in 30 minute by car would take u a few hour or more on foot . cars have become a necessary element in modern society . the world is keep growing , city are becoming even larger , and population is still growing , especially in india and china . the growth the world will see in twenty year will bring more and more need for car . also , car will become cheaper over time , a it did for the past decade , and it will allow people that could n't afford car to buy them , cars will become more necessary over time . during the growth in the past few decade , our city have developed in a way which it can allow car to transport most efficiently . cars were allways taken into consideration , we have road , underground passges , bridge , parking lot , and all kind of system for car . this system ha layed it root deeply into our city , and unless we change this whole system during the next twenty year in our city , car will still be the most efficient way of transporting , and people will not stop using them . cars have been by our side for half a century , it ha made transport much easier and faster , and it is also becoming cheaper , which allows more people to afford them . as long a there are n't huge change , or a long a we do n't creat a more effective tool than car , car will still be in use around the whole world twenty year later .
