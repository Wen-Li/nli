to answer this question it is important to figure out the reason why young people support their community . mostly the younger people join group to have people around to enjoy the time with friend . this can happen in the church community , sport club or just for hanging loose . especially activity in church try to teach the younger one how important it is to e.g. help people with disabillities . but because of the increase of the medium consumption , especially tv , community activity are being told to be `` uncool '' . it is more important to be individual and gain your own popularity . another reason can be that people loose trust in their government . they feel the pressure which last on them if they want to have success in their life . so they try to get the best for their own advance . as well when the people recognise that government member who should serve the public think it is more important to fill their own pocket . this can have the effect that people turn to be more egoistic . especially because of the new information era the people are aware of the selfishness of some government member . as well they are told about the risk in life every day in the news . i think this constant pressure and the lack of honesty ha lead to the point that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their community . but with the society being aware of that matter , chance ar not bad that a new way of thinking and acting can be taught . so you can see a lot of effort being taken from medium and government to emphasize this problem and to point out how important it is to serve the community . hopefullly this will lead modern society to a turning point where serving is something good an ha not to be `` uncool '' .
