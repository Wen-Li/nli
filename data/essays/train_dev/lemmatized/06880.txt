i personally agree that having broad knowledge of many academic subject would be a good idea . students will be familiarized about broad knowledge of many academic subject to increase his chance of getting a job after graduation or maybe during his study . also , it might enable him after graduation to handle different task , which will eventually help him to be promoted faster and get higher performance evaluation . moreover , knowing many academic subject will help all of u to create our own business upon graduation . i graduated from the king fahd university in saudi arabia back in year 2000 with a bs degree in the electrical field . i took a broad knowledge of many academic subject including power , control , communication , and from other field . it took me only one week to join saudi aramco company , which is considered one of the largest oil producer in the world . when i joined the comany , my management evaluated my qualification . they discovered that i have braod knowledge of many technical subject . my management nominated me to work in several investigation committess since i knew many technical subject . also , i have been assigned to perform my technical study in the power , control and communciations field . recenly , i have been nominated to work in one of the largest project that saudi aramco will construct , which is manafia project . this project is considerd a mega-project and it will start in year 2007 . this assignment is one of the challenge assessment that i might face . however , it is considered a golden chance . i presenting my story to demonstarate how broad knowledge of technical subject might create golden chance for u . therefore , it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subject than to be specalized in one specific field .
