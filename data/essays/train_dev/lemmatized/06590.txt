`` successful '' , how doe one relate to this word . it basically mean someone who ha attained adulation and appreciation for a certain something that he or she ha done . it can also be described a a way of getting acceptance from the society for an idea that you believe in or u have faith in . thus a successful person would obviuosly be someone who belives in and is not scared of exploring his idea and trying to attract acceptance for the same . inorder for a person to gain success a percievierence , determination and hard work play key role in a person 's life . a sucessful person thus take risk and try new idea and differnt way of doing thing . therefore success only knock on those people door 's who beieve in themselves and dare to walk into unfamiliar territory . take for example mr.dhirubhai ambani who started off with a not very well off chidhood but with his grit and hardwok turned his dream into reality . from a small scale industry his company today is one of the biggest and most important company 's in india , its play 's a very important part in the commerce of our country along with helping in buliding some highly complex and neccessary equipment . his initial success gave him the confidence to go ahead and bring about new innovative plan and his hardwork and vision changed them into a successful venture , thus successful people do try new thing and take risk rather than only doing what they already know how to do well . therefore sucess is not only related to doing the same thing over and over again but also in trying newer and better idea to make a large enough impact in society inorder to carve a niche for yourselves and then work upwards from there ,
