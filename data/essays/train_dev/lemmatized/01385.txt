in my opinion , there is no general answer to the question whether or not new thing and risk will lead to more success than sticking to old shoe . i think it highly depends on the character of a person . people might be very successful in doing what they have done all their life . usually , they are very experienced in what they do and with their knowledge and their background they are able to make the right decision which eventually might lead to a great success . on the other hand , people who take risk and who are willing to learn new thing , new theory and new perspective , can generally be characterized a more open-minded . they have to arrange with new situation and be more flexible . they have to pay attention to the change of market and change with their environment . it can also be assumed that people who seek new challenge are more motivated than people who do the same thing every day , because they will not get bored by a daily stupidity . not only that new challenge lead to new opportunity for success , i also think that having and gaining knowledge in more than one field rather than being a specialist on one certain topic provides a lot more option for success . being able to follow and take part in discussion on a variety of field might earn the respect of other people . it is a lot easier to give an objective opinion , if one can verify this opinion through solid experience in a variety of field . i think having a wide range of basic knowledge is a lot more impressive than just being able to lecture on one specific topic . people with common sense and a variety of interest might more likely be employed by an employer than probably would be a specialist who ha not ever looked beyond his narrow borderline . although i can see situation , where experience in doing familiar thing can lead to success , i , a to speak for myself , would prefer learning new thing and according to that i would also be willing to take some risk . despite all these argument on success , i also think that life is a lot more worth living with the opportunity to face new challenge and learn new thing .
