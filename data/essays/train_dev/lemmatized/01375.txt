in my opinion , i think that a person ha to take some risk to reach a new position : doing this , it ha the possibility to reach a new level of wellness , that could be reached only by courageous people . on the other hand , when a person try new thing , is not shure that what is doing is going to be the right choice , and in many case he fails and , sometime , he lost everything he have already reached with fatigue . i think that a person have to go on and , maybe , could became important , famous or rich , only taking risk : if someone choose to continue doing what he already know how to do well , certainly will not make mistake or big error , but it will rest a common person for all the life , asking himself what could happened him if he had choice the more difficult way . a latin poet of the third century b.c. said that everyone ha to pas several problem and difficulty that we find in our ( short ) life to have the possibility ( not the shureness ) to reach our right way and our happyness . if we do not this we 'll be forever a common person . in my opinion , we have to try new thing and to take risk , because our life is really short , and if we do not try this we 'll live forever with the doubt that maybe we had the possibility to become someone important . doing this , even if we become not an important person , we 'll be in peace with our ownself , and we 'll not have the doubt that maybe we had the opportunity to change our position and also our life . so , concluding , i think is better make mistake and lose everything we have , but , in every case , try to reach what we dream .
