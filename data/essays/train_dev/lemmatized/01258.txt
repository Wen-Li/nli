i do not agree that a group tour with a guide can provide u with the best trip for several reason . first , if we hire a tour guide , we can not travel by our desicion , which may limit our intersting of the trip . second , concering cost effectiveness , we should spend much more money on the tour which is followed by a tour guide . third , i would like to travel with my family and my best friend . in group tour , we should spend a lot of time with strange people . when i travel , i ususally plan my schedule and destination of trip by myself . i would like to travel freely and comfortably . i think that a tour guide tends to earn money from their tourist . for example , a tour guide may take tourist to a expensive souvenior shop which pay money to the tourguide for their contract . in a economical point of view , tour trip with guide shoud be more expensive than self arrange trip becuse tour fee includes their salary . if we plan our trip by ourself , we can choice a hotel and restaurant . however , we take part in a group tour , our trip would be fixed in the selection of accomodation and restaurant . i think that a gouop tour led by a tour gide should be boring . i have never used a package tour like group tour because i like to plan a trip . reserching about travel by using the internet and some timetable allow me to be fun . i would like to give a best trip to my family and my friend . in conclusion , i prefer a self-organized tour rather than a group tour with a guide .
