i agree the statement that young people enjoy life more than older people do . as much a time go by , older people got more experience from the life and they already have some fierce . so many older people do n't want to try new thing such a education , travelling , and culture , etc . but the young people are different . they are ambitious and they are always willing to learn new thing . i usually get happiness from learning . as my opinion , i think young people enjoy life more than older people do because older people have le chance to learn rather than young people . as time go by , the number of entertainment increase . in the past , people should work for living but now people make money for the entertainment and quality of thier life . young people have more opportunity to enjoy their life than older people do . for example , my father is very hard-worker and he doe n't have free time for himself . sometimes , he look like working robot . i want him not to work too hard and do whatever he like but working becomes his routine life . my father ha worked hard for the living and he ca n't stop working even though he is enough rich . i think my father is similar with any older people . goal of the life is different between young people and older people . so i think young people enjoy life more than older people do . i ca n't say which generation is happier than other generation because everyone ha different conception of happiness . it doe n't matter how people live but it is important to enjoy their own life . people should have their own happiness and do their best to achieve the happiness .
