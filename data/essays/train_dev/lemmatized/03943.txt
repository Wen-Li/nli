i disagree that traveling in a group led by a tour guide is better than traveling on our own . from personal experieces , i 've learned that touring on our own give more oppurtunity to be more knowlegable about the place we 're traveling , more time to travel unknown place , and more chance to communicate with local . as a personal example when i went to cambodia last winter , i went with a tour group led by a guide . before i went i knew i had to study about the place i would go , but i postponed such duty because i wa expecting the guide to explain everything . just a i expected , when i went to ancient site in cambodia the tour guide explained every little detail , leaving no space for me to further find out . however , when i went to europe by myself this winter , i felt obliged to study about the background information or about the european history because there wa no guide to answer my question . the fact that i wa planning all the journey on my own gave me more resposibility to study about the place i would go to . such case are not merely limited to my personal example . also when we travel with a group led by a guide , we have to follow with the tuor company 's tight schedule . out itinery is often scheduled and we merely follow where the guide take u . we do n't have much free time to ramble around new place other than the famous tour cite . however , when we 're on ourselves we do n't have to move accordingly to a fit schedule . we are free to go anywhere we 'd like . other than famous tour cite , we could simply go to local market or take a walk down the street -- place that are ordinary but also place where we can smell the local 's custom and culture . furthermore , when we 're traveling with a guide we 're too busy following the tight schedule to acutally communicate with the local . touring with a guide often end with visiting famous cite and taking picture . but when traveling on your own , we have more chance to actually be friend with the local . although there might be some language barrier , we can use body language and talk with local about their life-style , custom , and culture . traveling on a group led by a guide lack the precious moment to learn about a country in a first-hand experience . traveling in a group led by a tour guide surely doe have some benefit . we do n't have to plan all our schedule , and we do n't need to worry about not knowing something because the guide is there for you to explain everything . however , so far from all my journey , the most memorable and long lasting experience were those that i traveled by myself . starting from scheduling my itinerary , studying about the country , exploring new place , and meeting people from walk of street is truly the valuable and the real journey i never forget .
