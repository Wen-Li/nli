some people say that young people enjoy life more than older people do . however i do not agree with this idea . this is because there is many people who is in different situatuion in this universe . which are the nationality , gender , and wheher they are rich or poor . so i think how people enjoy their life is depend on their situation . in japan , most of the people who are teanager oes to school . they enjoy their school life and have fun with their friend . by looking at this stuation , it seems to be that young people enjoy life more than older people do . the young people have more enegy than the old people . however in some country , there are people who fight in the war even though they are still teenager . they have to fight even though they do not want to . they have to fight to survive . in africa , there are many people who dy of hunger , which include the teanager . even in japan , there is lot of teenager who can not go to school because of the sickness or their parent do not have enough money to send their childrens to shcool . so how people enjoy life is really depends on their situation . for old people , they do not have much energy than the young people . however they can enjoy their life by finding fun thing . my grandmother and grandfather really like to go traveling . they go to lot of place in japan , kyoto , kobe , hokkaido and so on . they do not have much energy so they always go traveling by tour by bus . so they do not have to walk a much a they go by train or airplain . they said that they enjoy life , even though they got old . so enjoying life is depends on the situation and who they are . the characteristic of people also affect how they enjoy their life . if a person is having a problem , however if that person think positively , then they would not think that they are unhappy that much . i do not agree with the idea that young people enjoy life more than older people do , because i think how they enjoy life is depend on them , so the age doe not matter .
