it is important that everybody enjoys their life . but who enjoys more , young people or older people ? in my opinion , older people enjoys their life more because they know what the true enjoyment and freedom to do anything . firstly , adult enjoy their life more because they are more experienced and know what the true enjoyment is . youngsters call playing computer game , going to the movie and partying with friend enjoying life . however it is too small to be an enjoyment of one 's life . older people enjoys their life in a greater range . for example , a head of a certain factory would enjoy his life by making profit , directing people and going to dinner with his family , which are far more enjoyable that playing computer game . secondly , adults have a freedom to do whatever they want to enjoy . for youngster to enjoy their life , there are numerous thing that are not permitted to do , such a drinking , traveling without parent . however , there is no such barrier for adult . for example , my uncle is now 38 year old and one day he told me that he is going on a trip worldwide for a month to get rid of stress he got from his business . then he told me that he would go to these beutiful place and would come back with better future . i , after listening to him , immediately thought of all the stress that i am getting from school and planned a travel alone . however , i could not make the trip because of my parent 's disagreement . from that moment i deeply realized that i can enjoy my life when i grow up . people say that enjoyment equal happiness . however , it is not always true . people can get fall into a trouble if they only seek for pleasure . this happens to young people a lot . however , older people are able to differentiate between enjoyment and temporary pleasure because they know more and experienced more , which is why they allowed more freedom . therefore , older people enjoy there life more .
