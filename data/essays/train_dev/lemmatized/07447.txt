nowadays , one of the most intriguing issue is that whether the majority of the advertisement make their merchandise look much better than they really are . as far a i am concered , i agree with this opinion , with three follwing reason . firstly , the advertiser attracts the public attention by making full use use of the `` clarity effect '' . although the cost on the super star is always unbelievably high , the producer can also gain profit by the advertisement acted by the clarity . it is true that since the super movie star or singer appeared in the advertisement on the screen , people have memorized the product because of their favorable clarity and are probably buy the product . but unfortunately , the public know little about what they have bought . secondly , the advertiser aggrandizes the function of the product sometimes . for example , an advertisement mention that you can keep all day long energitic by drinking an energy drink . in other word , you are still active even after you stay up for 24 hour . if so , why doe the scientist always mention the importance of the 8 hour sleeping time ? lastly , the advertiser sometimes emphasize one it benefit of the product but deliberately ignore the negative effect . a brand of medicine to keep fit point out in it advertisement how much weight you can lose after a couple of weks . however , the medicine ha a bad effect on the nerve of the taker to prohibit their desire to take food . all in all , most advertisement make their product seem much better than the original . although it will add the profit for the producer , in the moral light , it is a deceving behavior for the public .
