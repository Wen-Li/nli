it ha been said that , ` in twenty year there will be fewer car in use than there are today ' . it could be true since the fuel that we use now to run car are running out , but however i disagree with the statement and i will present briefly why i disagree that in twenty year there will be fewer car in use than there are today . first reason is that population is growing rapidly , and people are live longer nowadays . more people mean more car , people want convinience in their life more than anything else , people growth are growing since we have revolutionized industrial and medical care , medical care we have increased our estimate life . as i mentioned more people are being born and live longer they 're going to be willing to use more car . second reason , and the problem i 've mentioned about fuel , the fuel we now use is ` gasoline ' and i know that it 's limited and some scientist said that it 'll run out quicker than we think , but that is just like saying that we wo n't be finding the replacement , we 've revolutionalize in many way and we 've been making new technology to make our life better , just couple hundred year ago gasoline wa a junk but now it 's a most important thing in our life , just like we 've found gasoline we 're going to find something else just a important and capable a gasoline did . in twenty year there will be fewer car in use than there are today and it could be true since the fuel that we use now to run car are running out , but i totally disagree with this statement because our human being have developted more and more and we 're going to develop our life even faster since popluation is growing , and soon we 'll find a perfect replacement for the fuel we use to run car .
