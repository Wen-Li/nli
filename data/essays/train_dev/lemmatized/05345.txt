it is hard to predict the number of car after twenty year . as we can see that the technology is emerging greatly . we can assure this much that the public transport will be improved in coming year . but also considering the fact that most of the people are working and earning good , they prefer to keep their own transport vehicle . technology improvement confirm that public transport like metro train , delux bus provide convinent transport to many people . most of the people from middle class or lower class prefer to travel by mean of this transport and save their money over the high rate petrol or desiel . if government keep on providing this high technology transport or some better transport than we can hope some decline in the number of car present . now a day many of the people are having satisfying job . this increase in employment give a hint that most of the people will going to have a good salary in future . this kind of people will not worry about spending money on petrol or buying a car . cars have become a status symbol for many high class people . also the low rate of car are also attracting the public of middle class . if the rate of car keep on decreasing than there will be a chance that in coming future there will be nothing but the car on the road . it depend on the government to increase or decrease the number of car . if government will provide the low rate and more convenient public transport than the normal human being will prefer to take the advantage of high quality transportation syatem . but government need to keep a check on the rate and stock of car which come in the market . also an individual need to understand that whether the car is his real requirement or just a piece to show in public . keeping an account on this point we can hope for a better futur with le number of car .
