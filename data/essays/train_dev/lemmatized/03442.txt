i agree with the idea that success is mostly acheived when people venture into new terrotories and explore thing that they may not know so well . usually trying new thing or venturing into uncharted territory result in outcome that can be extremely good or bad for an indiviudual . when pharmaceutical company invest in new drug , or invention they are well aware that they might lose the money that they have invested . however , they are also aware of the fact that the risk have to be taken by someone in order for success to happen . people who take risk often try new thing whilst being aware of and for the most part having experienced great loss . however , what make a person succeed is the ability of this person to handle the new and risky . without the risk that many took in science and in experimentation , many of the simple disease known to u now would be fatal . if people stuck to what they knew and everyone contiued doing the same thing . then the world would be a stagnant place where not much will change . people who take risk and change what it is that is known to them allow new area to be explored , therefore , becoming expert in thing that were previously new . we currently live an evolving world , where new discovery and invention are made on a daily basis . in order for a person to live in this world they have to prove their ability to contribute to it . in many ecomonies job are scarce and people struggle to feed themselves and their family . people who want to be outstanding or who want to deliver more to this world find themselves having to think outside of the box , and assume more personal risk . success may vary for each individual . what remains the same is the fact that in order to excel in something a person ha to expand of that which is known to him or her . expansion can not be achieved if people limited themselves to what they felt they new . it is when one try something new that they might realize new ability and strength within themselves .
