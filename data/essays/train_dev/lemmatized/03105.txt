in twenty year from now there will indeed be fewer car in use than what are today . no wonder that the purchasing power of people will increase because of the betterment of the economy of the country through agricultural , technical and various other advancement , this will act a a catalyst in the purchase of more car . the development of technology will help to introduce new feature in the field of transport . the electrical train , which have already become a popular mean of commutation , will get replaced be even more efficient one . airborne communication can be subsidised for common usage . advances in nanotechnology can guide some new method of tranport at the macro level . another factor that may reduce the car usage is the prize of petroleum . the incessant increase in the fuel cost indicates towards their mammoth value after twenty year . hence vehicle driven by other power source such a electricity , thermal power , nuclear power etc. would be preferred . moreover , the way in which the population is enhancing would result into a tremendous increase in the number of conveyance . this would lead to crowding in the road and parking place . the introduction of publis mean of tranport will enable more people to travel in a single vehicle and hence would help reduce the pollution to a great extent . this would also involve le consumption of the fuel and also provide employment to more number of people . greater traffic would lead to greater pollution , greater enragement amongst the people and hence greater mental illness . the hamful effect on the public health is more detrimental than the organic cause of disease . this increase in insanity would cause more crime to occur , including suicide of course . pollution may injure the health of not only the human being but also of the plant , tree and animal that dwell around . hence regarding the benefit of the publis mean of communication the people after twenty year would certainly not prefer travelling in their own car and hence there will be fewer car in use .
