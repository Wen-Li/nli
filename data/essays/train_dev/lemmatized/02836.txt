i think that theoretical concept and idea are very important to prepare a student and to help him to built his own method of study . for example studying latin , with all those coniugations or math give you a tool to develop your mind schematically . in my opinion this is a good training , but it doe n't make a professionist . i believe that when a student reach a certain level of theoretical preparation he need fact : he need to experience in first person what the issue he ha studied is all about . learning from practical experience is much easier and involving than studying a subject on a book . for example ; if i had the opportunity to go to united states and study english , i would improve my language skill much better than i could do staying at home and reading an english edition of oscar wilde ! moreover is very important to consider the kind of subject the student is learning : many subject need more practical training ( for example biology ) and so other ( a philosophy ) are better understood with concept . think about those people who did n't have the opportunity to get an education ; all they learnt wa basically taken from real fact : i can say that the skill they have , for example in formulating a conversation , pheraps doe n't follow a logical pattern but if they can apport fact to substain such conversation it is not hard to understand what they are talking about . so i just partially agree with the statement and i think that the best choice would be to give to the student both the practical and theoretical training to ensure him a complete education .
