i agree that successful people try new thing and take risk rather than only doing what they already know how to do well because when people just focus on what they have learned from school , and think it is right , they do not open their mind to new experience wich can not be good for the thing they are working on . for example , when it come to technology , people must change or improve the way of doing thing really fast , so there can be better development ; without trying new stuff there would not be advance . trying new thing is important for success because it improves the experience of the person in some fact . taking risk is also important for success . for some people , taking risk might be bad due to the possible negative outcome their work can get , but taking risk is the only way people can livet new experience and improve in both working and personal life . taking risk is the only way people can prove if what they are doing is right or wrong , if it is right they can keep it , if it is wrong they learned from it and can improve it . when combining trying with risk , success is more likely to happen , but before really doing something with this two factor people should learn a bit a bout the situation they will work on , this way they can plan better what they will do . a good example of successful people are leader , they must always hear and analize the idea of the people surrounding them . all those new idea become thing to try that might be positive and improve the work they are doing . leaders review the idea , pick one or combine them , and then try it . also , when deciding what to do , they must take risk so the they can really achieve their goal . without risking they would not know what to do and just stick to the normal parameter that might not be good for their work . all the people should open their mind to the new stuff , try different idea and risk a lot to achieve their goal . sticking to just one learned thing is not always positive because not everything work the same .
