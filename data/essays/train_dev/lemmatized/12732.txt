for me in twenty year there will be fewer car in use than there are today , i agree . first of all the car is very important for a lot of people because the men need go to the work or at home or in generally we mast go for the city bat also out city whit freedom . i think that today also if we can choose what use for tryp , the car is the first time that make , because is the free and we can go whwre want . secondly i hope that the situation will be beter because the our city are very inquineted and we ca n't go free for the city street because there are a lot of car , for me the city mast have steet true for to drive and we learn to drinve whit sureship and whit respect for ader car without to go fast . in conclusion we mast use the car only when is necessary e when we ca n't use ather solution , becose sometime we forget when is all easy , but in the future we ca n't return in the pas , therfore now we mast look for the better world where to live . the tecnology mast only help to live well , i hope that is very difficoult .
