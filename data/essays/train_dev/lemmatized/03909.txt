i agrre it . i think successful pelple tried new thing and taked risk . try is make a light of future . but some people get damage after tried , but i think all success pople got damage before success . they tried again and again and get success . first of all , if you try to something and try to accomplish , you should get a lot of problem at the middle , but do not quit when you tired . because you have a lot of chance yet . new thing did not try to everybody , so if you accomplish it , you could make a big future . second , look at the around who success people . they do not say get easy about success . they got a lot of wall and became a miserable then they became a rich or famous . third , new thing could make u huppy . now , we have a lot of technology . for example , television , call phone , car , and micro chip that make u better than long year ago . if we do not have them right now , we can not live in this world . in addition , thechnology is developing now too . im deed , i think we have to agree it , because you living and using in the new technology world , so it mean that meny people tried and accomplish something . why do not dissagree it ? if you try to something , we could get a lot of new thing than now .
