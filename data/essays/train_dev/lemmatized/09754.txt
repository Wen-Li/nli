the best and most popular mode of trivelling today is a car . you can reach any where at your own time schedule with the help of a car . it doe overcome some of the disadvantage of other system such a bus , train etc . to trivel by train or bus we have to go by their schedule , and they can be used to reach only specific location . but the future is not so good for the car . i agree with the statement that twenty year from now thier will be ferwer car than today . cars require fuel to run . today the fuel used is mainly petroleium or natural gas in the form of lpg or cng . these are fossile fuel and they are non renewable , so they will tend to decrease over the time . the supply of these fuel will decrease over the time . so they will become more expensive to afford by normal people . as a result number of car owner will decrease . cars make lot of polution which is responsible for various health and environment related problem such a global worming or lung cancer . the problem related to the car are all related to the fuel they are using . so if we can get the alternate energy souce to run a car then it may have the bright future and we can see more car than ever in next 20 year . the alternative energy souce for this fossile fuel is solar energy , or fuel cell , which use hydrogen a their fuel . the problem with use of fuel cell is that it requires carring hidrogen along with the car . hidrogen is very explosive if it is exposed to atmosphere , so carring hidrogen along with the car is like sitting on a bomb . as far a other option go , there are very few car which run on solar energy today , this is mainly because these car are expensive . but a the technology grows these car may be affordable and can be available for use for resonable price . the other point that we should note that world is going towards globalization . it mean increase in the competition . so people will require faster route to trivel . todays car are limited in speed not only due to the car itself but due to over crowding of car , remember the time we spent in trafic . so in order to promote the car in future one need to see to these issue a well . answering all these question will shape the future of car . so twenty year from now , if we see car in musiums or on road in day today life will depend on all these issue .
