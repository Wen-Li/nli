in my opinion , it would be better to have broad knowledge of many academic subject than to specialize in a particular subject . two main reason can be given to support my opinion . firstly , having knowledge about a broad range of subject widens a person 's perspective . in today 's world , we are confronted with many different situation each of which requires a unique way of handling . a project about the construction of a bridge can be given a an example to this situation . a construction engineer deal with just the calculation required to make the bridge resistant to the pressure of car and truck that will pas on it . however , there are many complementary aspect of this issue that should be taken into account . the financial availability of the project , the environmental consequence of building the bridge there , the possible resistance of people living at that neighbourhood should all be considered . if that engineer took course regarding those issue , he would surely approach the issue in a more comprehensive way which is necessary . second , having broad knowledge of many subject give a person the flexibility to specialize in whatever field he wish to . unfortunately , the best example showing the importance of this includes me . i wa entitled to register to the computer engineering department a a result of the university entrance exam . in the beginning , thing went well but soon afterwards the nightmare began . i understood that i would not want to be a computer engineer and i had to reenter the exam in order to change my department . i had no other choice . i wa lucky to be able to change my department afterwards but many people in my country can not find this opportunity and this force them to have a job they do n't like for all their life . obviously , if student were given the opportunity to gain knowledge about a variety of subject in their first year in the university and then choose what they want , the problem would be eliminated . as a result , acquiring knowledge about various subject seems better because of providing people with a deeper outlook on event and giving them the opportunity to choose the career that is best suited to them .
