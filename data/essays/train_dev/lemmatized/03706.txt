basically , i agree to this statement . to understand idea and concept is more complicated than just learning thing by heart , and this is also what academic course try to teach their student . being able to present own idea is more worth than just re-producing thing , like you do if you learn hard fact . that 's why i think that doing research or developing or understanding idea and concept should rewarded higher than simply reproducing thing . science could not work without any ` thinking ' , and that is what student at a school or especially at an university are supposed to learn : to get behind the thing . furthermore , most fact are based upon a concept . that is an additional reason why understanding or doing science is more worth than just learning something by heart . on the other hand , it is mandatory to have a huge knowledge about simple fact in certain area . you are not a good scientist if you do not have a huge knowledge of fact , and if you think about a lawyer , it is necessary to have both , the important , and seldom used bill in mind ( and these are a lot if you count them ) . but that doe not make you a good lawyer . you have to combine this knowledge of simple fact with concept and idea , and these two thing make you a really good lawyer . in certain area , it might be enough to have a huge knowledge , and you do n't have to be that great thinking person . if you think about working in a library , it seems to be more important to have huge knowledge about the book which are in the archive instead of being able to understand complicated concept or idea . if your skill have a focus on just one thing , this will not be a key to success . to combine these two skill , being able to understand concept and simply to learn thing by heart , is a good mixture and can guarantee for good result in the job , but also in life generally .
