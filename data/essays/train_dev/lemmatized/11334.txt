as far a i can see , this statement is absoluty correct . learning or even memorizing fact might be usefull and effective right in front of an examination if you just want to pas it . but if you want to obtain good result , memorizing will not help you win the day at all . let me clarify this . as soon a it come to similar topic which are only associated with the content that you are familiar with , the one who only learned fact will not be able to answer the question a appropriately a if he had learned the concept and idea behind the fact . but a far a you are familiar with the main idea , you will definetely be able to give brilliant answer a you only need to transfer them onto the new topic . let me point this out on an example . i work a an assistent at the faculty of law at my university . my job is to correct term paper on several subject associated with labour law . within these paper student have to proof that they on the one hand have understood what wa lectured during the semester and on the other hand that they are able to transport this knowledge onto new subject . in general , i call a student `` smart and clever '' when he is capable of transporting knowledge to different subject and develop his own position . unfortunately i came recently to know that obviously pile of student have not really understood what the professer tried to convey . reproduction of fact is quite boring to a teacher after having read them several time . but transportation of knowledge and using this knowledge to evaluate new problem is exciting . therefore i would say , that memorizing fact is definetely le important than understanding the main concept and idea of the subject .
