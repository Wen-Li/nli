yes i do agree with the statment `` it is more important for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact '' . because just learning the fact doesnt give a student good knowledge , and i think it is not a proper way to shine his knowledge . first the student should exposed to the idea and related concept before learning it practically . for epitome if an engineer without learning the concept and idea if he started started learning the maintenance of a car and it part , he might not be sucessful all the time because he should know the concept and the theory of the part before learning practically . as in this case both the theory and practical concept and idea are necessary . suppose if a man ha some problem with his car , if he go to a local worker to get it repaired , the worker can not find a definite solution instead he repair it temporarily and satisfies his customer and gain money from him , here the looser is the customer . so intead of going to a local worker he could go to a company service center where the technical person are available all the time who are skilled enough and rather they would find the actual problem and give a permanent solution to get it repaired and give the necessary precaution to take maintain the car . so here both the theory part and the practical part play a vital role . same with the case of other electronic good like desktop pcs , laptops , televisions etc . .. most of the interview conducted by top mncs would conduct the round which would test both the theoretical part and practical part so it is important for every one to understand the idea and concept before they learn them . hence from the above mentioned epitome , it is not fallacious to say that it is important for everyone to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact .
