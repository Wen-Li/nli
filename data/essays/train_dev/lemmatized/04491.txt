nowadays , we sometimes go on a trip . there are two method to travel such a travelling by alone or group . some people assert that travelling in a group is not a perfect idea . however i maintain that i can get various benefit to travel in a group : not expensive cost to travel and apportunity to share information . first , i can enjoy traveling by cheap price . traveling cost is very high nowadays . because , if we go abroad , we could take an airplain . however if i can go the travel in a group , we can save some money . there are some rule that if taking it more than 10 people , airplain company would cut price . this situation is same a hotel and entrance fee . for example , i went to europe last summer in a group . i went there during 15days and it wa good aportunity for me . on the other hand , one of my friend also went to eurpople in same period . eventohght we visited there same peiods and same date , we had a lot of difference in cost . i only costed about 300 $ , but my friens costed 500 $ . second , i can get various information in travelling group . visiting other country are advantures . if you could have not visited at once , you would felt embarrased . however you can enjoy clean , safe and informative travel in group . for me , it wa first time to go abroad . so i felt scared sometimes . also i did not know what i wa going to do . at that time , i did not have enough information to enjou it . by using travel agency , i could book airplains and hotel . also i could have a lot of information about europe . there were many people in that group , so it wa available to contact them and share information and know-how which they recognized from travelling . eventhoug we should follow travel agency 's rule , i think it would be a good idea following in a group . it would be a good apportunity to using small amout of money , to expand your experience a well a to get much information .
