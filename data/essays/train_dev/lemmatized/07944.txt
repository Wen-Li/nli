if one had to ask me , i personally agree to the following statement . in today new world where student are competing with each other , where education ha become a prime necessity and not just a mere hobby we often hear student having endless conversation about the assigments they need to submit or the test that are coming up . each one having a goal to strive towards . with more time for work and le for play we hardly find young people sacrificing some of their time to their community . community service hold little value to many youngster in today world of technology , the modesty that we would find in youngster of the previous decade is absent . on the other hand we still find youngster making an attempt to find time for their community , to selflessly devote some of their valuable time to the helpless people of their community and to help interact with them , to help bring a smile to their face . when compared to the number of student that help their community , the number of student that dont outcast them however , there is still room for improvement , every cloud ha a silver lining and therefore i can say that maybe in the near future some improvement might be made , however we notice that a the year are passing we tend to see more people involved with their materialistic world leaving no or le time for the helpless . a good example would be myself , i start every month with an intention to help atleast one person i know in my community , to help bring a smile to atleast one person face but the month fly by and before i know it the next month ha started with exactly the same intention but no progress . the drive that we student have towards our education result in a fall back when it come to serving our community . our weekend are used up in completing unfinished assignment and relaxing ourself from the tired week that just went by and therefore i personally feel that in today world very few young people devote a good amount of time helping their community .
