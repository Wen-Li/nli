the issue argues that it is better to have broad knowledge of many subject than to specialize in one specific subject . in my opinion , i believe that it is better for student to know broad knowledge . there are three reason why i think that . first of all , it will be very boring to study one subject for a long time . in fact , you might get totally exausted and you might even lose the interest in that subject . for example , student who are good at calcualtion study math for a long time would also want to change the studying subject to a subject that can read without using your hand or brain . secondly , you can know what you are really interest in when you study a bit of various subject . this is the reason why education do n't focus on a specific subject and it also can make up the choice which what we really like of a student after a long time basic education till high school . for example , we decide what major we want to study after entering university . we can decide by the interest we developed since we started elementary school . futhermore , i believe with the advantage of learning everying a bit give more opportunity of choosing various job . we can use our broad knowledge instead of one specific idea to apply job we want in the future . for example , people who want to study hotel management when they apply to thier university . people who put hotel management a their major need to lean a lot of thing than just management . as far a i know , they need to know about different kind of wine , business , economy and communication among people . in conclusion , i prefer that people should learn more than just a subject .
