when we know a specific topic or we discus an argument , and we are well aware of what we write or speak about , most of the time we bring idea , concept and fact . the idea and concept are necessary to be able to define and describe a general concept . if we start any description , it is necessary that first we have a clear and defined general information about it and that we can put it above all the necessary explanation we have to give in support of it . many time we have to use many idea or concept to describe a specific argument , but it would never be clear to describe any topic , without the use of more detailed and clear explanation of the element , that can only be brought with fact . let 's think about history and let 's try to rely only on general concept about the history of romans : it is certainly very important to know that the romans have been conqueror , but it would n't be useful if we do n't support the information with more specific information , such a the time they pass teh alps or went to the sea and had the punic war . in order to be clear , it is necessary to have a wide and clear vision of the element of the discussion and that would be certainly represented by idea and concept , but in order to go deeper in the description , it is necessary to bring specific example of what we are speaking about . in a literature class , it is necessary to know the main element of the romanticism period in term of concept and idea , but it would be impossible to understand the meaning of the genre if we do n't bring specific fact to surround the idea , like who wa the main representative of the period or what wa written . students actually would use many of the fact to remember and support general idea and concept , that otherwise might be difficult to remember . i think that a stuudent should be able to understand fact and concept , but it is necessary that he support those general element with specific fact .
