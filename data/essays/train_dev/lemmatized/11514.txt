although a demographic explosion will occur particularly in china and in india , i am absolutely under the impression that in twenty year there will be fewer car in use than there are today . first of all , government are more and more concerned by the threat on the environment . although at the present time the lack of real global legislation is tangible , i am definitely convinced that in the future government will be able to enforce sanction against pollution . thus , sustainable development is more and more a part of political debate in the developed country . everybody know the danger of use of gas car on our earth . besides , government will implement more public transportation network particularly in some metropolis like los angeles where public transportation network is very bad . for example , a new tramway line wa enforced in paris . moreover , goverments will encourage the development of co carriage by granting . positive discrimination towards these collective user can be a solution . therefore , new technology will make gas car disappear . electronic or solar car will be on the market . these car will be competitive because of the oil price crisis . nevertheless , the biggest challenge will be to convince the developing country like china and india to fit to this new legislation . to conclude fundamental political , economical and environmental issue are at stake . this is a topical issue .
