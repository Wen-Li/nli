some people agree to the idea that understanding idea and concept is more important than learning concept . others think learning fact should come first . in term of critical thinking , i have to say understanding idea and concept is more helpful and worthy than learning fact . based on the field of study , fact are playing a important role . for instance , if you are a biology student you should know all the terminology related to the human body in order to explore further topic . in art , knowing the difference of realism and classicism is the foundation of your knowledge . then , you can classify genre and style of movie . however , student will not be able to develop critical thinking unless they understand idea and concept if they know about only fact . for example , with a scientific fact is presented in class and no discussion or analyzation is followed to help student understand the concept , once student understand the idea why a certain history event had happened in the past , it would be easy for them to understand the consequenses of that event . in conclusion , both understanding idea and concept ant learning fact are critical in learning .
