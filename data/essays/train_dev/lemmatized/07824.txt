`` human mind ha always had the unsatisfying hunger for knowledge '' . we always try to grasp the thing going around him u the nature . we tried to better understand our environment or surroundings by observing and learning from it . it is this compulsion to learn everything that lead u to the stage we are now . without the spirit of the man to study everything he see we would not have made the advancement in our social life . having the broader knowledge about many academic is better in some way because knowledge about one subject lead to the better understanding about other subject . as in the case of physic and math . the subject of physic would look like a japanese to an amatuer if he doe not have the background of math because every calculation done in physic involves math . as go for some other subject too . specialization in one subject involves intensive training in specific area of field . people taking up specialization only on a particular subject would have limited knowledge about other subject . the would be doing research only on the given field and there would be no scope to further increase his knowldge about other field . but having the knowledge about other subject would be quite useless too sometimes . such a in the case of student doing their college . if a history student is asked to gain his knowledge in physic it would be quite useless , because he would be confused about his future , whether he would end up working a a physicist or a historian . it would rather deviate the mind of the student from his main ambition . take for instance many great scientist and researcher who have contributed immensely in their respective field because of the liking they had for they subject . therefore it is better to have a specialization in only one academic subject because it help determining the future of the student taking it . as to what they would really become in the future . it also generates the interest in the student so a to expand his knowledge to the core of the subject .
