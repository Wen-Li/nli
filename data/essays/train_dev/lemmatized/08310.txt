it is more important for student to understand idea and concept that it is for them to learn fact . i agree with the statement for the following reason , the importance of the capability to think logically , solve problem and to create future vision . the stated reason are described in more detail in the following paragraph . first a student need to learn how to think logically in order to understand a problem that need to be solved . especially for study assignment a well a work assignment it is important to determine what is the unknown factor , that need to be found . if the student is not able to do that , the result might not be the factor that wa initially asked for . second , if a student just learns fact instead of strategy to solve a proble the student will not be able to apply the already learned knowledge to a similar problem . for instance the student know how to calculate the revenue based on price per product time unit sold but a soon a the unit sold is unknown and the given number are the price for each product and the total revenue , the student will not be able to solve for the unit sold . in order to solve the outlined problem it is important that the student learns the strategy to solve a equation for different unknown . third , only if a student understands the concept and idea of for instance a certain product like a car only then will the student be able to create further development of the already existing feature . if the student only focus on learning fact the student will always limit his knowledge and learing to already existing idea . thus , the student will not be able to come up with future vision which are vital in somone 's accademical and professional carreer . in conclusion , the ability of a student to think logically , solve problem and to create future vision or development of existing knowledge or fact is more important to me than learning the fact . it will enable the student to be sucessful in his or her study a well a professional career .
