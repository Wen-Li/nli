i think travel with friend and without tour guide is the best . true happiness and knowledge came from horrable experience . if tour guide are together with you , there are any ploblems . how and you get the worth of effort on that condition ? travel with friend mean it 's better than the alone . of course there are many benefit in travel alone , but the pleasure is le than the two . i think to have pleasure and happiness also important in traveling . 2 year ago , i went to philipines with only my best friend for almost one year . that give me strong self-confidence , relationship , and lot of experience . through the terrible mistake , i had many bad suffer . but that gaves me amazing social ability . of course , travel with tour guide can give u specific information . but it is le important than the lot of benfits which is get by oneself . and that is more useful to live in . in korea , many people travel alone or with friend before the graduate from university . so called bagpack-travel . in my opinion , the best way to travel is with your best friend .
