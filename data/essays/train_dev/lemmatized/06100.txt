some people think yonger people enjoy life more than older people do , because they are healthier than older people . i , however , think older people can enjoy life more than yonger people because of my personal experience . i , therefore , disagree with the statement which say yonger people enjoy life more than older people do . older people have more knowledge than yonger people . they have lived longer life than yonger people and they have had more knowledge than them . therefore , older people will try new thing that are good for them . for example , young people spend their time to play or play game with their friend on weekend , however , older people climb the mountain with their business member or travel somewhere to rest . this show that older people do better activity than yonger people , which what make them to be healthier . therefore , i belive that older people enjoy life more than yonger people . older people have more money than yonger people . this mean older people have more alternative to do . for example , one day my father told a story about ski-diving . at that time i did not know about ski-diving so my father brang me a place where is for ski-diving . many people were enjoying it and i really wanted to try . i , however , did not have money at that time , therefore , i could not do that and i thought older people are lucky because they have money to do ski-diving . older people can enjoy life more than yonger people because they have more knowledge about life and money , which mean they have more alternative . my personal experience taught me that older people can play more sport than yonger people and older people know more about what is good for them , i , therefore , disagree that yonger people enjoy life more than older people do .
