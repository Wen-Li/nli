majority of people are really effected from advertisement ; a a result of that company use this way to support the consumption of their product . i agree with the statement that product seem better in most advertisments . not tested product are selling on market / firstly ; the most important thing is to effect woman who spend most of their time by shopping . especially make up product are on market with just small change . by changing it cover or smell it sold like a new product . also hygenic product must be tested . sometimes in advertisement it say ; our new product is for sensitive and allergetic person nonethless when you use it you see that it is not real . secondly child want to buy whatever they see ; bright cover or little toy which are given with the product effect them . on the other hand with the improvement of technology new product are on market each day . for example last month i bought a new mobile phone which i saw an advertisement on tv . it is said hat it doe not effected from water and i dropped it in the rainy weather and a a result i can not use it anymore . after market service must be effected in conclusion ; i agree with the statement that sometimes advertisement are not showing the truth . they mostly the new producing way of a product with small change .
