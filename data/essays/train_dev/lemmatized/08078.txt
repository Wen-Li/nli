people go somewhere every day in life . and they use trasportation vehicle in order to go to the place that they want . i think the most comfortable one is the car . i do not agree with the statement that '' in twenty year thre will be fewer car in use than there are today '' because of the following reason . first reason is that travelling by car is the most comfortable way in short distance . in turkey most of the people prefer their car instead of puplic transpotation . we can understand this from the number of car in the traffic . especially the time that the people exit from their job , there is a traffic jam in everywhere and this indicates that people prefer travelling by car . so they can not give up travelling by car . secondly , there are fewer car in the past but this number is increased much more today . this show that in the future this number will continue to increase . maybe in the future the railway system will developed and be common but this will not prevent the use of car . third reason is that people 's buying power increased according to the past and everyone can easily buy a car in turkey . furthermore , there is more than one car belong to a family . since the railway system is not developed exactly and the fee of the ticket are not cheap to buy , it is cheaper to go to the short distance by car . thus people prefers their car . finally , in the future car will run with electricity or water or other cheap substance . then therefore travelling by car will be the most preferable way of going to place in the following twenty year . to sum up , there will be more car in use than there are in the future because of the reason that i have mentioned above .
