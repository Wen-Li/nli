it is generally believed that after twenty year , there will be fewer car than today . although many people think that car are getting more decreased , in my opinion , car will be much more increased in twenty year . above all , nowdays people want to live more convenient . people would like to save their time and money . so they may be want to their own car . for example , if they have their car , they will save their time and they can go everywhere they want . cars will become most important thing in people 's life . then the demand for buying the car will be increasing . for exampl , nowdays one house ha more than one car . because they want to move individually , so they just get one 's car . in this sense , people need car imperatively to do live more conveniently in individualize society . in addition , recently our technology have developed continuously . all over the world , they try to creat new and innovative thing . then we can not stop their need for making good and new thing such a robot , machine and car . some scientist try to spread out the car whcih make no pollution or use natural resource . if we have that car , we do not worry about the pollution which can be bad effect about car . people who do not want to pollute environment will be enjoy their life with their car which make no pollution . in this respect , if scientist study about the car which make no pollution and use natural resource and spread out all over the world , we will try to use the car much more than use the public transportation . in conlusion , i disagree that in twenty year there will be fewer car than today for the reason that i mentioned above . to live much more convenient life and the development of technology influence on the increasing the car after twenty year .
