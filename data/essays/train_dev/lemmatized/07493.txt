as far a it concern me it 's true that young people enjoy more the older people . as young people have the strong sprit in them to achieve anything under the sun , be it ragarding the sport , extra curricular activites and the hill climbing ( mountain ) . in the modern world young people are ready to perform any difficult task bravely because they have the strong will power in them to achieve . when we consider the sport , young people enjoy a lot by playing outdoor game like football ,, basket ball , base ball and also in the athelitics . and this keep the young people physically and mentally strong inorder perform any risky operation . .. and the older people may not posse equal strength a performed by the young people to play outdoor game ... and merly the older people a only one chance to encourage the young childern . . in this modern world each any every young people want to be different from other youngesters , so he doe thing differently from the rest . and he doe this because so show that he is more talented , and also he want to `` gain appresetation '' from others . .. [ to be rewareded for his bravery ] and also he want to be recognised a the unique person . .. and so i personally feel that all that activity performed by the youngster cannnot be equally performed by the older people . . so youngesters enjoy a lot than the older people . ..
