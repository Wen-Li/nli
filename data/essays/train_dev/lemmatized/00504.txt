i agree , most advestisements make seem their product and offer better than what they really are just because they dont show the other side . many promotion of product advertise their product the way they wish they were but actually are n't because they havent found a way to create the product that way or just because it cheaper the way it is . but , since one personally know the truth , one doesnt care about the quality and just sell whatever will earn them profit . its incredible to look at this and see the way people have turned to be ; from being so honest and hellpfull in the past to being blinded by money and material interest . it 's clear that people today day 's will do anything just to appear to others likeone ha achieved all wanted goal and have reached fame and power . a false advestisement can be seen like a quarter , promotion of one face of the quarter , you may be fully convinced that it great and that it all true but when you get close and see all the caracteristics you get to know that there are two side of the quarter . its strange how so many product have been sold in great amount when one can see the false advertising clearly , so clearly that you ask youself `` how come people buy this ? '' . disgracefully we 're not all brain and people today day get distracted easily , we give the attention mostly to the thing that dont matter because we dont do the reaserch needed to compromise yourself with the important thing in life and the one with good quality . although some company 's have no '' head '' , no true leader for when there are trouble and demand for product , one can see that there allways ha to be a '' head '' in a plan . company 's do research , investigation and interview to find out way to attract customer , to find out what people are looking for . this way you pay attention to the good thing and not to the bad ; this is a good strategy but in a negative way since it fool buyer . by putting attractive color , pretty design and catchy name they have all the attention they need from the customer and what they could say `` in our hand '' . unconsiously they fool u , they put so much artificial thing that they cover the product completely ; it could be just like advertising a completely different product , a total fake and false one .
