i agree with this statemant for three reason . firstly , many young people , even elementary school student , have a lot of thing to do after school . some student have to do their home work , some student have to go to cram school . they have no time to concern about their community . secondly , the way of playing ha changed . developing of computer game , for example , young people tend to play inside of their house . the longer they spend thier free time inside of thier house , the lesser they spend helping thier community . lastly , not only young people , but also society ha changed . young people in thirty year ago , they used to play on the street , and they had plenty oppotunities to communicate and to help thier community . recently , the number of crime in the community increasing grately . strees near their house are no more safe place . neibours are no more reliable . some people will say that there are still young people who help their community . however , thinking about the increasing number of old people who dieing alone , we can not avoid admitting the decreasing of young people 's time to helping thir community . it is sad , but it is true .
