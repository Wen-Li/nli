i disagree with the statement that a student should have a broad knowledge of many academic subject than to specialize on one . studying about several subject at a time will not give the student a chance to know completely about any of the subject . if a student is not allowed to learn about any one subject in detail , he would end up having little knowledge of every subject . this will not help him to be successfull in any of the field that he ha studied about . he ha to decide on one subject or a field and should get into maximum possible detail of the subject . it is quite impossible for a student to get into detail of each and every subject . one ha to be gifted with superficial power to be able to master about all subject . considering an expample of a group of architecture student . learning simple information about every aspect of building design will not help them do a good design individually . if the group is devided and each student is made to specialize on each aspect of buliding design in detail , the whole group would finally be designing a very successfull project together . this is more like the idea of devide and rule . so , a student should be let to study about a subject in detail . in the above example one student could get into design , another student into structural aspect of a building , another into interior decoration and many more like this . finally this group turn out to be a very succesfull architectural firm . hence it is clear that when any student is made to study about many subject and none of them in detail would put him in trouble . a student ha to specialize on one subject . this help him to gain his interest and focus his concentration towards one direction . he may also do good research on the particular subject and invent new thing . so , it is always advantageous to specialize on one specific subject than to have little knowledge about many thing at a time .
