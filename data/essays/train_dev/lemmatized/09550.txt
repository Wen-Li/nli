i strongly agree with the statement that understanding idea and concept are more important than learning fact . while the fact can be basis of analysing and developing idea , it is more valuable to learn abstruct idea for student . there are two reason to support this argument . one is the applicability of concept , and the other is value of the learning process of idea . firstly , idea and concept can stay in student memory and apply in different situation . in contrust , fact are fixed and forgetable . for example , i used to learn history in the fact based method and memorised historical event and peopls in detail , but after several year i forgot everything which i learned . if i had chance to think about the reason or possible solution of the historical event in my head , it would be applicable in my own situation . secondary , the process of learning about idea and concept is the effective way of learning rather than memorising fact . in this process , student try to understant difficult thing and ask themselves critically . this is very important part of learning and it make student more intelligent . in conclusion , understanding idea and concept are more significant in the process of learning .
