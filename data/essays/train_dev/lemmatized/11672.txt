i disagree with statement about to have broad knowledge on many academic subject rather specializing in one specific subject . it is always better to have one subject to get specialised more because it make the person strong enough to compete for certain job which especially requires specialization in some particular subject . i have presented some example below to support my arguement . i have got two friend who are studying their undergraduation in `` mechanical '' , `` mechatronoics '' a their major . the subject involved in mechanical are purely related to concept based on mechanical . but the subject involved in mechatronics are related to mechanical , electronics , little bit of computer science , i.e mechatronics is a combination of the subject . when my both friend completed their undergraduation in their respective field , i observed that the person who done his major in mechanical were able to hire or get the job easily . in case of other friend this ha not happened . here he is eligible to attend the company which requries mechanical . electronics , computerscience background knowledge independently , that sound to be more specification in the subject mentioned above . here my friend wa unable to pursue the job a he lack more knowledge in depth to be required for a particular company . therefore for every individual it is essential to have an keen thorough knowledge or specialization in particular academic subject rather than having a broad knowledge on many subject . this case can better be explained in case of field of doctor 's profession . as we all know that a doctor who is specialized in one particular organ of our human body , say eye , heart , kidney etc. , are more valuedand paid than the doctor who have got enough knowledge on all aspect of the human organ . this is the reason why kidney specialist , heart specialist etc. , have more fame than other doctor who do n't have any specialization degree in any organ of oyr human body .
