ideas and concept are important and are considered a important base for the development of a child a a human being . ideas and concept can make built a future understanding and prospect for a person . there is a small line of demarcation between idea , concept and fact . ideas and concept are described a , that a person on basis on what is being learnt or his understanding of concept can think of an example to visualise it in a better way . the idea and concept , once understood by a person can make his way to wide view , or imagination and can easily draw out what he or she ha understood about the subject . example : - a student is told about a tree and is told that it is green in colour , and ha wood which is brown in colour and grows from root . and that there are stem in wood through which leaf in green colour that can provide with ` shelter and shadow , can grow so , this idea or concept about the tree can help a child to know hat tree is , what are it feature , what all benefit of tree are . and all this can help him to imagine how tree look like , and when he can see the tree will recognise a to what he ha a knowledge about that particular thing . so , idea can also help to have rememberance and recoginition . wherease , fact are simply stated , but you can not imply about them . these fact can not let one to think to there wide imagination , a to how thing can be , and what can be it advantage and disadvantage . because it is one basic matter that is imposed on one by being stated a what is called a `` fact '' . but some fact over duration of time create enthusiasm among one to know about the concept , or logic behind it . and that is when one us there idea and visualise the fact to a concept . hence i agree with the statement that student should understand idea and concept than to learn simply fact . because , it can be difficult for a student in his growing year to understand and pik up the concept and idea , and to think about there own view on those idea . but it is the best way of teaching and understanding , a can help is overlasting future . because there are situation in colleges that we face whereby self study , and undertading of concept help a student more than just simply inculcating the fact , without knowing the other important implication and benfits of such a stated fact . so . with few difficulty in using brain to a right direction , and visualising of all fact and idea can help a student with a great future prospect that just simply taking of fact from the teacher . so it important to question , a to wh'ether it fact or a concept .
