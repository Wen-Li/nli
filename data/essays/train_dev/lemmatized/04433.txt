some people think that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their community while some others think that they do . for those who think they doe give the reason that lot of young people would go out and do free survices for orphanage a well a other non profitable survices in educational commities and etc . for example we can see that lot of student enter club or team that go out around the neighborhood to help out those who are in need . this can be seen much more clearly at us and north america . however for those who think that the young people doe n't do enough survices point out that most young people just focus on their own leisure activity when they have free time or just go and get more work to earn more money instead of paying attention to the community . for example they give out the fact that young people nowadays spend more and more time on surfing the internet a well a doing sport instead of free community survices since that they do n't actually get any benifit from it . as for me , i personally agrees to the idea that young people nowadays do n't spend enough time to help out for their community , on the condition that they are living in asia or non english speaking country . the fact is that in non speaking country such a asia young people tends to focus more on school work and how to get better degree such a master degree or phd . however in north america , the school requires the student to help out the community at least 2 ~ 5 hour a semester , which mean while those young people go to school they receives the idea of helping out the community instead of just focus on the academic . in conclusion , i only agree to the condition of that the young people are not spending enough time to help out the community when they are living in the non english speaking country such a europe or north america
