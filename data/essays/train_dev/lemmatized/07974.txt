there are many mode of transportation avaliable to the modern person such a plane , ship , boat , bus , train , the underground metro , but car remain the primary mode of transportation for many people who are commuting everday in urban and subarben area . i disagree with the previous statment that say that car use will decrease , for i believe that with time , the amount of car in use will continue to increase . firstly , the population inhibiting the earth continues to grow year by year . these people will evidently need to move from one place to another and therefore find the purchasing and use of a car a a good solution . we also find that the average consumer may buy more than one car , for they can afford it . if you are ever stuck in a traffic jam , you can plainly see the amount of car out there is increasing . looking closely , you will also find that these traffic jam are getting worse every year . secondly , the more people there are , the greater the demand for car , and this will lead to an increase in production of car . we can plainly see that the manucaturing of car ha not decreased but is increasing year by year . infact , this is a very competitve market with a varity of product aimed at different consumer . from the busy soccar mom , needing a large and reliable car , to the rich business man ready to cruise in his expensive european car . this market , is infact getting larger since the time of ford model-t , and will contine to grow with new designes produced every year . thirdly , there are many country currently trying to enter this ever expaninf market . for example , there are many chinese car infiltrating the market and this is a new advancement never seen before . there are also country that manuacture car part , such a moracco , and this production is likewise increasing . it is apparent that the production and use of car will continue to increase year by year . unless these are new techonlogical advancement that can replace car and are cost effective , thus avalible to the average consumer , we can be sure that car will not decrease in number any time soon .
