some people enjoy life and some other people do not , may because they dont want to or just they do not feel it . in my case i am young woman and in me experience i can say that for me this statement it is true , is true because . for example , i am the older sister in my family and i can see to many thing about what my father and mather that are older than me like to do . i do many thing different , of course , for the difference of age like go a party every two week or a concert once a week , and olso maybe go to the movie with me friend or just make noise , but what they do is not that similar , they like to stay in home reading , watching movie or news and some time spending time with the family . in some occationes i can understand this kind of behavior , and is because they are tired after wok and that , but some time even if they stay all day at home , they would do the sema thing during the day . some people think that each person have their own way to enjoy their own life , because it depents on the way of see the thing or activity that you are doing , but for me is not in that way , i need to do thing that make me feel that i am enjoying my life and the people would see and realise that ithat 's why i agree wiht this statement . i really prefer to spend my time doing thing more thing that older people , i think that i enjoy life more that older people or better that that
