i do not agree the opinion that young people enjoy life more than older people do . it is true that young people have more physical capacity than young people , but older people have more precious experience than young people . so older people also enjoy their life . young people have a lot of energy , physical capacity . so it is easy for them to travel foreign country and able to have valueable experience . on the contrary , it is difficult for old people to do such a experience . but they are able to think and find many interesting event around them . they may not be able to have experienced foreign country , but they are able to have enough time to love cherryblossoms in bloom in spring , and they also enjoy the rain drop in rainy season . many young people might not think such a thing , but i think it also can be a element for enjoyable life . second abundunt physical capacity doe not always people happy . recently , there are serious social problem like a murder , violation , and so on . these problem is derived from innapropriate use of physical capacity , that is innaproproate use u youth . older people also do such a thing , but the probability to do such a foolish thing le happens . youth is very useful element to enjoy their life , but it is also become an important element to be an old .
