i do agree with the statement , and i would substaniate my stance in the succeeding paragraph . primarily the rate at which environment is getting polluted it tough to imagine people having an oppurtunity in using an automobile leave alone a car . ofcourse many eminent people and reformer have joined force to save environment from pollution it can be jus regarded a a beginning . or a rennaissance in twenty first century going by the no of dramatic reform , protest going on inorder to save `` mother earth '' basically in day-to-day activity in the modern day scenario a vehicle ha become a basic amenity . by vehicle i meant a car because on an average every 2 people to 8 people use a car in developed , developing nation . a car wa a necessity earlier or a mark of an aristocrat or his associate . but these day it ha become the order of the day to use a plush car even tough thier 's no impending need for it . going by the design that are introduced in the market `` at the drop of a hat '' by the manufacturer in many nation it indeed tough to imagine a pollution free environment . they are reaping rich profit and soaring unparalleled height a far a their bank balance is concerned . i do not mean that pollution is caused only by uncontrolled vehicle usage , but this definetly play the most significant role in contributing to enivronmetal degradation . it wa given in an article of ` national geographic channel 's magazine ' regarding the hazardous effect of the increase in the no of car in this century and their subsequent contribution to the degradation cycle . and ut astonishing to note down that a staggering 42 percent of pollution is contributed by vehicular pollution . so in the wake of so many fact coming to light and few developed nation , superpower like china amending law to protect the environment and more importantly making their citizen abide by the law it just might be a tough going for car manufacturer in the future . actually people do not use vehicle in venice which is supposed to be the pollution free state in the world but there 's a possibility of some one coming out with a break through like say an eco friendly car , probably we might to turn to that car . goin by the theory of uncertainity it highly unlikely that car can be operated with same regularity in future owing to law of nature , demanding circumstance like environmental degradation and spread of various health hazard there 's a bleak future for various car manufacturer who have earned money tht'l cushion future generation . i feel that there 's an urgent need to address the problem of pollution , health hazard resulting from the harmful gas an automobile may emanate . as they say `` prevention is always better then cure '' .we should take note of these problem and strive o find a fitting solution to the already dilapidated environment
