several reason make me to agree with the fact that in twenty year there will be fewer car in the street than there are today . these reason are of various kind . first of all , the natural ressources of our planet may not be sufficient to make it possible to produce enough energy to maintain our traffic rate . or the price of energy will be to high for one to afford having or buying a car . gas is very expensive yet , because of the various conflict in the world , especially in the productive region of the globe . then , i believe than alternive way of transport will have been developed and improved . collective transport may become cheaper and lot of people may prefer them to their car . new mean of transport will be found because the world public opinion is becoming aware of the danger of pollution . and the transport sector is the only one where restriction can be made , since progress in industry can only be made in the long term . changes in the transport sector can happen before twenty year . campaigns can promote the use of the bus or explains that biking can be a better solution than driving when living in a city . finally , new solution can also appear . one can have difficulty to find the link between the reducing car rate and the internet , but in fact it exists . the net make it possible to do shopping for example . one ha n't to take his car anymore . if one emloyee who deliver good at the internet user is on the road , it make the car rate divided by two . all these solution , even if i recognize that they sound quite unrealistic , will necessarily be examined by the decision taker . actually , they will not have choice . i believe some global measure should be discussed , a an isolated one may not be enough .
