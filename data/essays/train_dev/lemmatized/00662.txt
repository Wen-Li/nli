these day , le and le young people are willing to give time to help their community . this is because student simply do not have enough time to spend other than studying . moreover , student tend to care le about others nowdays . first , student spend so much time on their study that they do not have any spare time to help the others . many parent think that it is better for their kid to focus on their school work in order to enter a good unversity . according to a survey , more than a seventy percent of highschool student had not enough time to do other thing beside studying . this prof the fact that even though some student want to participate in their volunteer work for their community , they will not be able to because of their limited time . therefore , young people do not spend their time volunteering because they do not have enough time . another reason is that the number of young people who care about other people are declining . their interest is only focused on their own success not on their community . many expert say that a lot of mass medium such a television and newspaper are responsible for this . they show the importance of winning the race only . they convince people that helping others is a waste of time . thus , more and more student are usually interested in gaining money or getting a good carrier . students are not interested helping others because they think it give nothing in return . the young , therefore , are not willing to help their neighbor . this is because they scarcely have time to volunteer . moreover , even though they have time to help others , some student do not feel the nessesity of volunteer work because they do not think of others that much , these day . however , the decreasing number of volunteer is very tragedic to the society . we should make the young to care about others more to make this world better .
