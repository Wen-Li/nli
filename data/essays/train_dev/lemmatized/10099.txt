i do not agree with the topic that `` it is better to specialize in one subject only '' because in the present computerized world people are expected to do many thing at a time.a broader knowledge of many academic subject will give the person to make himself with any type of environment . the world is not isolated every company have different job to do . i mean every company is dealing with many activity and expecting people to have the basic skill to perform reasonably good in every activity . for example take a company say ibm one of the biggest company in the world . there are many branch in the say hardware , software and so on . many time people from one branch are shifted to other branch depending on the work and he is expected to do well in that branch also . without having the basic skill in other academic he can not perform in that branch . but for a department like research this may not sound good there people are expected to invent something new for the future use of society . in this case the person is expected to focus more on which he is doing research . even then he need some basic skill in other academic . for example if a person is doing research in vlsi designing , along with electronics he ha to be familiar with electrical technology , embeded system , computer science . this is because every academic subject is related to other academic subject . no subject is isolated from the other academic subject . from the above point discussed i would like to summarize my topic that it would be better to have broad knowledge of many academic subject than to specialize in one specific subject . broader the knowledge , broader will be the choice and a better future .
