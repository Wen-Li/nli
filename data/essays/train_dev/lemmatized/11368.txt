some people believe that the product in advertisement are the same a the real one because it look like the real one . however , i do not agree with it . i believe most advertisement make product seem much better than they really are because of well-taken picture and the stratagy of commpanies . first of all , well-taken picture are very attractive . the purpose of advertisement is to show the product well to people . for perfoming that purpose , the product in advertisement should be a good shape . a freind of mine , he is working in advertisement company in korea . one day , he showed me two picture of apple . one wa just regular picture and the other one wa the picture that he added some color balance with photoshop . two picture wa totally different from each other , and he said that his company will use the latter picture for the apple advertisement . for this reason , i believe that the good in advertisement is better shape than the real one . moreever , advertisement should make people to want the product , and that is the stratagy of advertisement . for letting people buy the good , the advertisement have to use any way to attract people even they exaggerate . one day , i saw the advertisement of kim-chi , korean traditional food , on television shopping . the seller wa eatting it and it looked like really really delicious . i could not wait to buy it and finally i orderd it . however , a soon a i god it , it wa not that delicious than i expected . for these reason , i strongly agree with the idea of that most advertisement make good seem much better that they really are . because well-taken picture and the purpose of advertisement are most important factor of that people choose the product .
