i completely disagree , mainly for three reason . first is that althought youth typically implies health and will to do thing in life . the truth a i see it is that the act of enjoying life is something that is defined a well a happens in our mind within ourselves and is not something completely dependent on how many year doe one have . as an example of this there are the lot of young people that live in deep depression , sometimes clynical sometimes not , that clearly do not enjoy life . it is clear that the example given in the paragraph above can be reverted . but that brings me precisely to my second point . for me is not accurate nor completely correct to make generalization about a so subjective thing a people enjoying life more than other people . how do we compare the enjoying of one group versus the enjoying of other ? and what is the meaning of enjoying life ? all of this make me more suspicious about the given statement . now , my third objection is foreshadowed in the last paragraph . what do we mean by the phrase `` enjoying life '' ? it is obvious that althought there may be a certain consensus between some people about the meaning of that phrase , enjoying life doe not mean the same for everyone . less problable it is that it will mean the same thing for older and younger people . so it may be possible that older and younger people enjoy the life the same but within their own definition of what is enjoying life .
