what make a successfull person succesfull ? it is the way of how they handle thing different or more inventive compared to what i call the `` normal people '' surrounding them . therefore , i agree with the statement that successful people try new thing and take risk rather than only doing what they already know how to do well . in the following , i will present to main argument to support this opinion and in the end conclude with a generell statement . my first argument to support my opinion implies a switching in the logic of the statement : trying new thing and taking risk lead more likely to success than sticking to the ordinary way . in work life , for example , people that climb up the career leadder are always those who bring about new idea . at first , they question the established process , then they think about newer method in a greater horizon . after that they wage the cost and benefit . even if the new idea outline obvious risk , for example a high rent for a store in some not so popular area , they take the risk and start the changing process . why ? because `` risk taking '' is mostly regarded a short term statement . however , a successfull person , weightens his or hers decision making argument in a long term perspective and therefore , the risk arent a high a a first glance . the store area , for example , will in this case probably develop into a hip shopping area . the second reason why successfull people try new thing is simply , because the have more money to spend on new thing or risky activity , such a fun sport or gambling . thus , poorer or `` normal people can not afford trying to many thing that get along with consum . of course , there might be exception from the stated theory , but in generell i thing that there is a logic and even a circular pattern that support the thesis this essay is abot .
