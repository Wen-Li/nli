i completely agree with the statement ` most advertisement make product seem much better than they really are . ' there are so many example that prove this statement to be true . i am taking a psychology class at my school and we actually had an assignment about this . we had to bring an advertisement to class out of a magazine or newspaper that represents a product . advertisements are always exaggerated to be better than they actually are . people advertise their product in order to sell it . it is a business and no business will be successful without positive feedback . of course , if the product seems good , people are going to want to buy it . the advertisement that i brought into class wa a cigarette ad . i found it on the back of a magazine lying around at school . the cigarette brand wa `` kool . '' the ad showed a young man laughing and seeming happy . he wa holding a trumpet trumpet in one hand while holding a cigarette in the other . this advertisement made cigarette seem much better than they really are . everyone know that cigarette are bad for your health and are in general just disgusting , but ad like these make people think twice . another example of making product look better than they truely are , are food product . many food company that produce the same food a another company , will compete with that company . both food company will have to make their food look better and sound better than that of the other company 's . these advertisement will start popping up everywhere like on tv . advertisements like these are found everywhere you go . when you are at home , you will se advertisement on tv or receive it in the mail . when you are walking through the city , you will see poster hanging on the side of the street or on the side of a bus . people can not get away from it , which is good for the business , but bad for the people . people will automatically be attracted to certain product that seem very good on an advertisement .
