most of the time , youth is remembered a day of happiness and good memory . on the contrary , and especially in our time , becoming old is often seen a horrible and everybody try to stay young with cream and other chemical product . but do young people enjoy life more than older people do ? i think they do , because only a few people make the right choice when they are young and because we have an illusory vision of youth . first and foremost , young people have a lot of free time , they are having no reponsabilities . they are totally free to do what they want , or that what is widely believed . in fact the large majority of young people is to attend school , obey to their parent and deal with the problem of finding their place in this world . the difference with older people lie in the fact that they are asked to do almost everything they do a older people choose a job , a wife , a place to live and all the others thing . the time that is still left , once what is demamded is done , is really free : this time is given generously to young people and is precious to older people . this is when they live like they want , and often so a to be the contrary their parent wanted them to be . once people get a job , a wife , an husband , a situation , they forget that they are free , that they can live like they want even if it is not easy . actually , freedom is much more dangerous for grown-up than for teenager : parent are there to help and to rescue in case of emergency and there is little time when the danger of freedom can be experienced . the experience of freedom during the youth is faked because the inner feeling of freedom is not balanced by a great danger . on the other hand , older people see much more risk in freedom . people do not learn fro their youth .
