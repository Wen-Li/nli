there are different opinion among people concernig whether having broad knowledge of many subject is more desirable than specializing in one specific subject . although it is true that having broad knowledge can help people in various problem , a far a i am concerned , i conceive that specializing in one specific subject is more preferable to having broad knowledge in our life . i will present briefly two reason supporting my idea . the first reason is that because the society will change more complicated , the demand for the specialized knowledge or skill would increase . in fact , in ancient age , people should do everything well to survive , but now people do n't need to be capable of everything . for example , famous baseball star can earn enomous amout of money only because of his ability of throwing ball fast . the second reason is that in modern society people can not obtain broad knowledge of many specific subject . nowadays socioty new knowledge and skill are produced so fast and much that we ca n't keep up with the pace of the development . if there is a person that is able , the person 's faith is only his or her subjective faith . for example , we could not even imagine the internet only a thirty year ago . of course , broad knowledge of many subject can help people make their life balanced and rich . however , the more important thing to do in modern society is to specialize in one specific subject a person can do well and interested in . in conclusion , i would rather specialize in one specific subject than have broad knowledge of many academic subject .
