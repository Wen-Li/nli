i think this statement is absolutely right . when we face it we have to realize that there are le successful people than average people . why ? the question is why one people is succesful and the other is not . because the succesful people have tried something that no one tried before or maybe ever tried but not a well a the succesful people did . this mean that to be sucessful you have to try something which ha never be done before or work and focus more on something than other people . for instance , why did the star become so famous ? at the beginning a celebrity is a person like anybody else but to become famous she ha to make a movie original , try something which is gonna work something special maybe somethign that nobody ha made before . she or he ha to be very imaginative . the risk taken will bring her or him at the top or maybe down but the risk wa taken . an another example maybe more reliable. a scientist is a person who need to take huge risk to have the chance to find something to cure illness or something else . what would we have discovered if none of scientist , chirurgian and doctor took risk . the response is easy we wouldn t have discovered anything . they tried something new for the cancer research for example and took risk to find something out . it is the same story all over again for other sector or other profession , you can t get sucess just in doing the same thing than others do . you have to have your own personality , you have to be different in a lot of way somehow , you must take risk , you must try until you get what you want or until you suceed . in my opinion you can t be successful is your just get into the stream , you must get out of the stream and follow your own strategy , experiment new thing and bet on risk . you might suceed or not but at least you would have tried .
