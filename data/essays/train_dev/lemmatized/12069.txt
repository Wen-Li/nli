i agree that it is better to have broad knowledge of many acadamic subject is important a student up to his secondary school level , that is up to his ten plus two level . becuase we should be familier about all basical scinces . it is impartent to inculcate body functioning , and body cleaning , so we need biology . one should learn about the nature and environment in which he living . basical mathamatical caliculations are impartent in day-to-day life . a person should be imported that how he should behave in the society , what are his right and responsibility , so he should learn social study . there is multidimensional devlopments are occuring in various field of study . there are also different interest and talent exist in each person . it is difficult to decide a careere for a person inthe early age . so every one should be familier with many acadamic subject . on the other hand dealing with many number of subject at the same time is very difficult thing . even there are more number of sub field existing in a group today . for example let u take technology . in technology there are many number of branch existing like computer scince , electronics , mechanical and civil . each field is different frome other . one ca n't reach the apex in every field . to have good knowledge on a perticular field , it is better to devote entire time to get mastery of that perticular subject . doing reaserches in order to get practical knowledge is impartent . so in my opinoin , reading many acadamics in secondary schoole level , and reading a single specialized subject from under graduate level is better to one .
