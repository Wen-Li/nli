i agree with the idea of that young people enjoy life more than older people do . when we look around u , we can easily see that young people are walking around the city , going to the theatre . doing something else , while older people staying at their house . young people enjoy life more than older people because they have the energy that the young age give to them and also a a result of some religious thing . firstly , young people naturally have the energy to be able to more active than the olders . if you are young , you do not have any important health problem , you can walk , run a long a you want . young people have an energy inside them which doe not let them to be stable . in my country , turkey , we describe this situation a ` not being ablo to fit her \ his cup` . as a benefit of this energy , they enjoy life more than older people can do . moreover i greatly believe that , especially in my country , this situation , that young people enjoy life more than older people do , is a result of some religious circumstance . older people think that they are close to death and they feel the end of their life . so they consume their time especially for praying and doing something for the life after death . older people think that using their rest of day for entertainment is very disadvantegeous for them . however , young people doe not afraid from death , because they are not close to death a older people . so they walk around , go to disco , theatre and they gain the taste of life . to sum up , it is very clear that young people tend to enjoy the life . as a result of the energy that they have and not to feel themselves to close to the death , younger people live their life more entartainmently than the old people do .
