i disagree with this topic simply . because i see the young people who help their comunities very often . in the course of development about human living , many young people do not have enough time to helping their community . actually , compare with the past , it is true many people do n't help other people even if they have enough time . but i think that can not be serious problem of ethic in community . first , almost all school ha volunteer club for community . and student can learn easily that 's the right way and that 's the good for everyone . for example , to help somebody who is difficult to do something or cleaning street . moreover , there are subject for helping community in some special school ( but not really common anyway ) . that 's why we can see young people who learned about ethic and volunteer . even though they not do it too much , i believe that people in community are satisfied with young people 's little helping . second , if student will help their community during vacation , some school give point for score of semester . unfortunately that 's not very good situation , anyway young people should give enough time to helping their community . but in my experience . this behavior is not really useful . many student are good volunteer but some bad young people doe not help their community really . because they only want to get the point for semester . besides school can not observe them completely , they do n't do their best . fortunately that bad young people are not many so we can see the young people who help their community by this second way . as a result , there are many young people who learned what is really good and what is really bad . and they do their best to helping their community by many way . that 's why i 'm sure our society is happy because of young people .
