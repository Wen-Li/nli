i agree with the given statement that usage of car will become fewer in the coming twenty year . i can infer this from a practical fact that increase in scarcity of fuel which lead to a hike in fuel price . and also from the awareness of pollution by the people may make them travel by bus or train . maintaining a car nowadays is a fashion and a symbol of status . but we have many disadvantage from using one . the first on is that we have to spend a lot for it fuel and maintenance . and we sometimes find it difficult to park our car when we go out . due to increase in population in the future due to unavilability of space and due to higher demand there may be a hike in the parking charge too resulting in the withdrawal of usage of car by many people . when coming to the case of pollution they cause a lot of pollution resulting in various illness and health problem of people . so when the people become aware they will stop using the car in the future . also many number of car result in traffic jam which are likely to increase with increase in time and population ; so people being aware of these messy thing will lessen their usage of car and limit them only for inportant aspect such a vacation etc. i.e. the daily usage will be limited in the coming day . from the increase in number of car it result in scarcity of fuel availability resulting in hike of fuel price so much . then i.e. twenty year from now people will stop using car much . because a large hike in fuel price is likely to occur due to it scarcity for which the orinary man may noy be able to afford . so the number of car used by ordinary man ill be low . to have a pollution free environment all our public will take necessary measure to limit pollution but when they cant limit it i.e. twenty year from now , they will stop using the car which are also a cause for pollution . and to meet the expense for his living due to growth of population in the future one ould limit his expense by stopping the usage of car which help him alot by saving a large amount of money wasted on travel .
