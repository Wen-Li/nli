when we look into the present scenario in my country , india , one will find more number of bike than car . this is the case because people here are not inclined towards the luxurious good , like car . they are more intrested in possessing those good which are required to live a normal life . but a the rate at which the development is taking place in the country , one can expect this to change . firstly , when we look into the technological growth taking place aroung the world , one will understand that the human are not satisfied with what they have . each and evry time they come out with a new idea to make human life more simpler . this is leading u to an age when a luxurious good in present day will be an daily necessity . people are very lasy to work hard to travel from one place to other . so they came out with the idea of bike instead of bicycle . then came the four wheeler car . it had all the feature of an bike and it also provided comfort . but the cost and maintainance of it didnt encourage many to look forward for it . nowadays , we have got the technology which can be used to manufacture car at a cheaper cost and which can be maintained with no extra care . in future , there will be car which guarantee more comfort , speed , luxury and efficient fuel consumption . we can even look forward for model which run with a battry or solar energy , which are renewable source of energy , than going for petroleum fuel which are on the verge of extinction . this will encourage more number of people to buy car . when we look it from an individual point of view , the economic growth of the country is growing at a faster rate . people are becoming wealthier and are looking forward for comfort . as in india , an normal family ha four people and when ever they want to travel a a group they have to consider some outside mean . but a the present day indian can afford to buy a car with his earnings , without a second thought he is going for it . the present population and the sale of the car in the country tell the rate at which the the number of car on the road is increasing . so , twenty year down the line , we can look forward for an india , when more half of the indians posse a car . car , which is a luxurious property nowadays will be a daily necessity at that time .
