knowledge ha no limit , infact it depends on the person what he really wanna know or learn indetail to what it will be helpfull to him or is required for him . well , personally i feel it important to have broad knowledge of many academic subject , but when i give deeper thuought i stick to having to be specialized in one specific subject . because it need greater effort and u need to sacrife all other need to have broad knowledge of many academic subject . firstly , every person need some formal education to great extent . later it depends on individual interest , in which subject he is really interested and wanna persue his or her specialization . that specialization in one particular subject is the one which is gonna fetch u a good job , name in soceity , and finally reach pinnacle in that subject . onthe other hand it requires a lot of money to persue knowledge . for example , to do medicine will cost u a lot of amount and great effort in present day situation where the number of seat available is le and a lot of reservation police . secondly , you need to dedicate our whole life or a major part of it to acquire broad knowledge of many academic subject . when u think in practical term it almost impossible to do u r specilization in both engineering and medicine . at the same you will be missing all the joy in life spending your life learning all the time . a everyone know , there no limit for knowledge . being a human being you need to dedicate time to your family too , which is part of your life . to conclude , knowledge is every important for every one , at the same one should know to what extent or what excatly they want to know or helpfull to lead a decent life . gaining knowledge can be hobby after certain extent , but cant be the only part of life . so , i prefer to have deeper knowledge in particular subject i am interested in .
