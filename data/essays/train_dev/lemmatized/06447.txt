with the change of technology and way of living of the people there is a drastic change in the behavior of the people . this is mainly true in case of young people . these day young people are getting more reluctant to work given to them and even becoming more careless in doing or performing their duty . i surely agree with the statement that `` young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their community '' because of few specific reason . the reason that i provide to support my opinion are that nowadays young people are getting more busy with their work or study or even with entertainment . firstly i would like to talk about the study or the content of the study . in today life study are including a lot of syllubus which give a variety of idea to youngster , but the people who are including these syllubus into the academic are forgetting that because of this young people are unable to do their must duty and so ruining them . secondly in this compititive world involvement to work is much needed to make a place in the world market . so this might be the other reason for young people forgetting their duty . thirdly and the most important one is that the entertainment provided to the world are distracting them from doing their duty perfectly . these three reason that are stated above are mainly making young people to become busy and so not allowing them to make any time for their community . not only these young people but this problem is with almost every one in this community . these busy deed making people forget about the society and to help the society . but there are many people who are still alloting more of their time to develop the society and because of them the society is still breathing . so a to make the society more better every one and mainly the young people of the world have to come forward and make time for helping the society and make the world a better place to live in .
