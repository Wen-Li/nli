today , we are facing serious environmental threat resulting from the excessive use of car . passing a gas station demonstrates u daily that gas price are increasing tremendously . also on a day-to-day basis , the medium tell u about political conflict mostly resulting from oil issue in the middle east . thus , it may lead u to the question if the invention of the car wa a good idea . moreover , it is intersting to think about the question if there will be a many car a today in twenty year from now . i do not think so for the reason i would like to give in this essay . first , oil resource are deminishing very rapidly and statistic show that we will eventually run out of oil and gas . this , of course , depends on the pace we are using our oil . but it seems very obvious that the vast oil reserve will be totally gone in twenty year if we use oil a we u it today . thus , a there will be no fuel in the future there will certainly be fewer car a well . second , the car a we use to know it now is probably going to dissappear . technology develops at a such quick pace that there will be new facility which will transport u and our good in the future . twohundred year ago , people thought that the train is going to be the new vehicle of the future . however , a the car wa invented , train were not the only transportation mean anymore , thus resulting in a decrease of train being used . in the same way , it might be happen with the automobile . even today , car are not used that often anymore when cheap airplane ticket become more and more available . lastly , i believe that the need to get from one point to the other will be not a high a it is today . in twenty year , computer technology will have advanced in such a tremendous way that almost everything will be possible to do from home . this trend can already be seen today , a many company are offering job that can be done from home using the internet . thus , people will not leave their house in the future a they do now and can leave their car , if the vehicle is still named a such , in their garage . in conclusion , i feel that it is obvious from the argument given above that there will be tremendously le car in the future . moreover , it is impossible to say if such a vehicle will still exist in twenty year from now .
