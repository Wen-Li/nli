i do not agree most advertisments make product seem much better than they really are . first , tv , newpaper , internet and so on , more and more come into our life , so we can get a lot of advertisments everyday . in the day life , we have to buy lot thing , the same thing we have so many chance , which one is better for use , which one price is better , we can not look for every store , so the advertisments give u the information . '' oh , this one is good , ha a lot of function , we shall buy this one `` we will say that after saw the advertisement . but , if the real product is not better a advertisment , we spend time and monay , then we buy the product is not we want , what will happend next ? we do not trust advertisement anymore . second , sometime , we really need the product , it is most importent to u , we bought the one after study a lot of advertisments , but you got the one wa not you wanted . if you bought it at store , you can change or return it at once , but you bought it via internet , what you can do ? it is mean you lost a chance . third , that publisher or producter give people advertisement are not real product . people are not trust you again , you will lose the market . so i do not agree that piont .
