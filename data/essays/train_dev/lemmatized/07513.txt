yes , i do agree with the given statement that the young people enjoy life more than older people do . this can be explained with various example . to begin with , the elder people didnot enjoy much priviledges . the society wa not that developed . they had no club , the advanced technolgies to communicate . if they existed , they were in minimum number . whereas , the generation of today , get to enjoy life to a much better extent . they have club , pub and various other hangout to keep themselves alive all the time . young people are free from various fear and responsibilites that come with the old age . older people are much more prone to a lot of physical problem / disease . whereas , young people do not face these physical problem more often . this also give them that youthful and ` always-up-for-party ' attitude . this can also add up to prove that the statement is right saying young people enjoy life more than older people do . moreover , the advancement in technology nowadays ha made communication and interaction much more easy a compared to the earlier time . this act a a medium of interaction between two stranger and can often be a starter for a dating , later shaping ito a relationship . this can certainly add up to the enjoyment . the older people in earlier time didnot enjoy such ease of communication . another point which can be a reason for the given statement can be the generation gap . it can be quite difficult for the older people to communicate or understand the problem faced by young people at time . the older generation is still stuck up with the old orthodox view point . this can act a a barrier in their life sometimes when it come to enjoying life . thus , to conclude , the above point give various example to support the statement that young people enjoy life more than the older people do .
