i think understanding idea and concept is more important for student than simply learning fact . however , sometime learning fact is necessary . in the following paragraph i will state my reason why i do agree with the statement . first of all i think in today 's society and business it is important to communicate . discussing and talking about problem and idea in a classroom give you the ability to talk to people more easily even if you are not the same opinion . you learn to understand their idea and why they might think this specific way . another important thing is another benefit for your future job . today you might be sitting in a classroom with a teacher helping you with every question you ask him or her but sooner or later you probably will be sitting in a business meeting , in a office or even be teaching a class full of student yourself . if you have learned to understand the idea and concept of thing you also learned to solve problem . if you did n't understand it at first , you looked for answer and way that you might be able to understand it . the third thing is that it is probably easier to learn for a test when you get the main idea or the whole concept . when you prepare for a test and just learn fact the whole time but do n't know how they fit together or what their connection is , it is pointless . you might know it untill the next day but you will forget it in about a month . however , if you learned the whole concept and understood it , you are familiar with it and it is easier for you to recall thing . i would like to support my statement with an example : in math it is very easy to solve problem after you have understood the main idea and the concept of the solution . some task might be harder but you always know at least the way to solve them . if someone would just learn the formulars but doe n't know how to use them or how to combine them he wo n't do good on any test . even so i support the statement i have to say that there are some major where learning fact is partly necessary . for example if you learn a new language you first just study the vocabulary . when you do history you have to learn date and `` timetable '' . in the end , however , it always matter that someone understands the whole idea .
