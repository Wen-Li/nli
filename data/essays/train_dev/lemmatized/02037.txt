we are living in a modern world filled with advertisement . all advertisement try to show the magic of their product . however , i have little blief in what the advertisement have told me . i think most advertisement make product seem much better than they really are ! the goal of advertisement determines their poor credit . all the advertisement are aiming to attract a many customer a they can . and how can they obtain this achivement ? they give misleading and uncredible information of their product . for example , some healthy food will claim it body-building function in the advertisement . but few give any convincing statistical state or trustworthy survey on how it make effort on people who have used it . we may see a set of comparison between a fat girl and a thin girl . but how can we believe it 's just the effection of the food ? since advertisement used for commercial use , most of them will not provide sientific proof . another interesting phenomenon is that famous actress and actor often appear on the screen to advertise a product . of course , the actress and actor are attractive and beautiful . by these kind of advertisement , we attach the product to these beautiful imago . but the truth is , how many celebrity really use the product they recomment ? they are just invited to say a sentence , show a pose , and etc . . it misguides the costumer to some extent . costumers will connect the product to the good imago in their mind . actually , the product are not so perfect a the advertisement said or the customer think . the reason why there exists such a huge gap between the product in the advertisement and in the fact is because there is n't effective norm to regulate advertisement . no specific policy ha given to restrict the advertisement . in fact , exaggeration becomes one of the keywords in advertisement . i have already disappointed to find a real product in any advertisement . only when our goverment and medium realize the importance to supply the audiance unbiased and true fact instead of the beautiful lie in advertisement , can we choose the product without doult following the instruction of advertisement . so , when you choose something to buy , do not trust what the advertisement told you . turn off the television when you see an unblievable product in an advertisement again . a clever customer should try to evaluate and judge a product by him/herself .
