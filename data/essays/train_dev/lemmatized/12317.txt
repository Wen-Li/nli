yes , i am totally in agreement with the notion that it is better to travel in group instead of travelling alone led by a guide . actually , in today materialistic world their is more safety concern then ever before . so it is wise decesion to travel in group . for ex , if a person travel in a new town or country and he doe know not anything about the new place . then it is better for him to travel in a group because it lessen his chance of being confused in an unknown place . a person could be face a lot of defficulitios ion new place like where to stay , have food and some time he may encounter langauge problem . so travelling in group with guide will be helpful option . . travelling in group led by guide is very good choice , because the guide is familiar with local language , culture which help a lot . actually , travelling with a guide enhances your joy of the trip because he can tell u a lot about the the place you are touring . further it is also cheaper economical to travel with many people . beause in group everybody is contributing in the whole cost which is mostly le then the cost of travelling alone . exploring a exile place in alone is not a good option because sometime their are few minor prolems regarding to security which may encounter by an single traveller . for instance like a person is going to catch a train in a railway station and someone steel his purse , then he feel that he is in critical dillemma . actually , there are few thief who attack on alone and new traveller . but if you are teavelling in group , they can not dare to steel your thing or you can con = mpliant with your group member . basically , travelling alone in a new and unknown place is always a risky task , one should have to be very careful about himself a well a his luggage too . on the other hand travelling in group secures a person from these minor problem . at conclusion , it is a good and intelligent idea to travell in group with the guide . it make you safer and allow to enjoy journey .
