according to me having a broad knowledge is important at the biginning stage of your knowledge building . it serf a the base or foundation for your knowledge . for me having the ability to contribute in every possible field in acadamic subject is the great thing . the main reason for this is my excitement and quick grasping power which attracts me to the every new and different thing around me . i prefer to have every possible knowledge of all the subject . this developes interest and also help to experience more number of field rather than many thing in same field . by having broad knowledge of many subject make average level of knowledge very high . but by speciallising in one subject restricts the growth of knowledge in other subject and also it ha a specific limit . what after that limit ? , when you know everything in the same subject . for me it important to know more about many thing than knowing everything about one thing . for example in any industry , the main work consists of many small work such a machine handling , actually working on that machine , it maimtainance , repairing ant many thing like this in many region . here it not possible to solve every problem by only one specialist . because he ha the knowledge about one thing only . so he cant help for the other problem . here the role of generlist is important . he ha answer for many thing and in many field . we can say manager . manager is called so because he can manage all thing . so i prefer to have broad knowledge of many acadamic subject and thats why the are being introduced , thats why they are being teached . otherwise people will have one subject only . which can not work . in today world you cant live with knowledge of only one field . more the knowledge more you can grow . for me being a jack of everything is the best way to grow in knowledge .
