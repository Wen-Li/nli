although there are reason to disagree with this statement , i agree with . indeed , successful people try to do a lot of new thing . there are a lot of reason i will support this opinion . first of all , if you want to be successful you have to be better than other people because that is the definition of success . in order to be better you must actually behave in another way than other people . then you have the chance to succeed . if you hope to be successful without doing thing in another way than other people you have to be better than most of them . this is a very tricky task . that mean that probably more people are successful who are risk-loving . a famous example is bill gates who wa a highly talented student . however , he wa not only better than other student he took also risk rather than the other student and founded a small company with the name microsoft . today , bill gates is the richest man allive . second , if you take risk it is highly possible not to reach the personal aim and you may fail . however , if you do not take risk it is not possible to reach high aim at all . maybe the possibility to fail is higher but it is also higher to reach your personal aim . finally , you must have the attitude to improve you characteristic all the time . that regard technical skill , for example to handle computer-problems , a well a social one like the behaviour in group . the willingness to improve yourself together with the the personal claim searching always the best alternative increase the probability to be successful . in conclusion , although there are a lot of risk trying new thing and to behave unusualy , it is the only possibility to be successful , if you do not only trust in winning a lottery , because you have to be better than the others .
