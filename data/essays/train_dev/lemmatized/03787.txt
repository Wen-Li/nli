ideas and concept are based on assumption and historical moment , however fact are real and most of the time scientificly prouved . i believe that to understant a fact you need to understant idea an concept that take you to that fact . for example , in politics it is important to understant idea and concept of the diferents party to understant their way of doing thing . the main idea of communisum is to share everything and have the same level of life with the same opportunity . however , communist gouverment such a cuba show that there is not a equal situation and in fact the goverment manage everyting and people are not free to do whatever ther want . the cubain communisum show that there is a different between the concept and the fact . it think it is important to learn the concept and illustrated with real fact allows student to havea better understanding of the situation . furthermore , idea and concept are the base of a fact , that is why it is a logical process for student to learn idea and concept to be able to understant fact . for example the monarchy in spain , people respect the monarchy system because they understant the concept which make part of their identity . they know the background of the country and they the fact that they made part of the country history . but to understant that , you need to know the background of the country and to know what is the concept of the monarchy in other to be able to understand their position toward the spanish people .
