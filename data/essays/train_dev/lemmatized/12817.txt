i agree with the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide . there are 3 reason i agree . first , i can get information from a tour guide or group member . last summer , i visited to okinawa in a tour group . it is first time for me to okinawa . i have few information . however , in group tour it is ok , because tour guide ha so much information . to follow the guide , i can really enjoy the travel . next , i can go to the place which not famouse , but very nice . there is a good place which we can not know from the guid book . the tour guide tell u that information . for example , good restaulant , good suvenia shop , and good shight seeing place so on . thirdly , i can travel safety . if we face some happning , i can ask the guide to help . they have to help u to contrast . thesedays , japanese often aim from robber in other country . moreover , when i face the trafic accident or dissester , for example earthquipe , my familiy get information imidietlly from the tour company .
