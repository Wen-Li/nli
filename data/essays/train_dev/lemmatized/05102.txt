did you understang everytime your learend everything ? this subjet is it is more important for student to understang idea and concept than it is for learn fact . in my opnion i prefer important for student to understang idea and concept . first , do n't worry by not your understanging fot study and understanding . every eachother have each opnion and think so we can not contorl their think and understanding , so we need to say our opnion and we need to know why ? and how ? and understanding . second , we are different , every pepole is different , for example color , language , culture and custom so we ca n't understanding , i have experience , wheh i wa came to first visit usa , i do n't know everything , and than i think if i eat good food and i give some food for my friend . i think he like this one , but suddenly hi throwout everything . so i 'm very surprise . and then he said me our country can not eat pork , i really mistake . so i understanding everyboby is different , and everytime nerver forget and think . futhermore , think and behavior , and ues . if you learend something you can use good work , but you can also ues very bad work . for emample , someone theated something , but you can understanding different or mistake , you can use tealent for your bad way . this is very bad and sad . so we need to know good understanding . and thinking about possitive way .
