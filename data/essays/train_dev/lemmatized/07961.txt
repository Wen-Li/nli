some people think that to study many academic subject for getting borad knowledge is better than to concentrate on one specific subject . however , i do not agree the opinion and think that people getting a specialized knowledge will be beneficial to our society a follow reason . to begin with , our society , recently , should get the human resource getting a specialized knowledge in many area such a technology , economy and policy . because unprofessional people can lead the society - country , company , party etc. - to the miserable status . the negative result of company operated by unprofessional owner can be a good sample . for example the korean famous corporation ` daewoo ' got the bankruptcy some year ago , because the owner ignore the advice of professional staff . at seccondly , the modern society ha expanded it area . so the society ha been detailed and need the people suitable for each area . especially , the modern corporation have so much department for improving the efficiency . for example , most company divede the department such a administration , accounting , human resource , general support and production . in this case , company should employee people who can use the specialized knowledge . at third , if necessary , there are other way to grow broad knowledge after becoming the specialist in specific area . the community activity and interaction with people in other area will be effective way . so many company hire specialist and give them opportunity to experience other area for growing people who are able to control the overal company in conclusion , i can not agree that to study many academic subject for getting borad knowledge is better than to concentrate on one specific subject , considering the above reason .
