life is a series of experience . these experience start from birth till life end . if a series of experience are enjoyable , we percieve that part of our life a good . if we went through a series of bad experience , we percieve our life to be dull & bad . thus , the degree of enjoyment one encounter in life is a result of the quality of the sum of series of experience one had in a lifetime . i disagree to the statement , young people enjoy life more than older people do . i strongly believe that the degree of enjoyment one experience in life is dependent on various factor , the most important being one 's own mental-set . for example : an old man woud rather be enjoying more , playing with his/her grandson than the grandson him/herself . so , enjoyment is not based on age . it is one 's own mind set & it ability to percieve thing positively & appreciate them . in turn it will result in an enjoyable experience . living life enjoyably is a skill . it ha to be learnt , either through experience or through knowledge . the young people assume partying , going out with friend , seeing movie are the great enjoyment that they are experiencing . but they are least exposed to the fact that these are only trace of happinees , just like bubble on the water surface . there are deeper , intense & more joyful moment in life . the emotional happiness of spending lifetime with a partner is one of the deep enjoyment older people go posse . with age come maturity & stability to withhold happiness . the experience of life also provide the much wanted tolerance to older people . this make them a better knower of life , relationship & how to derive happiness from it . in my opinion an older person is a better taster of different kind of enjoyment in life .
