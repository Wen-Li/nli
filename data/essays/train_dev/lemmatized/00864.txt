yes , i totally agree with this statement saying that most advertisement make product seem much better than they really are . it is a shame that being a consumer is getting harder because there are too many advertisement present their product in the most attractive way . i think the reason is that there are many company and manufacture out there making the same type of product . therefore , they all have spend a great amount of money on advertising so they can compete with each other and survive . and due to the advanced technology those advertisement agency use , almost every product they present look like the best on the market . but very often , consumer do n't really get what they expected after purchasing the product by just looking at their ad . for example , few week ago i saw a digital camera ad on fry 's electronics that wa offering a great discount on this featuring model . it the picture , the camera got a great metalic texture and looked very well built . although i owned a professional digital slr camera ( by canon ) for a while , i wanted soemthing inexpensive , small , and easier to carry around in the campus . i purchased the camera without doing some research online or trying it in the store . when i took it home , i realized it body wa not metal but some light ; cheap plastic . the fully charged battery died with in just 30-40 minute of photo shooting after trying it . i finally got frustrated and decided to return it . the return line wa very long and the guy behind me wa returning the same camera too due to the same reason . we talked for more than 30 minute while waiting and we reached a conclusion that never purchase something just based on the ad or picture . from now on , i do study online or read some consumer review before i purchase . even the old saying go `` a picture worth more than a thouthand word '' , it doe n't apply on all product we see on advertisement nowadays .
