in my personal experience successfull people try new thigs , because they need to kep their brain funcional and open to new sesation , feeling , smell , flavor and information . try news thing help them in the future to make good desition the any kind . because this people never stop to try an incresses the anolege . people how take risk they have two option lose o win is nothing in betwing . the result is be able to reach the point of success or not . this people make drastic desitions they can be good o not but always the result is a lerning experience . for example i move from bogota colombia . i am a veterinary in my country , but in united states i am a veterinary thechnician my gool is be able to optain my licensas a dvm to practice in united states . i make a good decition to move to this country because this is a country to the opportunity . to day i improbe my stile of live and increace veterynary skils , my risk : learn other language , live in difents state and learn who to live whit the people of this country . people who only doing wath they already know how to do well they are people who do not have expectation to grow in life they are the same over and over they do not make the risk because they feeling tha can fail and is very powefull thinking . this people never be able to experience new ting because what they know is the best for them . there word is to limited but no risky \ , they no see the need to chage . because there family is the same and risk and new thigs the are no in the agenda , or maybe somthig happen in the past and when the try to make change someting bad happen .
