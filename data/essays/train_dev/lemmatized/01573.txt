nowadays , a lot of student waste time to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact because of several reason . the first and most crucial reason is school education system because in the exam student need only idea not fact . in my country is a very good example to support this idea since our exam in school include only idea and concept instead of including fact and we take mark only idea . if we know only idea we can take good mark and we can our family member happy . becasuse of these reason we do not take care of learning fact . the second reason why understanding idea is more important for student is that to be a successful person in the comming day . my country is the best one to explain this idea . if you were a successful student in your school life and you graduated from a well known university , boss of holding accept your application and they do not interested in anything about you . furthermore if you want to enter a well known university you should only understand idea and should be successful universty enternce exam . to achieve these you need only to understand idea and concept . to sum up , understanding idea and concept are more important than to learn fact because edutatinal system want it . thus student pay attension to understand idea . altough learning fact are very important , student do not waste time to learn fact because it is not enough to be successful .
