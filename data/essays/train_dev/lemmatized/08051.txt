knowledge in a broader sense is always helpful , but keeping knowledge in many acedamic subject rather than in one specific subject will be difficult and in practical scenario will keep you on `` no man land '' . i personally disagree with the statement to have knowledge of many academic subject than to specilize in one . there are strong reason for this , let u take a subject for this , say `` industrial design '' this seems to be a one subject but it a complete discipline in itself any academic curriculam if design will include all those subject which will help in this subject . specializing in one subject will make a person skillful and specialist of it subject or field . he can contribute to the industry or a society with his skill . this is one aspect of the specialization , it ha another side also , it will bring people from different field and subject together and will encourage a teamwork , example of a autobobile industry will help to make the point clear . to make a product one broadly need a designer , a person who design or visualise that product , an engineer who will make that product work , a marketing person who will sell it to it right user , thus they have to work together and everybody ha to be a specialist in his subject a a engineer can not sell or a marketing person can not design a product . though it look very simple but it is very difficult to execute a each and every person in any industry ha a specific role , though they can contribute in other area with their idea , but one ha to play his key role in that particular process and thats why skill or expertise count a lot in today competitive field . specilization will not give you a choice from the career point of view , but it will make you known for that particular subject . most of the people who served the society with their knowledge were highly specialized in their respective field . thus , it better to have a specialization rather that broad knowledge of many subject .
