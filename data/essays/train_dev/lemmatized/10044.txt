everyone love to want be successful people . that is why there is a big debate about wether people can get success thing . naturally , some people feel that we try new thing and take riske . however , in my opinion , doing what they already know how to do well is necessary . there are a few reason why i hold this view . to begin with , it is professional . what i mean is that they konw very well compare the other person . for exampel , if cardiologist want to take care of pediatric patient , is it a good way ? as you can see , when they want to success their work or job , they have to do what they already know how to do well . another thing , we must considers effective factor . in other word , when someone try new thing , it is time-consuming . take diver a an example . if tax driver try drive bus or truck , they have to learn how to do it . also , they have to get this licence . they aleady have know-how . they already know how to do well therefore essential for success . taking a look at the other perspective , of course may people consider refresh and change their mind . that is to say , when people can do work for a long time , they can get manersim . however , if they give motivation or change life style , you can get more adventages . thus , we must do waht we know how to do well . taking all thing into consideration , i feel strongly that only doing what they know how to do well is a great idea . the main reasions are professional and effective . do you still think that successful people try new thing and take risk ?
