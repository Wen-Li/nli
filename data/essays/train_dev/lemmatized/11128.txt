i do agree with the statement , but i can not be completely sure about it . it is a fact that oil price are higher than ever before . also the polution show a lot of economical and enviromental problem and it is enough a reason to stop using the car because of their leck of usefulness in the city . oil price is a principal problem for western country which have n't their own oil supply . for example in europe , it is almost impossible to have a car without paying car tax , insurance and enormous fuel cost . also the leck of space in major city make the price rise up . one can already see many trend in a lot of city in europe , e.g. the goverment in vienna is making biking rout in the city and also providing cheap rent-a-bike place for it habitant . holland is for sure a good example and show that people are still mobile without a car . a city designer in london said that car should n't design the city . he meant that city are not made for car but for human . this statement ha it truth , when one compare city in newer country with older one . european city have a natural structure . the old part mostly the center are n't designed for car but more for human . american city like caracas they have major problem with mobility of human . of course they have a metro but the car made formed the appearance of the city . they have in the middle of the city big highway and it is completely impossible to walk from one point to the other .
