the standard of living ha been changing over the year . due to all the modernisation and technology people tend to enjoy a lot these day . i believe that now a day younger people are enjoying more than the older people . because in the era of lot of invention and sophisticated technology younger people are having a great time . many way of entertainment came into existence like amusement park and shopping malls where younger people are getting very much attracted while the old people are not willing to get into these party because they prefer home . on the other hand younger people want to enjoy themselves like having dialy party , going to picnic and have a drink . i think that there is considerable amount of change in enjoying these day rather than few year ago . younger people are becoming more successful in their career which implies that they are searching for new way of enjoyment and having fun . while old people dont have eagerness to go for daily party and picnic and they prefer a calm and peaceful life where there is not much pollution and traffic . younger people are very much eager to do something different and they want to have fun all the time . there are various way in which the younger people enjoy like , taking part in sport activites that consists of car racing , water sport and many other game . by participating in them they enjoy very much which release all the burden and all the stress of thier work . while in the case osf older people they prefer to be at home sleeping in their bed eating their own meal . while younger people prefer eating outside with their friend having fun all the time . moreover younger people want to drive away the boredom and they dont want to spend their weekend in their home rather they are finding new way of enjoyment like going to movie , arranging special party in costliest hotel while older people always prefer their home . and when there is an instance of any success in their job the younger people want to share their success with all the friend and they spend lavishly for the party . in my opinion i think that younger people are having a good time rather than the older people .
