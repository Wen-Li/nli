i think older people enjoy life more than young people . there are two reason . will , knowledge and money . first of all , it is will . older people think how to life . because they had busy time when they were young . for example , doing job and growing own child and housu keeping and so on . i have heard that they want to do something which they want . they talk to me what they want when they have free time . in other word , they have something to do after retired . and they have `` will '' , which they are going to enjoy it . i otherwise there are le experence for young peole . so they want to do many tinng , either . for exzmple , sport and study . doing those is very fun for young people . but sometime young people do not those by own wish . someone , who is their parent and teacher so on , let them do . i think thinking of older people is real enjoying life . second point is knowledge . third point is about money . money is necessary to enjoy life for people . in japan , older people can get pentions . so there are many mony which they use for myself . i think money is not everything , but it is important to enjoy life . older people can go to trip , going to house where their grandchirldren ive .
