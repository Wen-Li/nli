for the last decade society ha been suffering the opposite way of `` humanity '' conduct that were lived specifically in the 16th and 17th century , where people cared for others , for humanity , that 's why wa created the `` humanism '' . the actual problem is the specialization of subject that cut off the human relationship . instead of care by the person who life close to u , we care more to know the reason of the molecular existance , for example . what i want to say is that in the way we obtain more broad knowledge of academic and cultural subject , we could be better person in society because we 'll understand those who are the same a u and we also be capable to understand the problem we have a society . it is part of an open-minded education that the study of a specific subject could n't bring . to preserve peaceful relationship between different culture , nation and between different personality , a society we should perform educational curriculum that waranty a broad knowledge education .
