i agree with the statement that in twenty year there will be fewer car than there are today . as car mainly depends on fuel that are conventional , there resouses are limited . this might increase the demand for the petroleum and there product . after some year or due to continues increase in fuel cost may force people to move away from the car and they mostly depend on public transport which is quite economical and ha several advantage . governament will implement different plan to discouage people to use car by lavying heavy tax on regestration , insurance charge , road tax & yearly reneveal charge . which make not affordable for the people to own a car . due to continues decrease in petroleum resourses , the auto manufacturing company are focussing on non-conventional sour like electric car , hybrid car . as electric car is limited for certain distance and it requires to charge than for some time to make it run again which is a major drawback . a hybrid car work on us more than one fuel to run , which is quite costly but it is stated a a future car . in future , we may see only these car running on road . due to increase in population the number of car user increase which will increase the emmissions of gas like co2 , lead particle into the air . this will damage our environment and hazardious to health . because these gas may cause lung cancer , respiration problem . so , it is the responsibility of governament to encourage people use more public transport which make le depend on petroleum , environmental friendly , le crowding the road and economical also .
