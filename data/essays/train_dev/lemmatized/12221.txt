this is a problem , which can not be answered just with `` yes '' or `` no '' or in a few word . there surely are example for both : young people who help their community and who do not . young people who do not give enough time to helping their community may not be integrated strong enough in this community . maybe their parent have little time due to their job or because they do not want to spend much time with their kid . so the kid only do the thing they want , meet friend , have fun , but do not think about responsibility . often kid whose parent do not spend enough time for them feel more responsible for their friend than for their parent and the community they come from . a big problem that can occur related to this are gang . the kid believe that solely their friend are important and they do n't have any responsibility against other part of the society . but this way they build up a new community and spend much time to helping this community . but other kid are more integrated in the community of the adult . they do much for their village or region . for example they are in a sport club or train in the firefighter 's youth-section . i think the major problem is the behaviour of the adult , especially the parent , and how the kid are treated in their community . if young people know that the adult need them and the adult show that they are proud of what the kid do for the community , the young people will spend more time to helping their community . but if the adult do not spend enough time with the kid and maybe their community too , the kid will act the same way .
