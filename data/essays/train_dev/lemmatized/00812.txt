yes , i agree with the statement that young people are not showing up intrests in helping the community rather most of them are intrested in other useless activity a far a concerned . many community need helping hand to cover their problem . young people should be their icon , but unfortunately they are not , added to that they take up a large participation in damaging those legal community . for example , their are many community for old-age people , they are forced to live up in boundage house wheir they lack their family sentiment though their child are financially sound . most of them feel it to be a burden to look after them and to get relieved from this they , force the aged people to live apart . young people now-a day are more attracted towards the external affair they are not supposed to be . they are not sparing up their time to help the community even in their liesure time rather they are attracted towards the entertainment section like movie , club etc.they dont even have time to spend on the communitie in which they live , they simply try up to escape from it a much a possible . i think they shoud to be focused to the advantage and satisfaction they get when they help the community . the abase response to this , should be shown to them theoritically . the matured quality in such matter shoud be inheritted into them . young people , these day are misleaded about the importance of the community and their us . community accumulate form the nation . they are a pride factor for resemblence . finally , i conclude that young people should always approach the community in a possitive way and help the community a far a they can . helping the community tend to help themselves in all
