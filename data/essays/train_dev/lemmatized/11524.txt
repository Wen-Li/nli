first of all , i thing this statement is something very common to listen nowadays , but i think it is n't true . each new year it is true than the young people is more busy in a lot of thing , but it 's a social problem , bacause they have to study , to work , to learn other language , and more to can find a good job . i think this is the main reason to say that the young people do not give enouth time to helping their community , but do n't they study to improves their knowledge and with them help their community ? i think so ! for example , lot of young people use their summer holiday to go to place where they can rebuild old building , or help old people , ... on the other hand , i suppose that is very important the education that they have received in their house , if their parent were woried about teach them the importance of the enviroment , helping old people or mantein the place cleaned , i think they try to have enough time to do that . however , i can understand the statement bacause nowadays everybody live very fast , i mean , you have to do one thousand of think during the day and frecuently you have n't time to think about all that isuues , nevertherless not only young people , but also everybody . finally , i wish everybody had a little time a week to think about this and do something to solve this problem .
