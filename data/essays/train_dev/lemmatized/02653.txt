city born and city bred , i have long been accustomed to the sight of passing vehicle . now that i , a an engineerer , have more oppurtunies to observe the hallmark in the history of invention and have noticed any sign , at any moment for the time being , the fall and decline of car . they are in radical demand in a number of rising country and technology advancement empower them the novel vitality . among contemporary power , us , japan and western europe , the more car people posse , the more is needed for the simple reason the refinement , replacement must be done over two decade and the thriving marketting of new style stimulate the need while average income of people in these region grant the desire . let 's go a step further into the rising nation , china , india . a bief glance at the strenuos road building craze will dispell any douts on the pressing demand of car . some people suspect they , a well a americans , japanese and europeans will be concerned on environmental issue . more often than not , the majority , especially in developping country will consider the properous automobile industry and other area which have some bearing on it the priority . however , country that are sufficiently technologicall prepared may take sturdy step to update , instead of abandoning the car . as far a i can see , automobile is such an indispemsable element of western culture that deserting the car is equivalent to disposing the contention in freedom . cars embody the culture of fully controlling one 's life and the significant sign of being entitled to pursuing the personal aspiration . hence , i definitely believe the recession of car will not occur at least in the near future , so close a twenty year . but one thing is certain , that automobile will take on a more fantastic appearance to gratify the aesthetic appetite of consumer and adopt more feature , say , automatic navigating , hydrogen fueled to be friendly . the possible massive possession of car in developing country in twenty year is approximately written in stone .
