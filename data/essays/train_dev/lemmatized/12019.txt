in the past few decade car have been the most useful vehicle in the world . the use of car is still increasing rapidly . there are many people saying the negative aspect s of car , though i think the increase of car use will go on in the next twenty year or maybe more . the carbon dioxide which is exausted from tha car are said to be a big cause of global warming . this negative aspect should be prevented , but there are still great share of car . why can not people use train and other social tranceportation . in that way car user will be decreasing and it will be good for the enviroment . when i wa still a child and did not have the driver license i thought the pollution the car make wa evil and something that one need to prevent . after a few year when i took the license the thought of pollution went somewhere else from my mind . it is just so useful . i think car are like smoking . we know that this is a bad habit . despite the fact , people just can not quit it . the usefullness of car adicts the people . no one want to be in a bus or a train when you see the people in there getting squashed and misserable . we than think to use the car , more private and convenient . i believe car would not decrease forever . people can not prevent th e desire of using such useful thing so we need to think of another way , like inventing a car that is ecology . the amount of car share will be increasing a the population rise . the decrease of population is the only way of decreasing the car .
