the present statement is a false dichotomy on an essential academic topic : is breadth of knowledge better than specialized knowledge ? i will develop the reason why i consider that building broad and specialize knowledge are both essential and complement each other . to have a wide knowledge of many academic subject is essential nowadays and will be even more important in the future . the world we live in move fast and new technology have enabled an exponential growth of network connection between people from different background and culture . therefore having a broad understanding of different culture and industry is key for an individual to understand and evoluate in our world . conversely , specific and specialize knowledge is essential in order to contribute to the development of our civilization . to master all the aspect and challenge of the discipline is essential in order to contribute to it development . having insight on a specific topic is a strength which could infer numerous job opportunity . one of my science teacher at university used to say that the more specialize a discipline is , the more broad knowledge you need to understand the mechanism of nature and physic . he used to think that somehow many scientific discipline converges towards a unique truth ( an old scientist dream ) . as a conlusion , i believe there are no reason for contending that broad knowledge is more essential than specialize knowledge ( or vice-versa ) . as a matter of fact , i consider they complement each other . i would even add that what is essential in our today world is to learn how to learn in order to be able to adapt ourselves to our ever fast muting civilization .
