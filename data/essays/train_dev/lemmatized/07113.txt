i agree with the saying that people should have broad knowledge of many academic subject than to focus only on his/her specific subject . because doing so have a lot of advantage , not only in academic researchment . but it 's also important for one to make real academic achievement . firstly , our science system have been and is developping rapidly nowadays , making the relationship and interacting between different subject more and more . so you really can not just focus on one simple subject , because the broader you view , the more it help to understanding what you are specific for . as for me , though my major is computer networking , i also read a lot about other academic subject such a biology and physic , even social art . because i found when communicating , the behavior of people in society and the computer in a network is much the same , so we can use the same method to look deep into it and see how it organized and cooperated , and we can learn much about both of it . secondly , a broader knowledge make one person more sensitive . this kind of scientific sensitive is extreamly important when making scientific invention . it 's because person can find the similarity between two thing and make some really brillant solution or idea , which is impossible if people just know the little thing of his major field . in science history , a lot of invetions and discovery came from a cross thinking of two distinct subject of science . of course , people should first know well about what he/she is specific . but too much specialization just limit the person 's eyesight and make he/she blind . so the idea that people should broad their knowledge is right . at least it work for me .
