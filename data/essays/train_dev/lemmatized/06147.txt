in my opinion , i agree with the statement that it is more important for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact . first , sometimes the what we see or hear is not the fact . like long time ago people think the earth is a rectangle , because the road are flat . but after several year of searching and experience , now the fact become that the earth is like a ball . so it is important to underatnad the idea and concept , then we wo n't be cheated by what we see by our limited vision . second , it is important to understand idea and concept because it 's the way for u to get the truth and concept . for example , after a stuent learned and understand the idea and concept , then they can use it to discover or create new stuff . i think that 's why we envent lost of new thing like car and plain to make our life easier . so i believe that understand idea and concept are more important for student . third , it is more important for student to understand the idea and concept because in this way , student start to think , and become creative . they can use their imagination to creat new idea and conceptes , and their imagination is not limited by the fact . it 's a good way to encourage student to search , think and find the answer they want . so it is not that important to let the student learn the fact . in conclusion , i believe that it is more important for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact . because in this way student can imagine and think freely , and creat new thing that 's unique . and it 's good for u to find the truth and real fact .
