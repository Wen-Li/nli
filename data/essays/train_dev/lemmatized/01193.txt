people are thinking about their future or what they are going to do when they are still young or old . some people think that older people can enjoy life more than young people . because they have lot of time for lesures . but i do n't think so . i agree with the statement `` young people enjoy life more than older people do . '' . there are some reason i agree with this statement . first , literally young people are young . that mean they have time to do their work , have fun within the life they got . actually they have to earn the money for the future , study for their college and so on . in the united states , people work since they are 16 year old typically and they earn their own poketmoney . young people can do whatever they want . but the older people ca n't . because they are too old to do fun thing in the world . the body get really slow , sick and lazy . they might have just little energy to do it even if they have lot of free time or money . secondly , most of young people are open-minded . that doe n't mean older people are close-minded . in my case , if i want to do something , i would do whatever i want . i do n't think about advantage of that or disadvantage . i just enjoy what i get to do . people like to do stuff what they like . and young people can try anything . but for older people they have lot of limit for that . for example , they are not able to climb up to the mountain a lot or go swimming , get drunk , ride fun ride at the fair and so on . third reason is that they know a lot of thing than older people . the world is changing constantly . sometimes new thing are coming up and sometimes old thing are being thrown away from our society . so i am saying that young people can get a lot of information about that and get to know and have fun with it . actually i like to do something new with my friend . that make me challenge for that and eventually have fun . young people do n't fear about the new thing . and they can accept well than older people . since i am young , i understand i can do anything whatever i want . young people have dream , thought , goal . but i think the most thing we have to do is to have fun in our life because we are still young and have lot of time to do other stuff , open-minded and we know lot of thing coming up recently and enjoy it . so i agree with the statement `` young people enjoy life more than older people do . '' . there are a lot of thing to have fun in our life . i do n't want to miss it and we can have fun than older people do .
