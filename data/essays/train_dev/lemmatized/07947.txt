it is generally agreed that the younth enjoys life more than the older generation doe . however , i will explain why i am not a strong advocate of this belief . firstly , most student have a lot of work to do for their study . as a student in an engineering school , i have to work a lot in order to pas my exam . i donot have too much time to spend with my friend . my parent have more time to invite friend and to attend to cultural event . i am looking forward to having a much free time a they do . a lot of retired people are in a good shape and are travelling a lot to discover the world . i am personally convinced that many of them are enjoying life more than i do . it should also bear in mind that when we have a job in a company , we are independant and it is for me a top priority . we have the opportuny to spend our money a we wish . we can set up a family and spend a nice time with our child . i woud really appreciate to bring up my chidren and to do my best to enable them to be well educated . i know that before this , i will have to work very hard to be allowed to go to the universty of my dream . above all , it should not be brushed under the carpet that many young people suffer from the lack of assistance . some of them even commit suicide . also , some teenager have to face drug problem that have tremendous effect on their health . i think that much remains to be done to decrease the rate of these dramatic addiction . to conclude , i back that young people do not always enjoy life a much a the older generation d. i think that authority should focus more on the way to help more the younth .
