this is a conversial issue about it is better that learn different aspect than to specialize in one specific subject . depengding on personal experience , personality type and emotional concern . we may find that some people hold the idea about learn broad knowleg ; on the other hand , some people might choose learning in one specific subject . the answer , nevertheless , is not easy to make , with all aspect carefully considered , i deem that former one is more reasonable . the essential reason that why i agree with the above statement is that learning different subject will make people have more experience when he ii in the trouble . a good case in point is the affair happened in my hometown last year . some student in my hometown decided to have a trip in desert , before they went , they prepared all the thing . however , they met the problem in the second day , a girl wa sick because the bad enviroment , the madicine they took is useless . when everybody did not know what to do , a boy who study botany used the mothed he studied in the extra class to save the girl . so , learning extra subjuct is a sensible choice . another reason can be seen by every one is that learning broad konwledge will make people know more friend . take different class will let you know more classmate , and it is important that the friend will help you when you be in trouble . the case is not isolate , it is typical of donzens i have heard . althought different view about this topic is exist , i still vote for learning broad knowledge . although the merit of learning one specific subject is recognized , it is evident that the drawback is far outweigh them . learning one subject will make people boring sometimes , it is not good for people that always think one aspect . so , with the evidence offer , i will choose learning different subject a my opinion . judging from all evidence offered , we can draw the conclusion that have extra knowledge will be good at both experience and making friend . so , to be frank , i strongly commit the notion that studing broad of many acsdemic , but not only one subject .
