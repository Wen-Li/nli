sucess also contains risk . .. why that is so ? the example is straightforward sucess requires optimal condition . although there may be a number prerequisets for it , in this brief paper , i will discus two of them . .. one of them is effort and it inevitably contains risk . in order to become a successful academician one should work really hard . in a simplistic manner , he or she should spend lot of time for her or his study . this might automatically , risk the family life of that person since she or he would not have enough time for the family member . there could be ceratin risk such a argument about unfinished duty of that person . even though it is an interpersonal level of analysis , it is clear that this situation requires certain adaptation for everyone . the student for instance have to learn effective working strategy in a more limitted time . it is certainly something different and new ( a compared to the day of le responsibility , for instance ) . one other important prerequiset is being innovative . remember the scientist who were killed because of their ` new ' idea . a person who would like to be innovative should accept the risk . .. an academician for whose idea doe not suit with the convention of the department he or she work for , might be an example . however , she or he should take such risk and show other faculty member that the ` old way ' or ` old idea ' should be given up . if this innovative approach would work ( say that other faculty member agree ) the person would be successful but there is always the risk of disapproval . .. one could avoid certain accident if she lie on the bed all day , do not do anything at home and let the time go . but you miss a life . .. the logic is same . .. if you do not care being successful , you do not take any risk and always follow the old way . .. but then you miss a chance . ..
