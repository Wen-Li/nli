i disagree with the statement that it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subject than to specialize in one specific subject . i disagree this because half knowledge is always harmful . the primary reason why i prefer specialization in one specific subject is specialization give you indepth study of the subject which could be very useful in the real time application . for example a computer engineer can not be an efficient cardiologist . this may effect the heart patient . another reason for specializing in one subjet is you can discover new thing after going across insight information of the subject . most of the discovery have been made by the scientist only after specializing in one subject . that is after conducting repeated experiment on one thing . thirdly , specialization improves creativity in a person . in every field specialization is the essential component . however it is better to have some knowledge of many academic subject and that is why when you come from graduation to post graduation then to phd , you are supposed to take specialized subject . therefore based on the specialization student are classified a computer engineer , electronic engineer , doctor and so on . in conclusion , i strongly recommend that specialization in one subject is better than having broad knowledge on many academic subject .
