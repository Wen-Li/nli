i personally believe that experience and practice is what make a person perfect , according to the proverb `` practice make perfect . '' one need to have some sort of experience in an area to be successful ; for example a previous mistake or a wrong decision that ha been made . to begin with , i would like to give an example of my personal experience . in the summer of the year 2007 , i had dislocated my knee during a physical education class at school . we were playing kickball and it wa my turn to kick the ball and run . due to the slippery floor of the court , i had slipped and almost broke my left leg . it took me a large amount of time to start walking , running and even sitting again , and the doctor had forbidden me from playing any sort of sport again , a there wa a big risk that the same accident would happen again . however , i did not listen to the word of the doctor and started playing basketball , my favorite sport , a soon a i wa able to run again . i even joined the varsity girls basketball team of my school . now the season is over , and i am glad that i took the risk . however , if i hurt myself again , i would never regret what i did , because i would take a lesson out of it : not to disobey my parent and my doctor again . another example of taking risk and trying new thing would be joining the chess club of my school . i had never played chess in my entire life , but a soon a i joined the club , my knowledge of logical thinking ha flourished . i enjoy playing the game , even outside of the club , and i am proud that i took the risk and joined the club , even though i wa nervous and shy at the beginning . some people tend to hate seafood , while others can not live without it . i believe this is a matter of choice and sometimes a matter of experience . disregarding people who have allergy , an ordinary human being would enjoy eating something if they were raised eating it . i am a seafood fanatic , and therefore adore eating japanese food . sushi , the most common type , is something i eat every week . some of my friend , however , highly dislike sushi . my best friend at school had never tried eating sushi in her life , but she told me about her hunger for seafood several time . therefore , i took her to a japanese restaurant once , trying to convince her to eat sushi . she did not want to eat it at first , however when she tried it , she absolutely loved it . now , every week me and her go to our favorite destination , the japanese restaurant . experience is something that happens once in a life time , and can be used numerous time for different thing . i believe that trying new thing and taking risk , such a visiting different country and riding the fast train in an amusement park , will expand a person 's overall knowledge and turn them to an open-minded person .
