the the best way to travel doe not ha to be in a group with a specific tour guide . i have visited many country with my family and very few of them had been with a tour guide , most of the time , we do research on the country we are going to visit and prefer to get a much information about the touristic place a we can . and we plan our own tour a a family , if we want to make a stop or stay more time in a specific place , we can do it , but we would not be able to do this if we were traveling a a group because we have already a schedule . which we have to respect due to the rest of people we are traveling with . we have also traveled with a group , with friend of the entire family , it is a lot of fun because we share lot of great moment , but even tough , we do not travel with a tour guide , we also plan our own tour before the trip . six year ago , we took a trip to vail colorado with another family , great friend of ours . in total we were 10 people , five from my family and five from their family . we went skying at the vail mountain , even tough my parent , my brother and i had already skyied , this wa a new experience . we enjoyed it that much that i can dare to say that it ha been the best trip ever , we got the opportunity to share with the other family a well a we shared with ours . we had such a great time that we made another trip together . this exciting trip made me sure that the best trip are not necessarily with a guide tour by your side .
