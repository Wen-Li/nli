it is normally for people to grow , and while growing , we 'll have a little bit of everything , happiness , enjoyment , sadness and depression . ofcourse , every single stage ha it own nice moment . but this concept change from time to time . for me , i think that young people enjoy alot more than what older people might do . for many reason , the hardness of life will auscalate while being old because there will be many factor interfer with aging process . one thing is that , the duty for young people will be much lesser than those of older one . all what young people ha to do is going to the universtity , which is considered a source of pleasure , and all what he ha to do is passing it . here , he can do alot of thing to make him happy . he can meet different people every single day , he can have his own group to spend nice time with , he can go to different place while being with that group , and he can enjoy being in an intimate relation by having a girlfriend with whome he can spend great time with le commitment . while , on the other hand , if we think about the older man who is supporrting that young man , we 'll find alot of thing to consider . he ha to save money for his son 's university , he ha to manage the situation of the whole home inwhich there will be other brother and sister , and he ha to keep managing for the wholy marriage life he is having . also , in older people , they will start thinking about some issue arised later in life like retirment and loosing significant others . finally , every single stage of life can have it is own source of happiness and sadness . but being young will mean le duty with much fun .
