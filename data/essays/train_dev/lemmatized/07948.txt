are young people happier than older one ? i think that this statement is the sad reality . we 'll quickly see the argument on the paper firstly , young people have much more occasion to make new friend than old people . if you go out every week , if you 're invited at your friend ' place twice a week , your chance to meet new people are amazingly high . the truth is that you only can and want to have this kind of life when you 're relatively young besides a a young personn you are not a involved in your family life a your parent might be . you can spend the time you want with the people you really care about without thinking about the duty you need to do back home . studying abroad is an opportunity you ca n't miss . with the increase of link between the earth nation it ha became easier to study abroad than before . as a result , today student have much more chance to go in a foreign country than their parent had . proof of this point the increasing student demand for the erasmus program and the strong relationship that university maintain together . last but not least , old people have to work and secure an income to make sure that their family could live safely . it 's not the case when dealing with young people that can do whatever they want a long a they are good at school at the end . a young guy can relax a much a he want . he even can leave school if he doe n't like it . an adult can not afford it . he can not chill out because someone is counting on him : the young personn . to conclude , i would like to say that we mu n't be blind , there are too many argument in favour of the point supported in the paper and so few for the opposite point that the answer should be obvious . life is better when you are young .
