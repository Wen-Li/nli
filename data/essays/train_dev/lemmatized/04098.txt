students are too often required , by unskilled teacher , to learn pure and simple data instead of developing the ability to understand wider concept and idea . before going on , i 'd like here to make a distinction between `` data '' and `` concept '' . a data is something we could learn by heart , that could be simply memorized , for example by reading and often easy to forget . a concept , instead , is something complex and something that usually , once acquired , is almost impossible to abandon . with concept it work more or le in the same way than with experience : usually , old people state that `` life is the best teacher '' and sometimes they 're right . life , with all it amount of experience , teach u how to react , how to behave and sometimes the direct experience we make will be recorded in our mind forever , certainily in a more unforgettable way that the information we received at school . in my opinion , so , concept and experience have the same value , or better , experience can help in understanding wider concept and viceversa . the study of concept , if done in a certain way , could help student in building a system of idea of their own : it 's realy important , infact , to be able to start independently from one subject and to arrive to another , showing a flexible mind and the capability to develop an autonomous way of thinking ; simple data alone , instead , are not sufficient in order to learn how to link the information student get and how to build an integrated information system . to conclude , it would be very useful for school to develop an integrated educative system , expecially in italy that normally lack of practical aspect , which could coniugate practical experience with the study of concept . the idea of a common core curriculum and of different subject ( for istance literature in a scence faculty ) which could enrich one 's general knwledge , would be a good method to be implemented . .
