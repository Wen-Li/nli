i am totally agree with this statement . no matter successful people or normal people , they all need to try new thing and take risk . if they only do what they already know , they are learning nothing . successful people try new thing an take risk are the best thing that they need to do . for example , a animal professior who discover medicine for human . if they only make the medicine that we all already know and already have , so this is not called discover and they are no longer needed . of course they need to find out new medicine and it take risk because they test animal . another example is student who are successful in study . why are they successful ? the reason is they already try new thing such a read a lot of different book and communicate with teacher . the risky thing is taking extra exam that are not required . if student do not read a lot of book and evaluate themselves , how can they be successful student ? they will stay the same without study new thing . they can not only study what they know well . otherwise , they can not open-minded . for me , i have a personal story about this topic . i am trying new thing an also taking risk . i came to america for study . i am trying to study new culture and language . i am not successful yet , but i am trying to be successful . also this is a risk for me because my parent can not afford me to study university in america . the tuition is too high . my parent have to take care of me and my brother . international student can not work off-campus . i could not find any job in-campus . this is a really big challenge for me to study abroad . therefore , i agree with statement .
