i partially agree with the statement that ' most advertisement make product seem much better than they really are ' . i think it is tough to clearly tell whether one absolutely agrees or disagrees . advertsements are one of the most important aspect of modern day business . with so much competition in every field and each idea superior to the other , good advertiment ha become absolutely mandatory . advertisements help a lot in increasing the customer 's awareness about a product . with so many product in the market these day , there is no way the manufacturer can reach the people without publicity . increased competetion can be cited a the most important reason behind an underlying exaggeration in all the ad today . if an advertisement is very modest , and explain the flaw a well the quality , would there be any taker for the product ? people have so much choice these day , the manufacturer ca n't afford to loose their present customer . they are always trying to increase their market share . advertisements have a deep impact on the consumer 's mind . he go to the market looking for a particular product keeping the advertisement in his mind . it is only the beneficial aspect of the product that draw him there . an example could be that of luxury car . all the ad emphasize on the increased space , better tyre , better suspension , etc . no one say any thing about the huge monthly installment that would go in to enjoy this luxury . but thinking from the consumer 's point of view , he will not even go to have a look at the car if the ad is not attractive , leave apart buy it . but , on the flipside , there are many ad that are very misleading too . like , the ad for weight reduction method . these manufacturer know that they have easy target in woman or young people in general . they publicize how someone lost a major chunk of his weight by consuming their pill . there is absolutely no mention of the side effect of these artificial method on the body , which may look healthy after losing fat , but can develop other disorder , like reduced in fertility in female , to cite one . most of the time manufactureres know their target . they cash in on the weak point of that target population . sometimes these can misguide the people and lead to irreversible loss to them . by the time the truth dawn on them , it already too late to react . to conclude , i would say that taking one stand on any one of the two extreme is not fair . the maufactures should be allowed a little liberty in making claim a long a they are not absolutely unjust or too exaggerated . but they not let go of their ethical responsibities , and should not go to the extent of causing harm to their consumer just to increase their profit .
