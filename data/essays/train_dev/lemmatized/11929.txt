from my personal experience the best way to travel is not by being led by a tour guide , it 's better to plan your own journey . it is true that it not an easy process , but you have much more benefit . for example , the money is a perfect factor to talk about . some agency often charge you to much money to organize your trip , and it could not be a god idea to loose all that money when you could save the 50 percent of what you spent . you have different stategies to find solution . for example , involving place to stay , such a hostel that you find in the internet that are cheper . the experience is one of the most important element of planning your own trip . the process of making your own desicions and going whear ever you want can become really fun . last summer i went to europe and went to spain , france and germany . i organized the hole trip , day by day and it becamed a real success . it is true that problem occured during the trip , but i think that those are part of the thing that creates the adventure of the experience . another factor is that most agency already have the city in wich they are going to travell , so you do n't have many choice to explore . on the other hand , the liberty of my schedule gave me the oportunity of even going to england for just a couple of day and in a short notice . the schedule is led by you and not by anyone else , giving you the liberty in a place whear you had never gone to . there is no better feeling than being in a huge place were time is not a factor and liberty is taken . in a sense you feel so small and alone in a enormous continent but ironicly you become stronger and bigger a all the experience satisfy your expectation . so in general i think that backpagging is an experience that every human being must have in his life . there is adventure , clueless bahaviours and surprise that a tour guide could not offer you .
