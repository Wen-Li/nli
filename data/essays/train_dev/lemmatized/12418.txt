i disagreee this statement . because , i think it depends on people . i take one example and approach this problem . now i live in tokyo with my grand mother . her name is kazuko . she is 68 year old . usually over 60 are rentnerin and have no work . but she is still worker . she work in drug store . every day she get up early and leaf house . and she go back to home late . i thougt that hard working is difficult for her . so i asked her `` such a hard working is difficult is n't you ? '' `` no , it is enjoyable !! '' she said . i wa surprised to hear that . she continued . `` once i retired . but then i wa at a loss what should i do . and i had a boring life . after that i determined i work again !! '' generally speaking i think a lot of people assume `` young people enjoy life more than older people do '' . but strictry speaking , it is nonsense . thinking `` young people enjoy life more than older people do '' is neglect to older people , i think !! now i 'm second grade university student and major in english literature . when i wa a freshman , i majored in gerrman literature . it wa boring for me.so theni did n't enjoy life . but i decided changing my major and could achieve this desire . so now i am enjoying my daily life !! conclusion state that `` enjoying life '' doe n't matter age !! thank you !! that 's all !!
