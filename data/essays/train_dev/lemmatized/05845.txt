i disagree because traviling with a group led by a tour guide is a bad idea for my thinking . first when someone is travilng with a group led by a tour guide , it make him or her being controlled , so he or she ca n't have the ability to move freelly . for example , if someone need to go to the restroom , every one should wite for that person until he or she finish . and also if someone doe n't like the place or ha been to the place that group are going to , he or she should go with the group . the second reason is that travilng with a group could be unhealthy in someone 's health . when someone travel with a group , he or she may have healthy problem that could transfear to someone in the group . for example , if someone ha inflo , it can transfear ( go ) to someone in the group easlly . the third reason that when someone is traviling with a group the travel based on a plan . when a group travel , it ha a ready plan . so , when someone want to change his mind about a place , he ca n't change the plan he should go with the plan or leave the group after paying some money . for example , if someone change his mind about visitng a musume with the group , he ca n't change the plan from visiting the musume to visit the zoo . so he should go with the group by rhe plan or leave the group after paying some money . all in all , a you see , traviling with a group is a bad idea because of the ability of moving , the health and changing the mind . i think when someone want to travel , he or she should go by themselvs .
