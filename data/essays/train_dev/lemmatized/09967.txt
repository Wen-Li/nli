nowadays , some successful people usually try new thing and take risk rather than only doing what they already know how to do well . in my opinion , i totally agree with this point , and it is a good thing . following my discussion , you will see the reason . firstly , successful people should try to new thing , because it is a big chanllenge for them . although successful people already success , they sometimes need a bigger chanllenge and it will make them got a lot of good feeling , then they can continue to more successful step . secondly , it is ability that should to learn for successful people . today , following technology and science 's development , more and more people succed , absolutely , it is very good thing for this time , but successful people should try new thing and take risk and they should n't stop to the one thing . because a a successful people , they also have many stress in their life , so they should learn lot of ability and knowlege that they can not be lost by this world , otherwise , maybe one day , they will become a common person from a successful people . finally , take risk and try new thing is a very helpful and useful thing for successful people . it is really ture that they should try it . in conclusion , successful people try new thing and take risk rather than doing what they already know how to do well is a good thing .
