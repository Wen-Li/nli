i agree with this statement . advertisement only state the advantage of product . if the product have bad point , we ca n't notice it , because advertisement can hide the problem of product . there are many advertisement in our life , for example firstfood restrants , newspaper , magazine and so on . advertizements appeal the many good point of product to attract customer . if the product do n't have any advertizement , customer ca n't notice the existance of product even if product are new one , customer may be not able to recognize it . it is the big problem for the seller to sell the product a lot , so advertizement really affect the product to seem much better than they are . advertizements appeal the good point strongly , so they do n't state the bad point , even if the product have problem . many customer often see the good point of the product when they buy something , so they do n't take care for the bad point . therefore , if rthe company appeal the product with advertizement , customer ca n't notice the problem more , and customer think that the problem seem much better than they really are . advertisements really affect the product to be seen much better than the real . in conclusion , advertisement are the good factor to make the product seem much better than really are , because they can appeal the good point of the product , even if they do n't have . also , they can remove the bad point of product when they state , even if the product have issue . therefore , advertisement make product seem much better than they reall are .
