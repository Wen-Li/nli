most of people sort some bias aganist traveling , some consider it is more fun to travel alone , but other choose to traval in agroup led by a tour guide . in my opinion i would prefere to travel in a group led supported by a tour guide for the following reason . first , when you travel for a trip or a journey abroad and you do not know anything about that countrey , so it will be very hard for you to figure out the most intersting place in that country beause you do not have any a tour guide , who can help you alot to save your time and to enjoy the most beautiful place around . i think a tour guide can assist in that matter , since he is more experience about the place and he have more information that can help you to understand certain thing in any place or any country you go . second , it is very hard for anyone who doe not speak a certain kind of lanaugae , for example if u want to go india and you dont speak indian what you can do in that situation , because not everyone speak english , therfore you should have a tour guide who can speak indian , who will help you in anything you need . third , the soule of the group is very good thing . they give you accompany in your trip and make it easy if the trip take long time , you can share story with each other and you can have a really a great time . a tour guide can make the trip more orgnised and in that matter you can save time , so you can spend it in another thing . in concusion , i agree with that statement because the group led and the tour guide really can make it different if you want to make your travel alone
