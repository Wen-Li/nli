in my opinion idea and fact are both importants and linked by a relationship of cause - effect . the fact is a description of what some people thought and they have had the power to traslate an idea in an action . when i wa attending the high school , i remember i told my mother that the school gave u just some information about the fact that ha happened and not the possibility to understand new idea . for example , in my opinion , the history ha two interpretation : some people think that it is useful to learn fact , while other think that beginning from the past fact , you can understand the present history . the history is like a circle , sometimes it repeat the same situation , the same mistake , the same fact . to learn fact is the better way to understand the idea , and honestly i scared about the people who ha got the idea without knowing the fact or without giving to them the right relevance . so the fact is important to understand the situation and to analyse which is the best idea to use in that moment . it 's true that the analyse of fact is useful to start thinking and it permit to stimulate more the brain of the student , with discussion with the teacher . i hope that in the school there will be during the history class ( or other subject ) , the time to discus why some fact happened .
