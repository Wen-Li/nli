would you like to study broad knowledge of many academic subject or to specialize in one specific subject ? i believe different people have different answer . however , i prefer to study broad knowledge for several reason below . first , in fact , many student do not konw what they are really interested in . as we know , nowadays , many student have a same problem that they do not like their major . why dose this problem happen ? i believe that it is resulted from that they are not interested in their major . if they can study broad knowledge of many academic subject , they would find out that what they are really interested in . this is very important . actually , i have this problem , too . my major is material science . and i can not study other subject in my university . however , i do not like my major , because i can not find out any interesting thing from this major . every day i have to do experiment in my lab , which is boring . in fact , i want to learn some subject that i could communicate with other people . i believe if i have another choice , i would not choose this major again . as a result , i choose another major when i study for my mater degree now . second , in modern society , most of job require student have many skill , instead of a certain skill . as we know , when people work in a company , he ha to know how to use computer , because today most of work are finished on computer , and the communication with other thoughout emails or msn also need to be done on computer . if this person only know about his major , such mathmetic , art , or something else , i do not believe that he would have a capability for this work . that is to say , he would be fired in future . i believe this is a pity for our education in universites . consequently , we should learn broad knowledge of many academic subject to fillful the various requirement of many job . if we have kind of knowledge , we could do many job in a company , and we have more chance to get promotoed . for example , if we learn knowledge about engeering and management in university , we could apply for two type of job in a company , which would be very useful for our career in the future . however , to learn broad knowledge of many academic subject doe mean that it is unnecessary to specialize in one specific subject . what i mean is that we should also be professional expert , because when we face with some difficulty in our work , we must have academic knowledge to address them . this is of great essence to u . in sum , we should learn broad knowledge in the first place , and then we also have to specialize in one specific subject .
