i think that this is a mainly key point in the new economic society ; but it 's very hard to conclude a general idea about to how to have a success . in this case the question is very limited , and reguarded only the complete or uncomplete people knowleadge background for the own of success . in my opinion is impossible that the people can arrive to success only with hit knowleadge , but in necessary a mix of the various elemaents that make it possible this ; is more possible that one people that ha n't particular knowleadge , eccept the economics skill , find the success than one very knowleadge people without any skill in the economic world . but is also true that the knowleadge consist in a principal help for the aim of the success . for the first a successful people must be tend to the risk , because without the risk ca n't have what do you want ; the risk is proportionated to the result that can be have if the new thing that finish in a good result . obvious this is n't mean that for have the success is sufficent take some risk , because this can have dramatically consequence complete contrary to the success , in ther word this is mean lose all thigs . for the good final result the risk must be using with knowleadge about how and when the risk is possible to use . infact is necessary know when one risk can be have or no in relatioship to the thik that it is related . in conclusion i ca n't exaplain a correct answer for the question , but only my opinion that is not determinated but is a mixing about some thing ; this because the thing is very soggettive and must be analized in each case .
