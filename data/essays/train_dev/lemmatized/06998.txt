there are a lot of people , most of them young people , who say that young people enjoy life more than older people do , but is it truth ? well , to be honest i agree . i think young people enjoy life a lot more that older people do for the following reason . in first place , young people are experimenting everything that older people already did . they have more energy and fisically they are able to do , what sometimes older people ca n't do . older people is most of the time tired or in bad mud and they do n't want to do anything . i 'm not saying that all of them are like that but most of them sometimes become angry people and they live their life so . instead young people is ancious to live their life and to have the experience older people had . for example , i 'm a young person and i think i have such much more fun than my parent do ! it is obviuos . that 's because they have a lot of responsabilities and a lot of thing to worry about . but for me is a lot different , because i do n't have kid , i do n't have to work and i do n't have to worry about anything , but the school and doing my homework . i can do a lot of thing they ca n't , for example i can watch tv on the afternoon all the time i like but my parent have to go to work so they ca n't or i can go out on the weekend with my friend but some time it 's impossible for my parent to go out with their friend . and i think that all these thing make that some person become like that . of course with all those thing they ca n't enjoy life like young people do . so that , these maybe some of the reason why people say that and in my opinion it 's truth .
