it is more important for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact . i agree with the following statement . students are young and generally do not enought experience for their life . they do not responsibility for their life and they are generally very busy on their life . thats why , there are many reason for my support idea . firstly , they are young and they have not done enought experience for their life . i am a faculty at the dokuz eylul university in izmir , in turkey for seven year . i have studied a lot of student . in my experinces , they understand and believe idea and concept because they are so young for life and they have not done anythings . secondly , almost all student are very busy . they learn a lot of thing . they have studied on their life such a homework , listening , reading , speaking and writing . however they have not had any experinces such a earning life , earning money , doing help anybody etc . actually i do n't know another country but at least , in turkey is this . our curriculum teach generally good math , geography , history , biology or anything but it doe n't teach life knowledge , this is big mistake and turkis educational system and it curriculum ha to be change . finally , they don ' have enought responsiblity . in my view , this is educational system 's problem . for instance , in turkey almost all student go to secondary school and high school . they study and they do homework . neverthless , usullally they do n't do any home made . in my opinium , if we succed for new generation , we have to learn life 's fact and we have to give more responsibility . we have to change our traditional educational system . they have learn life , world , and world 's problem such a war , peace , environment , conflict and etc . because , tomorrow life for them .
