i strongly agree that successful people try new thing and take risk . there are so many thing that make people successful , but taking risk and trying new thing are the most important part of being successful in my own opinion . the main reason is that there are plenty of people who are very successful by taking risk in their life . in addition , the life ha become pretty flexible . therefore this flexibilty make people think differently . recently i have read an article regarding the life of ronald thrump who is very good at realestate business a everybody know . this article h affected me a lot , in other word this article ha left great impressure on my life . according to ronald thrump , if someone want be successful , he or she should take risk . also he belief that unless some risk are taken in this life , we can not be really successful a we want to be . there are so many succuessful people also who have become very successful by taking risk , trying new thing , working on different field which made them become very successful . therefore i strongly believe that taking some risk will bring succeed . day by day the world is becoming smaller . in other word , the world ha become such a small town a some expert people say . this situation make this life more flexible a well . as a direct result of this flexibty , people work on very different and new area . some people who take advantage of these new area , who benefit properly from these area become very successful . this is why , people who want be successful should observe new area and invest on these area a well . twenty year ago 's opportunity were much more different than today . we should consider new area , new thing , if we reallly want to be successful in conclusion , a the time pass , we should think according to need of time . the life is really pretty short and in this short life some who take risk properly are successful . at least , i find them very successful .
