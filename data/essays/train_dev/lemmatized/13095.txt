travelling implies discovery . i have myself travelled a lot to different continent , i have however never been in a group directed by a guide . the good point of having a guide is that everything you look at - the other type of architecture , the other culture , other rituels - are described and explained by the guide . from what people told me about it , i guess that going on trip with a guide is a more relaxing way to discover new habit than looking by yourself into book to try to understand what is all around you . nevertheless , the point of view you get is the one of only one person . as far a i am concerned , i prefer going to new place without a guide . i like getting to know the culture by myself . you take the time to discover . in consequence , you interfer with the new culture and catch , understand the habit of the people around you . it 's a more personal approach to the culture . this point brings my second thought on the subject : i prefer travelling with a friend rather than with a group . travelling with a group mean that you follow timetable . you do not see what you necessarily would have liked to see . most of all you remain with people who have the same culture . as a conclusion , my conception of travelling mean that you should enter another world . i come from paris and lived in india for three month with two friend working in hospital . we dressed with the clothes everyone wore , so that people thought at one pointthat we had been living in india for a long time . the experienced and time spent with people implies that we were three and not a group of fifteen people . we were no tourist somehow but observer , discoverer , walking , eating with the people who live there .
