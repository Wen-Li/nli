today are many the possibility to do something to help the community and the society in wich we live . many are the centre organized to give an help to people with different type of problem . at the same time , nowadays , are many the possibility for young people to partecipate at this type of work , trought the civil assistance or volontary work , in wich a person decided to give a part of his time to the community . i am desagree with people that said that young people of today do not give enough time to helping their community . on the contrary , i think that today young people are more responsable , and that have a mayor interest in social problem , problem that can refers to people with particoular phisical and mental problem , but also toward situation that refers to the environment and nature . maby is different the approch of a young people , in spite of an adult , toward these problem . a young person ha more dream and aspectation than an adult person , and many time he try to explain these aspectation with new strange alternative way , that often are not understand from everybody . .. the younger ha the necessity to go on the street and across the square to express his disase and his fantasy to change the world . is true that , many time , on the real side , he doe nothing , but i think that is something . an aspect that maby ha the necessity to be renforced is try to convince young people that several time are more important fact than word and that there is the necessity to do something of more important than to go across the square to shout what is important to do . ..
