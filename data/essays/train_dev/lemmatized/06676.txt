i disagree with this statement . i believe that there is a better chance in having a successful career for a person when that person specializes in one specific subject rather than having broad knowledge of many academic field . as i write this essay , i would like to explain to the reader why specializing in a certain field is a good idea . eventhough it is important to have wide range of knowledge , it would be pointless if you do not know how to use them wisely . your knowledge from different field could spread out all over the place and lead you to nothing . that is the last thing you would like it to happen . for example , learning different kind of language . you know basic greeting and could understand typical everyday conversation in five different language might make you feel smart . however , you would not be able to do businness in those language because you do not have enough knowledge of that language . in other word , you can not have a carreer using those knowledge . in conclusion , i would like to strongly state that to be specialized in one specific subject would help lead you to have a successful carreer . in other word , a brighter future . the more knowledge you have , the better . however , the important point here is how you are going to use that knowledge in your life .
