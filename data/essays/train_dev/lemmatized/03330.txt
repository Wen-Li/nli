some people believe that it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subject whereas others support to specialize in one subject . in my opinion , notwithstanding a person should have knowledge of all related academic subject , to specialize in one specific subject is most appropriate in compliance with this century . we are living in a century in which it is easy for everyone to reach information about nearly anything at anytime they wish . however this knowledge is generally too surface based . therefore the level of knowledge determines the difference between an academic person and non-academic person . to specialize in one academic subject prevents a person from spreading his energy , effort and time to too many thing at the same time and help to contrate on that one subject whereas broad knowledge of many academic subject shall only result with a lot of unnecessary , unclear and ambiguos knowledge which end up with no contribution to academic at all . the area that agrees to specializaton ha been increased by the development of technology . science ha been seperated to much more branch than it wa fifty year ago . for example principle such a law and medicine encourages people to specialize in one specific subject since it is impossible to learn to a subject deeply with a surface based knowledge . thus , i believe that considering the easiness and quickness at reaching information , it is better to specialize in one specific subject in order to draw a difference between academic and non academic .
