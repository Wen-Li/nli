it seems difficult to choose one oppinion , becuse they are also have colorful life between the young people and the older people , but it doe not mean , they are similar to me . i would like to agree with the young people enjoy life more than older people do , if a personal quality is can considerated a criterion to choose thing . first of all , in nowadays , era of information , many of young people enjoy their life via the internet , even everything possiblly in the digital industy . for example , if a grandson of the older people live abroad , and the communication between the grandson and the grandfather is only via the telephone instead the internet online chatting what is cheaper than the international telephone call , but the older people can not use the internet even can not use computer . on the other condition , the young people can adapt anything quickly , so that they can migrate to another city for the different experience . most of older person can not accept the different enviroment and what they will eat in the different area , if the older person migrate to other city or country , they will be illness easiler . the important thing determine the young people enjoy life better is that they are educated in the signifcant era of information , so they are developed with the world development . for all mentioned above is why i agree with the staement that young people enjoy life more than older people do . now , i do strongly agree with the statement .
