i disagree with the statement that is best to travel in a group led by a tour guide . when you travel with group and guide there are only predetermined place you can go to , and also spend a precise amount of time in each activity . these are the main reason why i prefer to travel on my own . i think that if you travel by yourself , you are not subject to a specific schedule , also you can organize yourself in a more convenient way . sometimes you feel like staying in the hotel and rest or do something totally different than the rest of the group . also it can happen that you do not get a great and cheerful group of people and that can contribute to some tension among traveler . several year ago , i went to brazil in a tour with several friend , and ofcourse , we thought that having a tour guide would be the best thing to do . initially wa o.k. , but at the end became a nightmare because we wanted to do other thing that were not part of the guided tour routine . for example , we wanted to go to buzios , a small town with amazing beach and a lot of natural site to visit . unfortunately , and because the tour guide refused to take u there , we were not able to visit buzios . some night we also felt like going to different and more exiting place or stay longer at others , but , we were reminded of the policy in place . guided tour are very restrictive , and because of this and other experience i have had in the past , i believe that traveling on your own is the best move .
