the statement at issue is whether in a period of twenty year there will be le car in use than today . i disagree this statement and i 'll try to give some reason and example that will show why , for me , this is a wrong prediction . if we look at our world today , at our everyday 's life , we can see that people do not use bus or other kind of method to move . they prefer to use car . i give a personal example . when i 'm driving my car i often take a look to the other car to see how much people are in one car . the very fact is that in most of the case in one car there 's only one person driving ot . i mean , what a waste of energy , time and money ! giving this example i want to state that nowadys people using theirs car a the principle way of moving . and this , related to the question asked to me , it mean that i do n't think that only in twenty year person will learn to use bus or other way of moving that city and administration often offer to they to prevent pollution , traffic and other problem creating by the wrong using of car . i want to give another reason to my disagreement with the statement at stake . if we consider how much money doe the factory that make car spend in the making of spot and other communicational 's channel to make people buying their car we can say that is impossible to consider the fact that only in twenty year ther wiil be le car in use . i give this opinion to say that this method of moving difficultly will change in a short period . because it imply that person should learn to proctect his/her own enviromental , it imply that people should apprehend to ride a car carrying more than one person a time , so that we can learn to create le pollution and traffic . a final argumentation . i want to state also that industry and echonomic should stop provoking people to buy such a lot of car and give and try to find other way to let the people moving without create pollution and traffic . i t
