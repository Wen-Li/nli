do really the young people enjoy like more the life than older people do ? i do not think that would be the complete answer . at present , not all the young people enjoy the life more than older one . nowadays there is a huge development in new technology , such a electronics , giving u new item and facility such a cell phone , internet and worlwide communication that were out of mind when the older people were young . but this also , is the responsible of a more stressfull lifestyle in the actual youth . most of the time , these are the cause of the increasing number of young people that commit suicide and suffers depression . young people is still learning to live , but in a world totally different of the older man . today there is more competition for all , even for finding a job , now a man doe not have to compete against the others that live in the same city or region but if doe with the men around the world . this cause a more difficult stressfull situation in young people that derives in a le enjoyable life experience . sometimes the inexperience of young people in taking decision about their own life are stressfull situation , and sometimes they take this in the wrong way . the necessity to make all the thing faster and better that have the majority of young , act against them . the older people now take advantage of the advance in medicine than can increase their life quality , and in some case , to cure the illness known to commonly affect them . they , in opposition to young people are mature enough and have their life fully realized that make them available to have more enjoyable experience than some of the actual youth generation . i think that the way the young people can enjoy better the life than older people is by taking in account the advises and wisdom of old people . we have to remember the old people have already walked by the way the young one are barely trying to go throw .
