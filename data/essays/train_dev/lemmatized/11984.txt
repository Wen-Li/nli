from my point fo view , answering that question requires a previous one - what doe the word ` community ' involve to you ? . as far a i am concerned , that word is not affected by a lot of factor , by a number of meaning . .. any person will probably tell you that those who develop their normal life around you are your community . being religion the main - or most common - reason for that union , most of the time . as i see it , to find the honest , deep , vivid meaning of ` community ' you have to look much further . i would name a my ` community ' those people who affect my life in different aspect , who have the power to change my path one way or the other . those people with whom i live and learn everyday . my community and me are able to play a larger and more important part in one another 's life . i do not agree with the idea of young people not using their time to help their community . actually i believe that most of them do it everyday , by taking an active part in their own life and in the one of those who live with them . to exemplify my point i will add some case considered by me a some relevant way to help . a boy who spends his time explaning to a classmate a problem that will help him pas an important exam . a law student who ha to work everyday a hard a possible and study , she doe not have time for herself , however , she teach her niece english for free each weekend to help her pas , because that girl know her brother can not afford extra english class . in a nutshell , if those who agree with that statement consider young people to be selfish , i think they are completely wrong . what is more , they should take a moment to look around and to ask young people what are they doing , i am sure that they will prove them all wrong .
