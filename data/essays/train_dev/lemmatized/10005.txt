nowadays , there are many new thing appearing day by day , including some new techoniques , such a computer , internet and so on . sometimes we may think these new thing are just preparied for young people , because it is very hard for older people to be adapt to such thing . so , some people draw a conclusion that ` young people enjoy life more than older people do ' . as far a i am conserned , i totally disaree with this statement . there are several reason . firstly , some young people just are addicted to the ` new thing ' , such a computer game . they do n't know how to deal with such thing . and they do n't know how to benefit from these thing . on the other hand , the older people do know . once they get to know that something is useful for them , they can get involved in it and enjoy it . when i wa a undergrad , some of my classmate were addicted by a computer game , namely counter strike , when they play this game , they could forget to have food , forget to sleep . it did halm to their health , then how can we say that they were enjoying their life when playing such game ? however , hardly can we hear older people do the same thing . secondly , older people know more about life . maybe they do n't know many new thing , but they can understand every new thing . they can judge correctly whether those new thing are useful for them . they are able to enjoy every new thing for them . while usually , the young people can not do this . lastly , nowadays , many young men tend to be more selfish , more temptuous , more ill-tempered . thus , it is more difficult for them to share thing with others , to have good friend , to understand this society , this world . and these thing are the most important thing for our life . older people do it better . so , actually , older people enjoy life more than young peole . in summary , in modern day , although young men may know more news thing than older people , they do n't enjoy life more than older people .
