the question if it is better to have a broad knowledge of many academic subject rather than to specialize in one particular subject is not easy to answer . first of all many academic field need a specialisation to explore new development that broaden the understanding of the related research field . this are especially the human science were process become more and more complex and a particular researcher propably would not profit from knowledge in a field not related to his work . in contrast to that there are many academic field were a broaden understanding of different science can help you enormously , a many field are interacting each other . the whole world is involved in the globalization process , so new commitment between people , country or institution are made , that had no ealier contact . business manager have to face new partner belonging to an other culture , that could lead to misunderstanding , if the people do not have the related cultural skill . from my personal point of view , i appreciate to have a broad knowledge of different academic subject . studying european studies with a focus on political science , it is absolutely necessary to have skill in sociology to understand what society a well a part thereoff are thinking about various step of political integration on the european level . this also includes skill in european law , a you are not able to archive your political goal without knowing the particular law system , this applies at east on functional democrcies . additionally , my economic skill are important a without their functionability the whole system would collapse , so you always have to take different position of view into account , before making a particular decission from your own point of view . summarized i would say that it is dependent on your academic field to choose in favor or against a broad knowledge . on the one hand there are definitly expert needed to be sure that scientific process go on , but on the other hand in many different occassions a broader understanding of different academic field is useful to act securely in a world becoming more comprehensive .
