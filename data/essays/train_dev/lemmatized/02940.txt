this statement elucidates any sapient persin who is an avid reader into the nitty gritty of this topic . i do agree with the statement that young people enjoy life more than older people do . to buttress my support i like to quote that young people enjoy most of there time by partying and going to beach and so , but when it come to the case of older people they ca n't do it they will not be enjoying in beach and also they will not be partying . to further wox on my stand i like to give a pragmatic experience from my grandfather . on the other day my grand father told me that he used to enjoy a lot when he wa in his younger age than he wa now . he used to tell me to enjoy a lot and he told me that the younger age is the age that will not return again enjoy a much a it is possible . the other experience that my pedagogue told me when he encountered during his study is that , he ha done a research work on the style and pattern of the living of old people and the young people and he told that compared to the old people from his result the young people tends to enjoy a lot . on the other side i think it not only the enjoyment that come by partying or so is the only enjoyment , we should also consider the enjoyment from the side of a older people , they also ha their own enjoyment , the older person possibly after their retirement they used to sit and they enjoys by listening to the song and also reading some book mainly some devotional book , which the young people most of them are not interested . they also enjoy by having a tour to all the religious place and also they will be satisfied when their child become a good individual . finally i like to conclude , without any degressions from the topic that definitely older people enjoy but not to the extent that the younger people enjoy .
