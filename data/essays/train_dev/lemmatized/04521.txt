personally , i totally agree with this statement and strongly believe that people 's succcess is mostly based on their experience . perhaps , point of view would be easier to explain with some example . just look at the past . most of the scientist reached their goal because they always tried to try something new . reamain focusing in just what one know , it 's clearly a sign of the fear of trying something new and difference , and of course that kind of people is scared by not being enough or able to manage the new situation . if you have never tasted a new food , how could you know if you like it or not ? just with the knowlegment , it is possible to make clear decision , to have a complete view of the situation and to choose in a more liberal way . let 's take for example the role of a judge . how can a judge express his verdict without knowing what really happen ? it is not possible at all . the same rule is applicable to the ordinary life , where nowadays we are always tempting by something new - sometimes good , sometimes not . to make a sucessfull decision , in my opinion , the best way to act is to try and know everythings related with the topic , and then - just after this - to take a final decision . being an expertise in something , it 's absolutely a good value , but it is not enogh to be sucessfull .
