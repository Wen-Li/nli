the french education system put a premium on the theorycal knowledge , contrary to other education system which emphasis parctical knowledge . which of the two could be the best ? understand idea and concept is the base to be able to undersand the reality , the current event in the entire world . indeed , theorical knowledge and culture permit to be open minded , to analyse a situation with the nessary competence . for example , a brilliant manager ha to know a great variety of information to make the righ choice . moreover , france promotes the ` classes preparatoire '' , it is two year of hard work to integrate the best business school . to succed the exam , you have to learnt a great amount of concept : you have to study mathmatics , economics , philosophy , history . the goal of this learning is to give you kwonledge to cope with all type of situation , in every day life , at work . .. but on the other hand , to understand concept is no suficient . i think it is something very interresting and useful , but student have to learn fact too . for example , certain adult did not study long time when they were young and they succed in life because they used their practical competence and their work experience . so it is important for student to do training period for example . to conclude , i think these two type of learning are linked , so they have the same impotance for me because if student know many concept and they stay far from reality , it is a problem because in their future , for their career , both competence are required .
