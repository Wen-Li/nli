while some people believe most advertisement do not make product seem much better than they really are , l agree this statement.l think there are three important reason to support this idea . these are that to reach people is more esier and advertiser can show product diffirent with imitation and people do not have real information about product . as far a l know almost everybody ha one television or radio . they can get all news from television or radio . for instance l watch t.v almost every day at least two hour . if people watch the same thing constantly after long time they believe imitated material on screen . as a matter of fact television especially most effective tool. l beleive also that all people are not educated to evaluate all prose on television . they can accept all thing without thinking . another important reason is that l beleive advertiser get educational support to effect people . they take advantage of opportunity . they already have information how to influence people . for example people have some weakness such a emotion or dramatic . when we watch child who is carrying and listen to song so emotional backround we would like to do everythings . we feell that is our responsibility . last reason is that a a society do not like read book about . proof is amount of buying news paper , so advertiser can exaggate news for selling their product . we face to lack of the knowledge . if we have some information we can seperate which one is correct which one is wrong . because of these reason l support that vision can be changed by advertiser . however a a consumer we have to be more qualified . they depend on our life style . we have to spend time get rigth information .
