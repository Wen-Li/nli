i disagree with the fact that in twenty year time there will be fewer car in use than there are today . infact i believe that their number would have gone up ten time . cars have become the most basic and primary mode of transport in the world today . from the time they were introduced until now , their number have gone up exponentially and there ha been no decline in their sale . providing both riding comfort and safety , car have become the basic necessity for all and for some it ha evolved to become a fashion statement and an article of pride . people now a day , are in the false belief that the use of car might stop in future because the petroleum reserve are slowly getting exhausted . but what they fail to realise that petroleum is no longer the only source of power that can drive the vehicle . after year of research new technoligies have been devloped realising this danger hybrid car are already being produced and marketed . so are electrically driven car . however some researcher are working on using hydrogen a a fuel . sucess in this will be the biggest break through ever in the field of automobile engineering . hydrogen is available is abundance and it also ha a very high calorific value . thus capable of producing greater power than petrol driven vehicle . in addition to this the problem of pollution is also solved a , the only exhaust that would come out of a hydrogen driven vehicle would be water . twenty year is a lot of time and by then this technology would have not only been tested but would be driving the entire world . seeing the latest innovation in this field , car with better look and aerodynamics are being manufactured . in twenty year time concept car , which have already taken a start , would be in full production . our world is full of people who admire beauty , safety , comfort and most of all technology . thus making car not a curse of the past but refined gift for the future .
