young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their community . this is undoubtedly true and i would absolutely agree with it . today 's generation have become more hardworking and sincere towards their carrer . there is so much of competition that the young generation is just so busy preparing themselves for a better and more secure future . there is so much of competition that one doe not have the time and energy left to support their community . they find it very demanding to support their very own survival that they feel it will hamper their future if they invest time in supporting their community . one example i would like to mention here is that a friend of mine who use to be always busy supporting his community found that people started exploiting him and taking undue advatage of his goodness and kindness . he felt that he wa putting his future at stake if he would carry on helping his community and he wa not even sure that if tomorrow he would be in a problem whether somebody would be there in time when he would be in crisis . infact one day while he wa helping a member of his community , that member said this line `` god help those who help themselves '' . he told him son start helping yourself first by doing well in your academic and then help your community . that day he realised how far his friend had gone in life and how much of effort he will have to make to shape a good future for himself now . one really doe n't know what life lie 's ahead of him or her and to secure their future they concentrate on their work . that is why young people of today 's generation do not give enough time to helping their community .
