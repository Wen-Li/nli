a guided tour is always a preferd tour . a guided tour with a group is more fun , learning and longlasting . for example if you are travelling all alone to a historical monument with no background knowledge about the place . its a good a seeing the monument/place in book . if you are travell alone then thing will be not be of greatet interest . there might be moment that you want to discus with some one on a specific painting or architecture . this call for a tour in group rather then individual . a monument / painting speaks thousand word when you observe them but it can not listen to you . there are some point of the guided tour that make it more intresting . first , the intricacy of the depth of the knowledge of the guide about the importance of the place , which obvioiusly we a a tourist are not aware of . second , there are place that may not be listed or published in the map , magazine , book etc and there might be some local place that might be of intrest which the guide know . the third point is that in a group there are people with differnt ideology and thought . the inquisitiveness of any one in the group to know about some thing might prove to be useful for the entire group to learn more about the place . obviously a guide is the best one to answer such question . thus a best way to travel is a group , led by a tour guide . there is ofcourse , the other side of this where the guide might try to tell thing differently and might say wrong thing about the place . the guide might be prejudiced about some of the historiacl view and opinion . these are factor that depends on the type of guide you choose . if there is good guide with good reputation then it is always advantageous to hire him for a guided tour . if you consider saving the guide charge by not hiring him then the money spent on coming to the place may go in vain since you would have only visited the place but do not know any thing more about the place than what you have seen .
