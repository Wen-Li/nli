if the given statement is true closely depends on the carreer you are planning to realize . in my special case , i agree with the statement because i am striving to become a journalist in the area of science . of course , the abillity to write scientific text is a crucial prerequisite to this kind of job but it will be also extraordinary helpful to have a broad spectrum of academic knowledge and insight if you are willing to get a scientific writer . therefore , i am studying molecular biotechnology which is characterized by it outstanding variety of subject in order to get a broad education . but many of my colleague are very dissatisfied with their education since they are not teached to accumulate special knowledge in a particular fiel . they fear that we have learned many important thing but are not able to cope with problem occuring in the work of a scientist . in other word , they do not feel capable of doing excellent research in a special topic . from their point of view , the given statement is not true . you may conclude that the best way to be educated is a compromise of both possibility . in my opinion dealing with a relatively broad spectrum of academic subject at the beginning of your study can be well combined with specialized study course after a few semester . there is still the advantage of getting an overview of different part of your subject and different part of science first . but after that you are still able to make up your mind and to choose the topic you will study in detail . for example , in the united states and in europe too , it is possible to make a bachelor degree and to go on with further study in order to achieve the master degree . therefore , after having received the bachelor degree student may consider to change their subject of study or to go ahead with much more study within the same field .
