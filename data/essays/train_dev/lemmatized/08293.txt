i think it is more important for a student to understand conceots and idea then to learn fact by heard . this is because of some simpel reason . it might be better for a student to learn fact , date and result because thats the teacher askes for . but in real life , this mean the life after school , the time you need to work for your money to survive , it is better to undestand thing . a person not able to understand what she or he is doing is not able to develop an idea to find mistake and eliminate them . a person who is able to do this would be much more succesful in her/his job , just because of being able to make the way of working more effective . in school this kind of understanding and finding solution on problem should be teached . another point of why a theme should be understood is because of fun . fun motivates to go on , to do more . for some persones it might be perfect to lern by haert , but most of them get bored . the more effective way is to support the wish of people to understand ( who deos not know the most frequently asked question of a child : `` why ? '' ) . while supporting this whish , by it is more easy to motivate someone for some topic even if it is a theme with a lot of fact . i my self support this fact absolutly . in school i had in 2 year two differnt teacher in physiks . the first one wa not realy motivated and asked u to work with the book and in exam we had to summarise what we have read . my second teacher wa round about the same age , but totally differnt . 1. he loved to teach and his method were much different . he did experiment and so on . the first teacher gave me 5 point ( max15 ) the second one is still my teacher and made me choose physiks a the subject i like to study , just by motivating me . the result were 15 point in the final exam . these two point show and my small story show why i think that it is really important to make student understands what they learn .
