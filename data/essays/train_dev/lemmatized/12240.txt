i do not agree with the this statement because younger and older people have different way to enjoy life . life is not about age whether is a young person or an older person , but instaed about symbolism of joy is a way of enlightment and reach happines . younger people might think or have the idea that they are only one to enjoy life , but at what cost . older people instaed , have the treasure of wisdom among knowleg , with a convination of lot of experince , they have the mature and most important quality , patience . i have seeing older people enjoying life more then yunger people , but also , come to a cost of good health . i have see many older people that enjoy life a if they have the hearth of a twenty year old person . to me , life enjoiment is long term learning experience that bring individual to understand the meaning of enjoyment of life . when one is young , one can think that they have the energy to impose them self to the world that they are indestructible and this might bring to a short end of life . a few year ago , i wa talking to an old friend , he told me one important thing that marked my life for good : `` the diable is not smart because is the diable , is because the diable is old '' ; is like the young or old wine , or like the age of the wiesky , whats it is better an 8 year old wiesky or an 24 year of aged in a barril , i would go for the 24 year old aged in a barril . for many thing , a child one learn patience by trying to create something maybe a small plaster figure or a carbing on wood , but a learning , it take time to develop and to evolbe . this is why it doe take time to go trough school first in kindergarten , then into elementary following to middle school , and high school and later college where education teach u that for anything to mature , it doe take time . and because of i beleive that one need to mature some how and reach and state of aging and would enjoy life a everyday should be , a joyful development . because of this many observation , i beleive that younger people would need time to evolbe and reach maturity to be able to enjoy life in a more passionate way .
