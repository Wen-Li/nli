i completely agree that youth now do n't give their community the time they need to improve because of several reason : most of the young people are studying , some of the people are working on two job , some young people do n't care about their community and only think of themselves . first , most of the young people are studying . so the do n't have time to work for their community . but in fact , they are helping their society by getting a good degree and being roll-models for their kid and raising the educational level in their community . second , some people have two job because of their financial need while some of them would like to work for their community but they just do n't have the time . as a metter of fact , they are helping the society by teaching the child and the other people not to give up in their life and to work very hard to improve theirselves . i remmember a saying that my father used to say to me which is `` no body will spoon feed you '' and just right now i truely understand the real meaning of it . another reason is that , some people only think of themselves and do n't pay any attention and care for any one else . these kind of people destroy the community be their selfishness while other people try to improve it . i think the best treatment for these people is to be advised by important people who have made a great improvement on the community . in conclusion , i think the three reason i 've written above are enough to illustrate that people do n't help their community because they do n't have the time not because they do n't have the desire to work for the community exept some sick people who should be treated .
