in today 's world , having a broad knowledge can defenitly help people in the society . they can apply for diver job , or they can even have two job , contrary to someone who is specialized in only one subject . but being specialized in only one subject mean that the person know his job perfectly , so he can have more chance to be hired for a specific kind of job . in my opinion , i think that having a broad knowledge is better than specializing in only one subject . we were spoken with my american civilisation teacher about that . is it better to do his master and to continue his doctorate on the same topic or we may change to show our skill ? that day i simply told him that knowledge is one of the most important thing in live , we use it at school , but we can use it to give help to some people , for example , in high school , or in middle class . we can also be a teacher . we can teach french and english for example . moreover , not only to help people but for also for u . we can proove to ourself that we can learn different subject , we can understand them , and finally be good at them . it can be seen a a way to be proud of ourself and having the feeling to be part of the society , a far a we are concerned by many point . however , having a broad knowledge mean studying and also learning a lot , so we can be tired because of it , and not share time with his friend , his family , going to the cinema . it look like having no fun , and to considering it that way , life can be boring . to conclude , i have tried to explain the reason why having a broad knowledge can be useful ( help , proud ) but we must consider that this point of view can be limited .
