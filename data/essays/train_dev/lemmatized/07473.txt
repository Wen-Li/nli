the statement `` succesfull people try new thing and take risk rather than only doing waht the already know how to do well. '' ha several example in the scientifique history that show that it is true . one of them is albert einstein , who had at the beginning of his professional live strong difficulty to find a suitable job . he ignored his friend who where arguing not to change his job and went to an university in berlin where he developed the theory of the relative time . another example ( where the meaning of successful is different ) are the attempt to kill hittler during the second world war . these people knew how to survive in the nazi society , but they took the risk of being killed because they believed in what they did . from the point of view we have today they where succesful . another side of the same medal is the recent economy . the value of the firm only depends on the their success at the stock fair . as result the manager are trained to push these course and they do n't care about there employee ( it 's not a risky behaviour , because everyone doe ) . in this case success is a question of the definition . but there is another way to success too . doing continiously the work you know how to do well will give you a smaller but steady flow of success . because people can rely on you it will have an positive influence on your work . my personal way to success is a combination of personal and professional success . at the one hand you must have the possibility to have i.g. a family . that 's why you need professional success , with risky decision that will you allow to earn more money . on the other hand personel success is never a result of risk .
