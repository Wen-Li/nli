knowledege is something which we gain everyday . thus it should include learning of various subject equally but not speacializing in one of them only . according to me speacializing in a single subject is not always useful because of various reason . firstly , it is not helpful in certain difficult situation where knowledge about the specific thing is required . for example incase of short circuit it is important for the person to know what step to take . for this the knowledge of physic is required , it is similar in the case of bleeding or any other physical injury , the basic knowledge in first aid , learnt in human science is required . hence in practical sense knowledge of various subject is of great importance . secondly , it is more demanding in these mordern day . people are not really sure of being successful in a particular feild hence it is always safe to have equal knowledge about evrything a it will enable u to take up any proffession in futre . as according to famous economist gunnar myrdal `` education should be such that it should generate employment in any feild taken up by the educated . '' thus broad knowledge ensures employment oppurtunities at a better rate a compared to knowledge gained in a specific feild . thirdly , knowledge about a variety of subject would not bore the person but it will make it interesting for him a he will concentrate on different subject rather than a single one . fourthly , even quiz competition lay emphasis on equal learning of all the subject . the question asked in such competition are related to different subject . hence even in knowledge testing and gaining competition like the quiz competition show that broad knowledge is better a compare to speacialized knowledge in a specific subject .
