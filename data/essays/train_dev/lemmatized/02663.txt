i definitely agree that successful people are more willing to try new thing and take more risk rather than only doing what they already know how to do well . because they are not affraid of changing , they have more chance , and they know that you need to take risk to find new way , they can become successful people . first of all , successful people are not affraid of changing what they already had . they do n't stay still and they always want something new . success often come with something different from the established one . for example , the success of the website of youtube '' is because it 's new and unique . therefore , it grab everyone 's attention . if people always do thing that they knew very well , their life will be all the same . successful people are willing to try anything new and find new thing that help them succeed . furthermore , because successful people are willing to try new thing and take risk , they have more chance to succeed . they do n't have limitation . therefore , they have more opportunity than those who always do the same routine thing . in addition , successful people know that every investment ha it own risk and life is full of risk . in fact , they love to roll the dice , and to see what will happen next . that 's why life is so special . you never know what will happen next . it may take you to the successful life , and it may take you to the totally failure a well . during the process of trying new thing , successful people always gain some valuable experience which help them become more successful . to sum up , successful people are not affraid of changing their life and are willing to try new thing . they take risk and they do n't worried about losing what they 've owned . during these trial and error , they always gain some experience which make them successful in the future .
