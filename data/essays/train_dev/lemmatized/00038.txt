for the following reason , i disagree with the statement that in twenty year there will be fewer car in use than there are today . first , using car will be more convenient in twenty year . for example , when i wa a university student at a hitotsubashi university in 1995 , i went to hokkaido , which ha many natural park in japan , by my friend ken 's car . because the car had no car navigation system , which showed the map where we were automatically , ken and i had a trouble to find the road we should go . however , now most car in japan ha car navigation system . we come to know the road easily . although now we are not able to see the map about all over japan , in the twenty year we will be able to see it . using car will be clearly more convenient in twenty year . second , a lot of more safety car will be made in twenty year . for example , now in japan , where i live , there are more than ten thousand traffic accident annually . last year , one of my cousin , kumiko , who wa six year old , came across a traffic accident and because she ran into the road in order to catch a ball she dropped . the car driver , mr. suzuki wa not able to stop immediately when he found her because it wa suddenly . if the car coule have stopped automatically , he coule have avoid the accident . now i hear the news that car company are trying to make safety car that can stop immediately when someone or something suddenly appear in front of the car . i believe these car will be made and used in twenty year because we will not have to be anxious about traffic accident . a lot of more safety car will be definitely made in twenty year . therefore , i strongly disagree with the statement that in twenty year there will be fewer car in use than there are today .
