i am not agree with this statement . i am not agree with this statement because , from my point of view , it wo n't be fewer car in use in twenty year than there are today . i my opinon it will be more car firstly because they will give a major utility and we could do many more thing with our car than we can do today . in twenty year time , car will have everything included and you will be able to do whatever you want while you are driving . this is one of the main reason that i use to argue that it wo n't be le car in the future than nowadays . another reason is that from my point of view , the number of car will increased because they will be more sefety and this fact will aloud underaged people to drive a car because they will have many system to prevent the accident . since many time , car have been the most safety transport in the world , and i think this is not going to changed , because car company move a lot of money and they will do everything to sell more car and make them more safety and comfortable . another fact that in my opinion will make the number of car increase in the future is that the goverments are spending a lot of money in the rebuilt of many highway that will make the trevel by car more safety , comfortable a safer . to sum up , i would like to say that for me , car are a very important part in our daily life and it will be an more important in twenty year than there are today .
