these day , there are lot of exsitding place around here and there for young people such a ammusument park or playing some sport . but at the same time , there are lot of amazing place for older people . therefore i do not agree this statment . i have two reason for it . first , i think it is much different that the point which young people like and the point which older like . for example , for young people , they really like to go skiing , but for older people it doe not matter . it mean , they do not feel attraction about that . on the other hand , for older people like to go to the place there are hotspring . but for young people , there is no value to go there . in my opinion , now they are equall . second , it is natural that older people ha more money than young peolpe doe . therefore older people can spend mucc money for their fun even if they can not have enough time to go somewhere because of their child . they can buy their favorite dvds , and enjoy by watching them at home . lastly , even though they can not go outside whenever they want to go because they are mother at house , they have more time to do their favorite thing rather than young people who ha to go to school everyday . therefore i think older people can enjoy their life more freely than young people do .
