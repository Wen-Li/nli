i do not support the statement stated . the reason that support my contradiction are stated below . cars are being manufactured in count of thousand per day per unit throughout the world . automobile technology is one of the most progressive aspect of today 's generation . it ha become the basic need of mankind . in fact , without the use of automobile , life today would have been very difficult . for public transportation , automobile are required . they are used in transportation of good from one place to another . all basic and essential requirement such a ambulance , fire truck , breakdown wagon , cab etc are all automobile . it ha become a matter of concern regarding the disadvantage and ill-effects automobile reflect . problems such a environmental pollution , noise pollution and the rapid depletion of fuel reserve are the talk of the day . fossil reserve under the earth 's crust that have taken million of year to form by sedimentation and organic decay are being exhausted at an alarming rate . an extrapolation from the current fuel reserve indicates that all of the present deposit will be completely exhausted in the next 50 year . then what will happen ? what about the million of car and automobile running throughout the world ? will transportation come to a standstill after an estimated span of 50 year ? the answer is a no . today 's world is very advanced in science and technology and this advancement is accelerating at an unimaginable pace . since primitive time , man ha always invented way and method to enhance and improve thing to fit his lifestyle the best . so will be the case now . research ha already begun in finding alternative source of energy that can serve a a substitute for petrol and also keeping in mind the problem of pollution . man is said to have the most intelligent brain of all creature . god ha made the human brain in such a way that it can think , analyze and invent new way that would ameliorate the ordinary present into a better future . alternative fuel substitute such a hydrogen power , nuclear power have been a favourite topic in research lab . in fact , there ha already been a launch of the first water-powered car . these improvement will continue and there wont be any decline in the number of car after twenty year when compared to those we see now .
