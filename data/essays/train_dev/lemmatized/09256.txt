taking risk and getting to know the unknown is an important part of beeing able to move forward and experiencing new thing , which is why i strongly agree with the statement . where would the human race be if our ancesters would n't have taken risk ? the curage to do something new unexperienced or unknown allows development . if columbus would n't have taken a risk no one would know about amerika . many of our scientific achievement are the resulsts of taken risk . if no one would have tried to fly ( at the beginning with some strange looking machine ) and with that would have taken the risk of breaking an arm or a leg we would still travel with ship ( if we are willing to take the risk of sinking ) . persons who took a risk are those who are standing in our book and those who achived something in life and for the human race . but let just look at a more personal level . if we are willing to take risk we are also open for new experience . if a person is willing to get to know different culture and view and is leaving her/his comfort zone , that person will learn something beneficiall to her/his life . i would say that taking risk is one of my basic human need . my life should be excieting and full of experience , until now i have always been more sucessfull with that additude than those people not willing to take risk . sometimes i maybe burned myself but the thing i leared from those negative experience is something nothing else would have been able to give me . how is a person able to get life experience or to become wiser with age if that person is not taking risk ? it is not at all admirable if someone is only doing the thing he know how to do , to some extend it e even sad .
