i do agree with the statement . facts are important above all a example or expression of the concept wich is behind them . facts are for sure important because they can explain thing . they can help rememberimg a thing ; they can focused the attenction on a peculiar aspect of the subject , can be helpfull to explain or capture the idea wich they follow . you can remeber all the fact that you like , but if you had well understand concept you will be able to recombine them in different and original way . you may be able analize even different situation following the same concept . to explain better my point of view i 'll take some accademic subject a example . for istance it is not important , to me , remembering date and hour of every single battle a long a you can remeber how the war went , why it broke out , who were fiting and why . in history what it is crucial is the general setting of the period . another good example can be even a scientific subject a the chemistry . it is not essential to remeber wich specific salt and wich peculiar base are combined ( fact ) , a long a you rember the way the reaction go and wich is the result ( concept ) . reffering to enother subject a sociology what it is important , for example , it is to remember that someone 's behaviour can be modified by the society 's response to his action . keep in mind every single possible society 's reaction it is not that crucial . to resume my point of view in few world : if i can propely understand the concept and the idea of what i 'm learning i will be able even to elaborate them and to use it even in different suituation . i can recombine concept in different way , i can adapt them to a variety of sistuations i might need to analize .
