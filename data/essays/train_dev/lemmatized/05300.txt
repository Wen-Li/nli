i strongly agree with the statement that most advertisement make product seem much better than they really are . the company which produce their product indeed want to profit more form advertising . advertisements help the audience realize how the product function and what it advantage are . the people who watch tv are expecting the information which can entertain and release them from the burden of daily life . frankly speaking , company are runing for profit , so it is abvious that they are inclined to make their product look better and seem to function better on the advertisement . as it is known to all , the invest of advertisement cost a huge mount of money , so one of the advertisement duty it to fit the investor ' request to make the advertisement more convincible . advertisements are supposed to help audience know how the product function best and what it advantage are . there are scarce advertisement that would tell it audience what the product 's disadvantage are . for example , a laptop computer advertisment would show it audience how small the laptop is and how convienent to be carried , but it seldom mention a word about the poor battery life expectance and the low-speed cpu . however , it is somehow unnecessary to tell these advantage because many people who are willing to buy such a laptop only use it to do some document writing , which doe not need a high-speed and shining cpu . the people sitting in front of tv are expecting to see something entertaining , since they want to have a nice leisure time . a high-tech advertisement with many dazzling artificial effect or an interesting story is more than welcome for the audience to pay the petiance even after seeing it several time in one hour . in conclusion , advertisement surely make product seem much better than they really are . while the company enjoy the profit advertisement have brought , we will not feel it is a waste of time to watch such a entertaining advertisement with a seemingly great product .
