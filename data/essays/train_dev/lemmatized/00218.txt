facts are those that often people believe . if the fact are not derived from the idea and concept of the relevant subject then they does'nt have strong root to be considered a fact . people are almost all fooled if they believed in the fact in which they doe n't have enough understanding idea and concept . so i prefer in idea and concept in which most of the fact are emerged . in favour to my decision i can suggest the example of physic area in which newton ha made a theory that every body in the universe is attracted towards the earth due to gravitational force . this fact ha not just emerged from the idea that an apple thrown up ha fell down . he went deep into the idea why the came down and made him do a research that prooved their is a force of attraction towards the earth . as a result we learn today the laws of newton . so a far a the example is concerned i strongly believe in idea that led to fact and the student community should focus on that the example i give is the invention of electricity that benjamin franklin ha given . the mere idea that she felt the shock during flying her kite didnt led to the electricity . she made effort to learn why this happened and she felt that their are some charge particle which are responsiponsible for that shock . this led many theory in physic and later scientist created wonder with this concept . the argument can proved in all other area not only in science . students doe understand the fact unless they are projected with concept and idea . so unless the fact are supported with enough idea and concept the fact are never fact and there will be a black spot always if it is believed blindly
