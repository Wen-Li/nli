i do not agree nor disagree with the statement . i strongly believe there are advantage a well a disadvantage in all phase of life , in youth a in old age . it is generally agreed that young people have strong physical quality , more energy , and a wide range of opportunity potentially available to them : their life is n't written yet . at the same time , older people are weaker , need medical attention with higher probability , and do not have many of the choice young people have : because , a you grow older , it becomes too late to seize an increasing number of opportunity , and more door are closed , so to speak ( in particular career-wise ) . for example , if a young woman pursuing a career in acting and attending theatre class , is struck all of a sudden by a revelation and decides her true vocation is in marine biology , she simply quits theater study and enrolls into science school . changing your mind like that would not be possible when you 're like , say , 40 year old : no matter how hard you work , the competition will probably have been into your field for 10 or more year than you have , and that kind of gap is practically impossible to fill . so , if you 're 40 year old and you 've been , say , a theatre actress , you 're probably bound to stay that ; or at least , you do n't have all the opportunity you 'd have had , had you changed your mind at a younger age : in short , i guess we can safely say that getting old reduces the opportunity of successfully changing your career field . however , there are clear advantage that go with older age , such a security , reduced uncertainty about the future , the comfort of relying on a family of your own , and that feeling of safety that having a steady job give you : all this is more likely to happen a age increase . it is wise though not to generalize too much : in those country where the job market doe not present high level of protection , job-security might be low for the old a well a for the young ; and when divorce is a popular behavior , your dream of a happy family can be easily shattered and turn into a nightmare .
