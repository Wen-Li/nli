i agree that most advertisement make product seem there are really are . i had many experience in this situation because the product seems very good in the advertisement . there are three reason to support my opinion . firstly , people make an advertisement in order to catch coustomers ' eye , so it will talk about that it 's good for you when you choose to use it . after people saw the advertisement , they would like to buy it in order to know ot is good or not . sometime people will feel bad with it . secondly , the company make product and they always hope that they can earn somme money by selling it . they will let coustomers think that it 's a worth to buy , so they will talking it 's benifits in the advertisement . for example , when they introduce a cooky , they might tell you it use honey not suger and they add the natural produce in the cooky . it is good for your health and mind . it also taste delicious . people will be attacted and would like to try it . furthermore , the company will invite a professional people to be the actor to introduce the product in the advertisement . it seems that it is a good direction to buy the product . some people will believe it because it is introduced by a famous people . to sum up , i believe that most advertisement make product seem there are . it is a business to catch people ' eye . nowaday , even we know the reason , we still would kike to buy the product and try to use it . some of them are really , some do n't . people should get more informatin befort you buy a product and then you can find a useful thing for yourself .
