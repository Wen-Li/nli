some might argue that understanding idea and concept is more important than understanding fact . i think this statement can be true in some way , but i definitely reject it and for the following reason . although it is easy to support the theory that student tend to be fascinated by and thus learn idea better than fact and give them more importance , this can be argueable . literature or philosophy , which are basically based on the study of idea , ideology , theory , are usually easier to study and even more pleasant than , for example , solving chemical form . they imply le effort and abstract concept can be seen a more essential in an education than number or fact . however , subject a literature , philosophy , history , can be on one side a difficult a scientific subject and on the other side often have to be supported by fact . firstly , idea , for the reason that their substance is based on abstraction , can be very hard to formulate , share and understand . many philosophy , like kantism , are based on notion of knowledge that are mainly intuitional and can not be understood neither by an experienced and open mind , thus it can be hard to consider more solid and important than fact . secondly , fact are idea and viceversa . as popper stated , fact do not exist before idea because it is the idea that brings the mind to explore the fact . also , many idea have to be supported by number to be valid and feasible , i.e. economic theory or political statement usually rely on statistical data and method . in conclusion , i would say that the statement is a half truth and could be completed saying that idea and fact are essential element in every mindset in any study area , depending on each other and sharing the same importance . students are usally enough flexible to appreciate both idea and fact , a many old thinker and philosopher , who were at the same time mathematics and philosophy scholar .
