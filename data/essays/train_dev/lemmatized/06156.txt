specializing in one specific subject is always better than having a broad knowledge of a large variety of academic subject . however , to have some knowledge about other relateds subject would n't be bad either . i 've been studying photography and video in a university for three year . the system of this program i study is based on giving education about several subject ranging from video art to documentary photograpy . from what i experience from this system , i can say that getting to know each subject a little bit but not being able to specialize on one academic subject is what you can do to ruin a student future . i am telling this because i know when i graduate i will find out that it is difficult to find a place for myself in any environment . for instance , when you are applying to a college for master degree they would like to see the subject you specialized in , or when you get in to a job you need to have a specialization on something to be succesful . on the other hand , when someone who ha a spacialization on a spesific subject but doe n't know anything else other than that it will also be considered a a bad situation . for example , if you are studying fashion photography , it would be an advantage for you to have some knowledge about other subject related to fashion photography , like art history . getting to know how the figure were painted by which technique , what colour were used in order to express which emotion , what the basic principle of art at certain period were , improves the quality of the photographic work . in conclusion to specialize in one subject is necessary to maintain success both in work and academic environment , but a an addition to that extra knowledge on other subject that will add to your specialization will be a remarkable advantage .
