to answer this question , it is also important to know about the intention advertiser have . for sure they want to spot their product into a brighter light , because they want to persuade the customer to buy their product . generally you can assume , that a good manager doe not want to make his product better than it actually is , but he want to picture his product relatively better than the competitor ' product . therefore an advertisement sometimes make product seem much better than they really are , but it doe not have to be . in case advertises exaggerate , it will arouse negative dissonance at the customer and they will be very unsatisfied . on the other hand the statement depends a lot on the interpretation of the potential customer 's behaviour . if he interprets the advertisement in that way , then it is absolutely unimportant what the advertiser wanted to express with the advertisment . due to this two point of view ( advertiser or manager vs. customer ) i do not agree to this statement entirely . maybe , because i am tried to be both . a manager a well a a customer . nonetheless if this statement is true or not , you should always make the assumption , that an advertisement doe not reflect the reality correctly . if you do not make this assumption , you possibly get disappointed , when you buy a product , many time . this probably will happen , because not every manager take into account , that negative dissonance can have bad consequence to the consumer ' behavior . additionally you should not forget another party , which is involved into the process of developing an advertisment . it is the advertisement-agency . the always want to exaggerate and put everything into nice and beautiful color . many time the have so much influence into the ad finally , in short word , i do not agree to the statement , but i would tell everybody , that an intelligent customer always take this possibility into account . otherwise you eventually put your money into the wrong investment .
