since the serial manifacturing of car , they had become a really important part of human life , a they decreased the time required for transportation . as people 's need for transportation will not decrease , it is really hard to say that there will be fewer car in the near future . people use car in their everyday life and , for people today , it is hard to imagine any period of time without car . there had been other form of transportation in the past , but ; none ha been used a frequently a modern car . one could claim that a newer form of transport may evolve . some people even say that , we may be able to teleport in the near future , however ; this suggestion ha yet only lived in science fiction book . therefore , in the near future , a near a twenty year , people are unlikely to see a newer form of invention that will close the era of modern car . cars ' look , type of fuel they use or their engine system may change , but ; after all , they will still be car . even if car began not to move on four wheel , but ; instead , started to fly ; a we see in science fiction movie like `` back to the future '' , they would still be called `` car '' . that is because , they will still be belonging to an individual and be used just like the way we use them today . as stated before , their way of working , that is ; their engine system , ignition type , fuel etc. may change ; however , they will still be `` the personal transportation device '' . as a result , when we look at the 20th and the beginning of 21st century , it is almost impossible to see car vanish from the market all of a sudden . lots of people are happy with this a well , a long a oil price are kept at a reasonable price . maybe , the 22nd century will become free of car and car addict would surely be glad that they are not to see those time .
