the topic given to me is that broad knowledge is better than on the knowledge of a specific subject . i dont agree with the following statement because broad knowledge can not help u always . it is necessary to have a specialised knowledge over a particular subject . by having broad knowledge over many academic subject can not fetch you in getting a job . this is because the company want student who were specalised in a particular task for their work . moreover he can not be confident in any of his subject and face many problem . if we are specalised in a particular subject we can do research in that particular subject and can improve our knowledge . by doing so we can reach great height in our career . for example if we consider the president of india , he is a great scientist who used to work at isro got great fame because of his sucess in the field he ha choosen . we must take him a inspiration and must try to develop in our future . if we try to have knowledge on all subject than it just like standing on two boats and definetly we have to face many problem in the future . though he is talented he can not reach great height in his career . he may also face the problem of earning money a he can not get a good job that bear his expense . for example if i am interested in both science and social it is better to concentrate on only one subject than the two . this is because if he study both he can not be a knowledged person in any of the subject and and he will come to the stage of confusion to choose which subject for his higher study . i finally say that it is better to be a leader in one field than to be a member in many field . so finally i feel that it is better to specalize in one subject due to the reason given above . moreover by doing so we can be the most knowledable and experienced person in a particular field .
