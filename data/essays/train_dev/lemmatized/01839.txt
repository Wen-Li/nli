as the popular saying go `` jack of all trade and is master of none '' . though the saying indicates that little knowlege in all is not helpfull . but in practice like in acedamics , to find onces area of interest it is essential to get exposed to various subject . therefore , the basic knowledge about a variety of area and in depth knowledege on a subject of primary interest is the right blend for any student . the exposure to wide variety of knowledge help choose a subject of interest . many student discover their true interest a long time after they choose another field . many student take up area they have no interest because they never get chance to find what interestes them . this can be avoided by giving more exposure to various subject . also in mordern time there are many job which demand interaction between various feilds . for example , a software designer may need a basic understanding of account or banking to understand need of bank while developing a banking software . similarly a mathematician help creart formula or theory for problem ariseing in physic thus must have a basic understanding of concept in physic . another need for learning many different subject is because each of them provide a different skill set . for example , a painting class is not only about color and stroke but help develope imagination and creativity in student , which will be helpfull in the long run . similarly other subject like mathematics enhances the analytical skill which are useful to even a biology student in analysing result of experiment etc . but basics only are not usfull , student should also focus on one subject especiall in later part of his career like graduation and specialise in it . therfore learning of many subject is very benifcial for student along with persuing in-depth study in a
