personally i am convinced that people have to try new thing and take big risk if they want to be successful in our day . i am studying economics and from my lecture and from observation of today \ s economy i know that you can not make much money with something that already exists . of course you could just buy something and resell it for a slightly higher price but the big money can only be earnt with something that is brand-new and everybody want to have . a good example that prof this thesis is bill gates . he invented a completely new program for computer called windows and earnt several billion dollar with it because everybody wanted to use his new program and there wa no other program of a similar kind available . because he wa the only one offering such a program he could sell it for a very high price and he and his company microsoft became extremely successful , admired and wealthy . but in order to find or invent new thing people have always to take risk because at the time someone invents a new product there is uncertainty about whether people will buy it or not . if the new product doe not sell well , all the time and money the inventor ha spent with thinking about and producing his product is lost . if the windows-programm would not have sold well , bill gates would have lost a lot of money instead of earning it . it is easy to see that big opportunity are always connected with big risk and danger . reason for that lie in the fact that in our day the people in the western country almost have everything they need and always expect new thing . this implies that only these people can be successful who can offer them new thing .
