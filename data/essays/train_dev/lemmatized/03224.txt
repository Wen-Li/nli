i agree that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide for many reason . first , we a very new to the place and if we a in a group there are very le change to get lost in the unknow place . it is better to have a group . we can enjoy the site by sharing our own idea with the other preson . in a group they can take good care of the other preson if they r not well . second , having a tour guide is the best way to travel . guide is the person how is very familier with the place so he can help u to now the history of the place . he ( guide ) also take u to the very important place , which we can not find them with ourself . he also help u in selecting the place to rest and have great food . third , people make many good friend in the tour . in a group no one feel bore of the tour ; because in the free time they can enjoy by dancing , singing around the campus fire .
