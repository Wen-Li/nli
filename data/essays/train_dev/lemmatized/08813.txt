some people tend to say and believe that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communites . in my personnal point of view , it is a false statement , because nowadays we see more and more young envolved in the public concern , and many new association established by and for young created . and i have a personnal experience a a young woman working with several association that are mainly composed by young , and we try to do social work by helping poor child in their study , by tuitoring them , collecting fund to buy schoolbag , book , copybook for them , we have even convinced a rich club ` rotary club ' to sponsorise a whole day in the swimming pool for 200 kid . and i know many other association doing really great work especially by youth , not only in my country but all over the world . in another hand they may be some young who are not interested in helping their community , and who just foccus on entertaining them selve , but it doe not mean that it is a generalized situation , and i think that it ha been the case in all the era : they have always been aware young who face the problem their community are having and who try to solve them , and other young who just do not care . finally , i think that what leaded to this misunderstanding , is the gap that appear between the generation , because every previous generation tend to idealise it youth and is not satisfied with the new generation behavior , just because it is not on their way , while the adult should understand that time change and so mentality , and they should try to help young to find out how to help their community by their own way , not the way they want them to act .
