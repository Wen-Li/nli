i disagree with the statement that the best way to travel is group tourings led by a guide . of course , group touring can give several benefit : proving some good information , making friend with peopel with different background , etc . but a far a i am concerned , i believe that it is best to travel alone or travel with a few friend . first of all , i like organizing tour schedule and preparing for travel . i search good information about my touring in the web site . we can have a lot of valuable information about cheap price hotel , affordable rent car , or wonderful sightseeing . in contrast , a group tour ususally make me be very passive . i do n't like being passive . secondly , i feel more free and comfortable when i prepare for my own travel . group travel ususally provides rigid time schedul and travel itinery . but i enjoying freely choosing our schedul and place to visit . our schedul always can be adjusted based on our situation . thridly , i love driving my car when i make a trip to historical site , park and mountaints with beautifual scenary , or cutting-edgy city such a new york , l.a . in contrast , i can not drive car when i become a member of group tour guided by a tour guide . driving car , especially in the highway , make me feel relax and happy . finally , i do n't think that group touring provide cheap price . it usually need a lot of money to participate in group travel . i believe , preparing our own travel can help u save a lot of money . to sum up , group touring is not best option for me because it make me feel more passive , le freee , and very often the price is so expensive . i prefer traveling based on my own schedul and plan .
