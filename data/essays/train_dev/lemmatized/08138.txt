people always need to learn something to reach good life standarts therefore learning is the most important aspect of humanlife . everyone ha a different point of view , about the idea of learning . it is more important for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact . these are my following thesis . firtly , student go to school to learn something . teachers are teaching them to u but we do not awere what they are . for example , when i wa a student in a high school . my teacher learned me but he did not want me to understand them . because of this reason , sometimes i do not understand clearly my lesson at my university . in addition to this , to understand concept can help u in future . if we understand a subject , we never forget it , because we cover it all . we know every thing about it . for instance , we are in a math class and a teacher learns u a formula and he provides it for u . if we understand it how we can obtain it , we always remember the formula . on the other hand , to learn fact is neccesary fo people . something can not be undertand . they have to be learned fact for student . despite the ti idea i prefer to understand idea and concept to sum up , a i said before it is more important for student to understand idea and concept than it is fo them to learn fact .
