in my opinion , i admit that some people like to have broad knowledge than specialized one , but i rather like to have specialized knowledge of one specific subject . the primary reason of this is that people should have good or bad at academic subject . i think it is waste of time to study dislike subject which they know they will never ever use after the examination or graduation . in my case , i had to study mathmatics and science when i wa a first year at my highschool , but i hate them and the grade were very bad . because of this , at the tutorial , my tutor recommended me to quit them and concentrate on other subject , so i did and the decision wa very good for me . i could use all my time for studying essential subject for my future and i have never regret of my decision ever . on the contrary , i have to admit that there are some good point for lerning , any academic subject . the biggest one is that we can think of something from various direction . things sometimes related each other and lie on to various subject , so broad knowledge could be very useful in some case . however , i still believe that there are more good point in only one specialized deep knowledge than several shallow knowledge . the next reason for this is that most of the people shoud choose one specific subject sooner or later , so i think it is sooner the better to concentrate on the subject which they really like . in addition , i think it is much easier to remember or learn the thing which people are interested in than reluctant to . from the reason above , i believe specialized knowledge in one specific subject is better than broad knowledge of many academic subject .
