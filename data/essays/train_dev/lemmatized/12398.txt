i would have to disagree with the statement thats say that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide . although it depends on your age and interest , i would certainly prove next my opinion . if we take for example , my hometown city , buenos aires you would be shown a different buenos aires then the one that we actually live in . for example the tour guide would take you to the government palace , the obelisco , the widest street in the world ( 9 de julio ) , the typical restaurant , tango lesson , so on , and so on . but the real deal is that we argentine do not usually go to these place , most of u dont even know how to dance tango . people come to argentina and believe it a real poor country and that the people that live in here are far away from the people who live in first world country , but let me tell you that 's not even near the real deal . i have friend from all over the world , and when they come to buenos aire they are stunned , amazed , they have the most incredible fantasy of what a third world country should look like , and are terrified with the news that come from our country , so when they get here they cant believe what a great quality of life we have going on . in fact , i take them for a tour all around the city , the newest neighbourhood , the best restaurant , the coolest night place , the most popular soccer match or polo tournament , the most shocking museum exposition , etc . but most importantly , they get to meet through me a lot of different people who are actually part of the argentine culture , and who can in their own word explain whats going on in the political , social and cultural matter of our country . in fact i believe it is the worst way to travel ( by group ) , dealing with a hugh bunch of tourist , and not getting any contact with people who actually live in the city . i certainly believe that he best way to travel is with a friend who life in that specific city . if you do not know any , then i would certainly recommend two solution . the first one would be to travel in a very small group , and to take note from internet web page such a www.asmallworld.com which offer opinion from people who actually recommend the best place to go to , and rank them , and even explain the real situation of every country by their own citizen view , one can even talk to them and find out about almost everything there is to know about any city . secondly , and maybe the best option i can come up with is to use a taxi driver a a real tour guide . in fact , they are the real tour guide in the city , they know everywhere , and they are constantly in contact with people , and they even know almost about every subject there is to know about . at least if you are in buenos aires , i can assure they are for certain the best tour guide in town .
