marketing is the main factor to make this a rule . i personaly think that product have to look better in the image because the market competition you can found in the real world . i have found many time my self with a product that is not event the half of good that i wa expecting and this is the result of advertising . under controled cirumstances the color , the texture even the result of the product are controled by advertiser whom are responsables for the introduction of the product to the market . and you belive it . some time product realy are what they announce and i think these are the expensive one , not all the time but frecuently the more you pay the more you receive . some brand give u the idea of quality and we buy that because quality is important . i do n't mean with this that we have to pay extra money in order to get better item , some time a particular brand have `` more name '' than others and this the only reason that justifyes this product to be more expesive but not because is the better . we can find in the market a lot of different brand and quality equipment that can let u solve our needing . it is in more of the case the power of adquisition ( the amount of money ) we have the one that rule our buying behaivor . you have more money , you can buy more expensive thing , but not nessesarily the best . it is a game that we play very often considering all the time the expese versus the quality , some time we just buy an item that bearly give solution to our need but we are not willing to expend more money on it . so it is importat to put in a balance what we are looking for and try not to be catched by the ilussion of advertisement because most of the time they are more atractive that thery realy are .
