today , we usually heard that young people are not interesting in helping their community . i think that young people have a different vision of that . they help their community , but in a different way than ten year ago . first , the structure of a family ha changed . there are more divorce , parent and child can live kilometer far away from each other etc . i think this could explain why young people feel le concerned about old people for example . but we can see some experience in france to reduce the gap between old person and child . some school have organised meeting , every week , where each child ha a grandfather or a grandmother for the meeting . they play and make activity together . it is an interesting experience for child because lot of them have lost their grand parent or live far away from them . moreover , they learn to care for old people . in addition , youg people have different behaviour because they have different education . if the parent teach their child to help other people , i think they would follow this lesson later . if they see parent helping a neighbour or someome of the family for example . another point is that the current society and parent ask a lot from young people . there is a lot of competition between parent because they want to show that their child are `` better '' than others in school , sport , music , etc . this mean that child have lot of activites during the week and the week end so they have le time to spend for their community . finally , i think that young people help their community but they could give more time for it . parents have to teach child that family and community are important and that they have to take care of each other .
