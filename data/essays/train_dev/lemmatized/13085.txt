you often see old people on the street who are either angry , annoyed or very sad . by contrast most of the young people i know are very cheerful and relaxed . apparently , most of the young people are much happier than older one . therefore , i personally believe that young people enjoy their life more than older people . evidently , older people have more malady and painful physical problem . the body get weaker when you become older and often cause horrible pain . generally speaking , child and younger people are healthier and consequntly fitter . my grandfather for instance , had belly cancer and therefore did n't relish eating anymore . being traumatized by horrible memory , many old people get more and more depressed in their old age . this cause difficulty that force old people to renounce many pleasure in life . for example , it becomes more and more difficult to travel . in addition , younger people still have a lot of wish and idea of what they want to accomplish and experience in life . whereas old people tend to be frustrated because there is nothing new to discover . they have experienced nearly everything in life and do n't have any future plan . young boy and girl can look forward and are still full of hope , whereas older people must look backward . in conclusion , i personlly believe that it is much easier to be happy when you are young . on the one hand , being young and fresh normally lead to a happier life because the body is generally fitter and painless . on the other hand , a child or teenager still ha the opportunity to discover many thing in life . given all of these reason , i recommend everyone to learn and experience a many thing a possiple during his youth , since for most of the pleasure in life it will be too late one day
