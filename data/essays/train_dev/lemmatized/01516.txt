i think that in twenty year there wo n't be fewer car than there are today , i think they will be different . people wo n't happily leave the opportunity of having such a confort , they prefer going to the seaside with the whole family without depending from a public service like national railway by having theyr private car that could take them with all the package directly from the house to the beach with no delay and not trasporting luggage by hand . the car in a century became a everythay thing in the life of the people and only few think they can do everything eeven without that . but the lack of oil will rise in the next decade and the pollution is getting too high to use this resource any longer so it will be necessay to find new energy resource to permit the use of these private transport . petrol company like chevron and government ' scientits are searching new way to give power to car engine , for example using hydrogen or converting sunlight in power , now this kind of energy cost a lot , but in some year they will be the most used way to give power not only to car . so the car will have probably different engine in 2030 or ( why not ? ) they will go on rail , but theyr number wo n't change a lot , maybe it will grow if the new resource will be accessible to everybody without making too much pollution .
