i agree with the statement that successful people try new thing and take risk rather than only doing what they already know how to do well . the phenomenon appears in a lot of different category , but one of the most import one is business . success is often related with money , which mean , that a well know company would take more risk than a small family business . that is not completly true since one ha to remember that the opportunity of a big company are much higher becuase they have the financial resource . but if one compare a successful company with an unsuccesful company one will see that the the compay with a high profit is risking more than the other one . for example , coca cola is nowadays one of the most successful company in the world . but it did not start form the beginning a a big company . it started with only one product called cola . when coca cola wa establish on the world market the coca cola company raised it porfit each year . after that the coca cola company took a huge leap of faith a invested in a new produced called fanta and sprite . that wa very risky because the people might not like the new drink and would not buy them so that the cocal cola company would not get back their production cost . but even if they would have lost all the money they invested into the new produvct the coca cola company had remaind a a successful company . in general , successful business take more often risk to gain even more porfit rather than unsuccessful buisness because it doe not matter to them if they loose .
