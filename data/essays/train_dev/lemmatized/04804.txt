i agree with the statement . in the education of a child it is important to transmit him the knowledge of fact concerning history , science , art and other matter , but it is more important to teach him how to reason independently and to think with his own mind . for a student it is very important to understand idea and concept behind fact ; in fact , this give to the student some scheme that he can re-apply to understand many other fact and he can use to continue learn also alone . notions are relevant , but are idea and concept that develop in a young boy the skill required to analyze thing and reasoning . in the past to know a lot of fact wa very valuable and esteemed , but today , thanks to new communication technology , information and fact are easily available to everyone and have lost great part of their value . for people today it is not essential to know fact , but it is required to have the capacity and the mind to understand fact and to find out what we really need among the big quantity of information available . internet today is maybe the gratest example of what i say : in the web it is possible for everyone to quickly access to fact that happen in the world , to historical archive , and to a lot of picture and video . ideas and concept are also the basis for creativity ; discovery in scientific area can happen only because researcher have understood what they have studied , and have gained the capacity and courage to go further simple fact and to design theory and rule also concerning fact that have n't yet happened . aone affascinating example is a. einstein : with his idea he proposed theory that were verified by fact only many year later .
