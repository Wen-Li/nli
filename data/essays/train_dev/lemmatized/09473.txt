this question is really important not only for people who are planning and starting study at a college or university but also for people already working in a specific area . in my eye you should specialize in a specific subject a soon a possible . there are a lot of academic area you can study so at first you have to identify that one that fit best to your personal interest . when you are intersted in math for example it doe not make a lot of sense to study literature . so at that point you have to make the first specialization . in my eye that will help you to succeed in your study because you are learning something about topic you are really interested in . after finishing study the process of specialization continues . when you have studied business for example i think it doe not make a lot of sense to search a job where you have to apply the whole knowledge you have collected during your study . you will lack the propper knowledge to perform difficult task which will lead to failure and in the worst case you will loose your job . therefore i think after finishing business study for example you have to specialize again an maybe search for a job in the marketing or controlling departement of a company . even when you now work in a specific area , the process of specializing should still continue . to become a successful employee for example i think you now must become a specialist in specific task of the area you are working in . when you are working in the marketing departement of a consulting company for example you could specialize to the marketing of chemical product . in my eye these step of specializing in a specific subject are the best way to become not only successful in your job but also help you to divide the important information from the unimportant one . altough you should not lack a propper knowledge about other academic topic you have to specialize in order to be not provided with a overload of information you can not handle with .
