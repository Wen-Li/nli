i agree with the statement that people will tend to use car le than nowadays in twenty year . firstly , more developed transportation than car will be made . moreover , people do n't need to move like nowadays since through the internet they will be able to handle their work without directly moving with their car . first of all , the new transportation will be made which is much more environmental friendly than car in thesedays . nowadays , car seriously cause the environmental problem . because of the gas released by car , it bring about the destroy of ozone layer . furthermore , the increasing use of fuel cuases the human to hardly find energy resource . people living on the earth have problem which car influence on our nature environment . thus more developed transportation will be made to preserve the nature . next , there would be little chacec for people to move with their vehicle to manage their work . as the internet grow , people can do their work conviniently . they do n't have to move much to meet somenone or see the situation directly . intead , they can meet people on the internet even seeing each other by screen and have talk . also , they handle their work by getting the material by the internet just on their desk . this developing of internet cause people no need to move somewhere anymore . it can make the le us of car . for these following reason , car are no more significant tool for future people . first , more eco-friendly transportation will be made , moreover the le people use their car becuase of huge developement of the internet . that 's why the use of car would be decrease in 20 year .
