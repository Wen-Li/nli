i think older people should enjoy life more than young people . old peopl usually retered their job , so they have a lot of time . moreover , when they wa young they were working hardly for many reason . therefore , i think older people can enjoy more than young people . people usually said young people can to everything but older people are diffcult . however , i do not think so becouse my grandmother is always enjoy her life , for example , she learnes song , it called shigin in japan , and tradidional japanese dance . she stareted to learn thesethings when she wa a 65 year old , but she can learn new thing and enjoy these thing . moreover , other my grandmother learn to sing a japanese song , for example enka song , and plant vegitable and flower in her garden . she like to take care plant and eat freash vegitables . i think old people want to do new thing becouse when they were young people they usuaslly could not to do anything to theirself . garbament could not allow free when during or after war . after war people always to work very hardly . they did not have a enough money and did not free time . however , now to change the enviroment , so they can to do anythings if they wont and have a money . when older people wa young , they could not to have free time and could not to enjoy their life for working , but now they can have free time and to enjoy their life . therefore , i think older people shoul enjoy life more than young people do .
