i would like to discus the statement that young people do not spend enough time to help and suopport the community they are living in . to my mind young people nowadays spend le time helping their community than they did some decade ago but you should consider that there are quite a lot of thing that have dramatically changed over the past few year . now , there are many new service offered by the government that give u the opportunity to spend our time doing something else than working for our community . an example for this would be the improved helthcare system : some time ago , it wa nearly impossible to work in full-time job if one of your relative wa very ill and needed permanent care and help . today , you just have to apply for special service that are paid by the insurance and you will be given help . however , there are still some some service which can not be provided and / or paid by the community . in those case ( i.e staff at the fire brigade , ambulance driver , trainer at sport club etc . ) there is indeed kind of a shortage . in my free time , i am working a an ambulance driver without being paid for this . often have i experieced situation in which we ran out of personnel because nobody wanted to work on the weekend or wanted to stay up all night . i wish that in those case , more people would recognize how important their contribution would be . all in all , i think that we do indeed need a young generation that spends more time helping their community than many people do now , but we only need their support in some field . so my suggestion would be to try to make some advertisement and promotion in order to show them how much fun it can be to play an active role in society and to help them to find the right kind of occupation for them .
