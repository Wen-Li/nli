it is the hardest choice on everyone 's academic path . someone think it is better to specialize a soon a possible , others think it is better to have a broad knowledge of many academic subject . i think child and teenager should learn a much a possible on many different subject and during university they should specialize in one specific subject . when i think about great scientist in the past century i am surprised . they all had a broad knoweldge in many different field sometimes very different from each other . for example leonardo davinci wa the greatest painter , philosopher and scientist of his time . i think nowadays it is not possible to reach a deep knowledge in many different field because of the increasing complexity in every subject , furthermore i think it is better to gain a deep knowledge in something than to have broad and superficial knowledge of many different subject . specializing in one field is very usefull for two different reason . the fisrt one is that specialized student likely will find job easier because our society is interested in woorkers with specialized and advenced skill . the second reason is that if you specialize you bacame aware of the complexity of the subject . even if a person will work in a different field with respect to the field in which he ha studied , he ha learned to face difficult and complex problem and it is will turn to be extremely helpfull . if one learns many different subject he likely will know just the basic idea and he will not develop his ability to fix complex problem . althought i think it is important to specialize in one subject i also belive student should be able to try many different subject before choosing their field . it is difficult to inderstand what you are really interested in . trying is the best way to make a good choice . for this reason i think university should allowed first year student to change their major without any charge or penalty .
