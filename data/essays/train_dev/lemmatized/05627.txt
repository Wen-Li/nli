being old doe n't mean anything , many people are old and still have fun . i really do n't agree with the statement `` young people enjoy life more than older people do . '' being young you might have more energy than a old person doe . we all know that being young is a very good , we can go out and play football or basketball without worrying about breaking a bone . old people can also do that , but they just have to be more careful than the young one . there are many old sport player out there still left in the world . for example there is brett favre who is hitting 40 pretty soon . i know that is n't really old , but in football that is a pretty old age . many old people can be very active in other business espically the art . we all see many fashion designer , actor , and novelist who are all pretty old and still making good movie and writing good book and making beautiful clothes . helen mirren is a good example of an old actress who know how to have fun . her performance in this year `` the queen '' ha her for a frontrunner to take home the academy award . many time it usually the young one who get crtical acclaim for their performaces . you also see many old actor hitting the club like lindsay lohan and britney spears without their underwear on . you see bruce willis and george clooney who still hit the club . you also see many old fashion designer , who still make the best gown for people to wear . many people might like zac posen or proenza schouler or the newest fashion designer that just graduated from parsons , but in the end people still like the old fashion designer such a oscar de le renta . in the end , i do n't agree with the statement `` young people enjoy life more than older people do .
