there is no single day without a new commercial with medicine or food that could help the elderly people to keep fit in their body and young in their mind . we are now surrounded by the eternal youthness quest . but why ? do young people really enjoy life more than the older people do ? we first have to acknowlegde that the general trend conforts this idea . we easily can find the reason for it : - from a physical point of view , it make no doubt that young people have the advantage of their age . .. and their body . they can , for sure , do more physical effort than the elderly people . in this way , not all physical activity are opened to senior . eg : attraction in an entertainment park . - generally , the young people are studying , and therefore have commonly more free time than working people for instance . eg : school holiday . this time , being larger , can be alloted to more activity than for the other category . - an important fact is that most of young people do not have to care for kid yet , and do not have the charge of a family . consquently , they can enjoy life more than other people , since they do not have such preoccupation . from another point of view , this general trend is new : it only make a while that people get to 70 , 80 or even 100 year old . 3 or 4 generation before u , it wa uncommon ! therefore , the idea of old people wa the idea of people staying in a rocking chair , waiting for lunch , having strict scheddule . .. it 's not the case anymore : many older people enjoy life , go to their activity , go out with their friend , and love it ! another fact is that what young people could find enjoyable is not enjoyable to everyone . it creates then another point of view . there are pro and con about this topic . and i have to say that i am totally divised on this subject . i do n't think there is a yes-no answer , but more a general one which i expressed .
