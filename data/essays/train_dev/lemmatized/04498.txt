the statement given is rather black and white . i would although agree with the tendence , that successful people are able and have the courage to dare new thing . and obviously not daring anything new or unusal doesnt promise any success . an ability which might lead to sucess is the wisdom to know in which situation it is needed to do what is familiar and when a new step can be dared . i would say this is a possibility of using resource and energie effective . some time it might be wise to do thing which are familiar to do and doesnt consume money or time for research . but than it is nessesary to dare something new . for instance for a company which produce product or servises , it can be advisable to lance a small range of product first , till they got a position in the market and a name among their costumer . after that they have gained ressourses to do step in new direction , generally spoken . taking risk need a personality that dare to fail . an experiment can go wrong and in that case a desicionmaker need to carry the responsability for it . i think the ability of taking risk is definitivly a positive and creative one and needed to reach goal and success . it is a skill for leading position . but a i mentioned the more important skill is to be able to distinguish situation where it advisable to chose either the known or the new action . sucess altough could be understood differently . goals could be set differently . in the case the goal is not an economic one , and for instance to gain experience , than is trying new thing and experiment defenitly an advantege .
