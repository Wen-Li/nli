car usage get larger and larger in time being but in my opinion in twenty year there will be le car in use that there are today . there are several reason why i think so . first of all car consume fuel oil while working , this will became the main restriction of car usage in twenty year since the price of fuel oil get higher due to lack of founding it around the world . moreover , usage of fuel oil cause environmental pollution due to the carbonmonoxides provided after fuel gas usage . even if some people believe that there will be a solution of this problem with new energy source like natural gas since it will affect the performance of the car i think natural gas usage wo n't be preffered by user . the second main problem with car usage will be the lack of parking place around the world . if the number of car get larget the people will not found place to park them and would preffer to travel with something else for example bus insead of individual car . third the recovery of car get expensive and harder in time being . since solid waste aroun the world becomes a bigger problem in time being production of solid waste will be tried to reduced expecially by goverments . this situation will cause highering the tax of car and this will affect the car owner badly . as a result people will not prefer to buy a car . fourth and last i think that technology will improve in twenty year such that there will be new and usable transport vehicle around the world used insted of car like smalll personal plane etc . this will cause a reduction of car need . to sum up , in my opinion expense of car usage , environmental problem that car usage cause and developing alternative to the car with improved technology will cause a reduction in car usage in twenty year .
