giving a real contribution to the community is an important social aspect . in my own opinion the time dedicated to this purpouse should take a part in the life of any of the member of a community . i disagree with the statement because i think that young people nowadays is the most invoved in helping their community . many of my friend give their contribution to different social assotiacions and they do not earn money for that . they simply do that because they believe in the importance of their help . i think that young people is more involved in helping community rather than grown ups . this could be ascribed to the different amount of time which they have . grown ups are more likely involved in career and in family so they are not able to dedicate a large amount of time to this purpose . instead , young peole ha more free time and , in addiction , le worry to deal with . therefore is reasonable that they use this chance to help other people in the community . however , acccording to me there is also another reason for young people is larger involved in giving their time for the health of the community . a young man is tipically more idealistic and full of enthusiasm . therefore we can immagine how a boy can enjoy the idea of helping people spontaneusly . on the contrary a father might prefer to use his time and his source to help his own family . in conclusion i think that young people firmily believe to share their time and source to help the community . the result , can be seen in all the widespread activity and no profit association that we commonly meet . therefore i am pretty proud of the way the people of my age deal with the need fo help in the community .
