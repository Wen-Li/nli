well , i think that the statement ha 2 ponits of view , i i can assure you because of my personal life experience with my acttual own business . the first point of view like donald trumph there are many people that take new risk in business ( for instance ) and start campaings totally diferent that usuall . donal is a real state business man , a constructor developer , a golf court owner , and recently a tv host with the apprentice ! so he try to do the best in many area , obviuosly very well researched , because when you have success you leanr some rule that teach how to be on top allways no matter what , por example : a. think possitive b. fail is good , because you learn from it c. you allways have to be surrounded by people smatest than you , in order to make a team that help you achieve your goal . d. you have to serve allways , because you are a person who work for the people and that people is the one that give you the success . e. you have to be a visionare or a pioneer , and see what other ca n't see to help the society grew up . well a you see my point of view is like the business side because i like it and i know a lot . the second point of view but in the other hand , my own experience teach me that if i get lazy and sleep on my success i can not do new thing because i allways be waiting the same success from the same source and keep all my risk down , because i `` think '' i 've got the forever formula and try to stay in my status quo . in sumary , i think that the human been that is successful , have to probe him self that he can do it in other area different in order to stay alert and grew up in knowledge , perfection and happiness . thanks
