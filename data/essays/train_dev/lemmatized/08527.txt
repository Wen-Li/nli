i strongly support the idea that young people nowadays do not give enough rtime to helpiong their community . in this century young people seem indifferent to what happens around them . actually we can understand rthis issue by delving with their activity . i will try to lay down my reason by mentioning my previous statement . first of all , young people most of the time choose to be lonely . i reached this conclusion by observing the youth everywhere . i will try to reconstruct a vivid picture of youth . look at the teenager outside , maybe 80 percent of them listening music while walking or travelling in metro . when you think over carefully , you willl discover that he or she doe not want to have relationship with the community . by mean of this they are standing far away from their community . even though they they do n't want to share the view about any issue regarding the community . most impportant issue are education in the family and tecnology which cause the youth keep themselves away from community . let 's take tecnology , especially television . when we examine the parent or family daily life , we see the reason why our child are reckless and disrespectful to their environment . each member in the family is passing time by watching something , mostly time consuming paparazzo and competition program . and no one is talking on this very useful time period . so everybody go own way of life and parent do not teach anything about communal life . as a result , negligent and indifferent young people are forming everywhere . it mean that mankind is not thinking his future . because adult are responsible for these young generation . all in all , a phsciologist said that if there is problem in teenager , first of all , we have to examine the family atmosphere of this teenager . we should not forget that there is no another world so let u tend to this upbringing issue very closely . young people mean the representative of u .
