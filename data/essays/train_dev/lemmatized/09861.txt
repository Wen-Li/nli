i personally do not agree with the statement that successful people try new thing and take the risk rather that only doing what they already know how to do well . in fact i think that is not a matter of being successful that push people to try new thing and to take the risk . actually successful people are very much concerned about their knoweldge and probably are not likely to risk because they do not want to loose their popularity . for example a brillant manager know exactly what his \ her skill are and therefore he \ she would never try to do something new because of uncertain and risk that can lead to their replacement by someonelse who is better than he \ she is in that particular issue . it seems strange that someone who is already successful and know how to do something well doe n't want to try or doe n't take the risk . normaly these kind of people should have a strong character and therefore the wright spirit to challenge themselves in new thing . but the surprising thing is that they are the one who have hard time realizing that they are valid person and that if they have achieved certain success is because they have the quality required . i think that these type of person , unfortunately , have a big lack in their personality . in fact they seem not to be self confident even if they would not revelate to the pubblic . furthermore i belive that people who are not successful are more willing to try new thing and to risk . first of all because they have nothing to loose and second because in this manner they will have a chance to show their capability and to create a stronger character by challenging themselves .
