in our society , young people tend not to spend a lot of time helping their community , and that is due to the society in which we live . indeed , we observe at the moment a sort of individualism , which is expressed by the fact that people tend to live by themselves without taking care of their neighbour , acting like sheep . young people used to care for other people , but that wa what the society told them to do . nowadays , the matter is not that young people do not give enough time to helping their community , it is just that they do not have time to do so since our society is based on work and money . how could it be possible for young people to care for community when they have barely time to take care of themselves . it is true that more and more young people live their life according to their personal need , which is kind of hypocrite in a way , but one ha to admit that our society doe not help young people very much . on one hand , studying is becoming more and more expensive . if you are courageous enough to make your dream come true , you can try to find a job in order to finance your study , but this doe not seem normal . on the other hand , you have some country where study are paid by the government , a it is the case in denmark for instance . in scandinavia , one can notice that people and especially young people care for others , take part into helping community . in brief , they are deeply involved in their society , willing to help in order to make thing go better . in a nutshell , i would say that the young people 's investment in their community is closely related to the society they live in . if young people have to bear adult ' role in life when they are not adult yet , i do not see how possible it is for them to get involved in their community .
