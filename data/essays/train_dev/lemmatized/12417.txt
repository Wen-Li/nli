this is a very particoular theme . in my opinion the thing that is better is the first affermation . i think this becasue for a person in the world is more interesting to know something of every argoument instead that only a specific sector . all this because a man with a little conoscence of various argouments can have a relationsheep with a lot of person in the world than a man that know only a singoular sector . in the world of today the knowledge and the intelligence are two important element that permite to the people to survive . in the modern society is present the refoular of the most clever . usually a man with a limitated intelligence is condanned to suffer . for me only in the case that a man life only and make a particoular work without to have any relationsheeps with other person can have a specialization only in one specific subject . but this discus is valid for few people . an eclectic conoscence permit , also if it 's limited , a dialogue with a lot of person . sometimes a specialized conoscence is not necessary because the the majority of the discus that people do is general . only in particoular situation is request a specifical conoscence of a argoument . this is my opinion , but is not law . also because a limitated conoscence of a thing is better that no/knowledge . a life of success is possible only with a particoularly intelligence . in fact a man only with a intelligence more develop can have a lot of success in the own life and becomes a very important person . usually the fact go in this way . rarely a man becomes famous and important for a casual event . in the story of the world these fact are very rare . in conclusion a person should have a developed knowledge in every sector , so that he can speak and to have a relationsheep with other person of different social level . in fact a intelligence person can speak with every person , intelligent or not , but a person with a limitated conoscence difficulty can have a relation with different person
