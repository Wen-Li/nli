young people are enjoy life more than older people . even if this speach doe n't make a sence to people it ha some logical reason . in today 's world there are a lot 's of opportunity for young people that technology provides . i think technology and enjoyment of youg people in our day are very parallel to each other because of several opportunity that technology provides since 15 year . the most important technological achievment is internet . the adventage that internet provides for young people is to learn better and communicate better with their friend for instance . so even this can prove young people enjoys their life better than older people . in addition if we think that older people are using thecnology a young people do it is absolutely true . however this though brings a new question that even if older people could use the technology and the achievments a good a young people doe . i think even though older people can use the thecnology they can not figure it out a young people doe . on the other hand the time that youg people living in earth are very lucky because the'r life are not limited because of the political reason if we think this in border of turkey and many other country too . young people are free to experience what ever they like to and go where ever they like to go in feeling of freedom . maybe if i ask my mother that which of u are enjoying the life she would defenately told me that we are enjoying much more . several day ago we were invited a a guest in a family friend , the thing that tooks my attention wa their memory about their yought year and they told u young people in the dinner that we are lucky to be young and they advise u to enjoy it . offcourse being old ha some enjoyment in it own frame . in instance thay enjoy our growth , success and happiness at the same time . because for a family the biggest reason for being happy is their young child 's happines . finally , young people should have their best year by learning more and more so they can extand their view of life and enjoy their time a good a they can before the responsibility take a big part of their life .
