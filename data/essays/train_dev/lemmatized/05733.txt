today , a growing number of people that led by a tour guide , when they have a travel to the other nation . leding by a tour guide ha it advantage and disadvantage . if it were up to me , i would definetedly choose to travel is in a group . this is because of , the advantage of traveling in a group far outweigh the disadvantage of leding by a tour guide . to give you an idea . here is an example . to start with , if we go to travel in a group . we can get a lot of experience . from my personal experience . when i went to sanfransico with youth group which include in church . we have to preparing for retreat to having a good time without a complain each together . for example , we bought stuff like food , lamp and map and so on from that time . through this experience , we can get a wisdom and good relationship . furthermore , as time go saying , `` experience is best teacher . '' as this example demonstrates , people probably do n't forget the lesson from the experience . i have a friend who is bestfriend in korea . when he had a free time from a company for a 1month . he just woried about whether he should go in a his company group or leding by a tour guide . finally , he choosed that go to travel by a tour guide . he went to california . actually you know there are a lot of beautiful place in here . such a ` laguna beach , seal beach , hill and so on ' but then , the tour guide lead to him and his family to disney land , and la downtown , korea downtown . they got a frustrate that titely schedule which made him . as we have seen , although they get a difficult physical , he should have go to travel with family in a company group to sum up , given the between traveling is in a group and leding by a tour guide . i would choose to first thing . overall , the experience that i went to sanfransisco became part of my life . i whole heartedly agree with the idea that going travel is in a group .
