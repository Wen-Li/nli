i believe that young people enjoy life more than older people do . there are many reason why young people enjoy their life more one reason why young people enjoy life more than older people is that they do n't worry about everything . young people mostly only think from one day to the other and do n't make any future plan . like getting a stable job to feed a family . mostly they wo n't have a family until their mid thirty . another reason why young people enjoy life more than older people is because they are independent . their entire thinking is different from old people . they do n't choose a job only because of the salary they also want to have a fullfilling job which is challenging . a job which offer further option maybe to work in a different country . nowadays young people work to live on - older people live to work . while older people think about security young people sometimes just quit their job if they are not satisfaied anymore . the third reason why young people enjoy life more than older people is because the have more option to enjoy themselves . there are plenty of free time activity they can go to . there many club , bar etc. which meet young people 's interestes . whereas there are only a few club or bar where old people can go to without getting stared at . young people are able to go almost anywhere they want to without any age limit . all together young people have plenty of reason to enjoy life more than older people .
