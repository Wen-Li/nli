i belive motivation is one of the most important quality that make people successful . seeking new opportinities and better way is avoidable . therefore , i strongly agree with the statement that successful individual always try new thing and take risk . my mother always told me a story about my grandfather who wa born in a poor neighbourhood and had no wealth when he wa young . he started business with a very small shoe store . there wa no employee or manager . he wa the only one working there and the store wa neiter famous or popular . he , however , had a ambition to make the store bigger and make more money . he borrowed some money from a bank and bought a land , then expanded the store . the decision wa risky because there wa not guarantee that he could pay the money back . some of my grandfather 's relative , including his own father told him to stop dreaming and be careful because he wa making enough money to support his family . because of his effort , his business wa significantly succeeded and he finally ownedtwo big mall . this great contribution could not be achieved without his risky challanges . he could have chosen to run the small shoe store and have comfortable life a he wa told by his relative . he did not have to worry about failing if he did , but he could not experience the great success a well . being conservative and doing thing we already know are not totally useless . many people choose this way and are satisfied with their situation . however , being motivative and finding better way will teach more lesson to people . only creative and ambitious people can innovate new great idea and be successful . taking a risk is neccesary to be successful in any field .
