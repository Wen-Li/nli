i agree that student must understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact when the student understand idea about any lesson , suppose it is pharmacology , that kind of medical science is hard to be learned by fact . the student when understands pharmacology and the concept in medical term , can use what he learned a a fact in his practice life . the student have to love before understand , and by meaning love , it a childhood love to specific study or work to do , when he grow up . after that he is going to understand the idea of what he love , let u say the he love football , so that is the begining , than he must understand the idea and rule of football , before going to the fact that he maybe a great player . so first love something , whatever it is , game , study , job , anything in the world , than understand very good the idea and concept of what we love , than we may face or learn the fact of what we love . maybe a lot of people agree with learning fact before understanding it , is it helpfull ? maybe yes , it may reach the chooser of this fact to the top , or make him depressed all his longlife , so it is a chance or opportunity to some people to do it , if they want to learn fact before understanding , they may do it but the consequence are not known . actually understanding concept of pharmacy to me , made me love it more than anything else , but when i finish the studying and began to learning fatcs that im working in a field that is full with non honor people , and people using it a a business for money only not for health and money , if i had knewed or learned these fact before i understand pharmacy and medical concept , i definetly would not choose to understand idea and concept of a great science and a very important science in human health and life .
