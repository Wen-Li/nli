it is often said that young people would not spend enough time to helping and supporting their community in our society . i disagree with that opinion . at first , i do not think that interest in policy ha decreased over the year . the most important reason for that is that our system is democratic which mean that people have the ability to vote and can influence policy which is not possible in a dictatorship , for example . another important factor is that every citizen ha this right from a certain age on . in the past , that often depended on the income and woman did not have suffrage at all . today , nearly every political party ha a youth organization , a well . that would not be neccessary , if young people were not interested in policy . furthermore there are a lot of poltical independent organization which concern about the interest of the community . in the past there were neither political youth organization , nor independent poltical youth organzitaions in spite of the decreasing number of people to vote , i think it would be exaggerated to say that young people do not put enough effort or time in helping their community .
