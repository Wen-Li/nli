in my opinion , i agree that traveling with a group of people led by a tour guid is the best way to travel . there are several good reason why i agree with having a tour guid during the travel . first of all , when you will decide to go to a foreign country that you have not ever visit it , you will face some difficulty and a little bit of fear . all of these trouble that you will be faced because of the worryness and anxiety for this trip . also , may be because you do n't have enough required information about that country . so you need some one to help you about the place , shopping mall , good restuarant , lacation of some hotel and so on . according to these challenge , the bast way to keep away these trouble is to travel in a group led by a tour guide who have enough information about the counry more than what you have . second reason why i personaly prefer that because i think it is safer for you and your family . i rememberd when i and my family traveled to italy , we encountered some criminal and drug people who we do n't know how to deal with them . however , although my father had solve this problem , i think if we had a guid with u that will be more easy for u . the third and last reason is we choose to travel to have some relax and have a rest away our work , duty and responsibility . actually , if you want to do that you should be away from all these trouble that , of course , you will be facing it such a ask some citizen people to have some information about a i said in the begining `` where can i find this hotel ? '' , `` where are the recreation center ? '' , `` what is the best restuarant do you have here ? '' and lot of these dum question . you may also do not know how to speak their language since you are not a native speaker . in short , personally i prefer to travel with a tour guide to keep away all of these headach .
