there is a statement that have drawn my attention , it say `` young people enjoy people more than older people do '' . well , i have looked over the statement several time and thought of it so well until thing became so clear in my mind , and i reviwed scene from my personsal life and found out that it is n't true , because i have seen my grandmother , who life her life enjoying every moment , and ha everything she love around her . she spends her time planting fruit and vegetable and flower around her house , and she spendsher day in visiting her loved one , a they all live in a small village , she take a nap at noon , then spends her evening with her grandson . i have asked her once : `` are you happy with the life your living ? '' , she replied : `` well , honey , i wa never a happy , i feel that i do not let a moment of my life go without living it '' . this wa surprised because i have always thought that we , the young , enjoy life most . then , i thought of taking a glimpse of my life , and after a long look , i found out that i do not really spend my time in hat i love to do , and i had the explanation for that , which is ll the other hings ihave to do , because i am still a dependent person in everythingm and i can not do whatever i like to do because there is a duty that i have to do in life , while my grandmother is independent , know what she want , andhas the time to do it all , so she 's the one who 's given the chance to enjoy her life . well this doe not only apply otme , but it alsoapplies to all of my friend , because we , the young , feel that time is going really fast , and we have many many thing to do , so we do not enjoy our life , but we rather use it in accomplishing the goal we have to reach .
