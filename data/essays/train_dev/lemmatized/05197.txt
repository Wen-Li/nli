as it is rightly stated by someone that ` prevention is always better than cure ' . the world is looking to this by saving and preventing the extreme use of natural resource . so i definitely agree with the idea or statement that in twenty year there will be fewer car in use than there are today . to support this i would like to state few of my view a follows . in my coutry like india , where there is tremendous population and for travel purpose there is enormous number of vehicle . more vehicle talk about the private vehicle especially car , which is used a mode of transport for the entire family , or say individual car for each family member . just imagine what do they do ? they only add to the pollution of the environment . as in air , noise and water pollution . it doe not only add pollution but also wastage of natural resource like petrol and diesel . and for this we have to depend on the gulf country . wherein it is only upto the economical crisis , which indirectly is seen in hiking price of petrol . what when this resource get over , traveling will not only become expensive with other alternative but also impossible one day . some western country have accepted the fact and started more conventional , cheaper and better way of traveling . like traveling on cycle to their work place , place where they have to visit often . by cutting down on air and noise pollution , i think that 's a very wise decision one can take , in order to prevent future problem . also travelling on bicycle , one can do cycling exercise everyday which is always good for one 's health . i think that it is smart decision , if taken by our govrnment can prove tremendously useful well on which government is already thinking . and be a ` stepping stone ' to prevent hazardous problem . and with this thinking and implication in future definitely i think that there be reduction in private vehicle especially the car in next twenty year .
