in this set of material , according to the reading passage . i agree with the statement ` successful people try new thing and take risk rather than only doing what they already know how to do well ' . in this competitive world one have to be able to fight or handle , the different kind of situation that arises in becoming him a successful man or take him towards , glory or victory . one have to be very hard working and very fast and clevere to compete and to lead in the race of success . a succewssful man according to me is a person who take risk rather than working or doing a single thing in which they already have knowledge and they have hope that they are the best in that field . according to my opinion a ` successful ' man is a person who take risk and lead the nation . people should take risk and try new thing through which , they can succeed . many great people have taken risk for getting success in there work . for example , the egyptian people have made churches with great height which wa not possible until the romans period . they took a risk and constructed the churches not only with a great height , but also took a risk and made the possibility of making window in between the dome with the help of ` barrel vault ' . so , according to my opinion a person is not ` successful ' until and unless he take risk . he is able to learn more thing or able to understand the different field which he is not familiar about . taking risk , make him think more this improves his ability to think and get closer to the thing which he is not familiar about . one 's he is succeded he get a name and he becomes familiar . by taking risk his mind power for thinking increase and he able to decide and get to a good conclude that whether , he is able to achieve that goal or not . so , at last i conclude that one is not successful in his life until and unless he take risk .
