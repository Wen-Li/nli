i unfortunately agree that the yuth in our time not sharing enough ihn the community development . if we compared this share with available type of community need . i am always asking my self . why this small available helping hand . in deed i see the need for the volunteering effort are increasingly clear specialy in the developing country . one side of the community need is the need for the donatiions to get money to help the poor or even the hungry people allover the world , in addition to that these donation can be channeled to help the poor student to complete thier education , more over the richy man can patronize some of the sporic event to maintain the good health of theyuth in the poor town . in other area that need the help of the rich , is developing some environmental project that can recycle the wast droducts in the poor country . this type of help not only with economic value but also ha a great effect on improving the health of the communitty due to minimizing the epidemic disease caused by the pollution . at the end i can see a lot o area people can help community to develope . but again the question arise ; why this little effort have been given from the yuth to th ecommunity ? in my point of view there are some cause for the answer . firstly , the government in many country control the donatiions of the volunteer insisting to expend in special area , which dissatisfies the donner . secondly th eperiorities of the yuth now is for fullfiling the the basic need for their life wich are endlessly changing and very ycoastly than befor which not only take moneyy but also take alot of time . this mone and time can be channeled to the community if th ey are simle need a before .
