i partly agree and disagree . on the one hand i consider a broad knowledge of many academic subject a something valuable , something that make you a better scientist or researcher a you might get a broader view on a problem . on the other hand specializing in one specific field help you to concentrate on specific problem - you have the chance to go beyond the surface of a field or subject without getting sidetracked . it depends on where you see your career and on your talent . if you want to work in - let 's say - medical research , than a broad knowledge of modern and ancient language , philosophical idea and school might turn you into an interesting conversation partner , but it clearly doe n't help you to come up with a cure for cancer . to come up with a cure for a desease - that is actually hundred of different deseases - you have to specialize in your specialization - and you have to start at an early point with that . if you want to work a a philosopher than your work will benefit from a broad - but still deep - knowledge . some people might ask , what we need philosopers for , but that is a different question . so the question is more should the university give student the chance to `` linger around '' , to change subject , to build an academic personality if this is necessary for their chosen field of career . it seems that today no-one is willing to give you the time and resource to develop your academic profile over a long period . which is a pitty a so many praised author and scientist founded their career and their idea on the broad knowledge they established over a long period of learning . the trend go towards shorter education period a finacial resource are limited . this is unfortunately a fact that we ca n't change . sad is , that the decision made towards shorter , specialized education system are mostly based on financial consideration and they hardly leave room for exception .
