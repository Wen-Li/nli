travelling top the list of many people 's choice to spend their leisure time for . but whether to follow a group led by a tour guide remains a controversial question for the traveller at their planning stage of the tour . in my opinion , the best way to travel ha little to do with following a large group . people tend to rely on a group and stick to it for security or consensus or whatever they needed , but when it come to travelling , thing might fall on the opposite side . the assertion of unity mean the denial of freedom , it is especially ture when , with the guide of a tour guide , one can not indulge himself in the freedom of choosing what travelling site to visit or what time to start and there is a greater chance that the true meaning of travelling , relaxation being my defenition , might be raped by argument and complaint . some people would contridict my point by saying that a tour guide offer valuable and well-informed suggestion that would make a better trip . but is n't there enough news of tourist being cheated or made use of for the sake of tour guide ' benefit ? by saying this , i am not saying that tourist are more skilled at escaping trick when travelling by themselves , nor am i judging the moral standard of all tour guide , it 's just that is n't it even sadder to be fooled when certain investment and trust and already been placed on the tour guide ? in addition , travelling fullfills different purpose for different people . some want to escape the hustle and bustle of the city , some wish to explore the unknown world , some aspire to adventure through exciting place , and none of these seem attainable by following the lead of a tour guide whose job is to keep everyone in sight and control . good or bad , there is no absolute truth , however , we always have the right to chase what we want when travelling .
