first of all i want to say , what the question deal with . i am asked if it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subject or if it is better to specialize in one specific subject . there are many advantage and disadvantage for both side . on my opinion it would be better if you have a broad knowledge of many subject . the reason why this is on my opinion will be written down in the following text . first i want to say , that if you have a broad knowledge you will be able to work in more company . so it would be easier to get a job after you finished your school of academic . maybe the company you want to be hired is searching for a person who know thing of every part of a firm . a reason can be that the firm want to be more free to hire someone . then they can hire you for a work but if a person of another work is missed , you are able to do his work too . furthermore i have to explain that it is easier to know something about every academic part than specializing in one part . you should know everything about this part . i want to give an example . if you want to specalize in marketing , you have to know everything about it . you can only be hired in this part of a firm . and if you are not be needed in this part of the firm you will be kicked . but if you have the knowledge of several part you have the possibility to work for example in the selling part of the firm . a third advantage of a broad knowledge is that it is more interesting to learn new thing . you can learn new thing in all part of academic . it would be boring if you do the same thing the whole of your life . a broad knowledge give yiu the possibility that you can change yor work . your life would be more exiting . to finish the text i want to give reason why this is on my opinion . i am studying buisness . but i am studying in all part of buisness . so i can look with part will be good for me . maybe i will specialize my knowledge later but i know many thing of other academic part too . so i will be more flexible than other worker later .
