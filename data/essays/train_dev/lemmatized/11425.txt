it is better to have broad knowledge of many accademic subject than to specialize in one subject . we will see in a first part why i schouldn t agree with this statement and in a second part why i schoud agree . i schouldn t agree with this statement . indeed , i think in a first way that it can be better for a pupil to specialize in one specific subject . every body have a favourite subject , a passion . it would be more interresting for the student to work in his favourite subject , he would work with happiness , and would like what he is doing . for exemple , a student who love mathemathiq would rather prefer working in a scientific subject than in a art subject . he will have an idea of what to do for a job , he will be in good healthy . i schould agree with this statement . firstly , i think that it can be good to study different academic subect . indeed , this might be verry interrissing to have various subject , from scientific to philosophical . for exemple , if a student doesn t like a subject , he would have other subject that he should like . althought he would have lot of assignements , he would know about lot of thing in the world moreover , a student can be bored , annoyed with just one specific subject to conclude , i can say that i m always at school and i am more scientific . next year , i would choose just one specific subject and i think it s verry interressing to change my way of life . i think i would rather prefer next year because i would have just my favourite subject math . but , it wa verry interressant to study differnts subects during my study .
