most advertisement are making product seem much better than they are even thoug others are not . firstly , i used some product which wa not a useful a it wa in the commertial . secoundly , most advertiesments are showing increadable usage of their product . that is why i think most advertisement are making their product seem better than they are . i used some make up product in order to relieve some skin problem . its advertisement wa very good prapere becouse it wa shown a a really good product . however , when i tried it , it did not work well . most of advirtisements are the same . when people use them , people see that they are not a good a they were shown in in addition to this , most of the advertiesments are showing many increadable thing and most of them do not seem true . for example , a acne cleaning jel advertiesement is showing how the product is effective . the advertiesment is telling that acne problem will disappear in 1 week . this is not posiable . even though people who ha acne problem use increadably good product , acne problem can not disappear in one week . on the other hand advertiser are using some famous star in order to make their advertiser better . even though they use famous people i do not believe this kind of advertiesments . that is why i do not prefer to buy product have this kind of advertisement .
