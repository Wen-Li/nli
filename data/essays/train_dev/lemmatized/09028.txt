to say : `` in twenty year there will be fewer car in use than there are today '' is a joke . every year in this world the number of car circulating is increasing , new country are developing , the work 's market need more flexibility and everyone of u want to have the freedom of going wherever and whenever we want . if we think about china we can see that it 's trying to follow the first world with it economy so we can imagine that in the future they will follow our manner so probably they will wish a u a car for ownself and a car for their child . if that happen the number of the car will be necessarily higher than now . in addition the number of people living on earth is going to become bigger and so everyone will have his owncar . another problem that can increase the car ' number is that very often the public transport system is not very useful because there are not ride during the night or the frequency of the ride is not enough or the train and bus are so busy and owercrowded that can be a real challenge to cach them . in addition , a happen very often in italy ( a today ) , the public transport is not available because the worker do n't go to work to protest with the government or with the employer on the other hand the number of available parking will be ever fewer and so that can be a deterrent to reduce the car . in addition the request of fuel will be too much higher ( increased by the car ' number ) and a ever happen in the market the petrol price will be so high that someone will have to leave his own car at home using public transport .
