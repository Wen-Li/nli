yes i agree with following statement . it is more important for student to understand idea and concept than learning fact . as life is a short period so the student cant experience or learn every thing in fact . when coming to understanding the idea and coccepts it one of the life cycle for the student . as student face many kind of idea and concept in class while listening to the class . student come to know many kind of concept while reading a book or listening to the lecture in the class . the student is supposed to create idea while reading book . understanding the idea of other people like class mate or friend is very important in the student life , because many people have many idea and concept . by understanding the idea of other people the student can learn many thing related to life and survive ni his life at any stage with out facing any problem . if the student fails in catching the idea and concept of other people he will face many problemsin life . some people ha the idea of solving any kind of problem by their idea and concept which he faced regularly in his life . by having idea on a perticular job which ha to finish by the student he can survive and completes the job at any kind of difficulty he face in the path of completing the job . for example the student prepares for a seminar and prepared a paper work for the seminar . but he lost the information prepared by him . but he is not discouraged and the idea and the concept he prepared encourages him to complete the task in time . this is the main advantage for the student to understant the idea and concept than to leatn fact . favts can be learned by the experience faced by the student in his life . every thing in the life cant be experienced a stated below . as there is no experience for the student in facing the seminar but he completes it perfectle with the idea and concept . for this reason iagree with the above statement
