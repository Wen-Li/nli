i agree with the statement that say : `` succesfull peaple try new thing and take risk rather than only doing what they already know how to do well '' for more different thing : at first , if you do n't try to do something different from what you already know how to do you are not able to change you 're condition of life . for exemple , if the men never try do somethin new or better than before , the civilitation never go on or change . we ca n't image how could be our life if peaple like leonardo da vinci , volta , newton , einstain and a lot of other peaple like them never tryed to find something differt from what they already knew . all the scientific resource are based on this way of think , try to find something better from what still exist . for exemple we need to find new medicine for make the life better . in 2020 we hope that the expectation of life become higher , and it will be only for medicine and doctor who are searching new medicine . also in the personal financial meaning take risk is very important , because if you do what you already know how to do , probably like other peaple , you can earn enouth money for live , but you will never be rich . for exemple , if bill gates never tryed find a new way for use the computer , now he could n't be who he is , and also all the peaple who use the computer have to say thanks to him . another important point is that a men , for live an happy life , have to change something sometimes , if he doe n't do that , his life will be so boring . i
