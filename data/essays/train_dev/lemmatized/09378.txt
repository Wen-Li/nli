i agree that student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact . it is that this statement is for student . do you think about it that if student doe n't like study for themselves . it make big problem . first , if student doe n't understand or misunderstand , it make to go wrong way to student . students want to know knew impormations , but they do n't understand well about knw impormations . so , they need teacher who make to understand them . if it doe n't important for student , student do n't have attention . so they become that they doe n't like attention about new idea . secondly , they want to interesting study . if student doe n't understand idea , it is that their class is not interesting to them . i experience about that , too . when i wa highschool student , i do n't like english because my english teacher alway hit me with my grade . i want to study english but my teacher did n't . he always do quiz and test and he hit me with their grade . i think it is problem that it is exept to understand . finally , in school , student wnat to play without study . because their subject are without understanding . for example , korea ha many academy for that they help student can go unversity . academies teach interesting more than school . and they teach fast more than school . so , school are bouring to student . students always sleep in school and after school , they study hard in academy . it is wrong education system , in conclution , understanding is important more than learn fact for student . it will decide their future and contries destiny . we offer for their future . it is that our future become to go good way .
