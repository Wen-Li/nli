people always discus that which one is more imporatnt betwee understanding idea or concept and learning fact . in my opinion , make student learn fact is more useful and helpful than just make them understand the concept and idea . first of all , if student just understant the idea and the concept then when they face the problem in the real world they will not know how to solve it . the propuse of people learn knowledge is they want to studt how to use these information to solve the proble in the society , so master the skill to face and deal with the problem that they have is the most important rask . secondly , let the student learn fact throuhg the practice can make them more clever and give them much important information . throuhg their experience they can learn many thing that they can not study in the classroom . these useful information and experience can teach them ues thier own way to solve the difficult problem and make them become more wise . thirdly , if people can understant how to face the fact then they will have a better relationship with other people and the whole society . they will use a suitable way to consider their life , and do a better choice . the connection between single person and the whole society also will become bettter . people live in a complex real world all the time , we will meet many different peolple and many difficult problem , but if we can understand the fact completely and know how to use the right way to solve them , then we can get a bettter life . because of these rasons , learning how to face the fact become a so imporatnt thing in people 's life , if we can learn and understand fact but not just know the concept and idea .
