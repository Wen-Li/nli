some people say that successful person will not be willing to do what they know already but try new thing out . i strongly agree this statement , and i have reason for my this . people sometimes talk about this line `` a hero is someone who is doing a common thing in a not common way '' what make a people successful is that he/she make a defference in something . if the person just follow the rule already there and doe the thing what they already know , how can he/she be different ? how can he/she be special ? for people already succeeded . in order to survive among all those succeful people , they always choose to try new thing to make them more successful . like most scientist , they could spend their whole life time in lab for researching , discouvering a new effcient way to make something instead of what we are using now . in fact , the public recognize those peope who invent new thing or discover something new which are very useful for people . the gorverment rise scholoship , the university provide fellowship , many company and organization give money for people do research a well . a successful people will not refuse to take the risk to become for successful and make a defferent with those help . all in all , my conclusion is successful people try new thing and take risk rather than only doing what they already know how to do , however , what they are going to do is completely based on what we already know , knowledge is the rule .
