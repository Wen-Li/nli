it is realy difficult to say broadly that it is the best to travel in a group led by a tour guide , or to plan for your tour yourself . there are several factor contributing in making an opinion . if i am travelling to a new place that i did not visit before and have no experience or knowledge about it best place , timing , sight tour , historical place and recreational location , then , of course , having it professionally arranged by a tourism company and being led by a guide will be the best option . this will save time and effort and in the same time will provide the best to see and to do in the place i am visiting . the trip will be professionally preplanned and i do n't have to worry about transportation or gathering information or going into the hassle of the unknown or unexpected . another good point is being a member in a tour group will give me an excellent opportunity to get in touch with other people from different background and be acquainted with other culture . it is a golden chance to make new friendship relation and enjoy talking to people out of the usual circle of person in my ordinary daily life . on the other hand , if i am travelling with my family or with a group of close friend and i know the place or country i am addressing , then i would prefer to go on my own in such trip . having visited that place , probably more than one time , mean that i have the sufficient experience and knowledge a regard where to go , what to see or visit , and when to do this or that in the proposed program . in this case i may be the personal guide to my companion ! i do prefer this last option in case i am travelling with my family to a place i know very well . it save me money and give me and my familiy the advantage of flexibility in planning and in keeping privacy . it also give u the opportunity to strengthen or family bond and enriches our relation to each other without being tied or perplexed with obligation to the rest of the tour group .
