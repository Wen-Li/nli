i agree with the statement that in twenty year from now , there will be fewer car in use that were today . more and more new car are getting added to city traffic every day . improving economic condition are encouraging people to purchase a car on their own instead of using the public transport system . the city 's infrastructure is not being able to grow proportionately to the traffic resulting increase of jamming of traffic and accident . a recent health survey ha shown that people who get stuck up in traffic jam are more prone towards stress affecting both their pesonal and professional life . also , not to forget the pollution of air and sound these vehicle cause everyday . one more important factor that would discourage the car usage in coming time is the constant rise in fuel charge and lack of availability of immediate and reliable alternative . the fuel production is not able to catch up with the alarming increase in the fuel consumption . with the advent of metro rail and other advanced public transprt mechanism which carry huge of number of people with short span of time to their destination , people would be inclined to use them than risking themselves getting stuck in a bad traffic jam . with aggresive promotion of usage of public transport system by the government , the number of car could significantly decrease . also , with people experimenting with newer idea of car-pooling where a car is shared by a group of people instead each one of them driving one on their own may significantly see in the reduction of number of vehicle on the road . owing to all these factor , people in coming year will be le inclined to use their car .
