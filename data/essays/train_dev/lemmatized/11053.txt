some people think that young people enjoy life more than older people do . in a few aspect , i agree this idea , but generaly i do n't agree this idea . i do n't support the idea that young people enjoy life more than the older people do . because , according to my life concept , enjoyment of the life doe n't depends to people 's age . enjoyment of the life depends on the person ' characteristic . in my company , there are two example to this topic . the first example is that one of the my colleague is who is twenty year old is very pessimistic . she doe n't enjoy life . she act a if she is going to die tomorrow . for that reason , she doe n't enjoy life . second example is that i have a fifty-three year old coworker . she enjoys life more than my young friend who is twenty year old and very pessimistic . the old lady is always happy . she make plan for night and weekend for fun . every year she travel abroad , take picture and tell all of the colleague . also , she is very funny , somedays she praperes small joke for our young and for pessimistic colleague to make her optimistic . also , i am familiar with that some people ' age affect their life vision . for example , with my mother we go wedding ceremony , i invite my mother for traditional dance . my mother sometimes refuse me and say that she is too for dance old , intead of older people youngers could play . i think my mother age affect her , and diminishes her enjoyment of life . some people think that enjoyment of life ha coherrent relationship with age , but on the contrary i believe that people enjoyment of life is depend on their characteristic . as i implied before one of the my twenty year old coworker le enjoys life . but , on the other side my fifty-three year old collegue enjoys life more than my younger friend .
