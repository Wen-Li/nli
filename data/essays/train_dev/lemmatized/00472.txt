`` young people nowadays '' , this is a dangerous expression to start a thesis . it carry a negative tone , a musty `` in my day people knew how to behave ... '' flavour , older than ancient greece . it is hard not to disagree with anything starting that way . refering to the statement a such , one ha to differenciate . there are a lot of young people engaged in activity dentrimental to society . this certainly should change . and there is never enough time spent in helping the community , most social organisation are working at the very limit of their resource and barely scratching the surface of the problem they try to remedy . but that is true for all age group . furthermore social engagement is not considered very `` cool '' by most young people . but there are notable exeptions and a lot of sport group , boy scout or christian ( or any other religion ) youth organisation wo n't work without the time and effort devoted by teenager and people in their early twenty . so i think the main problem is to recruit more people into social engagement , regardless of their age . society ha to change it 's attitude towards helping the community to achieve this , not just the young generation . therefore i do not agree with the statement a stated above .
