i do n't agree with this statement . cars have an important place in our life . i 'm almost sure we ca n't think of leaving our car at home and go to work by bus or simply walking , if we know that we have the possibility to do it by driving our car . we trust car , the majority of u believe that car have been the best invention of ever and that anything will ever substitute them . if nowadays car are so important , thinking of the next twenty year i 'm sure that they will gain importance instead of losing it . if a family is composed of four people , we will have a many car a the number of people having a driving license . this mean that if each of them can drive , we will have four car . a possible explanation is related to our need to have our own car . cars help u to feel indipendent . we can leave and we can come back whenever we want and the only thing we need to do is to drive . however , car mean pollution . there have been a lot of promotion thaht have tried to prevent u from using our car but they have failed . everyone of u know car damage the environement because of the toxic gas they produce . sometimes , when something reminds u of it , we even think about catching a bus or going for a walk but we never do it . car is comfortable , it can take u everywhere and we ca n't stop from using it . the only possibility we have to leave our car at home is to find a faster , cheaper and more comfortable way to travel . if we find a valid substitute for the car , perhaps in the next twenty yars there will be le car than today . however , i ' sure that nothing will ever been a perfect a the car .
