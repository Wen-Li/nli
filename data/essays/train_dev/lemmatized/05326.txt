because of the importance of advertisement in our modern society , this question seems quite interesting and could be also written this way : do advertisement lie to u ? it always seems to u that the good we see on tv or in magazine are perfect , or far better than they actually are , and we are often disappointed by the real product once we have bought it . but could an advertisement work if he told u that what he want u to buy is only quite good or not that bad ? advertisements are closer to propaganda than information and it ca n't be helped . on an other hand , some advertisement are willing to give some result or mark that their product were given by different organisation , association or consumer and we 're eager to believe that , most of the time . we must n't forget that customer are usually well protected by law which punish lie in advertisement but here is n't the problem . indeed , the problem is that people usually do n't make any difference between the picture and the thing itself , and are too eager to think that what they see just in front of them is real and ideal . they always look for something perfect but ca n't realise that perfection doe n't exist , moreover low-cost perfection . advertisements show u the best side of what they want to be baught and it could n't be an other way , we ca n't blame it for that and furthermore we should face our own responsabilities by training to be more critical and careful in our decision . the fact is that advertisement do n't make product seem far better than they really are because only the consumer see what is beautiful , it 's a kind of game with the consumer who stay the only one to decide if he actually like , need or want .
