i strongly agree with this statement which say `` in twenty year there will be fewer car in use than there are today '' . nowadays , commoding by car ha become a major problem a it take or kill lot of time in travelling because of drastic increase in traffic in the country . and one can not really control the traffic instead one can travel by motor bike or take goverment service ( by train , bus or air bus ) . so in next twenty year technically we can hardly see people travelling by car . one of the most prominent reason could be , people are not secured when they are travelling by car a they see many acccidents occuring in the city without any mistake . people usually might visit late night party , club , disco and people may cosume alcohol and after that driving car can lead to disaster a drunken driving is anytime not advisable . the other reason can be , when you are going on a long drive and if your car break down and we really cant fix the problem in that situation we have to call ourselves helpless and there could be any problem we might have to face in such terrible situation . but when one travel in goverment service and one can really enjoy all the benefit been offered by the goverment in that particular bus or train . one can also consume food , can sleep , chat , play , etc . .. and the best part is that they can travel safely and in a secure manner . we are all aware of the fact that human being are very intelligent and they really have idea of what the importance of life is and would prefer to take a secure mode for travelling instead going by car which is anytime not safe . finalyl , i would like to conclude that in the next twenty year there will be fewer car in use a people love to travel with different mode and are fully satisfied with facility that they are getting in different mode of travelling than travelling or using car .
