to begin with , everyday the manufacture and usage of car are becomin more and more . and hence the high percentage of pollution level in our country . . and at the same time . . car have become a necessity unlike food to survive . . there are advantage and disadvantage to the following statement , `` in twenty year there will be fewer car in use than there are today '' . firstly the advantage for fewer car in use is that : - 1. the main aspect is pollution , if the supply of the car have become le in number automatically the usage will reduce and hence the pollution . . 2. every one love travelling in a fast mean to get there target on time , for this they use a faster mean of transport . so when the situation is that way if it is outstation , where is the need of a car one would rather take a flight or a helicopter to meet there target by which the expense and rate for each transportation i.e for flight and helicops . . will come down to reasonable rate . . disadvantages : - 1.as every individual have become accustomed to their own life , when this new concept arises people would automatically take a back step for not using car than walking down to some store . for example , in india , people have a tendency to be lazy enough to get their thing done .. that is if a person want to get his thing from a near by super market he would rather prefer going in his car than walking down to get them . 2. the market share and value it got now on car , wont be having then a in the next twenty year buying a car will be an asset like owing a flight or a land a their price will be put up that high . . a the commodity value is le in number the price will be high . to conclude , i do agee with the quotation that there will be fewer car in the next twenty year , but at the same time i say that it would be very costly affair to get the quote right with every individual . .
