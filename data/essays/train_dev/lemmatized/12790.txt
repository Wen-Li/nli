i agree successful people try new thing and take risk rather than only doing what ther already know how to do well . successful people always try new thing because they can see the long view in their eye . why they will want to try the new thing ? this question is similiar a why people will creat new thing which old people never imaging befor . it is because people all need to grow up . how can we grow up ? if we always do some thing we alreafy know how to do well , can we grow up ? it is n't said do the old thing is not good at all , we need to do that but succeessful people will do that when they take risk . so what will succeessful people do ? succeessful people will try some difficult thing they never do . maybe they will fall down but they can learn a lot form ther fall down . for example , a man always play foodball in high school , he wa the team 's leader and many college invide him to go to their school to play foodball . he go to one of those college and he have long vacation during this time . what should he do ? play foodball again and again ? no , he use this time to study by himself . he know he can not play foodball forever so when he have time he work hard to study . in the end of story , he transfur to another famous college to study commurce . is he a succeessfull person ? he make coise to study when he is free because he see the long tern in his futhure . people always do some thing their already know because they are afraid . they afraid their will do wrong thing . succeeful people will take risk because they believe even they fall down they still can learn a lot that help them succeed .
