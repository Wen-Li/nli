i believe that it is better to have broad knowdledge of many academic subject than to specialize in one specific subject . by this way , we will be able to talk about many subject when it is necessary , it will be more fun to learn new thing rather than focusing on only one thing and it will be much more easier to focus on one subject in the future when you have some knowdledge about all subject . people are usually more likely to respect to a person who have some knowdledge about any of the topic . in my opinion , everyone should be able to add something to the conversation when there is a discussion . if we have a broader knowdledge , this will make u more privileged . at the same time , we will easily adopt ourselves to the conversation compared to the one who is specialized in one subject , because we have a basis of that informatin before . on the other hand , it will be much more fun to learn new thing about different subject . because humanbeings are more likely to learn new thing and this will help u develop ourselves . in the process of learning , different topic are usually much more successful to grab people 's attention . what 's more , specializing in one subject is the next step of having broad knowdledge about different subject . first of all we should all become familiar with different academic subject . we should study many subject briefly and try to gain some information . after that , according to our interest we should determine the area that fit best to our interest . finally , we can sum that learning deeper about one subject , specializing , is the part which come after having broader knowdledge about many academic subject . at the first glance , you do n't need deeper knowdledge . after practicing many subject simply , it would be easier to choose the subject that you should specialize .
