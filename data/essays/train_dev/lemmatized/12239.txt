i do not agree with the topic . i think in twenty year there will be more car in use than there are today . one of the reason for my disagreement with the statement is that twenty year ago there were fewer car than today . i can remember going arround the city i live twenty year ago and there were not a many car a there are today . so , if the world still growing the same way , in twenty year we will have plenty of car in use . although i think car are very usefull , i find the traffic very annoying for the day life , but i have to learn to live with it a i think the number of car is going to rise even more than we have today . moreover , another reason to think that we will have more car in the future is that the price will get lower and people would be able to buy a car . ages ago a television wa so expensive that only a few could buy it , but throughout the year the television ha become so popular and common that the price have low down . that is what i think it is going to happen with car . i also think more second hand car will be in sale , so people will be able to get them and a a result we will have more car in use . in conclusion , i do not think in twenty year there will be fewer car than there are today a the world is expanding so quickly and it is overcrowding over the year .
