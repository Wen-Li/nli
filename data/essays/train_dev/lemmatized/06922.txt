one day i woke up i heard my dad fighting with my mom for who take the car and go to work and the other to go by a cap , from that reason my dad bought to my mom a car so i disagree that will be fewer car in the coming twenty year . cars is one of the most important thing that people cant live without , without car people wont be able to go to work or live their life the way they want . cars is the main thing that is making life easier these day . there are many reason why number of car will not decrease for the coming year . one of the most important reason is that car is the object that help someone go to work and get what the family need . first of all , people use car to go work and do their job and get everythin that the family need also it allows them to do many thing they like . also one of the most important reason is that the car help from moving from place to another . many people need car for going from their house for example to visit their family . after that car are made for moving from place to place wheither it far or near . finally , these day number of car increased because amny student are graduating from school and they close the age of 18 and they apply for the license to have a car . all people like to drive and mostly teenager . these day who turn to the age of 18 applies for the license test and later on they get a car . in conclusion , i dont think that number of car will decrease no matter what and through the example i mentioned car rate will keep on increasing for the coming day and year .
