considering the fact that driving a car is getting the most stressful and exaggerating way to get from one place to the other because of the huge number of car on our street that produce traffic jam of intolarable length , i think it is without question that we should have fewer car not only in twenty year but soon . the other possiple solution to build more and broader road is improper due to environmental reason . the debate taking place about climate change and the convincing argument scholar are giving u for the fact that , if we go on emissing such large ammounts of co2 , we are going to face a serious climate catastrophe , show that we are forced to think of alternative to the nowadays used car . but i do not think personal transpotation system in some other way will still be in use in twenty year . i hope that by then we will be able to use a type of energy that on the one hand doe not pollute the air and on the other hand is regrowing . i am of the conviction that fossile energy is not a technique of the future . an other point i would like to discus is the question if people could live without car , maybe even should . taking into consideration the million of people killed in car accident i come to the conclusion that we should use a safer transportation system like train . of course we face the disadvantage that a given person is way more flexible when taking the car than when taking the train or other public transportation system . i would recomment an improvement in these system , for example a better network and more train , in order to make the use of safer technique more attractive . coming to an end i would like to again express my hope , that at some point in time we will be independend from car a we now know them with their noise , smell and negative consequenses on the environment and our health .
