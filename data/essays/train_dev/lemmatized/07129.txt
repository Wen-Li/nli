having risk may mean to open l ? fe to new are . it may be dangerous but it is necessry for development , i believe . otherwise , most probably mankind would not come to the point he is at the moment . i will try to discus how man ? mproved his exitence on earth taking risk and signing so many succesful project in the course of history . i will also support the idea from my own life . the first example to be given for such courageus initives would be the invention of fire . fire ha been the most determining find in the history of man . the f ? rst person who found the fire obviously took an incredible risk in his or her life . apparently , it wa not easy for that person to trancend the supersticions of his culture . but the person gifted a marvelous present to mankind . let me give you another example : colombus took a tremendous risk to reach to the new world . that great journey wa the exploration of a new part of the world , of course , for the one who lived in the east part of the word . as a matter of fact , it wa so great a succes that the map of the world ha changed after this succesfull but very risky journey . i would like to give you an example instane from myself . after graduation from high school i should have a university examination to enter university . my transcript did not show a great success in my high school education . i could accept this situation and i could go a university according to my level of success . with also the help and supprt oa my family , however , i embarked upon studying the examination . this wa a turning poin in my life . rather tan sitting at home and waiting for my fate i tried to change my life course . it wa a success and i could be able to enter a prestigious college . to change something in the world also mean tking risk . our world improves with courageus initiative of brave man , i believe . this ha always been my principle in my life .
