i totally agree with this idea . this statement is an summary of all scientist , explorer etc . i think this statement ha something to do with personal value . some people are ready to use sth which someone else ha already did it or worked on it . these kind of people think that they are very clever . is it really so ? in the short term , they are succesful . but in the long term , they are not . what happens is they can not improve themselves for the future . there is saying `` education or training go on through our lifetime '' . everybody ha to do sth at a definite period of his/her life . if we want to be successful at the end , we must keep trying and taking risk . that brings to a conlusion that in our life there are thing we can learn from our family member , teacher in the school and there are thing we need to learn by ourselves . those who do not try and take risk , they can never learn anything new . so , in our society , there becomes a group of people at the same level of information . by the time , people who try new thing and take risk train themselves . at the beginning of my essay , i mentioned that trying is personal way of life . personally i always try new thing even though there is a risk to fail . after 20 year , i see those people not taking risk are at the same level of their life . they always need somebody to teach them . i n our daily life we say experiment , experiment . .. this is a tool for scientific development . if we look at those scientist lived in the past , they did not innovate or discover sth at their firts attempt . it requires lot of time to reach a conlusion on spesific subject . let 's look at the human life . in the old day , man were living in a very bad and poor condition . years and year after , man is exploring life out of our earth . how did we manage to come to a level like this ? by trying , taking risk . to fly in the air , many people have been sacrificed .
