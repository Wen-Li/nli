i disagree with the statement that say `` most advertisments make there product seem much better than they really are. '' for many reason . one of the most simplest reason but most effective resons is that false advertisement is illegal in most countrey 's , if not in all country 's . so it 's not very inteligant for someone to lie about the quality of a product . another very logical reason is that all production company ( no matter what the product is ) doesnt want the consumer to dislike the product , or be surprised to what the product turn out to be after have high aspactations to what it would be like , because the goal of an advertisement is to make people want ot buy the product , and be happy with haveing it . if product arent a good a the advertisement say the are , the reaction of the buyer would be not to buy . which is the exact opposite of the goal of an advertivement , and that will cause the product to fail in the market . if you ask people if they every had bought something that didnt meet the quality of it product , you will probibly find that most of the product accually meet to what wa said in the advertisment . and the key word in the statement is `` most '' . so do most advertisement make product seem much better that what they really are ? ! i think not given the reason above .
