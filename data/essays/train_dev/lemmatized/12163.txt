the mentioned statement discus the number of car in the future and thus , it need to be critically considered . when the production of car started they were only luxury thing for people that were able to spend a lot of money . but after a couple of time scientist developed car that were available for everyone . from there on the industry for car wa growing and growing . today car have material and immaterial value for human being . some people only need the car to be flexible and they love it for it comfortness . other people love the car for their special surface etc . cars are determining human being in so many way that no one could imagine to live without them . but car have also negative effect , especially on the environment . because of the air pollution the government want the people to reduce the car use . some city have an alarming air pollution caused by the car . thus , in the future a restriction should help to decrease the pollution . but would this cause a reduction of the car in use ? in some way this will be practicable because some city do not allow it citizen to drive within the city . this surely reduces the car in use . but not only environemental reason can cause a reduction of the car in use . especially the booming development of airplane and fast traines decrease the use of car . today people are able to get cheap flight which bring them faster to another point in the world than a car would . airplanes and fast traines offer the customer to travel a long distance in a short time and furthermore , in a comfort and cheap way . as oil price are contantly rising a normal human being ha great cost to travel by car . thus , airplane and train are accomodate alternative to car . concerning the mentioned argument i can support the statement . in my opinion there will be fewer car in use due to the alternative medium - airplane and traines . but this will not cause a reduction of car , but only a reduction of the use of the car .
