i strongly disagree with the idea that it is more important for student to understant idea and concept that it is for them to learn fact . there are three below mentioned reason for the same . first , if a student ha a vague idea of a contructive plan this can not be put to action without taking fact into consideration . for example , if a student want to invent a chemical formula or want to experiment with chemical to derive some solution but the fact is that the provided chemistry lab is not having enough facility to do it then it a clear waste of time and his contructive thought is in vain . secondly , ideas are hypothetical and fact are real . for example , many year ago people used to think that sun revolves round the earth but it just not the fact it vice-versa . if this wa taught to everyone of u till date then it would have been like beleiving on a concept or an idea but the fact were reaveled later . hence , hypothetical thing may be totally wrong and can not be taught to student but fact are real and should be taught . lastly , importance of learning the fact make a student more knowledgable and lead him to better acedemic performance . for example , if one dose n't know why doe the earth rotates round the sun or why day-night occur ? he would be considered a dumb and illeterate and would not be given any value in this industrialised and competative world . to be a strong competitor we should be striving for knowledge which is based on fact and not idea . understaing the fact and bringing them into practice with all the knowledge is the key to a bright future . ideas and concept understading is secondary to learning the fact .
