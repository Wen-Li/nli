albert ainchtain , bill gate and all successfull people in the whole world began their life with a try . trying new thing or experincing a new adventure in the life is one of the main characteristic of successful people . so , the one who spent his life stuck in one job or one life style is considered dead one , because the life he had wa with no mean at all . therefore , i agree with that statement because of two reason . the first reason is that if you are trying new thing , especially in your job , you may be more successful . for example , if there is a trader and his major trade depend on specific prodct and he successed in that product , he may achive success in another product and he could increase his wealth may be more than before . but it need a brave one and to make that decidition and this is one of the property of successful people . the second reason is that trying new thing make the person who attemped to try , ha more experinnce than before and add new memory , regardless if they are good or bad memory , to that person . although , that experince may cause an inverse effect on the person , but at least he may learn new thing that he did not know before . as a result , he may be a good wiser to other people because he ha a huge background on many thing . so he could be useful to others . in conclusion , trying and experincing new stuff in our life is the reason of why we are living on this planet . so we have to take advntage of that and try to acheive that aim of our exictance .
