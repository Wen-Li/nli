the number of car that we can see every day in the street is incredibly huge . cars are very usefull to move quickly from a place to another and quite every family seems to be able to afford one or even two or three of this mean of transportation . people do n't seem to be able to find another way to move so confortable like this ! of course there are some aspect related to the use of car that in my opinion may influence the future . one of this is the price of oil or fuel . this is a great proplem that nowadays all the world is facing . prices seem to grow more and more every day and if the situation will not change , if all the country wo n't find a solution , people will be able to afford car no more . another aspect related to this is the fact that petrol will not be available forever . in fact this natural resorse will end , not in twenty year , but surelly in a future not so distant from our time . so men ha to think to a possible solution , for example electrical car or other mean of transport to substitute car . there are even negative aspect related to the use of car . fuel or oil , which car need to work , are the first cause of air pollution . our governamnets are tring to find a solution to this problem , introducing day during wich car are not allowed to be used : but it may be possible that in the future only a small number of car would be allowed to circulate in order to reduce pollution .
