i agree to some extent that old people may enjoy their life better than young one . mainly probably they have achieved important portion of success and dream they have been eager to procure . or simply because they are financially independent . they earn money and they support other member of their family . they may be also the source of advice and wisdom due to their experience in life . all these thing may be true but i am sure a far a i know and have experienced that young people enjoy life fully . they benefit from every aspect of pleasure that it ha first yong people enjoy great deal of freedom which wa not available to them in the past . the freedom of wearing the fashionable clothes that they liked . the freedom of being late at night a well a having aboy friend or a girl friend . in arab country for instance the previous generation did not enjoyed that . and now merely in few cuntries in the middle east or north africa where people can enjoy having partner . second , young people enjoy their life through the new facility available like cinea , theatre , night club , traveling abroad and studying in foreign country . now we spend our holiday in very exotic area in the world just we precise our destination and everything will be done easily . the chance of studying abroad is very possible and feasible today . i am 27 year old now and i visited england and i intend to visit america whereas my father for example ha not leaved even for a neughboring country . so really young enjoy their life
