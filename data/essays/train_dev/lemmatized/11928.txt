i agree the statement . most important thing for student is to understand exsiting knowledge . students have to learn flameworks of exiting kwnoledge . i wa a student of mathmatics and realized how important to understand concept . there are many simple fact in mathematics but gathering fact didnt lead me to any idea nor concept . especially student ususal do n't have ability to create idea or concept , therfore just leaning fact dose n't make anything for the student so at first , to get ability to create new concept nor idea student heve to learn about what concept is , how exititng concept wa created . once student get ability to cerate concept , it 's also important to learn fact . i know that i have to learn english harder . it 's good experience for me to take toefl because i have realized my english skill . this test make me to want to study english . i have take this test just because i want to no my english skill , in this meaning i can mesure my english skill before i recieve the score . thanks .
