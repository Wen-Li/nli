in my opinion this statement is true . i think this is since young people are at the beginning of there life and not in the middle or at the end of it . you can reccognise it if you start a new work . generally at the beginning it is interesting , because you have never done it before , but after a few week or month you know how to do it and it is becoming le interesting . here are some example why from my point of view , young people enjoy it more to live than old people . when you are young you have a lot of change . you grow up , become interested in the other sex and have to go to school . you have not to be concerned about that you have enough money neither if you have a job or not . it doe not care you . on the other hand it really depents on how people have planed there life . the most grown up people i know , have a house or an appartement somewhere , child and a job . those people have really not a lot of change in there life . the time schedule is nearly every week the same . however i know some other people who have a completly different way of live . for example one guy i know , he is 50 year old now , stopped to work with fourty . he ha had the opinion that he owns enough money to live on with for the rest of his live . so he bought a sailing boot to travel around the world . he work from time to time if he can at a bare in jamaica , but only one ore two month in a year . i think in his case the mentioned statement is wrong . he never stoped to be young . i think that he enjoys everz daz like it would be his first on this planet . with this sentence i would like to say that the sentence wich i am writing about is not absolutely true . however generally i have the same impression .
