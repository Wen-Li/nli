i totally agree with the statement that having a knowledge on many subject is better than specializing on one subject . the world now is growing fast and the diversity in all field is maximizing . in such a new and modern world specializing in one subject can be challenging . fields which have once been thought to be in isolation or independent are now requring support from other field . this interdependency ha given raise to more sophisticated company which require people with a minimum knowledge in many important field . this ha a lot of application . a multi national company ( mnc ) is the best example of a place which require people having knowledge in many field . in an mnc there are various level of work . let u take an example of a human resource manager . his work is to employ new people suitable to the firm , monitor the progress of project and constantly deal with economic issue of his form . the above three task require aplication in various fiellds like to employ new people he must first basically understand the need of his firm . this requires him to have a knowledge in the field of firm bussiness requirement . next to monitor a project he should know the platform on which the project is being built . for this he need to have some skill in the computer language . next to deal with the economic issue of the firm he must atleast know the basic of the law of bussiness running . thus a level-3 worker like a hr manager requires a knowledge on three totally diverse field . if this is the case with a hr manager then we can easilly understand the requirement a ceo need . even scientist need a knowledge on many different fileds other than thier own subject . for example a physic scientist need to know mathematics for calculation in physic . he need to have grip on topic like trignometry , calculus etc which are essential for solving complex relationship in field like dynamic , solid state physic etc . the computer which can be called a the new face of the world changed a lot of approach in many field . it is being used in field like astronomy , physic chemistry in many way like embedded system . a space research scientist , launching a rocket need to calculate the astronomical distance between the earth and the target . this if done with help of a cmputer need him to understand how to use the system and other such complexity . e ven the present educational system seems to have accepted the need of having basic information in many field . the school of the presemt day have many subject lke math , science , social , language etc . the student ought to take all these subject atleast till a certain grade and then opt for subject they are interested in . the course in collges also have many subject in the course which they feel are needed . for example in engineering all the student also have common subject in the area of computer , electronics etc . thus in view of the new world i feel a knowledge in a many subject is needed for achieving success . a specialization in a single area ha no great use today .
