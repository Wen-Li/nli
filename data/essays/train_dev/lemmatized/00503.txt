some people might say that young people nowadays have enough time to help the community around them . but , personally , i think young people had limited time to take part in the community activites . where i live , in japan , the young people do not spend their time for community . so , i would like to illustrate the situation below . most importantly , young people in recent year tend to be more busier than those in previous year . for example , the recent young people have to study from the morning to the midnight every day . they have to go to junior or high school and also have to go to the preparatory school in order to get in a competitive universities . moreover , they must take part in the club activity such a basketball club or judo club after school to strengthen themselves physically and mentally . i think there are more time for university student to help their community than any other student in different age . but after graduated from university , young businessperson must work from early in the morning till midnight in japan . they could not afford to have sufficient dinner time because of the hectic schedule . therefore , they hardly have time to spend for community activity . in addition , the young people tend to get involved with the familiar relationship in their spare time . for instance , they pleasedly meet with their friend in weekend , however , they are likely to be reluctant to participate in the program to help their own community . there are not so many mutual relationship between the young people such a high school student and the people living in the area where the school locates or their own house locates . additionally , the many young people in their 20 now leave their own hometown toward the central city to live alone and enjoy their life time . they increasingly tend to get involved with people in the close and comfortable relathionship . it mean that it become more difficult for the young people to get involived with local community . considering from the point mentioned above , i think that young people do not have enough time to spend for community activity . personally , i hope that more young people help their community to build the relationship between the people with different age and in different situation and adult support the young people .
