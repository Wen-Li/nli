the statement touch upon a very contraversial topic . it is true that young people spend more time on party and traveling than the old people . however , i completely disagrees with the idea that young people enjoy life more than the older people do . i have many reason for my belief . it is true that because of age a older person would not be able to enjoy the party life and traveling around the world . but it is equally true that not only physical activity , but also other activity contribute to the definition of `` enjoying life to it fullest '' . to give an example , i had a mathematics professor who helped me prepared for compitive exam and standadised test out side the syllabus . although he wa retiered , he had a true passion for math and even at age of eighty he used to solve many challenging puzzle and do recreational mathematical work . apart from mathematics , he also had a group of friend , with whom he used to play card and always participate in various district and national level compititions in chess . he also kept visiting his two son once every year and taught his grandson the secretsof leading a successful life . from all these and many more activity , he derived the immense pleasure of leading a healthy life . on the otherhand , consider the yonger generation , where many people commit numerous crime in the name of having fun in life . these people suffer severely , when they have to face the punishment offered by the law for their arrogant attitude . we can find numerous example of young people commiting inexcusable crime and facing the punishment for life . on the contrary , in such case the young people have to face more sorrow in life than the old people do . i strongly believe , that to enjoy life , one must have the ability to give joy to other people and share thier sworrows , in whatever small way possible . on can achive the ultimate joy of life only if he is successful in creating a harmony in the community around himself . and i strongly believe there is no age limit to do this , and hence there is no age limit to be happy in life .
