i agree that is most advertisement make product seem much better than they really are . for example last week i saw an advertisement about soup for cleaning the car , they said it w 'll clean any think inclouding hard spot so i try that product and it doesnt do any thing for my car , may be the normal soup is better than this product . another advertisement wa talking about some food and they say it is very healthy and good for your body do i buy it too , but after i try it i dont thing i feel any change . and there is some product for a fat people they said it w 'll make you lose wight and make you thiner but alot of people try thats product and did n't lose any wight . but some time there a honest advertisments . for example there wa an advertisement about some food and they chalenge any one who can prove that is the product ha any unnatural product so when some people do some test for this product they say it wa true the product doe not contain any unnatural product . but the we ca n't say about advertisement alwayes make thair product better than they really are and in the same time we can not say the opssite because we have the to face , honest advertisemnents and dishonest advertisement . therefore , i thing that back for the person experians and what he belive in and if the product equal the big advertisment they have so do n't belive any thing you wach because some time you just wach a minet of layer from this company .
