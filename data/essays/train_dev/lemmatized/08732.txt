when the condition of the today 's academic and business environment are considered , it is a better idea to specialize in one specific subject than trying to get piece of knowledge in many subject . in the very begining of the evolution of science , many scientist used to deal with a variety of area . for example , the ancient greek scientist were both mathmeticians and philosopher at the same time . it wa true at that time when the condition of the agricultural society wa taken into account . there were very few people interested in science and they used to deal with many subject at the same time . however , many several branch of science are formed in history with an effort to specialize in different topic . the today 's world necessisates this progress . for example , a the computer tecnhology improved , different sort of specialist began to emerge in this area . in my opinion , specializing in one subject give you the chance to focus on this topic . for instance , you may have some knowledge about the hardware of computer , some about programming but you can not deal with a problem which envolves a huge knowledge and experience about a specific situation in one subject . if it wa possible to learn all the thing about many different subject , people would do that . however , a life of a human being is not enough for this . favors of studying in many different academic subject argue that it may give you the possibility conduct a research with different aspect of it . although these statement is partially correct , my suggestion would be conduct the same research with many specialist in different subject . i believe that the second way would give better result taking the each individual own specialization into account .
