i am graduated from sabanci university ( su ) , one of the leading university in turkey . in su , the educational system is different than other university and it is the only one which is different . the difference is that all student are to take the same class in the freshman and sophomore year , and to take their class of interest on the following two year . the student are educated in order to have a similar background which includes many diverse area of study , and to be specialized in their area of study afterwards . for instance , a student from the mechanical engineering program ha to pas the history or the humanities class , whereas a student from the visual arts program ha to pas the nature of science or the mathematics class . this system let student have broad knowledge of many academic subject without a major specialization and i think this system will lead future generation to more interdisciplinary area of study and cause strong and mutually beneficial business cooperation forming more specific business field . students , having experienced such varying field , will be more determined about which subject to specialize in during their postgraduate study . i , having graduated from su in visual arts and visual communications design program , am now eager to have my ma in sound design . without having been through a variety of subject during my education in su , i would not be so determined and confident to make such a decision .
