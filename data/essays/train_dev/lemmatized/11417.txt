there are many characteristic of successful people such a intelligence , knowledge , patience , openness and courage . in my opinion the most important one is being open to new thing and taking risk . for this reason , i agree with the statement that successful people try new thing and take risk rather than only doing what they already know how to do well . there are several reason for my choice and they are the following . first of all , these people are successful because they always update their knowledge in their area and also improve themselves continously . in addition , they do not always stay in safe part they have reached in time but rather they look for other way of improving themselves and ask for more information and more success by taking risk . for example , the founder of our republic , ataturk wa a very successful soldier in ottoman empire but in time he took risk and left his position in ottoman military in order to make leadership to turkish citizen in the independence war . as a result , he had lot of enemy , however , he served for turkish public , played an important role in independence war and finally established the modern turkish republic . secondly , even if you are found successful at a point , it should be boring to maintain your knowledge at the same level for year , not trying new thing and not taking risk . the people who are found successful , in fact do not care about being successful and they do not hesitate to take risk that may result in a failure . by this way , their experience and knowledge develop overtime and they take failure a an important part of their future success . for example , many of the invention made in the past were invaluable result of the new point of view of these successful people like einstein and the return of the risk taken changed our life all around the world . in conclusion , i believe that being always curious about new thing , taking risk , trying new thing make a person successful and they are also crucial for me in my life .
