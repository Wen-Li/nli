at the beginning advertisments started with shoing what the product really ha in it and that did not work with people who watching it . so from my point of view i will say i agree with what the statement meaning and what it is pointing at . so company started to do advertisement with false information . in my point of view the reason is or the reason are that many product were invented and they have the same quality so people do not care about what the product ha and what is it look like ? because there are many of them with the same idea . so advertisement started to be more cool than talking about the product and let 's talk about the sport car for example . they always show you in the advertisement that those two young people can hit on the most beautiful girl in college because they have the cooliest car in the entire university which is unusual to happen in school around except some special time and another example of that is the coffee advertisement when they show smoe handsome boy with beautiful girl sitting togather in starbucks or whatever it is , talking and laughing while drinking that specific kind of coffee or in that specific coffee shop and they look cool so people when they see them they feel really good of doing that thinking of doing this we 'll make them cool or whatever . anyway , advertisement are not suppose to be real . it it all about showing the bad thing a good enough to get sold from store or used in shop and mall a much a it could . and talking about this subject advertisement are costing a lot of money these day and it will be more and more expensive everytime the ad will be long and ha along story and a new one but if some one asked me about being in this section my answer would be `` yes '' .
