very often , people who managed to succeed in life like to discover new thing , new area in which they can try to succeed or master a well , all for the purpose of always aiming higher . the problem with this approche , is that it involves taking many risk , and at the end these people could end up loosing evrything , while they could have stick to what they already knew . this creates the problem of knowing if it is worth taking the risk to try new thing or if instead people should stay with what they already posesse . in my opinion , life is all about taking risk , and discovering new thing , so that our knowledge doe n't stay confined to what we already are good at , but that insted , these limit extand and allow u to learn and to succeed at new thing . for example , if there were n't people willing to try to undertsand the anatomy of the human body , the progress in medecine would not have been so advanced a it is today . this show that even if there are risk involved with gaining knowledge and mastering an area , it is still something that ha to be done in order to evolve . however , there are some time when people who take risk end up regretting it , wether because they did n't succeed in the other thing they tried to learn and lost what they already possessed , or because they did n't like what they learn while exploring new area . if we take for example a man who owns a show company , and he decides to invest his money in a new parfume company , or in another random business that doe n't relate to his are of expertise , he may end up lossing money if this business doe n't work well , or he may end up giving up because this business is not fit for him . either way , this man would have lost money and this could even affect the business in which he succeeded . therefore , taking these risk could definitly end up causing these people a lot of harm , if they werent prepared for it . in the end , it is all about beeing lucky and hoping for the best , because there is a lot of good thing that can come out of discovering new thing , but there are also bad thing . but if i had to choose , i would probably decide to take the risk , because the world would n't be were it is today without our will to discover and to master .
