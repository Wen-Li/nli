science , for that matter any other field of study , have been broadly classified in to many subject . its important for everone to have a basic knowledge of all these subject but i think it better to specialize in one specific subject . concentrating on a wide range of subject creates a lot of problem . firstly , the individual may not be able to find ample time to devote to each subject . secondly , the reader may retain far le than what is required because the detail of the mix of all subject might be really confusing . we always find that people who make their decision early and act promptly and concentrate in a particular area of interest turn out to be high performer or high end achiever contributing a lot towards the development of society . dr. a.p.j abdul kalam , the president of india can be quoted a a very relevant example in this context . dr. kalam identified very early that his interest lie in the area of space science and technology and started working on it from his senior seondary school itself . we all know that he had always been a towering figure in the evolution of indian space programme ever since he joined the indian space research organization . he can be a real role model to the young student . i do feel that an exposure to all the subject is essential for a student to make the right choice . it also give him the confidence to tackle new situation and to effectively put forward a new idea before the general public . but ultimately one should try to become a specialist in any field of his interest . in this society i feel one should be a specialist in the field he or she is working to make the other people listen their voice . it also generates a sense of belief among them over the thing he or she is telling them . i feel it always better to be a master in one field rather than a jack of all .
