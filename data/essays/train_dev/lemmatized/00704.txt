quite often management guru thrust an age old aphorism , `` it 's better to be a jack of all trade , than a master of one '' . ofcourse , specialization is indeed beneficial , however , what 's needed to succeed in this cut-throat competitive world is not just depth but breadth of knowledge . from my perspective , a broader knowledge base of many subject is what i call for and agree with the statement . if seen in the corporate context , a typical manager is required to know not just about his immediate area of interest or work , but also about the work assigned to colleague and sub-ordinates alike . for example , a building contractor , today is not just responsible for overseeing the construction part but also various other aspect such a dealing with artisan , wood craftsman , mason , architect and many other such people , so a to accomplish the set goal wihin the stipulated timeframe . moreover , today student at school are taught how to balance their academic and co-curricular activity . why ? because , this inevitably involves growth and development and better and broader learning opportunity . gone are the time , when parent insited their kid on becoming a gynaecologist or a paediatrist or an optometrist and started grooming them at a very young age . medicals school today churn out more general physician than cardiologist and expert in other medical field . admittedly , specialization in such field in the form of masters is indeed imperative , however , that happens mostly for a purpose of a job or a career to start with . furthermore , a people grow , learn and develop , a variety of skill will be needed to cope with abundant and rapidly changing knowledege and information , especially in this information age . a broader skill base , is what even professional organization ask for . for them , it 's all a win-win situation in term of more skill , responsibility and work load in the same cost a for a specialized person . a ceo or an entrepreneur would n't have been what they are if they concentrated just on their area of expertise . they are master strategist , skilled in various business aspect - finance , account , engineering , general management ( a course quite popular in b-schools ) . in sum , a general perspective and view of thing and subject is required in current scenario . people with broad knowledge are more likely to succeed than the one with a specialization .
