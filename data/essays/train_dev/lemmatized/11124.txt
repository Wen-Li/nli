yes , i agree that student must have to understand the idea and concept . but not by simply learning the fact . by understanding the idea and the concept one can have the ability to improve his grasping power and the creativeness , because when a student learns only the fact he can just have some information about the topic but he ca n't even know the concept behind it . but by understanding the idea and the concept some kind of inventive thinking can be improved by that student . for example , while doing work on math , if a student just learns the formula to solve that problem but not the concept it make a big difference . but by learning the concept the student can work freely not only on that problem but can also have some idea on related problem too . now a day in this fast generation student are being very fast . so they need to know well about the idea and the concept in every aspect . well by knowing only the fact on any aspect make the student to have some book knowledge but that is not sufficient for them they must also have some idea and concept too . in any aspect like software and computer , the student must and should have the idea about the whole system and also the concept for well use of the system and the software . its merely waste of matter that if the student just learn about the system and the software . it the only way for building up proper skill in a student is to understand the idea and should have proper concept also . so , according to me i feel that for every student it more important to undestand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact .
