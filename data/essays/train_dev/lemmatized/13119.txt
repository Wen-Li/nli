young people and older people are both vague term which will be hard to make an discussion . young people could vary by the perspective you have of young people . there for to make the argument clear , i will assume that young people are people in their teen , and older people being fifty year old and above . in oder to establish the argument of whether young people enjoy life more than odler people , first of all i would like to compare the advantage and disadvantage of both young and old . one advantage of an young person is the life time they have left which leaf them more option for the future . on the otherhand older people have death coming faster than those of young , therefore have limited choice they can do . there is the difference of potential between young and old . although it is arguable that old have the same potential a young , there is more time for young in order to develop their potential . another advantage for young people if the physical ability . although there are exception , young people tend to be more physically fit than those of old . also young people also have the physical potential which they can built up , whereas it is harder for older people to develop physical strength . older people definately do hold an advantage which younger one do n't . from the experience and knowledge they have accumulated from the past year , they are able to understand and take appropriate action where a young one are unexperienced which may cause difficulty in life . a point that younger people experience great disadvantage is the restriction set by law on certain people under age . an example will be alcohol , driving and other entertainment that youth are prohibited . older people have the right to reach all of that is possible whereas youth are not . whether old people or young people enjoy life is completely up to the individual . both have advantage and disadvantage . if i wa to make an opinion it will be that young people enjoy life more , because i only have view or taste of what it is to be young . also people have always been chasing a way to stay alive and young for a longer period of time . this idea support my idea the young people enjoy life more .
