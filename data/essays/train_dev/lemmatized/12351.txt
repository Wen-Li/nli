a fiftheen year old guy doe n't know exactly what he want to do in his future , so i think it 's impossible for him to choose a specific academic field where concentrate all his effort . in my opinion , guy until 20 should investigate many academic subject , so doing they acquire a varius cultural background that can help them to take the right decision for their future . later , they can specialize their knowledge in one specific subject , in order to reach an excellent standard in the cultural field they like . i think this two step process of trasmitting culture permit to reach different target . first of all , at the end of the university course a man ha attended , he ha the possibility to discus at the same level with the prior and brightness professor about the subject that are linked with his study . furthermore , the fact that his cultural baggage is also full of a widespread background , he can get in touch with other reality , speaking the same language and without misunderstainding . for exemple , an engenieer is able to built a bridge or to calculate the right quantity of iron in a construction , but also he can talk with a doctor about a medical instrument . the creation of this open mind could be not only the target of university course , but it 's necessarily to look for it from the first year that guy spend at school .
