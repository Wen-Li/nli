i can not imagine the world with fewer car in use than there are today . if you think coldly , the car manufacturing market is strong and powerful , where thousand of people around the world work thanks to the automobile field . i could mention several answer to analyce that it could be impossible to do it . aspects such a unemployment effect , decreasing the economy , aspect concerning poblation , or improving the technology , will be the reason to not permit that in the future will be fewer car that there are today . firstly , one of the cause that i do not agree with this statement is because , the poblation is increasing in huge path . families have more child than year ago , so in the short time of future , the new generation will need more car and automobile to drive to school , back to work or going vacation . secondly , a a businessman , and concretely a a salescar , i do not agree with this question beacuse , my compay will laid off me , and could be great quantity of co/workers a like out of the office . this reduction of employer would be an absolutly brankcroupt at the car business . everyone know , that nowadadays , that car conmpanies such atoyota , bmw , or mercedes are doing a good job research new fuel and other system of managing . technology is going fast so we need student to work in investigation research to maintain the use of car . in conclusion , in my view threre are several aspect to trust that in the twenty year there will be the same car or more than now . the car world business hire a lot of people around the world , from the person who design prototype 's until the salesman like me . also , the number of poblation each day is in continuining expansion , so everybody need car to go to differents place , and of course , techonolgy will offer new type to manage the news car . please , if disapear the benefit in sale in car , i will be an unemploy .
