i 'm agree with the following statement : `` young people enjoy life more than older people do '' . i think that young people life your life more attentment to old people . they go to a party , disco , pub but also cinema , university , teatre , ecc . the young people love travel and they visit all town of europa or asia . the older people must think at their family and at their child or also their parent . they watch television or walk in the park . they play at `` tre sette '' ( tipycal italian 's play ) young people havent not too problem and too responsabilities that older people have . young people are the future , they must learn to older people 's error . i study and i have not more time for my obby . i do n't like to disco but if i have freetime i prefer go in a pub to drink few beer with my friend
