nowadays since people are child there is a sort of competition for everything , for a footballmatch for example or for a running competition or for having a better mark at school . in this way a person always try to do the better of her so i think that people who can try always to win this competition in life can have the power to became a successful person because they love to risk and they 're proud when they try to pas their limit . i think also that pas ownselfs limit mean to make something that it bigger and more important than do a thing well known . it 's easier to do well something that we known than create something new . for example a normal artist can produce an accademical paint well made , that it 's also armonic and pleasant to see but it remains an exercise of the hand . instead a successfull people want to experiment new thecnics , new point of view ; new color in order to really create something new that noone had ever seen and in order to obtain this , the successful people have to risk , have to abbbandon all his own knownoledge to adventure himself in another unknown world of the creation . at the end i agree with the statement also if often peolple who risk , ca n't reach success because of differentes cause and on the other hand someone who had never tried to risk became a successful person because the raccomandation of some importants people .
