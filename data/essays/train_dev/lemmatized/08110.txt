the current era is the era of developing and ever growing information . the amount of knowledge available in almost every field is increasing . i think it is important that a person is specialized and ha all the required skill and knowledge of one particular discipline . a the old saying go , `` jack of all trade and master of none '' somebody who know too many subject may not be able to master any particular subject this is the age of specialization . specialization requires constant effort in one direction . so if a person want to specialize in a particular subject , they will be required to regard that particular subject a priority and other subject a subsidiary also to be able to contribute in a particular fireld , one need to put in more effort and time in knowing that particualr field , leaving le or little time to gain knowledge about other subject . specializing in particular subject would help in complete knowledge of that paricular matter . there would be le of confusion and more scope for exprimenting with the detail and existing knowledge . this is extremely imporatnt for scientist or other professional involved in the field of advancment of knowldge in the current time of cut throat knowledge , complete information of particular subject is required to gain an edge over others in the same field i dont intend to say that having information about other fierlds would do any harm . on the other hand , the information from other subject but related subject might prove useful . for instance a politician would benefit greatly from knowing the history of the region or teh technological aspect of a particular powerplant in his region is working . however he doe not need detailed and technical knowledge . he need to know enough that would help him with his role a a politician . i think specializing in one specific subject is more imporatnt than trying to learn too many subject . but once the person ha specialized in his or her field , they can always look at enhancing their information about other subject matter also .
