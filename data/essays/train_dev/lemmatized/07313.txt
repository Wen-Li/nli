it is widely believed that successfull people try new thing and take risk instead of concentrating on something they already know very well . on the one hand people who want to be successful should rely on their skill they already have . it is very important to take an advantage of the quality a person already ha , so that this person is sure to do the right thing , which mean that the person is self-confident . but on the other hand a rigid behavior could influence the work in a negative way . for example it is very important for manager who run their own business to stay flexible so that they can react to every change of the customer choice . the customer choice could change every day , so the manager ha to adapt his procuts in order be successfull . otherwise he will not sell enough product . a good example could be advertising . you must have new idea to impress the people seeing yor advertisement in order to push their attention to your product . sometimes it is also essential to take any risk in order to improve your business , because it could be a chance to multiply your success . of course such decision are very difficult and you have to think about them very carefully . all in all i think that it is a big advantage if a person ha enough courage to take risk or to try something new because in most case it is worth it . in spite of short-term negative impact it is important to be innovative in order to be a successfull person . rigid behaviour cause disadvantage in nearly every part of life . in my opinion it might be helpfull to stick to the well-practised skill a person ha , but everyone can improve these skill and learn new think in order to achieve his aim . that is why i think that this statement is right .
