there some difference between young people and older people . i want to explain important point that their characteristic . first , young people are more active because they have to go to school , they have to learn what their requirment . they also have to grew to become what they want to be . though , they are grewing up , there are a lot of sturuggles that they have to face to it . they are confused and lost because they can not see what is going to happen next . second , think about older people are more calm and have knowledge , go done though that their development . they can do whatever they want to do because they finish high school . they may have time to think about their grand child who they got . but there are thing that they can not do which is going to school , playing sport over beyond their avarage , being expart at some thing new . so some limit coming up to them because their age is increasing . but it doesnt mean that young people enjoy life more than older people do . for example , if you want to have own time like relaxing , sleeping , talking with friend , seems like young people have time to those kind of stuff , but young people may not do it becaue there are a lot of thing to do like home work , sport club , planning for university or job . but older people may do it because they have time , maybe they are having job that they really want to do . school wark is hard to have fun , there are such a limit time , they are still struggling with everything . older people can enjoy what that young people enjoy , if they want to play sport a much a that young people do then they can do it . young people can not do it exactly same thing a old people do . they have future to enjoy and older people are enjoying that future right now .
