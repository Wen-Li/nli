i agree with the statement that most advertisement make product seem much better than they really are . the logic of advertising is basically to sell more product and to make more money a a consequence of the the advertisement . advertisement is a way for the company to show their product to a large number of consumer . they are the must of a modern life . in a modern life the demand of the people increase a the world change . the demand can be of new tool , machine , car , house and any other thing that you can imagine . as the people need more of these the producer and company make new tool and machine and idea to attract people 's attention . in a growig world you do n't have the opportunity to reach every people unless you do not advertise your product or idea . to appeal more and more people an advertisement must show all the good side of the thing and should not mention about the bad side of it . i am sure that you are familiar with the situation such that people coming into a problem with anything he or she can buy by just believing in the advertisement . cellular phone are a good example , i had friend who chosed their cellular phone according to the great advertsement done about that item , but most of them were not happy with the product they bought . as i mentioned before , the logic of the advertisement is selling more and making more money a a consequence . as long a the reason is making more money , the company will not interested in the consumer 's approval for the short term . they will try to sell more and to do this they will need advertisement that are lacking the disadvantage or bad feature of their product . and in this advertisement , again for the same reason they will exagerate the even the basic feature of that product .
