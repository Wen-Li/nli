knowledge is like a big pot that any one can take and scope from . living in a world full of information oblige me to have information from diffrent aspect or subject . iam with the statment that say `` it is beeter to have broad knowledge of many acadimic subject than to specialise in one specific subject . '' having a broad knowledge of a certain topic or subjet is good when iam sitting with my college discussing certain issue or idea . this mean s i can paricipate effectivly in the disscusion or even in a debate in my majoring beacuse i have alot of information and detail cthat i can use to cnvince the other part , this is very good for me . i ca n't imagine my self sitting with agroup of people talking a bout certain idea that i have no idea a bout . this mean iam going to be speechless , staying at home is much better for me than being in this situation . because i dont want that happen to me i prefer studing diffrent many subject . iam personaly did this with my studying . my major in ba is methods of teaching english a a forgien languge and in my master i decided to tke some thing that is broader than it . i sudied cucrriclum design and teaching methodology . although it still the same dealing with education topic , bust still i got more idea than choosing to study methogology in english a lone . now iam planning to study in phd measrement
