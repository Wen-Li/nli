i do n't agree with this statement . there are some reason why i disagree with this statement because i believe that the relationship between the costomers and the company is very important for selling the product . first of all , if a company of a product advertises the product much better than it really is , the customer misunderstands about the product . it mean the company pretend the customer . when the customer notice that the advertisement is not true , the customer will think that the company pretend him or her . therefore , the customer will never buy the product . second , if the maker use an advertisement which is not true , a lot of problem will happen . for example , when a customer bought a product which is advertised much better than it really is and use it , and then it harm the customer because of the not true advertisement , the customer will claim to the company . and if the problem becomes big news , the company will get huge damage . finally , if the advertisement make product seem too much better than they really are , they might be crime . in the case , the customer will never belive the company , and they never buy the company 's product . to sell product , the company need to make good relationship btween the costomers and company . for making good relationship between the customer and the company , the company have to give correct information to the customer . for these reason , i disagree with this statement .
