i disagree with the statement because man ha always been on the for method to make his life more convinient , and a far a getting from one palce to another on a daily basis is concerned , four-wheeler are what make his life comfortable and so he ha no qualm in procuring a car if he can afford one . in twenty year from now , it is unlikely that population of the world would decrease or even remain fairly constant , and with more and more automobile firm introducing cost-effective car it is safe to assume that in the future more and more people will be able to afford car and hence the number of car on the road will increase . another major factor to support my claim is the fact that no concrete law exist keep in check the number of vehicle in a particular region . this allows people , especially family , to purchase a many number of car they want a per their requirement . also the fact that people now consider two wheeler to be dangerous to ride also lends support to my stand . people now are well informed of the increasing number of two wheeler accident which can be attributed to their relative instability and insecurity ac compared to car . they feel reluctant to use a two wheeler when they have the option of using a car and hence a time progesses it is safe to say that this preferance will indeed cause an increase in the number of car in the coming year . technological advancement in the automobile industry will also allow people to use `` non-polluting '' vehicle in the future . with the increasing number of pollution norm such cheap and `` clean '' vehicle will provide an escape route for the world 's population whose rising number will obviously lead to the popularity and widespread use of such vehicle in comparision to today i hope that with the argument stated above , it would be easy to forsee the increasing number of car in the year to come .
