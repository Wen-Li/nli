the question being asked is if traveling in a group with a tour guide is a best type of tour . this issue is important because it ha several implication on which type of travel people should have . i believe that traveling in a group with a guide is not always good . one reason i believe this is that people have different preference . in a group tour , each person need to follow the group 's plan even though the plan doe not care of what he or she want . while traveling around france , for example , artist want to visit museum but cook want to go to fine restaurant . in a group tour , it is very difficult to satisfy the wish of every member in the group . another reason i do not think that a group tour is best is that people do not have time enough to do what they really like to do in a group tour . the itinerary of a group tour can not be flexible very much . the guide and tourist need to adhere to the existing plan . while traveling , if you find a fascinating place , you would want to stay for a day or two . in a group tour , it is almost impossible to change the plan . this could reduce the true value of traveling . finally , i am not a proponent of a group tour because people could lose wonderful opportunity to see and make friend with the people who live in other place . when you travel on your own , you tend to try to understand the town and it people that you visit . in a group tour , you may be too busy to do this , following the group 's plan . traveling alone is very good more often than not . in conclusion , i do not agree that a group tour led by a guide is the best way to travel . that is becasue a group tour ha it own shortcoming . furthermore , i think that traveling alone is quite a good experience .
