university course nowadays are made of idea , concept and fact . but i disagree with the statement that say that it is more important for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact . concepts and idea are only a basis , concept and idea are often born from fact and fact allow student to go out of the theorical field to be closer to the professional life . in university course , concept and idea are only a basis . it is essential to understand them but it is also worthful to learn how tu use them through fact . facts are in a sense concrete example or element which will help student to learn concept and idea and help them understand that concept and idea alone are worthless if one do not learn to use them through fact . in economics science lot of concept are very abstract a for instance the concept of utility . if you do not apply it to the everyday life it is stay hardly understandable . secondly most of the concept are born from fact . sometimes idea and concept result from reflection but most of the time they are the result of experience or fact . in the chemical industry a large number of formula concerning chemical material are born from experience made with this same formula and which lead to an unexpected conclusion . that is the same for cooking . lots of recipe are issued from a test . moreover fact allows student to pas through the theorical field to adapt the concept and idea they learn to professionnal life for example . a student learning commercial relationship will understand selling principle much better through concrete example . actually concrete exemples or experience related to concept really help to be closer to the professionnal world and to understand better professional relationship . so a a conclusion one can say that concept , idea and fact are working all together and one can even underline that in some field like history for example , fact are most of the course .
