i completely agree that most advertisementes make product seem much better than they really are . i guess this ha become a common way of plubicity to all kind of product . commonly the publicity agentes are ordered to make the product look better in order to make the client obtain a lot more costumer . this publicity agent use a lot of technics to make the product look better , for example they use especialized software like photoshop to increase the size of the product or make it brighter , or maybe an artificial imitation of the product that not necesarly have same texture of look . eventhough one can observe this situation mostly on food product . the fast food ha become a product that often make advertisementes that make food look a lot of more better than they really are . for example the big chain of fast food restaurant often show some picture of each of the product they offer so the person can make his/her choice by observing the picture . when the food is delivered to the costumer he/she notice that the appereance of the real product is not even close to that one shown in the picture , for example , the person can get a smaller hamburguer or maybe a different type of bread in a sandwich . more over the fast food , this situation ha been increasing in all type of product like tooth paste , detergent or even cloth or shoe . sometimes when a person see an advertisement comercialising shoe , they commonly look softer and more confortable than they really are , when the person get into the shop and fit them often notice that the shoe were not a good a they look on televison . this certainly is a problem that is sourrounding u and overall is making people lose a lot of time . i think there should exist some kind of reagulation that could control the content of the advertisement , so people always can receive what they are looking , in that way there would be le problem of reclamation , and it will be reflected in the reputation of the company .
