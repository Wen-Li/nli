it is my personal opinion that one should have a broad knowledge of several academic subject till he attains a certain level of maturity , after which it make perfect sense to specialize in one specific subject . for instance , at the school level , it is very important to ensure that student have a balanced development by gaining broad knowledge of all major academic discipline . at the university level , however , student can start specializing in their chosen area of interest . this specialization can be further narrowed down to a specific niche area a one progress with his study . a preliminary knowledge of all subject will make an individual a balanced human being , with the capacity to appreciate and understand all field of study . eg. a knowledge of basic mathematics will ensure that an art major develops the capacity for logical reasoning whereas taking a few course in music will make a physic major more receptive to the beauty of the fine art . a basic knowledge of all subject would also help an individual to ascertain where his interest lie and enable him to select the discipline he would like to specialize in . after a certain level , however , it would become necessary to specialize in a specific area of study . this would give an individual an opportunity to cultivate his personal interest and would also give him the depth of knowledge required to get down to research work . this would ultimately add to the knowledge bank in that particular area of study . to summarize , i believe that a broad knowledge of many subject is important to begin with , but for any real value addition to one 's personal academic pursuit a well a the discipline he study , it is necessary that he specializes in it and gain in depth knowledge in that specific subject .
