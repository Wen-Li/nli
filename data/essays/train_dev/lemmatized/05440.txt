being bill gates success is an important thing for modern human and there are lot of description of success . but everyone want to be successful in life , from a housewive to a scientist . in my opinion , successful people try new thing and take risk rather than only doing what they are already know how to do well , because there is new opportunity , chance to develop themselves and bigger success than traditional one in trying new thing and taking risk . first of all , new way always offer new opportunity to people . for example , in 1980s there is no computer industry ; there is only special computer which are used in special center such a nasa or fbi . but nowadays computer are everywhere , in our pocket with our cellphone ! a man , named bill gates , become the richest person in the world who took risk and made a new computer program which is called windows . windows is an easy computer program for ordinary people to use the computer in daily life and it wa a revolution for computer . secondly , trying new thing give person a chance develop himself . for making a new thing people must research and learn new thing . researching process can be so effective for learning and developing new thing is also developing people 's themselves . people think and see new thing which are not important for them before . in addition , traditional way give people traditional success . there is no chance for big and important success . but in taking risk there is tremendous success . in ordinary way make ordinary job , no one remember your name at the end .
