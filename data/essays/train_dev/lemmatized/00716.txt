during the first reading of this task i have already made my choice . i personally disagree with that statement . why ? i have experienced that many people in may surrounding spend much time in helping their / my community . let me give you an example . i know many people who give evening - course for pupil in their age for being better in school and that for free ! another quit good example is the group of some pupil who meet older people / senior during christmas-time for giving some hope and the feeling of being part of the society and i personally think that this is a great supportment for the whole community in a city . there are also some young people in my surrounding who created an anti-drug club for preventing youngster and also older people from taking drug and / or commiting crime . i do not want to show that topic onesided , i mean i clearly know some people who have not taken part in a free social programm instead they prefer watching tv , playing computergames the whole envening or night , disturbing other people , stealing or destroying thing but i think the majority of the youngster i know are really motivated in doing thing for the community , just because of fun and avoiding to be bored by a situation . i know in other society ( china ) pupil have to work for their family and others instead of wasting the time because it is traditional . but relating to the statement , what is enough time to help the community ? i think it is quit enough when someone also do only a half hour or le every day for the community . so it is clear that it is up to everyone to do what he want to do but i think everyone ha also the task to show respect for the community itself and for what they do for every part of the society you live in .
