it is true that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their community . if we look at the youth around u , we find them to be self occupied . they are busy with their own life . the youngster are living a life that is all about their own dream , their own happiness and their own whim . gadgets , friend , movie , discotheque , pub and other such thing are taking them away from their family and the community . if they are not having fun , then , it is the increasing pressure of study that keep them inside their home after the school hour . their study and the stlye of the present school curriculum make sure the the student are studying continuously . the curriculum of most of the educational institution is designed to give theoretical knowledge to the student . lack of practicals take away the chance of any external exposure from the student . apart from study , the lack of interest in extending a helping hand for the matter related to the community can also be observed amongst the youngster . they are becoming a bit self-centred . for them it - me first . everything else becomes secondary for them . another reason for their non participation can be traced to the fact that they do not understand the importance of joint familes and thus the concept of loving and sharing is a little alien to them . earlier , the joint familes kept the people together . they were more tolerant , more caring and had better understanding of the importance of community . but , the concept of nuclear family ha taken away the element of ` together we stand ' away from the youth . last month , the mumbai blast rocked the whole nation and questioned our unity and security both . the terrorirsts involved were young boy . and if we look at the people who had come to help the victim then we find out that they were not the youth but the middle aged or old people . it is not that all the youngster are unhelpful but yes the majority is far too self centred to come out and give time to their community , to think of it well being . apart from this , their modern value , their distance from religion , their shyness , etc are also playing a role in their behaviour . at time , the thought that what can a single man do keep them away from helping others . they need to understand that they have the power to dream and change the world . they just have to take a step forward . it is high time that they realise that the community need them a much a they need the community . their survival and development is dependent on the community of which they are a part . their involvement will do lot of good to them and to their community a well .
