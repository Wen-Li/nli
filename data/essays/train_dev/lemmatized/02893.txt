many academic believe that it is more important for student to analyze and understand concept and idea rather than to study fact . in this essay i will examine whether the benefit of just understanding the idea outweigh the possible advantage of learning fact . firstly , one argument that many people state in favor of the above mentioned opinion is that if you know the idea then you will be able to adapt to a different situation and to apply it to new circumstance . in other word , only if you analyzed the concept then you will be able to use it to new situation . the mere knowledge of fact doe not help in this case since they are only characteristic of a certain point in time and can not be applied universally . secondly , it could be argued that only the knowledge of idea enables you to develop new idea . facts are static whereas idea are dynamic . you can look at idea and concept from different angle and play with them . out of this dealing with a concept a new , further developed idea or system of idea might be generated . mere fact are not open to such a proceeding , they can only be acknowledged . thus , because of these persuasive argument the opinion of the academic seems to be correct . however , the importance of the knowledge of fact can not be underestimated . in most of the time an idea can only be understood if you know the fact on which it is based . most of the idea are born out of a specific situation which is essential for the understanding of the idea . furthermore , an idea can not be further developed if you do not know anything about it origin . you would not be able to apply it to a new situation and surrounding . in conclusion , although there are several strong argument in favor of the opinion mentioned above i believe that the knowledge of the idea and of the fact are equally important . both idea and fact are intertwined with each other and can not be separated . thus , in my view student should study concept a intensely a fact .
