in my opinion , most advertiments make product seem much better than they really are . most advertiments establish for endustrial competion between thousand different company . their competions are fair for their realm but they dont have to be honest for their work . on the one hand , today we are living in techonological world , using satallate and web , watching tv , movie and reading news . always we see advertisement every where for instance , on bus , on wall , on building . i belive they dont tell truth every time because they dont need it . most advertiments company just consider an amount of their sale . they dont care people who buy their product . on the other hand , when i watch tv and see some product which i know so well because i am used to it before . i am just annoying these company . indeed , they are liar therefore i cant trust on them . my point of view is the most important thing related to especially food advertisement . let me give you a picture about fast food company in united states . for example , mc donalds is one of them , this company is common fast food place worldwide . today , we have to endovour and to reveal the most significant problem about obesite in this country and developement country . every day and every where we are facing and watching all this fast food advertiments and feeding ourself and our child in this place . we dont know really what we are eating a well . besides , they could be dangerous for our health , they could be deadly for u . i watched a video about mc . donalds and i saw that they are killing u . in this video ther is a man who ate hamburger and fried potatose every day and he got very serious health condition after thirty day . he had to give up eating mc donalds food . there is no doubth about most advertisement dont give reality for their produc
