the issue that in twenty year the number of car in use will raise or drop is difficult to deal with because there are different argument involved . some people think that there will be fewer car because of the environmental impact in wich the use of car is sued . on the contrary the increase of the number of car in use can be partly justified because the number of inhabitant on earth is still raising very fast . most importantly , rejecting co2 car are responsible in a wide proportion for the atmosphere pollution . every body know the consequence of a high grade of co2 in the atmosphere ; warmer temperature , climate change and so on . so most of the government , acting for the well being of it citizen , are writing new law and inventing new solution tending to reduce the use of car . for instance , in paris , during the summer , only the pair or unpair pattern number are allowed to circulate . secondly , we can stress the lack of petroleum or gas resource today , and the raise of pump price . as car are big user of petrol , their utilisation involve that car owner have the financial power to pay it . as the resource are not eternal and price are getting higher and higher , it seems a an evidence that the number of user will decrease in the next twenty year . another important argument would be that the automotive industry is very big enrgy consumer . indeed , to make a car requires lot of product such a platsics or iron wich consumes a lot of energy to get in available form . then the assembly chain , mostly composed by automatic machine consumes also a lot of energy . so , in the next year , government will probably realise that providing very efficent popular transport would have a good impact on the country energy consumption . to conclude , my strong belief is that even if the populattion is growing all around the world , the trend of environmental legislation in the prevalent car using country will be to decrease the production and the traffic of this type of vehicle in the next twenty year .
