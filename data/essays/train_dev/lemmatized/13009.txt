the car use int he 20th century continuinlgy increase with each year . in country like the united sates an average family will own at leats two car , since there is no other way in order to get from place to place . unless restriction are made on how many car allowed within a household , the amount of car in twenty year will not decrease , but possibly even increase . as the price of car becomes cheaper and cheaper , more people can afford to buy car and therefor will take this advantage . in many country there is no other way to get from palce to place unless you own a car , because of the long travle distance . just looking at the raise in traffic , almost everywhere in this world , proof that there are a lot more car on the street and that the number of car is not going to be declining . as long a the public transportation in many country remains weak and possibly even expensive , on the long run buying a car will do more for one . in many state the public transportation is terrible , there are only a few bus thta drive to the local area , and that every thrity to sixty minute . if people need to be ontime somewhere they wo n't rely on a bus to bring them there , especially if it wo n't even binrg you too close to your destination . systems need to be created such a the u-bahn , bus , and tram system in vienna or even the new york subway system that allows people to get form place to place in a resonable amount of time and under good circumstance . only if people start to use public transporation and their own two foot , will the car use decrease and that outlook is not comming up soon . teenagers can already get thier lisence with 16 and 17 in many countires , which only increase the car use in the world . if every teen in this world ha the possibility of driving a car or even half the teen in this world , that would mean that the car use would most probably double . car use will only stop is emasures are taken against it . the fact that car are used is n't bad but very understandable , yet car that not friendly to the environmetn should be created , such a electrically run car , which would be more expensive , which would also cut down rate on car use .
