today the people show very enthusiam to learn new thing rather than they had experienced in the past . because people also changing their mind set to the developing technology . so that they know more thing in the future and they feel that , it is a great experience and oppurtunity to them . i strongly believe that successful people try new thing and take risk rather than what they know in the previous stage . because everybody do the common thing like knowing already existed once but the successful people are ready to face the problem that are occuring when they are trying to know some new or advanced thing . they are facing so many problem but it give an experience and good result whether it is right or wrong . supose if they achieve positive result in that one they really get a good fame and an ideal pesonality to others , who are interested do like this in the future . suppose for example , one of my friend he is really good career from his childhood onwards . at the age of five , he really do not know about the computer operation and working . larter he face so many problem to learn about that one because his parent are not educated , not having enough money to learn . but at last he totally learned about that one by working a a part time job in one of the computer instituion . finally , that learning is so useful now . today he is working a a software engineer in one of the famous company and having a good name . he is very interested to learn new thing till now . its bacame a hobby today to his . so finally i conclude that people taking risk while they try to know new thing but those are very minute behind their success in the future . even though there is no success in learning new thing they got a valuable experience . hence successfull people try new thing ant take risk rather than what they already know .
