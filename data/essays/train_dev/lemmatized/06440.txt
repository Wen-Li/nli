enjoyment can be defined in different way . according to me , enjoyment or fun is the way one encounter the journey to achieve something , the satisfaction and pleasure with the people around you , etc . eventhough older people enjoy their life in their own way , i personally agree that young people enjoy life more than older people do . the youth ha enormous eagerness or enthusiasm to explore new thing in their life which they did not encounter in their life and willingness to experience . enthusiasm combined with the energy provides them to explore different thing in life such a the latest gadget , technology , people which make their life more adventurous a well a interesting . the old people having already experienced much of their life do not show much enthusiasm like the youth do . the youth also have their big dream which they fight to fulfill . so , they plan their step in such a way to build those dream . the journey they take make their life more interesting . older people , being already fulfilled or failed in their dream , do not enjoy a much a younger people do a most of their life ha been already used . the other main point is regarding the risk they are ready to take . the younger people prefer taking risk be it physical , financial or in any matter . for an example regarding physical activity such a hiking , skiing , rock-climbing , etc are physical exercise which provides immense pleasure . these activity can not be done by older people . in financial sense such a investment , the younger people prefer to take risk to achieve financial freedom a they wish they can resist the risk and can fall back into normal situation after some month or year . older people can not afford these risk . lastly , there are many other thing such a the community , accessory , which younger people enjoy better than older people . the above point show that young people enjoy life more than older people do .
