in my opinion it is better to specialize in one specific subject than to have broad knowladge of many academic subject . there are many reason to agree with this statement . first of all , to apply for a job you need to know specific information about one topic . for example if you aim to be an ingeneer you should know a lot about phisics , otherwise you will not work a an ingeneer . there are no position in where you can work if you do not know any specific subject . being specialized in one area give you the opportunity to find a job where ever you want . another reason why i consider true this statement is because it doe not exist a person who can earn a lot of money working , and doe not been specialized in a specific subject . that is why is so important to make a good choice when selecting a career , if not why it is so difficult to find an position with a good remuneration . it is because if you are not a knowledge person in a specific subject you will not show superiority in comparison with other people . it simply consist in making the difference . last but not least , i consider vital the thing that you need to know in deep about a subject because otherwise you will never have the incetive to keep on knowing even more and more . if you have a broad knowladge of many academic subject you are not able to go on learning more thing . a person need to learn every day something knew about a specific area in order to build up his future expectation about his life . in conclusion i consider it is much more imortant to specialize in one specific subject than to have a broad knowladge of many acadmic subject . that is because is vital in applying for a position , also to be able to earn a good money and finally to have always the ambicious of knowing more and more .
