this statement might be true to some exceptional people but the common successful people do not take risk . first it is difficult to define success . it may apply for money , celebrity or just happiness ( even if hopefully this three thing can work together . .. ) some successful people do take risk and try new thing because their succes comfort them and they know that somehow they have a sort of safety net . people who put their life or money at stake is really rare . for example , a person who owns a prolific business might take a risk by launching a new product but he never put his whole money in it . or at least not unless he know he can always get back on his foot with a stable product or a plan b. and this argument should explain why `` unsuccessful '' person will not take to much risk . surprisingly these person dare taking more risk since they do not have too much , or le , to lose . unfortunately , most of the successful people is coward and prefers to keep doing thing they know . they sort of `` stew '' in their own success . one of the main reason is that `` normally '' , someone ha to work hard to reach the top with a planified goal . except celebrity nowadays , you are not bumped to the successfull category . it take time , effort and sacrificies ( just trying to be happy ) . so why would someone take risk ? the only reason would be that success is boring and in order to dynamized it you have to make some change that can be radical or not . but you may also fall into something even duller . .. to conclude , i do not agree with this statement , probably because i am a part of the coward . one of the main reason is that success is hard to maintain , so once you have it why take the risk to loose it for something worse ?
