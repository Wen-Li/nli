in the present generation we are aware of learning so many new thing . so i think it is more important for student to understand idea and concept than to learn fact . there are several reason to explain the statement . for example , if you learning a computer language skill say like ` c ' language . the tutor will say about all the content such a pointer , string , array and so on is this mean that you are a proffesional in ` c ' language . no , not at all it need lot of practice rather than knowing the fact . with out generating idea we can do nothing with the language eventhough , by knowing the fact another example is , if you take an experiment in the chemistry lab eventhough , if you know the fact about the chemical that how they will change their colour it will not be helpfull in answering the question in the practical exam . therefore you should know the concept behind the chemical reaction then only you can answer the question finally , in some competative exam they will ask the reason for why you are choosing certain answer ? so it can be done only the student who is perfect in the concept rather than knowing the fact so , the above all point will conclude that idea and concept are more important than to learn the fact . moreover , by learning the concept it will be more fetching to the student in several aspect . in some case it play a major role in student career
