i agree with the statement that successful people try new thing and take risk rather than only doing what they already know how to do well . for one example , when you think about business , a company ha to make new product or explore new techiniqe to make difference from other company . if the company can do this , it can apeal cutomer the difference of there producuts or sevices from other 's and it can profit itself monopolicaly . for other example , when you think about a baseball team , every player shoud try new thing , because we do n't need same player so much . it make no sence to have nine powerful hitter . it make nosence to have fast runner . to consitute a strong team , the important point is the balance that can infer best outcome . so every player have to get skill that are diferrent from other 's and new . for last example , if you are an investor , it make no sence to invest like others . iif you want to have an advantage , you hav to invest differently . ofcause i have to admit it is a risky action . you may get a loss sometime . so you have to recognize that there is a risk in investing differently from others . from these reason , i conclude that a long a recognizing the risk of an action , we have to try new thing and teke risk .
