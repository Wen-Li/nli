the number of car in use ha significantly increased during the past decade and it ha been a controversial issue that this tendency will continue in the future a well . some people might claim that the number of car in use will continue increasing possibly thanks to the increasing population in the world . however , i think in twenty year there will be fewer car in use than there are today , for two reason ; high gasoline price and increasing interest in the enviornmental issue throughout the world . firstly , the price of gasoline ha been fluctuated over the past year , partly due to the nature of the resource - limited and will eventually dry up - , and therefore it is easy to say that the price of gasoline will continue going up . also partly because of the tension in the southwestern asia region , where the resource is mainly come from , due to the political conflict and war , the supply of gasoline seems to have been unstable and this situation ha affected the price of gasoline considerably . for these reason , the price of gasoline is very likely to be unstable , and eventually , continue rising ; it would be more and more difficult to use car financially , which could lead to a fewer number of car in use . secondly , a the large number of car in use ha considerable effect on the enviornment mainly by polluting the air , the increasing interest in the protection of enviornment might bring some restriction or limitation on the number of car in use . for example , in korea , although it is not legally restricted , it is encouraged not to drive at least once a week by the government program to make the air of seoul cleaner . although it is only the recommendation by government , given that the many country and ngos have greater interest in the environment issue than they did before , it could be said that there would be some government which start to make restriction on the number of car in use in the city to protect their enviornments . all thing considered , although it can not be predicted accurately , i think it can be said that the number of car in use will be le in twenty year than it is now for two reason such a following , 1 ) the price of gasoline will be unstable and eventually will rise too much to run a car and 1 ) the greater interest in the enviornmental issue may lead the government to impose restriction on the number of car in use in the future .
