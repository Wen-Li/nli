i can not agree . there are many reason why there will be more car in twenty year than today . in the follwing , i try to explain three reason that will have a major impact on the growth rate of personal transportation and therefore on the number of car in the future . firstly , many poor country have the potential to develop their economic power and rise the wealth and income throughout the country . china is a good example . the government in china managed to establish more or le substantial law and condition for prosperity . when people get richer , they often have significant more urge than before . affluent people , or people with a considerable income , want to own car a prestigious object . due to all these reason , it is very likely that especially poor country will experience a high growth rate in the number of car . secondly , the production of car becomes cheaper and cheaper . high end roboters can produce car in a very cost efficient way because they work very efficiently , quickly and almost perfectly . on the one hand , it is not necessary to pay roboters for their work and on the other hand they can produce 24 hour a day . moreover , engineer 's knowledge ha accumulated during more than 100 year and they are now able to produce car that are very cost-efficient in their planing and designing process . thirdly , new technology make it possible to run car without emission . in a few year , car will no longer consume gaz , but they will need a mixture of water and oxygen . this mixture doe not harm the evironment and will be very cheap in the near future . on account of this , care about the environment is no longer a reason the refuse the use of car . for instance , the car make bmw already run test car and even sold them to customer . they run without major complication and are very cost-efficient in their usage and maintencance .
