i used to like to go travel and almost my travel wa followed a tour guide . even though i wa very young i did n't want to having time with a tour guide because it wa very uncomprotable for me . i actually wanted having only our family . so most of time i felt if i grow up in the future , i will go travel by myself . then dream came ture . when i became adult , i went to trip only me and my friend . throught that travel , i realized that traveling by my self is much better to see everywhere and without a guide trip made me a feeling of freedom travel , many experience , and making new friend . first of all , i could feel like freedom without a guide because i could visit more many place which is not expensive but more beautiful . however , if i go travel with a guide , i can go only limited place and i will not feel trip , i will just take picture in ordet to show eveyone . second , i will get variety experience . if i go to french , third , i can make new overseas friend . actually , many people have language problem , and it could be serious problem . however , it could be chance to contect new people . if i do n't feel dangerous or scared , i can have a question to native poeple . also it will help me to go more general place , which mean native 's usual place , or if my new friend come to my contry , i will help them , either . in short , i prefer to trip without a tour guide because i do n't want to
