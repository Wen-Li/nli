since car have been invented an increase in the production ha raised and nowadays to use of a car it ha become a priority to everyday life need . i personally do n't agree with the statement that in twenty year there will be fewer car in use than there are today . as a matter of fact i believe that actually it will probably be the opposite . infact in a world that is under continuo and enourmous progression specially in the mechanical industry , i believe that the problem in the next twenty year will be were to put the car not their use . indeed the problem should be faced form another point of view which is how should we regulate the use of car since allready the situation is terrible . it is true that car have become a major part of life especially for people who live outside big city . in many case for example it is the only way to reach the town in order to go shopping because the pubblic transportation are not efficient . as a conseuqnce the more we continue developing real estate of our city the more the use of our car will continue increasing . looking to the future make me think that the situation will be even worse . all of the interest involved with the use of car such a gas , insurance policy ecc . will make the production of car increas tremendously and probably the bad aspect like pollution related to the use of car will not be a priority .
