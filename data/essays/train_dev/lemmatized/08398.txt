in my opinion , it is better to specialize in one specific subject in an academic study . there are several advantage of both path , however specializing in one topic would enable u to concentrate on one subject and to deal with it detail closer . the main reason behind my belief is that there is not enough time to learn everything and have a deep understanding of every subject . by the increase in the knowledge in acedemic subject , we have to have more time to consider all sphere of one specific subject . for instance , a political science student could not have a deep understanding of the middle east culture and politics in an education period of four year . in addition to his undergraduate education , he ha to have a research in middle east and should attend to a university or an institute which is specialized on middle east . actually an avarege life of a person is not sufficient to have a perfect knowledge of one specific subject . in modern society , the division of labor demand more specialized individual and the society is evolving into a hegemony of technocrat . beginning with the movement of rationalization in the nineteenth century and with the improvement of technology , we have more detailed subject to deal with , contary to pre-modern time . so , there it is not only my preference to get specialized in one specific subject , but it is a necessity for the society . the detail are increasing and we ought to get consistent with this development . we also need to consider that specializing in one specific subject would be meaningless , if it is so independent from the context which it is belonged to . for example , it would be meaningless to know everything about the history and the culture of the middle east , if the person would not have the enough information about the history of the whole world and the relation between civilization . in conclusion , a a result of the development of the modern society , people have to specialize in one specific subject . because there is not enough time to deal with many academic subject .
