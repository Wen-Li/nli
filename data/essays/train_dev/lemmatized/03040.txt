i agree that most advertisement make product seem much better than they really are . i think most of the advertisement are to trick people . first of all , advertisement are made to appeal their product to people . when the company make advertisement , it must appeal what is so good about their product and attract people to buy it . so they emphasize , sometimes exagerate , good part of the product so that people will know what is cool about the product . of course , they do n't highlight any bad part of the product . as a result , when customer buy the product and find out that there are some bad part , which were never mentioned in the advertisement . when this happens people find that advertisement made product seemed much better than they really are . for example , let 's say that there are two advertisement about two eraser . one say `` this is the best eraser ever invented . '' and the other one say `` this eraser is better than normal eraser . '' i think most of the people will buy the eraser that wa advertised a the best eraser . probably there is not much difference in those two . but it is better than buying `` little above average '' eraser . but in this case , apparently the advertisement made the eraser seem much better than they really are . i bought a mechanical pen , that wa advertised that they wo n't get my hand tired . but when i used the pen , i did n't feel any difference from using the other pen . it made my hand tired . i did n't have a high-expectation for the product , so i wa fine about it . but this wa a good example of product being not what they were supposed to be according to the advertisement . even though that advertisement do n't give very accurate idea of the product , people know that most advertisement exagerate their product a a common sense . so i do n't think there is a major problem to overadvertise their product .
