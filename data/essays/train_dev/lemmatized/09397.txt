i believe that in the next twenty year there will be decline in the number of car used today . there are a few reason why i think so firstly with the immense growth in the population and scarcity of space available to live and commute would decrease the number of car . this is because travelling on the public transport would be much more convenient than standing in the long traffic jam . second reason would be coming up of highly safe and convenient public transport system . the government is working on such issue and by the end of twenty year would have excellent transportation system like public bus , train , tram and metro which can take the person to his destination in much le time than the individual car . e.g in capital of india i.e. delhi , with the coming up of metro a lot of time is saved by the people working and commuting through car . third reason i believe is spiralling price of gas and petrol because of huge demand . this high cost of driving car would discourage their use in coming year and will lead to fewer car in use than there are today . the non-renewable source of energy used to drive car are getting finished up slowly and slowly and fifty year from now would be a time when we would have no fuel left . so switching to public transport will also solve the problem and slow the process of depletion of these resource . also with the increase in inflation in indian economy , the common man is looking for alternate mean to cut down the cost . so if a much viable and convenient solution is available then he would surely switch over to the use of cheap and better mode of transport . all these reason combined would make the common man to willingly come out of his luxury of car and use cheap and time - effective mean of transport like bus , train etc .
