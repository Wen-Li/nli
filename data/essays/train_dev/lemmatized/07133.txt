i agree with successful people try new thing and risk . i have some reason why i think when successful people try to new thing thoes are not professional , weak experience and knowlege about new thing . from thoese point , people have to take risk when they try to new thing eventhough they are already successed before . first , he is not a professional about new thing . for example , a man who is a really successful restaurant owner . every body want to open restaurant , like him . he probably ha some successful idea and action . also , he is sure about his restaurant food and style . it make him professional owner . however , if he want to get another shop , such a flower . he like flower , but it is not enough to open the flower shop . even if he is a successful restaurant , it doe n't have a grantee of successful flower shop . second , person who want to try to new thing doe n't have enough experience . as i wrote about the man who is the successful restaurant owener . he ca n't open flower shop easily because he doe n't have lot experience about it . everything is different . for example , when you eat some food , you can realize that every food ha different taste . it come from experience . last , person who want to try to new thing doe n't have enouth experience . the man who i wrote an example is a successful man from his own business . maybe , the he ha enough knowlege about it , but he is not get easily . some of knowldge from book , specific person , and so on . but , most important knowlege from own experiece . i mentioned in conclusion , thoese reason which are not professional , weak experience , and knowldege . in my opinion , wherether successful people or not successful people have take risk when they try to new thing . also , we do n't know that successful people can possible to have failed experience . that 's why i agree with successfil people try new thing and take risk tather than only doing what they already know how to do well .
