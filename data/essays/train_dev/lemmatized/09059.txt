the big exchange through the huge use of plane now adays i start to feel that the car will be history . in spite of the large number of car , the plane number in growing . since the first flight over the ocian people began to love the plane speed and to save time in travel . in plane the people do n't get tired of driving or even make an accedent which usually found in car . also plane can transport a large quantity of thing and in no time , and that we really miss in car . and the big reason that in the air there are no traffic jam ( at least until now ) . all of the reason above will make the people think of travel in plane , or even own thier private plane which is ussually smaller then the ordinary plane . with all these benefit , the people still feeling worried about traveling in plan instead of car . since 11/9 people began to think of the worst thing can happen to them which is kidnapping , but this feeling begin to be history in now adays . the plane accedents are much smaller in number than accedents with car which make the people feeling comfortable . i thing in 20 year the airport will be more and more the plane on the other hand will develop and pilot school will be opened to ordinary people . many shape and model of plane will appear , many company will exchange thier prouduction of ar into plane for example : i think we will see a nice gmc plane or even a toyota plane ... there will be also small airfield near almost every street . the use of car will be like riding horse now ! and the most exiting thing is to have your own plane , airport and passenger . there will be a taxi plane and that what i call it : the big exchange
