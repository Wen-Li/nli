over the past century , pedagogue all over the world have been discussing whether it is more effective for student to understand idea and concept or to learn the fact about thing . this debate ha not been won by one side or the other and one can only state a personal preference on it . personally , i think that a child or student will gain more from understanding idea and concept and from being able to apply this knowledge than by a mere memorisation of fact . to learn fact often mean to memorise something written in a textbook or something heard during a lecture . but how effective can this process be ? will it enable the student to apply what s/he ha learned ? i do not think that this is the case . i went to university in italy where the school ( and university ) system is still based on memorisation and in my experience , student there will learn fact , memorize them until their exam is due and then forget about them . in most of the case , they were not able to apply what they have learned . an example : they were very good in the subject of english grammar , knew the difference between all four german case , but when it came to speak english or german , they would not be able to pronounce a correct phrase . the learning of fact can often be very boring . the student ha to concentrate to memorize something s/he might not even understand ; often it is a theory that s/he can not relate to . to learn the fact is important because it give the student necessary background information , but it is much more fun for a student to discover some fact for him/herself . in a kindergarden class , the kid would definitely be more interested to have a frog in their classroom , to observe the animal and learn about it this way than by reading about it in a textbook . they would understand much better what the teacher is talking about if they can experience it in person . of course it is important to learn fact . but in my opinion it is a traditional , rigid way of learning that often doe not respect the inborn curiosity of ( young ) student . like in many other case , a mixture between both theory would be a good solution . first , the fact should be told . then idea and concept should be understood by the student , so that s/he can apply what s/he ha learnt earlier . after all , life is not just about fact , but about the idea and concept that lay beneath these fact a well .
