i agree with the statement that the successful people try new thing and take risk rather than only doing what they already know how to do well . i think trying new thing would make people successful . this is because you can get to know more about different thing and expand your view from many perspective . seeking more into one subject is a great thing , but trying to do new thing would be more beneficial in the future . by doing new thing throughout your life can make them experienced . it 's a wonderful thing to be an experienced person . by being an experienced person , people can solve more problem than those of the people who only know one thing and ha interest in one thing . i think expanding your view and being experienced would lead you to gain reliance from people . many people respect those of the people who have their own point of view and experience . so by being the one who is respected , they would be surrounded by people who are respectful and reliable . taking risk rather than not will make that person 's heart strong . i think to be an successful person , you would need to have some kind of risk . larger the risk , the stronger you 'll be . it is because you can not get stronger if you do not have courage to take the risk . it 's is not the risk that is important . it is the courage that is important when you take the risk . it is hard to be courageous at first , however , after you have taken that risk , you would be very satisfied with what you have done . there are many way for a person to be successful and these example are only few out of those many way . i always think that experienced and courageous people can be successful with their life in a lot of different way .
