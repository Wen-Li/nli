the place of car in our daily life is a really controversial topic . but , i think that some element allow u to think that in twenty year , there will be fewer car in use than there are today . first and foremost , pollution ha become a real issue and governements all around the world begin to be aware of the danger of the use of car for our planet . they hence try to implement some policy in order to reduce it or remplace it . the kyoto agreement encourages for instance to improve common transportation like the tube or bus . moreover , to my mind , it 's only the first step and in the next year , these policy will be more numerous and more efficient . in addition , our society acknowledge that the use of the car trigger a lack of physical exercise and some problem like obesity . walking now is becoming a popular way to move . furthemore , technology and communication allow u now to do a lot of thing without leaving our home . for instance , you can go and do our shopping on the internet . and it 's just a beginning . a lot of new possibility will appear in the next few year . some people nowadays still work at home . they hence do n't have to use their car to go to work and it 's actually the main purpose of the car in our society . these new kind of worker will develop a well and so car wo n't be used in the same number and in the same way a today . by way of conclusion , i would like to say that i really back up this idea that there will be fewer car in use in twenty year than there are today thanks to the awareness of their pollution and the progress of technology .
