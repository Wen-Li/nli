different generation have different view of life and each person ha his own way to enjoy his life . i believe that life could be enjoyable by everyone who want to enjoy it . it is not necessary that a young person enjoys his life more than an old one . it is commonly known that youngster have the enthusiasm to lead a happy life , free from dependence on some social more that they see in some case a a resriction over their want . and it is also commonly known that old people are very `` self-contained '' ; they lack the enthusiasm and the effervesence that youngster have . in my opinion , those view are fuzzy because i personally know many old people who know well how to enjoy their life , and my grandfather is the best example . when looking at his face , one can see that he is full of life like a kid . also , when examining his behavior , one can infer that he is more tended to enjoy his life regardless of his age for instance , he travel several time a year to every corner of the world trying to explore different place , different culture , and different people this is why he have numerous friend of diffrent age and different gender from several country . conversely , i have a good example of a young person who ha no concern in enjoying life , he is my neighbor , he view that he is `` born to die '' . with holding such philosophy , he ha no special interest or mean of distraction and entertainment , he doe not have any pleasure when doing thing . to recapitulate , i believe the fact of enjoying life doe not merely depend on a specific generation or on one 's age , but rather on one 's will and one 's want to benefit a much a possible from his life . hence , enjoying one 's life is mostly a matter of perspective from which we perceive thing .
