knowledge is considered a a key for any progress in human life . through knowledge people can be able to develop the standard of their daily life . they also be able to improve their social and cultural status among others . for example , if some one who specializes in energy , but having broad knowledge about other branch of science and culture could deal with so many matter a the same time . also this broad knowledge will help him to communicate with many society of different culture . at the social level a guy with this broad knowledge will find himself having a very sensitive rank in the community for all people will refer to him to have consultancy and advises . on the other hand a guy confining himself to a single specific specialization with no knowledge in other science will be isolated and have limited contribution at social , cultural and economic level . for instance if some one specializing in mathemics with no ther knowledge will only make contribution to development of this community through this field . but if he is asked to contributed to other field that are needed with aview of developing his community , he fail to do so . from other perspective having broad knowledge mean your are capable to serve you homecountry and your people whenever they need your help and assitance during hard time . so we should urge all people around the world , in general , and our own people in particlar to make use of their leisure time to have a broad knowledge about different subject that may contribute in the development of their country . for example , if some one 's major is in physician , but his country is a great need for some one with a background in economics , he will provide unvaluable advise when needed . therefore , i strongly recommend and support the multiplicity of specialization for all people with concentrating on one of them .
