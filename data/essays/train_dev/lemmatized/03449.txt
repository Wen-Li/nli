now i am at the later of 20 . combining my own experience and borrowing experience of my friend in china , i tend to disagree with the statement . in my point of view , both young and the older people know the importance of enjoying life , however , young people are different from the older one in how frequency , what and why to enjoy life . to start with , mostly young people enjoy life in a different pace from the older one . i think this is one of the factor that mislead others believe that young guy are enjoying life more than the older one . during weekend or typical vacation season , we can easily find young men or woman emerging almost every corner of trendy entertainment place , ranging from hot scenic spot to cute bar in the town . on the contrary , older people are rarely found . however , we have to understand more behind that . these occassions are the best time for the young guy to go out since normally during the weekday , they have to spend time in the office from 800am to late a 800pm . it should be more fair to conclude if we considered that it wa also the young people who spent most of time during the weekday to work overtime . secondly , young people enjoy life in a variety of form which are quite different from the older one . activities such a reading , playing card or majiang ( a traditional chinese game ) , or watching tv program are favorite one for older people . however , nowadays , young people have different fun to enjoy . they enjoy to have activity in a more lively and trendy form such a fitness exercise , hiking , drinking and sharing with friend in the bar . since those trendy activity are more publicized , it is easy to conclude that young people enjoy life more than the older one . lastly , it is the different view toward life that determines the variance between young peope and older one when they enjoy life . contrary to older people who more often view life and work are seamless connected in china , youngster will treat life and work separately . they understand that work is disconnected from life . in some extent , a happy life is the basis for a successful work . therefore , it is critical to enjoy life to full when off work while to concentrate on work vice versa .
