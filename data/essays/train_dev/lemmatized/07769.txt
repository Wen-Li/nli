i do think that there will be few car in use in twenty year than there are today , because we do not have enough resource a petrolem and our environment can not stand for the pollution for another twenty year . although car is convenient , it is not a good vehicle of transportation because we have already pay much price on it . the most significant reason i think that the use rate of car will reduce in twenty year is we will lack of the resource pretty soon . since car ha been invented and the industrial revolution , the natural resource of petrolem become needed than ever . however , it take time for petrolem to be mature but we ignore this fact for a long period because we can not not live without it . nowadays , almost every family ha at least one car and the demand of the industry cause the petrolem reduce faster than it can grown . this kind of natural resource can hardly be fixed and last forever once it ha been used out . the car amount will decay because it is not easy to find a replacable resource to cover and our environment can not take the side effect that came along with the pollution . bscause of the humenbeings , earth ha suffered for a long time because of the pollution . in brief , our main concerned now is to reduce the amount of car . if we do not take it seriously , the disaster came with the industry activity will rullin every creature that live on the world . air pollution , water pollution and all these kind of issue should be protected immediately . i think the amount of car will be fewer in use in twenty year than there are today . the two major reason that make it occur is the lack of natural resource and the pollution . we need to take action a soon a possible not only because we do not have energy to drive our car but because we do not want to drive the car . this is a kind of action that protect the environment in a most effective way .
