each and every person like to enjoy life . some think that young people enjoy life more than older people while some may think the opposite . different individual have different view . in my view young people enjoy life more than older peole do but not always . young people are full of energy and enthusiatic . they like to enjoy each and every moment of life . they are usually fit and fine a compared to older people . so they have the energy to enjoy each and every moment . young people usually watch movie , play sport or even make girlfriend to entertain themselves . they feel that this is the only age to enjoy , so they try to take full out of it . they consider this age a if the age of entertainment and adventure . old people on the other hand are too weak to entertain themselves by playing sport or by going for a adventurios trip . they also watch movie very rarely and only few of them make girlfriend at this age . most of the time they remain ill and complain about their health . older people often like company of others , if they are alone they might feel disconnected from the world and the enthusiasm to enjoy the life dy gradually . as i stated above that young people enjoy life more than older people but not always . young people have many tension regarding their education and career , so they can not enjoy the life at it full . older people on the other hand are free from tension , so they can enjoy the life at it best . young people often think about their career and remain involved in their regular curricular or business activity and are not able to deliver appropriate time for enjoyment or pleasure . so it can be said that young people enjoy life more than the older people but not always and not in all situation a this is the age when they have to plan for their entire remaining life .
