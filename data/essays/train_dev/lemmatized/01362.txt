in away i do agree because it god to try new thing and taks risk allso , but not to much it debase on the risk that you taken , and the thing that you will do . for exampel , a man or woman now abuot mecanis and want to try electrecs no prablom it allmost in the same maiger , thets the way i can tell it ok to take the risk and it a new thing too . but they shud n't take in baialogical or in speed rasing and they do n't now about rasing . so thers is a lement for the risk that they well take becouse thre a lemit for the risk that they taken . in another way i think ho want to do a new thing and take the risk should be a matuer person and now what he doing in the same time . so he or she can make shuore that they are in the right plac , or they can get help from another people like people wheth experunes and , have the careg and , successful too . so i think now you see the defrent in the two part of being successful and try to do new thing and take the risk in asafe way wheth help from experiens people and taking the risk in fare defrant way wheth out nowing what you are doing . people ho think of being in the same thing of what they now are ether fraid of doing somthing new or fraid of taking the risk becouse they want to be cabted insaid like bing in him self becouse he or she think it will make him or here unsuccessful and they will lose the canfedanents thats in them . in the end i think people shoul be more canfedanent in them self .
