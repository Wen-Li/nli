in spite of the benefit of learning fact , i believe that it is more important for student to understand idea and concept . there are three main reason why i have this opinion . in the first hand , i support the idea that understand idea and concept in a field ( for instance economy ) give a overall comprehension of this field and the process that can occur in that field . thus , it allows graduate student that come into the labor market to meet the requirement of numerous job even if they did not study certain characteristic of some task . then , i have the belief that when a student ha well understood idea and concept in a field , he is then able not only to understand the new event that can take place in this area , but also to learn itself from this fact . finally , from my perspective , the fact are widely dependant from the time and the condition in which they occur . consequently , an event that took place in a certain situation or a certain country , for example a major worker strike in france before a change in political majority , can not be interpreted than one in bangladesh during a very harsch time . futhermore , fact may be linked to a fashion in the way of thinking or the way of product good . an illustration of this idea could be the the fact that an american citizen sold a lot of french foie gras because he like that at a certain period , but still not do that because of a change in both the relationship between the american government and the french one , and the way to consider the treatment of the duck . however , i admit that learning fact may help a understand concept either not concrete at all or a little difficult . as a conclusion , i think that it is both more important and useful for the future life for student to understand idea and concept . nevertheless , learning fact can sometimes be necessary .
