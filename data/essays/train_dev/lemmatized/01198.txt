car as an object of desire i would really wish this stament would turn out to be true but i do not think that in twenty year there will be fewer car in use than there are today . even though there is incredible technologic progression occur in transportation , sociologic research have shown u that a car is more than an instrument of transportation . it is an indicator of a social status . although the developping technology are making our life more comfortable , still people have craving for object of desire , object of self-satisfaction ; such a car . it is true that the public transportation devise are improving in each passing day . i remeneber one it wa impossible to imagine a train passing through a tunnel which is under the sea . by this invention now people who live in paris can work in london . however when we speak of the transportation within a city , people insist on driving their own car no matter how disastrous the traffic jam could get in morning hour when everybody is rushing to work . they get in their car , usually one car for one person , and they prefer to be isolated from public in this safe but burdensome ride with all the traffic jam . i believe this is an egoistic attitude because preffering the public transportation would solve a lot of problem , especially the traffic jam . as i said before the people are stubborn and rigid on not giving up their car in the sake of the improvement of the traffic condition . they are concerned about their car because car have a significant symbol which underline the social status of a person . maybe this is a specific case for turkey ' in fact for istanbul , i am not sure . the parking is also another huge problem here . there are more private parking lot ( parking lot mafia we call it beacuse they make a lot of money ) than natural park . every space is considered a parking lot . the parking lot are like gallery in specific place of istanbul . the vallets arrange them in an order where the most expensive car are displayed with great care . in that way the owner of the car is also happy and tip the man more . when the situation is like that who would give up their car ? in fact , by the developping technology new and more luxury car are produced in each day . advertising company emphasize the need to change your car to a more advanced model if you really wish to maintain your social status . you need to be updated . who would give up these object that we fetished ? no way . .. in conclusion , i do not think that the number o the car in use are going to decrease in twenty year . in fact the demand for luxury car are going to rise . the use of public transportation devise are going to decline so the problem concerning traffic jam and parking space are not going to be solved beacuse a car is more than what it is used for . it ha a whole fancy myth behind it to which we are all attracted unconsciously .
