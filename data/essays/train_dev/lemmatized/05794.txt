i think that is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subject than to specialize in one specific subject . my opinion is supported by our everydays ' life where the people ha many suddenly problem at scholl or in work . if i have a good knowledge in a specific subject i can well do a specific work , but it is impossible to have a work where there are n't problem with other specific work . so this is important that the university or in general the school give a broad knowledge of many academic subject and support in general the culture . because if our society is composed by person who do not want understand to much of thing but want understand determinated or specifically thing , this society is died . my university is the best exaples to demonstrate that it is important study many subject than study a specific subject
