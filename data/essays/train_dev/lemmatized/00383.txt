if the youth new and if the youth is an old thought which ha always been used to question the issue of this essaz . this is a controversery issue . indeed how could life be characterized to enable u to affirm that young people more enjoy it than older do . considering the interresse , expectation in life , culture and financial ability , one would agree or not . indeed about young people , although they have the physical power and the strenght to try everything and to make new experience , they can travel all over the world , are able to lern many thing and plan for a tomorow , they still have a lot all misadventure coming and are rarelly realy fit to accept some reality and therefore go through deception bad side of life . older people have gone through or have had the opportunity of going through everything live had offered to them , have made their choice and now can look over their shoulder and smile or not . in any case , for them the action part of the life belongs to history and they can enjoy other feature of the life they have . rich people from reach family have a defined way and they don t need to burder for what they have to achieve . still their youth is uncertain because everything change and they also lack of everlasting certainity . i believe one can only really enjoy when the work is done and although life can be exiting and pleasant some time , everybody always get up in the morning and start again to built up . everydaz enjozment help u to get over but the real enjoyement is that of the older who know how thez have have done .
