in every time and every part of the world , young people are criticized that they had changed for bad , especially by the adult . and always it is partly true . but this time i disagree with the statement , which say young people do not give enough time to helping their community . i think , nowadays young people rather do give enough time to helping their community . today , let me explain my opinion and supporting reason . first of all , young people are said to be so much indulged that they do not contribute for the community by the adult . but i think , they become much more active for their community than adult say . i saw a documentary film about the cleen-up project in shibuya . in that film , even girl called gals or guy like teamers , who are most likely to be explained dull and infavor of anything , take part in the project . actually , when gal expressed their opinion to others , they seems to be more enthusiastic than any other adult same participate in the project . so it mean that they sincerely think of their community , and give their time and passion . and secondly , someone say that young people are not interested in their community so they do not give their time in to helping their community . but i oppose that opinion either . my friend take part in sanja festival in asakusa for 10 year , and she found interest in it . and amazingly , not only her is the person who think that . year by year the young people who take part in the festival increase . it mean that , if community open up to youth and communicate with them more , young people interested in their activity . i think , everyone should do something before being analogous to young people for how le helpful young people are , and how le time young people use for community . youths always have interest , and time for their community to use . i can say that , only if having very little opportunity , young people are more active for helping their community .
