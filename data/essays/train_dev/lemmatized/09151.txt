i agree with statement . young people do enjoy there life morethan older people , young people have more energy and more adrenalin which heips them to do whatever they want on the other side older people have le energy and enthusiasm , there body are weak and so they have to think twice before they do anything . for example if a young man want to go for a tour in his holiday then the first thing that come to his mind is where to go , whom to take , when etc but when a old persom considers a trip to go somewhere the first thing that come to his mind is how long will be the journey and what all precaution he need to take . young people can freely do whatever they want but older people may have many health problem which will restrict them from doing thing which they wuold have liked to do . young people can eat , drink do anything they like but older people will have many restriction . when it come to sport young people are encouraged to play many of them where a older people are always cautioned and even they are afraid play to there full potential . older people mind set is mainly different when compared to younger people like they look at life a journey coming to an end mostly thinking about what they have achieved and feeling satisfied where a young people never think of ther past they always plan their future , they view there life a a beggining of a great journey . for example older people think about there college time when they were young always thinking of the funny thing and there personal experience and feeling satisfied . where a young people think and plan about there how to enjoy there life like planning to go for tour with friend or play game with his friend , constantly thinking how to enjoy there life . so in the end i conclude that younger people enjoy
