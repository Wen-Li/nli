the question whether young people enjoy life more than old people can not be answered absolutely . it varies from person to person . there are , however , several factor that speak in favor of the thesis that this is indeed the case . there is a mental , a physical and a historical aspect to this issue which i want to use to support the thesis that in general life is more fun when you are young . in order to do so , i first want to assume that the difference between old and young is a question of age in year and secondly that the person to be compared live in similar condidtions ( other thing being equal - basically ) , which are not extreme . first the mental part . an important influence on the daily life of a youngster is the fact that he think he still ha a future . whether he see it a something entirely good or bad doe not matter , extreme case excluded , there will always be hope and hope lead to a positive attitude towards life . an old person ha a different perspective . he or she will see life more in the retrospective view and will therefore see more often the chancec forgone , excluding the few very lucky people that have always taken the right choice of course . so generally , young people will have a better mindset than older people to enjoy life . the second point is about health . young people are more healthy a their whole body is in a more dynamic state and better able to heal or develop in the desire direction and to enable them to a broad range of activity . also the chemical balance in the first 20 or 30 year favour a more intensive spectrum of feeling - although , admittedly , to both side . the elderly on the other hand have to cope with limitation by their body . we become sick more often a well a our strength decrease . this is an important fact to keep in mind when comparing age and youth . in addition the former and the latter subject are interlinked a the saying `` men sana in corpore sano '' suggests . thirdly the historical aspect . in the past the world ha changed only slowly and periodically whereas in today world change becomes an ever increasing and determining factor in daily life . the ability of company to survive is increasingly determined by the ability to cope with change . and so it is with young and old people that have to live in this world . young people are able to learn and adapt better than old people who experience becomes outdated at an ever increasing speed . so the development of the world favour young people more than old people . so mentally , physically and culturally young people have better chance to enjoy life . the most important point to remember , however , is that you are only a old a you feel and that age is not a question of year . there is no rule that you can not stay young mentally when you are getting older ( at least not to a certain degree ) , that you enjoy your body , having accepted it limit and that you try to keep up with change . when you manage to do so , you stay young - and enjoy life .
