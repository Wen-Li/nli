there are many way to travel but the one way that i most prefer is to travel is in a group by a tour guide . therefore , i agree with the following statement . first , the tour guide are able to help u . when we go with tour guide , they knew where are the best place and the most popluar place that traveller go , so we can go the place that are popular and place so we do n't have to spend much of time by going unpopular place and un neccessary to go . also , the travel with the tour guide are more comfortable . for example , the tour guide are able to speak the language that you traveled so we do n't have to spend time by having a conversation problem and they also know . second , we can meet a lot of people and be friend with them . when i traveled to europe . i met a lot of people in there . there is a person who live in island and someone who life far away from me . while we move to other country or city we always have to spend five to four hour by riding a bus so we played variety game and we became freinds on a last day of the trip . after the trip we traded each others address , telephon number and e-mail . also , after that when i visited the island that one of the member life i had a luch with them and talked about the europe trip that we had a few month ago and we trade each others photo by sending e-mail . i like the travel that in a led by a tour guide because the tour guide are able to help u and we can meet a lot of people and be friend with them but i think what ever way it is travel give so many rememberable remembers !
