i agree with this statement . i feel the student understad idea and concept then fact . it is clear the student lern more his idea and concept rather then the fact in classroom . soi agree with this statement . in generally anysubjects are clasified ind two way either scince or social . speciaaly in social subject we lern so many thing like histry geography economics and civics i tdiffer what we see to what we lern in histry . suppose few contries histry le then the 500 year but those contries are now word bigest lephacanamis and those rool entair world . in starting of twentiath century ther is no development of electronics scince . now we arre not thinking with of eleconics and computer and power but is it is truth . so many thing the idea and concept very iportent . like a meterials . their chemical bonding conductvitytypes of meterial these are lern from idea and concept only not throuth fact . in meterial we have different type of classification fron thier characteristic supose now we are disscussed scince class . in this case i would like to discous solour system . insolor system sun is not revolving but we feel sun is moving from east to west in naturally the earth is moving fron west to east . and i will give another example if we travel any vehicle we feel soroundings are moving we feel we are stationary like that . an other example we feel earth is like plat it 's not like a sphere shape but actually our earth is sphere shape not flat shape . but generaaly we feel it is a flat shape ,, if it is plat shape sun rising time and sun set time must be same but it is not true . i feel above threee example we understand idea and concept s then theit is for then to lern fact . i give one technical example in this case . in general we are not acept energy transfer in real life but energy transfer one form to an other form of energy . but from fact we are disagree we can produce from heat to cold . in our fact life we feel it 's very diffuclt . but it produced the heat is ( in boiler ) some kinetic energy this kinetic energy converted into electical energy with help of terbine , and finally electrical energy into cold from with help of refregaration process . so i stangly agree my entair part of discution . `` that is more importent to student to understand idea and concpts then the it is for them to lern fact '' .
