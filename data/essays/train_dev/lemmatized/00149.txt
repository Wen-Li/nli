how many time have you got deceived by commercial ? how many time have you regreted buying thing you saw on commercial because they were not a good a they seemed ? i am sure that this happened to many of you . i think that commericals always inflate what product really are . there are many product which are not good and have lot of commercial . on the other hand , there are many product that do n't do much advertisement which are much better than product which advertise all the time . so a product having many advertisement doe n't necessarily mean that the product is good . i can speak about this out of experience . i once saw an advertisement on the television about a soultion that remove all type of stain . i wa so thrilled by the advertisement that i bought one for me and one for my sister . one day my friend came to my house and she spilled blueberry juice on her white shirt . i proudly got the soultion and rubbed it on the stain a instructed . shockingly , i figured out later that the more i rubbed the more the stain spread . i wa very embaressesed from my friend who had to throw her shirt after that day . in addition , a lot of the thing mentioned in advertisement are incorrect . i once saw a toothpaste commercial that stated that this toothpaste give 12-hour protection to the teeth from decay and plaque . as a dentist , i knew that this did n't make any sense . there is no such thing a `` 12-hour protection '' . it is well-known that plaque start growing on teeth right after you brush them . unfortunately , false advertisement lead to a waste of money and loss of trust between customer and seller . therefore , i think that there should be a commitee to supervise what is being mentioned in advertisments .
