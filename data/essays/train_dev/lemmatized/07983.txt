it is ofcourse more important for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact . i completely agree with the above given statement . learning is an imporant part of a person 's life . right from the time when a child is born , he learns to eat , to drink , to walk , to play and so on . after some time , he learns to study and take the student 's life . at school , teacher teach him various subject a a result of which he need to learn fact . he mug up these fact in order to excel a a student . i , however , think that just learning and mugging up fact is not the requirement attaining success . this doe not serve the purpose of education . on the other hand , an understanding of the idea and concept is what hold importance . one should get a clear knoledge of the idea which have been explained in a subject matter . when a student gather knoledge and information in this way , he becomes able to successfully apply these concept in his life . this not only help him a a student but also becomes useful in his future . a successful student then becomes successful in his professional life a well . this is because he learns to use his knoledge into practicality . the above stated reason clearly stress and explain my point of view . according to me , getting student to learn fact and idea other than mugging up fact can be encouraged only with the help of the educational institution . i hence conclude my essay by saying it is only possible when thereis a change in the attitude of the teacher who are a part of the educational institution such a school , college and university . teachers will have to explain the imporance of understanding idea instead of learning thing nd encourage them to studyin this manner .
