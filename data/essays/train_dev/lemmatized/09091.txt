i have a opposite opinion to the idea that after twenty year , there will be fewer car in use than there are today . i have three main reason for my opinion . first , car are convinient than other vehicle such a airplane and bike . it is true that airplane could travel faster than car but it is not a vehicle that everyone could easily operate . in addition , i think more people are going to use car replacing bike . for example , when i wa in hurry to school , i had to ride my bike since i did not have a car . it took me long time and i wa late , so i have always hoped to have a car since then . other example is that when i took a train to go to the concert hall in suburb area , because it wa rush hour , i had to be in overcrowded train . i did not feel good being smashed with lot of people . furthermoer , i had to walk to that concert from the train station because there were not any public transportation near that concert hall . this experience made me think that car are more confortable and convenient than any other transportation . second , new technology have made car improve . some people argues that car pollute air . however , since the technology have developled electronic car , it will not be bad for the environment . for example . i went to one town in switzerland , where only electronic car were allowed . not only car but public bus and train were running by electricity . not until i found the electronic car did i think that car are not going to give bad effect in environment . finally , the price of the car will certainly go done . it is much cheaper to buy a car than in the past . this mean that it would be easier for people to purchase a car . for example , if the car price go down , people in developing country would be able to buy car . because the climate is bad in most of those country , people would be happy to ride on a car rather than to walk on hot dessert . for the reason above , i am convinced that more people are going to use car in twenty year .
