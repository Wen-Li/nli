i totally agree with this statment that is , in my personal vision , the most important thing that a student should learn a soon a possible , also during the elementary class . to learn math formula , historical date , to memorize poem . .. is important ? yes , but only in a short term ! for a student is mor important understant the reason why that there are behind that ha studied , overall considering his future , his professional life . nowadays , in fact , with the globalization , with the new tecnologies ( such a th worldwide well-know , the world wide web , internet ) and with the fast available of all the information the real skill is not to know a fact , to be updated about the main issue all around the world ; there is a new verb in english tongue : to google , that mean to find information in a fast way : this operation is easy , is not necessary a particular knowledge . the real skill is an other . to apply own knowledge in a particular field , to achieve an adding value . what i mean speaking of adding value ? considering , for example a marketing department for a modern enterprise , i think that the person that follow the product that will be market for the final consumer , called product manager , do not apply only the concept learn at the university in his project work , but should create an innovative way to push the product thinking to the real necessity of the person and finding a solution to resolve them . in this example , there is the main consideration that a student , when wa at school or at university should think : do not memorize or learn only to have a good result in the short term ( in a test , for example ) , but for a better reason , in the long term : to find more way to find a solution or to create new project .
