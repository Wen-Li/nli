these day a large number of people say that leraning fact is the most important and substantisal way to improve themselves . however , i agree with the idea that it is more important for student to understand idea than to learn fact because student with idea or concept can enable people to explain thing more efficiently and student have more time to spend studying than do adult . the main reason are a follows . one reason that student should put higher priority on idea or concept than on fact is that idea and concept can help people to explain thing logically . to be more specific , studens can classify , confirm and assure thing with fixed idea . for example , my brother always tell me the reason why thing go on a it do because he studied a lot of idea and concept in his university . however , i did not study idea . so my knowledge is just only from experience or fact . to be honest , it is quite difficult for me to explain something to other people because i do not understand the real idea or concept . many people told me that they do not understand my explanation at all . that is why i thing to learn idea is the most important . the other reason that student can have better benefit from idea than fact is that student have more time studying idea than doe adult . that is to say , even if adult want to study idea , it take long to learn concept of thing . for example , a i mentioned above , my brother studied idea and concept in his university . i actually envy him because he can explain thing better than i . so i decided to learn concept by mysefl . however , sicnce i am working for a company six day a week , i did not have enough time to learn idea enought . hence , i regret not studying idea in my university . in conclusion , i agree with the idea that it is more important for student to understand idea and concept than is is for them to learn fact , for the above reason . when i have child , i will force them to learn idea and concept in their university in order not to have trouble explaining people .
