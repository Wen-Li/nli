in today 's global environment , some people prefer to do routine task to be successful , others prefer to create new thing to be successful . personally , i believe that successful people try new thing and take some risk instead of doing routine thing . firstly , people who try new thing and take risk are generally succesful making profit in business environment . in these day , the most of the corporation prefer innovative employee . innovation mean creating new idea such a new product and new service . the new product which are done by corporation especially , employee are successful . as a result , these company can have higher profit . generating new idea and thing can provide success for an employee . for example , i had an internship experience in my country two year ago in summer . i observed that manager who are in high level position always talk about innovation . also , they suggested that i should be open to new idea . the second important point is the demand in the world . in today 's world , in soceity people have higher demand with regard to the product and the service . when a buyer buy a new product , one can be bored with this new product in two or three month . to provide new product , the market need people who can take risk to create new thing can be successful . for example , bill gates who is the owner of the microsoft company is the best example of this situation . when bill gates first developed the windows , he went to ibm to sell his product . however , ibm rejected his offer and he set up his own country . as a result , he ha become the owner of the highest valuable company , and his product are used in most part of the world . he is successful , because he took some risk and created new thing which is benefical to the soceity . the other important point is life satisfaction . people are born , because they want to survive and create new thing . every people have skill to create new thing . so , they use their skill . to sum up , the successful people always generate new idea and take risk for their trial . in most case they are successful and happy . routine task are boring thing and people who do routine task have not enough life satisfaction .
