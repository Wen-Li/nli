the issue at hand is whether it is better to have a broad academic education or to specialize in certain academic discipline or field . on the one hand , there are good reason for a variety of academic experience . if you receive a broader eduction , your academic background will help you to be able to work in different kind of job . for example , if somebody ha not only studied medicine but business administration a well , this person will have a lot of opportunity on the job market . he or she can work in a clinic a well a in a consulting firm . furthermore , different academic field provide different approach to solve problem or to describe the world . being able to see several view , somebody will gain a general view of eduction and science . for example , a student who is a candidate for a degree in economics but who also doe attend some extracurricular course in psychology , will be able to better understand why poeple in economic theory act the way they do . on the other hand , it is neccessary to develop a certain profession . that is why somebody should focus on one academic discipline in particular . today there is a very strong competition at the labor market . a student who doe not specialize in one or two subject probably will not be able to succeed in a highly competitive environment . for example recruiter of leading investment bank can not employ somebody who doe not have a detailed knowledge about certain topic . moreover , time you spend on trying to get broad academic skill , can not be used to spezialize in one particlur topic . this is a trade-off-problem . when i also attend extracurricular course , there is - in consequence - le time to deal with those course that are neccessary to receive a degree . this could also lead to the aspect that is mentioned above . finally , after considering all these pro and con , i feel that the very best is to focus on a certain academic discipline and to specialize . maybe one extracurricular course can be attended each term . this will provide a solid education and good opportunity , but will use the broad supply of a college or a university in an effective way a well .
