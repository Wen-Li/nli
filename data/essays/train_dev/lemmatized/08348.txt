i disagree with it , because it 's also a sort of lying to their customer . i understand that they are trying to sell their product alot , but they have to think about their customer to not be disappointed . i really enjoy watching tv , and there are lot of advertisement during the show break . watching those advertisement make me laugh , because i know that thing will never happen . few year ago , i saw an advertisement of a hair shampoo on tv , so i decided to try that because i thought my hair would be like the model on tv . i bought that shampoo , and tried . on the first day , i did not see any difference , so i though it take a while to be silky . i waited . nothing happened . that shampoo wa same a the other product . not one thing wa different or special except the nice smell . i 've been using it for few year now , but still , nothing seems to happen . they are really trying hard to grap people 's attention , but advertising to trick people is not good . some people will not care much , but some people can be serious . when they advertise , they have to think about their customer ' feeling , or make their product like it is on the advertisement .
