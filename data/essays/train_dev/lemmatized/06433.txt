from my point of view it is right , that people nowadays do not give enoguth time to helping their communites . i have the impression that the world we live in is a world of individual . everyone just seems to live next to each other but not actually together . in the past people , were forced to do certain thing together and help each other . nowadays the technolocial change ha made many thing easier and le harder . thus we have become lazier and concerning many thing we do not have to rely on each other any more . that 's the reason why we became more selfish and lazy . many people choose to spend their time in front of the tv instead of helping their community . as an example the amount of young men who do civil service decreased over all . most men neither go to the army , no do civil service : they just do not do anything . but without civil service our whole social system would not function any more . it is extremly important , that the young people take care of the old people and help them with their basic need . in the end it come down to a discussion of value . i am convinced , that there ha been a moral change . nowadays for many people it seems to be most important to look after their owns , to focus on their live , sucess and wealth . regarding this helping others in the community doe not seem to be relevant any more . everyone is responsible for his own life and luck . moreover it might be a problem that people do not indentify and related enoguth with their community any more . this lack of identification hamper them to play an active role in the community . due to immigration people with different cultural rood and with different kind of religion live together in one community but do not feel connected to each other . in addition the problemes we have to face a a community todaz have become more complex in the process of globalisation . they are no longer a limited a the might have been in previous day . but especially regarding this , i come to the conclusion that even more help in the community is need
