i agree with the statement that , in twenty year , there will be fewer car in use than there are today . there are several reason that i would like to present in support of my view . firstly , car pollute . air pollution is increasing by the day and at alarming rate . though there are strict law that are being imposed on the automobile industry to make car pollute le , these law ca n't prohibit people from buying car . more people will buy car and more pollution will occur and this , supported by reason i give after this one , will , in say decade 's time , reverse the situation and people will stop using car . at the present rate of air pollution , the day where the ecological balance is lost is not far ahead . though it 's being controlled by all government , it can not be eliminated . pollution will eventually lead to destruction of tree and plant , direct of indirect death of animal on land and in water and people will realize what they are doing to the world . secondly , oil price are rising very fast . how much ever the government promise it 's citizen not to raise tax , it will have to raise tax , because it 's not in the government 's hand to keep them down at the same level for ever . one day , gas will be so costly that people will stop driving car and start using other mode of public transportation like bus and train . thirdly , the rate at which oil is being drilled and extracted out of the earth , is extremely large compared to the rate at which it is being produced . and the world ha limited oil resource that can be made use of . it 's possible that people might still use car but use electricity instead of gas . but where will electricily come from ? a large chunk of total electricity is produced from oil and natural gas product , and they are still a major source of electricuty compared to solar energy or nuclear energy . lastly , road space is a big issue in most city now . people buy car without realizing they do n't have anywhere to drive them . huge increase in traffic congestion will only make people give up car and take the train instead , because they know the train ca n't get stuck in a traffic jam . the car ha long been a status symbol . there will be a stage when ifinally , i opine that there will be fewer car in use in twenty year than there are today .
