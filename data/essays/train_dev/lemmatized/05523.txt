in my opinion , i do not agree with the assertion becasue there are more opportunity nowadays for young people to help their community . with the advent of internet or other medium , people have become easiler to get information that their community need them to help . for example , in my apartment , the memebers of commitee announces the advertisement on our community website when they need people to help set up certain event . and they often receive a lot of response that say they would like to help . comparing to the past , there are few people informed that they are needed to help something . thus , i contrarily think more and more yound peole involve in community activies becasue they are more familier with the internet than the people before , and understand they are in demand . in addition , in my shcool , university always encourage student to do something that can benefit our community or society . for example , they are encouraged to clean the street and help teach older people who are illiterate to read . university do not pay the student that do service for community . nevertheless , many student often come to sign up for doing this kind of service . perhaps they will receive award , such a a certificate or a mendal instead of money . but after all , they do involve in and understandour society and community . when you broaden the scale to our society , you can also see that there are more and more institution which encourage young peple to help disable people . for example , in my country , we have `` sun shine '' gas station , which only hire disable people and young peole who are willing to help those disability . inconclusion , i think that we have more chance for young people to hlep our community becasue there are more way they can choose to serve their own community . this can be seen whether at shcool or our society or even in an apartment comunity .
