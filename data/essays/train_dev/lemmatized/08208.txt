i am not in complete congruence with the statement , i believe that in some case it is more important to understand concept and idea rather than to learn fact . because the feild of education is a vastly diverse and thus u need to bend yourself a per the reqiurements of the subject i opine that in science we need to understand the concept grasp the idea and also apply them a per the situation , science require you to not only memorise the fact buts also want you to apply the logical conclusion of the fact or concept learnt , so a to arrive at a best solution to a problem . for instance in subject such a mathematics you need to apply the concept that you have learnt and bring out a solution for the problem , not only doe math requires this buts also , various science related to math such a computer science which require you to frame programes depending on the the customer problem . if the scientist in olden dyas were only memorizing the fact but not understanding them then the people living in this modern era would be deprived of the knowledge of gravity , electricity and many more essential concept . thus we need to uderstand the idea and apply them a per the situatuion memorizing fact on the other hand is useful when we study art and subject like history , geology and also the other science such a biology and zoology , for evidence in olden day people use to caliculate which part of the day is it by looking at the sun 's position , thus to caliculate this we need the knowlegede fo from which side thus the sun rise , since sun rise in the east , people remember this fact and make conclusion about the part of the day . thus memoization fo fact help you while innovating a new concept that we nwwd to remember the characterist feature of the thing or object in order to derive a conclusion i would also like to bring otu a point that there is alwasys a case of forgetting thing while your are memorizing fact , but there is no case of forgettin concept or idea once you memorize them . thus a biased coin ha two side so doe a the apprach to leaarn thing and concept , in the climax i wolud like to say that learning fact and understnding comncepts heve here own imporatance in there respective field .
