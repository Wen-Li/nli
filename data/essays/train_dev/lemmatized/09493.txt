i think advertisement are soul of commerce . no one can sell his product without advertisement . i agree with the statement because i have found a lot of product that seemed much better than they really wa . i think the reason that could take a seller to use that kind of advertisement is that people are really impressonable . if they see an advertisement that promise them a lot , they certainly think that the product that advertisement represent is better than another one which promise them le . nowadays i can say that a very large number of seller use this kind of advertisement . the first example i can talk about is diet product . in the television we can see a lot of advertisement saying that using that product we could lose a lot of kylos in few week or day . we immediately can understand that this it is an advertisement that make the product seems better than it really is . we all know that there is n't any product that permit you to lose ten or twenty kilo in two week , and if it exists , it will be really dangerous . i can talk about this product also because my mother tried a lot of this product , and no one of them ha given the result she wanted . another example i can use is bank or financial group which lend you money . in their advertisement it seems like that you can use their money and to gave it back is really easy . but there are a lot of clause , generally writed small and in the end of the contract , that explain what you have to do to give their money back . generally here you can read about really high tax of interest and other problem you will have to confront later , and that give you more trouble . the last example is shampoo . in the tv advertisement seller promise you that their product will make your hair bright , strength , difficult to break and many other promise that generally are n't true . i tried a lot of shampoo which have no one of the characteristic i have said before . in conclusion i can say that advertisement generally make product seem much better than they really are .
