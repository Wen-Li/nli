`` young peple nowafays do not give enough time to helping their communitites '' i believe this is untrue . but i also believe that the ratio of people who do not help their community of young people and adult are the same . and these are a many adult who do not help to a many young people who do n't . many adult say that young people these day do n't help their community enough . to certain extent believe this is true and there are may young people who do not do these thing , but i also believe that adult do not give enough time to helping their community too . i do not think this is true everywhere , but i have seen a lot of adult in my area who do not participate at all to help their community . and i do not believe this is wrong because eveyone want their own spare time and do thing that they like instead of sacrificing their time helping out the community . so if adult do not want to sacrifice their time doing the work and do thing they like , why should young people get some time to do thing they like to do ? so i really believe that adult and young people should not tell each other how they are not doing what they are suppose to do instead we should give eachother some space of our own . another reason that make this statement true is because adult are not showing u the right model . as i mentioned , i have seen a lot of adult who do not participate at all in helping the community , so the argument is if adult are not doing anything how can they order u to what they are not doing ? therefore i believe in order for young people to participate those activity , adult must first show the model to the young people , and eventually the young people will start to follow these adult a their model . overall i believe that helping out the community and making them a better place is something good , and people do prefer these advantage , but what the adult should do first is not complaining about how young people are not doing what they are suppose to do but instead show the young people the right model so those young people will follow these modles togather making the community nice place to live in .
