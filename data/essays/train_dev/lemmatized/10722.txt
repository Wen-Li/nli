in my opinion the usage of car will stay at a steady level , rather increase . changes in propellant , road condition , and a growing population can disagree in single point of view , but mostly suggest an increase in the number of car . scientists , government , and car manufacturer are in the process of developing and improving engine using alternative propellant . these propellant include gas , hydrogen , or electricity , but are not limited to those . this development can cause a smaller dependency on oil . if this is true twenty year from now , people might have switched to those alternative propellant and do not see the necessity to get rid of a car in general . arguments saying that the number of car will decrease include fact like congested road because of a growing population or a decreasing quality of road condition . in addition some people claim and favor the usage of public transportation . i assume the behavior of people will not be changed in a recognizable amount . in a large city a i am living in both previously mentioned fact are true . cars are though used in an increasing number . for many people the car still ha more advantage than public transportation . as price for public transportation also increase attitude about this issue are unlikely to change twenty year from now . as mentioned before , population is increasing . personally i am familiar with the orlando , fl area . throughout the past five year an incredible extension of the metropolitan area could be observed . i suppose that an increasing population cause area to grow - making distance longer . this again can probably not be compensated by public transportation . people will continue to use car . as far a i have experienced people mostly favor individual transportation in their car rather than in crouded bus and train . i doubt a chance in the future . responses of urban and rural area might also differ in response to this issue and must not be neglected . generally i conclude a tendency to an increasing number of car based on personal experience .
