i do not agree with the opinion that the best way to travel is in a group accompanied by a tour guide . the reason for my point of view are a follows . firstly , travelling alone give a person greater flexibility to plan his/her trip . he is not bound by the physical or other constraits that could be forced on him by his group member . for example , if he were travelling in a group and many of his groupmates were old he would n't be able to plan a day of trekking or climbing . another example is time constraint . while travelling in a group , one ha to wake up when others do and be ready to do what all the others are doing . if one person doe not feel like seeing a place , say like a fort that day , he or she would still have to do it because it is in the group plan . secondly , a single traveller can get a better feel of the local culture by experiencing it on his own while interacting with the local . if however he is travelling on a structured tour , he can only learn about the place by listening to the tour guide and by visitng the well known often touristy place that the guide take him to . also , he would be left with little time to interact with local population if he is part of a group and is socializing with the group member most of the time . i do understand that travelling alone can sometimes be boring and some people are le confident doing thing on their own . but , i would like to point out that travelling alone is really lot of fun if the person travelling take time to talk to local and probably do thing the local way for a change and experience the flavor of the place . thus according to me it is the more adventurous way of travelling . if one is lucky one can sometimes get to experience unique thing by exploring alone than by going with the group doing the routine thing . i hence encourage everyone to try travelling alone once in a while . it could be a very enjoyable experience indeed .
