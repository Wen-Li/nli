i am agree with the statement that sucessful people try new thing and take a risk rather than only doing what they already know how to do well because if you do not do mistake you will never learn . people should try and learn new thing even if they do not like to do it . some people do not like to do something strange at least in their eye because they do not have any experience about it . otherwise , how they could write and read if they do not try . everything will become hard and impossible if you do not try several time to get it correctly . my experience with that when i wa in high school , i wa so outsider and i do not want to lear a new thing especially learing kind of sport a an example . when i decide to play tinnes , i failed several time in that time and then i gave up . after i graduated from high school i became a nimble when i play this sport before it wa my boring sport . then , i tought people in the club how to play this sport . learning a new thing let people avoid their previous mistake that they had already did in the past . when people attempt to do a new thing , it will be hard and boring at the first time but it is not impossible . albeit , human discovered lot of thing like space , ice age , and they also make lot of industrial thing like car , machine , and ... etc and became popular because of that , so , why not you . keep something in the mind that lot of experements that the scientiests did , they already had mistake with it but they tried it again and again . eventully , they got accuret because they did not gave up or they said it is difficult . people should pay attention to what is going on around them in this world . lots of famous people did mistake but they are successful . they are successful because they made a mistake and they also learned from the mistake . when i wa in high school , i did not get a good grade . so , i wa so sad because i could not be successful man in my school . then , i decided to learned from my mistake and correct them in the next semester of school .
