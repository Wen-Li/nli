i agree with the statement , because only people who risk and do n't keep doing always the same thing have some possibility to improve their own economic or social condition . the risk is necessary , since this way you can find out a different activity you have more possibility to succeed in . for example , most of rich people have followed this lifestyle : they are probably curious and they love to prove and risk . in some case , they start new activity or invest some money hoping to be lucky in their choises . if you want to succeed , even if fortune is a fundamental element , you need courage and bravery . you must not remain thinking of what to do too much time , because this way you will not take ever any decision . nevertheless , this type of behaviour is very useful in common life too . you should be sure of your opinion when you take a decision and then you should not change it , because it 's important to have certain value and idea . you have to accept the risk , considering the advantage and the positive aspect of your choise , and forgetting the negative one after you have chosen . it is useless and dangerous to keep thinking at your previous decision . for instance , when you get married you are trying a new experience and you are risking because you do n't know which problem there will be in your life after this fundamental decision , but you decide to get married because you correcty think that is a risk you can take to life a better life with a person you love . you consider love , feeling and positive experience more important than problem which accompany every marriage . i think that taking risk is the only manner to heve a possibility of success , because behind a risk , there is always a good prospective and a wonderful occasion .
