these statement made me think a bit more time because i disagree and agree with it at the same time . i try to explain my opinion about these topic . on the one hand , i agree with these statement for commercial product . because advertisement are mostly very common way to recognize some of the commercial product to community . when you see any product in any advertisement , you always meet good characteristic of the product . any advertisement do not mention about any negative characteristic of the product . if you try to sell some product you must say the good characteristic of the product . if you explain the some of the wrong or disorder characteristic of the product you can not sell it easly . for example when you watch tv you never met any advertisement mention about some side effect of some medicine , some food , etc . any hamburger restaurant do not any adverticement about how dangerous is feeding with fast food but we know when we eat much more hamburger we take weigth . if we apply morgage to buy a home we can met some bad situation when we do not pay montly bill . but any of them do not explain these un nice result of the commercial product . however on the other hand i disagree with the statement . because some of the advertisement are for the human service . for example : child care center , nursing home or any hospital , etc . these kind of advertisement try to explain the program ' facility , how peole get the service , etc . most of the these kind of advertisement give rigth information to take the attention of consumer who need the service . at the end i can say that advertisement is very effective way to recognize the some commercial product and service . but important one take account human well being .
