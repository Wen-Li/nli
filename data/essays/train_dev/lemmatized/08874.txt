it is not easy saying whether an advertisement make a product seem better than it actually is or not , since at first sight , few of u could really be able to find any possible difference between what is proposed to u on television and what it is . anyway i will try to answer the question and to give you some example in order to have it clearer . in my point of view , it could be possible that most of advertisement try to mislead the final consumer . this is due mainly to a few reason , such a the strong impact of television on the audience and the increasing commercial interest which play a key role in nowadays society . the former motivation , could be easily demonstrated taking into consideration ad regarding toy or anything aimed to child and younger group , which are the most vulnerable attendance . it might be enough launching some new product through advertisement during the cartoon time in order to convince child to buy it , being aware that a child is not able to know whether that ad faithfully reproduce the desired toy . the other reason , could be referred to a wide range of other item , which can be related to house keeping , car , insurance and so on . as a matter of fact the commercial aim hiden in about most of activity , push producer to use a many mean a possible in order to reach a huge number of customer . this can be achieved by company using a strategy such a showing a product in a way which could be believable but not totally true , taking advantage of weakness both of the weakness of people and of the strong of television . in conclusion , even if there is no certainty about this topic and even if i tried to set it out just from a television angle , without taking into consideration newspaper , i say that i agree with the statement that most advertisement make product seem much better than reality .
