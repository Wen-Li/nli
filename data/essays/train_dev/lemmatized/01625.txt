it can not be denied that travel may bring lot of fun and pleasure to the people who travel . however , concerning which is a better way to travel , by self or in a group led by a tour guide or some way else , it is still not reached a same point . personally , i quite agree that travel in a group is the best way . in the following , i 'd like to provide my specific reason to support the attitute . obviously , i think travelling in group can reduce the trouble during the turism . generally , the place we are going to travle may be a brand new location which we have never been to and know le before the travel , therefore , lot of practical problem such a accomadation , transportation and so on will be encounted , led by a tuor guide who may help u to reduce the time wasted on those poblems . moreover , if the travel is in a group led by a tour guide , more information concerning the place visiting may be provided . as we can imagine that the responsblity of a tour guide is to provide the background knowledege of the place visiting . with such a person , a lot of information of the place such a the history and culture which should be recorded and abstracted respectively may missing during the visit . that doe not sound to be a lot of fun . the third and also the last , large amount of travel fee may also be save . generally speaking , a tour guide . are those who have been to the visiting place more time than u , which enable he or she provide a well-organinzed scheldule . therefore , a lot of money which is not necessarily spent may be saved . to sum up , in my mind , i consider travelling in a group a the best way and best choice for me , which is more joyful and gainful .
