i think it is more important for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact because the idea and concept will provide them with the essential thing that will help them to understand and to develop thier knowledge . for example : if we wanted to learn a new language , we can not dive directly into the core without learning the basic such a letter and number . another example is to be a computer programmer you have to learn the concept of programming , basic of deffirent language and etc . if we do not first understand idea and try to learn fact , the result wo n't be good . we will feel confusion and we wo n't see matter clear . like building , if basis are week it will be degenerated . ideas are very important to imagine how the final result will be . therfore , we can go in the right way and achieve good result depending on the our idea and concept . most of people do not pay attention to this point , but i think that anyone want to do something especially big project they have to go in this way . look to the development now , ask yourself from where it came . people especially scientist and other peoplr put thier idea predicting the innvations abd the situation in the future , then it happens a they thought . i noticed that people who work in the imagination movie innovate more new thing day by day , especially in astronat field . they started by producing movie that show some strange creature attack the earth planet and try to capture it . then people fight them in order to get freedom . these series of movie encourage people to seek and to innovate depending on concept and idea mentioned .
