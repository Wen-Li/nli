whether it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subject than to specialize in one specific subject is an interesting question . some people think it is better to specialize in one , others think is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subject . i think both are important , because it is important to have a complete but also specific preparation today . personally , i believe that the best thing it is to have a general preparation , infact i think it is important to have a broad knowledge , who can allow you to know a lot of thing and to be preparate about all argument than you are specialized only in one . for example , when you are still student , you are not able to choose your specific interest , becouse you do not know all about the subject . at school you can attend many course , you have the opportunity to discover a lot of subject and you are able to make your right choice . however , i think , after have a broad knowledge , it is an intelligent thing to specialize yourself in one argumentat . the subject can be the one you love more or the subject that you need for your work . i think , for example , at the university you can specialize yourself in one specific subject , and you can begin more practise in this and you can increase your knowledge . in conclusion , i believe , it is important to have a complete preparation , becouse olny this allow you to have a good work but it is important for your personally preparation .
