i totally agree with this statment , when a person get a broad knowledge he can join all depates and can open conversation with all type of people , i would like to get a broad knowldge cause it will also make me look smart and well educated person and thats one of my goal in life . to be specialized in one specific subject is also a good thing it will make you a proffional in a specific subject , but when you it come to socity they will choose a person with a broad knowldge than a person with a spacified knowledge , because they think that the one with more knowledge is more educated and when you talk to him he can understand whats the stituation or whats the question , talking to a person with broad knowldege give you more chance and more apportunities to have more subject to talk to that person with , but when you are specialliezed with only one subject it make you stricted allthough you might be a profficional in that subject . a person can be educated and can be called intellgenet when he is familiar with all subject , for example a lawyer will understand his custmers sitiouation more when he go in detail with the person personality by using phsicology a trying to analyzie the person problem and situation . a person with more knowldge is the person who used his life and his time by using every secound trying to learn more knowldge . i a a person would like to talk to a person with a broad knowldge than talking to a person with a specific knowldge because i can gain more information from the person that have a broad knowledge . however , i also like to be a person with a broad knowldge so i can be able to talk with all people and not to freak out not knowing what to do when a person come to talk to me asking me about a subject rather than telling him i have no idea , i would love to anser his question with a good answer . in conclution , from my point of view i totally agree to this statement because it make sence to me also a the reason that i mentioned above make me belive more in this statmenet . use your time wisely to be a better person .
