i have once read a book talking about different stressful situation people would encounter in their life and some solution to these tough problem . one of the unfavorable issue highlighted in the book is how to deal with a heavy traffic jam . undoubtedly , those traffic problem , no matter in which part of the world , ha been remaining a a big headache for an extremely long period of time . it seems the government have tried every possible way to figure it out . thus , here is our concern : are these policy and strategy being put into effect ? in other word , are we going to see fewer car on the road in , say , twenty year ? from my point of view , i assume the dream would become true one day in future , though , i 'm not good at forecasting thing ahead . firstly , it is now strongly advocated by policy maker to take public transportation system rather than driving private car when traveling outside . as a matter of fact , this plan is working well steadily . people gradually have noticed that it is more convenient to take bus or subway to go to work and school than to drive private car . take the subway a a striking example , if you take it to go to work during the rush hour in the morning , you wo n't be faced with traffic problem at all . you do n't have to wait in an endless line and see no hope of moving your car , in this sense , you can totally guarantee your arriving time at office and have nothing to worry about in term of being late . i believe there is nobody who would like to be blamed by his bos every day merely for not being on time . consequently , i found no reason for people to ignore the positive alternative and still stick to his traditional and impractical way . in this case , there will be fewer and fewer people who purchase car , or at least drive their car during rush hour on weekday . furthermore , the price of gasoline is increasing rapidly in recent time , which cause more and more people to complain that they barely could afford the cost . thus , in light of being more economical , the majority of people would not incline to buy more car .
