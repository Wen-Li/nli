i agree with the statement `` most advertisement make product seem much better than they really are '' . i think today the company are spending a lot of resouces in order to have their product better showing , i think there is only one reason to spend so much money to achieve a goal that should be not important for the customer . in fact , i think that , if the people would think without any advertisment , they would choose the product that ha the best quality , and so the company that are not producing good quality product have only one solution , and the solution is to make the people think their product are better than they really are . i am very interesting in this issue ; and so , in the last few year , i studied a lot of marketing tecniques in order to know what are the company doing in this field ; however , i am also interested in being a good customer , so i want to try to avoid being a customer of a company that ha a bad policy regarding the marketing communication . i know that this is today quite difficult to achieve , but i feel that i really have to try it . another reason , i want to argue to support my idea , is linked with the quality of food we are eating today . in fact ; today the people have and average of disease much higher that it wa several year ago . i think it is due to the quality of food we are eating , i am affraid that , despite this fact , the people are still spending no more interest in order to know what are they eating . i thing also the governement should take some decision in order to clarify the situation . the last reason , i would like to point out , is linked with the agricoltural economic field . i know that today this field is not so important a it wa some year ago , but many people are still working in this economic field . i hope the huge company will not conquest the while market . i know that the progress can not be avoided , but i am still affraid of the future . i hope we could give to our son a world better that the one we have .
