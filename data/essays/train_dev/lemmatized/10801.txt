in japan , it ha became a big issue that young people do not participte in their community . considering this situation of japan , i agree with that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their community . the main reason is that young people have to study instead of helping their community . in japan , many parent expect their child to enter good high school , good university and good company . they believe that entering the good company assure their child 's happiness . in most case , these believe do not came true . however parent force thier child to study at preparatry school in addition to their high school . for example , ten year ago , i worked a a tuter . at that time , aya , who i taught math , wa very busy girl . she studied five day a week at preparatory school , and she practiced playing a piano and swimming . when i heard her schedule , i worried about her health . in this case , her parent forced her to study hard instead of having spare time to do anything not to related to entering a good school . as i explained above , in japan , young people wa not expected to spend their time to helping their community . therefore , i strongly agree with the statement that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their community .
