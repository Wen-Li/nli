well i strongly agree with the discussion that twenty year from now there will be fewer car in use then there are today , the very obvious reason to support my opinon on this subject is scarcity of fuel , which ha already been recognized a the impending crisis human kind is going to face in this century , now car need fuel to run , which unfortunately is a non renewable form of energy , however over the year scientist have come up various alternative which are supposedly more efficient and non polluting than the conventionol car which us petroleum a it fuel , however the fact remains that petroleum is still the mostly easily available fuel for running a car , atleast a of now . . and for any person who is used to driving his petroleum driven car wouldnt readily accept the change . another reason for me agreeing with this argument is that in the way human population is increasing , most of the major city around the worls are overtly crowded and so are the road of these city and time being such a important commodity in today life , very few people rely upon there car to reach there destination of work , college etc . . another trend which is catching up these day is car pooling where in a couple or more people who have a common destination point use the same car to travel which save them on fuel and also in a way contributes in reducing the traffic on the road , most of the major city around the world have also spent a lot of money on setting up a rail line between two major junction in the same city or the adjacent city , many people have started to use this option a this save them on time and it also very cost effective measure although by opting for this medium of transport they have to in a way sacrifice the luxury of starting from there home a and when they want too . . but in life you loose some you win some a in here you sacrifice your luxury to have a peacefull an safe ride to your destination in a cost effective way . .
