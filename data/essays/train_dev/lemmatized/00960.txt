young people enjoy life more than older people do ? i do not agree the statement that young people enjoy life more than older people do , and i state my opinion a follows . why age ? all people should know how to enjoy life regardless of their age . there may be different interest in enjoying life by age group , but age doe not limit how well people enjoy their life , therefore it is ridicurous to say that some age group is not good at enjoying life . generally speaking , young people are considered to be , active , healthy , outgoing , curious to new thing , with full energy , and go out to seek enjoyment . but is it true ? old people have more knowledge and experience in life . they are veteran who have survived many hardship in life , and they should also have experienced many joyful and fullfilling moment in life . it is natural to expect that they know how to cope with hardship in life and make much of joyful and fulfilling event to enrich their life . on good example is this . once i wa in a developing country todo volunteer work . in the country , there were many young volunteer and also older volunteer . to my surprise ! older people there were so active and enjoyed their life in the country . they went to off shore fishing on a boat and enjoyed cooking fish they took . they went to camping swimming , snorkelling , and even diving , and did everything they could do ! on the other hand , those who got sick were always young volunteer . they had trouble with food , climate , language , culture , people , and everything . they just did not have enough experience to cope with the different environment from their modern , confy and convenient life . fron this experience , i learned the lesson that at any age , people can try to enjoy life .
