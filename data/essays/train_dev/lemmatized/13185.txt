i 'm convinced that having a broad knowledge of many academic subject is better than to specializing in just one specific subject . there are several reason why i agree with this previous statement . first of all , having a broad knowledge of many academic subject allow u having a personal culture . the school give to the student the capacity of studing a substantial number of subject , so it 's important having a knowledge of them for ourself , a a culture for being well prepared in general . because i think that knowing differents subject open more our mind than just focus in one specific subject . in fact knowing just a specific subject is like a limitation . second , the knolwedge of many academic subject give the chance to have more chance in our life . indeed , knowing a vast amount of information show your potential with other people . you are prepared and have what it take to be considered a an efficient person . occasions in life can occur , because you are prepared in many subject so in a future you could do several work . to sum up , i think that many reason exist why knowing many object is better than just one
