in my opinion i disagree with the topic about most advertisement make product seem much better than really they are . in this new global world and era the company try to reach so many people around world by the use of technology . but it can be sometimes harmful for the consumer who do not pay attention . firsty of all there are too many way to attract consumer about the product . we can use internet , tv , radio , by giving advertisement . all of them are effective . by using a famous footballer or model you can increase the popularity of the product . on the other hand , the company use camera and light illusion to show the product more attractive . also this method can be used for showing the big one a a little and the slow one a a huge one . an addition to this mechanism the advertisment given on tv or internet are repeated so many time in order to persuade and convice the consumer . this made pressure on the consumer to try the product . the last factor for me to attract the consumer about the product is it price . as we know if a product is cheap we always think that it is the best suitable one for u . it i a quite wrong stetement in fact . thus the company know this situation and use it a a most well known weapon . in spite of the stated fact below , there are also some advertisement reclects the obvious and fair appearance and usage of a product . in such kind of situation we can try to company mark on it . for example some mark like bmw , general electric , lcw are most well known producer so we can trust their product also advirtisements . consequently , in our global and technologic world all company try to take a role in world trade and make much more money . furthermore we can say thet world management is related with some big company . so the smaller one try to be in this huge budget . and also they can do everything to get this even they force the country to begin a war . attractive product to convince people are an easy piece of cake for them .
