twenty year from now the population of car would be much lesser than today . due to many reason like most of the fuel used a today would extinguish , and if resource available they might be used for other purpose etc . well , when we compare the past and future we can expect both to be similar . in past , there were fewer car and even in future we could find few car , due to many reason . in past when car wa discoverd the making used to take much time and in future when making is easy and faster the presence of fuel is le . a in present day we find different kind of car , each having it own uniqueness but all of them run with petrol or gas . but twenty year from now these resource might be in scarce , or else used till the last drop . a in present we find the population of car comming in competetion with human being we might expect that it in future it would cross u . but once the the resource are gone all these car go in to scrap useful for nothing instead increase the pollution and causing problem to mankind . future is full of unexpected thing any thing might happen , for example instead of fuel car there might be electric car , [ no pollution car ] . these might complletly replace them or else people might use cycle a in past for transport and become more evironment consious . scientist are trying to develop a new kind of fuel which is made from plant known a bio-deisel , which also can be used in future a fuel . but car they will make there way some how or the other . and so called car in present day might be called with a different name . so i say that twenty year from now we will find car running with electricity or other mean of fuel , but in minimal population camparitive to now .
