i agree the statement of `` young peple nowadays do not give enough time to helping their community . '' i would like to explain the reason of my thought in the following passage . in my home town , there is an event for cleaning up the river in the town every year . parents usually join to such annual event . and they always complain u that more and more young people should join to the event , because they are also responsible for such task by using their river . the young people are more powerful than the elder people , so their join would be helpful . but the young people , including me , are not willing to join such event . one of the reaseon why they are not in such event is that there are no disadvantage or punishment for not to join to such event . if there are some disadvanteges in such attitude , it is most likely for young people to join such event . this is because they do not think that giving their time to helping their community are their duty or obligation . young people are le depend on their community , because social system for helping all the people in our country ha been introduced so they are not required their community 's help . so they do not want to wast their time for the community . the young people today is busier than those of the past . the business world today is very rapid and young people today in such world are required to spend almost their all time for doing their own business . so it is very likely to that young people today do not have enough time to share time to helping their community . from the factor and reason above , young people today do not give enough time to helping their community .
