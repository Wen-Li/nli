acutly i disagree that becouse if tha student get jast tha idia thay cant emropve any thing . but if thay stady and thay can see ther object in the fact thay cant foget that and they will thinking about it . if thay can understand and get the idia they cant thinking about it . but if they understandet and thay stell thinging about thir object they ill aske thir self alot of questiones . and they 'll explorer alot of saines like tha tacnaloge right now . about if thay can get the idiaes withe out do practes for that that 's ok but thay cant emprove thir skilles and they cant do any thing in thire live . and tha gad made u an he gave each one a mained . and tha maind can forget every thing ecept some thing like if it learned somr thing in the facte and saw it never can forget it . i know some saines you ca n't see it but you can imagen it and you 'll see it in the fact like in mathematiches , visecal or fasical so i like change the education from the first year in the elmantry scohle if thay can do that we 'll get alot of smart chaildren and thay can make agood live withe agood educathion . i saw in tha news peaper in my home thay wanit to change the educathion and relly it wa bad idia . thay say thay want to change tha educaction thay 'll give every one a lapetob in the elmantry schoole . my opinian in that all of them 'll be stubed becouse thay do n't have any idia about the computar so how can thay learn .
