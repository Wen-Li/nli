in a student life period and educational process student learn many idea and fact . sometimes idea and fact combine and can be learned together , sometimes we can learn them seperately . both of them are very important part of education but , i disagree with the statement and in my opinion learning fact is more important than to understand idea and concept . first of all , fact are more memorable thing than idea and concept . facts can contain historical victory , new improvement and also something important that worht to remember . students can easily remember the fact that they are interested in and do n't forget easily in their lifetime . for example , world war ii is an important fact in world history and it is easy to learn this fact rather than the ideology that caused the war . secondly , fact are more realistic thing rather than ideology . you have proof and historical document about the connected fact , but idea contain utopic and individual belief and value . it is a little bit harder to understand these utopic value if we make a comparison with the learning fact a a learning process . furthermore , learning fact is more impressive about taking interest in the issue . ideas and concept make them curious only who are interested in the issue such a aristotle ' s philosophy . but fact are more general thing and can take more interest rather than idea and concept . to sum up , i believe learnin fact are more important than understanding idea and concept
