this is a very good question , in fact i could speak about it for page and page , but here i have to sum all in only a few word . in my opinion advertisement are very important in our society . all is support by advertisement ! and everywhere i go i see advertisement for example on tv , in the street , at the university , on newspaper , on the train : everywhere ! and this wa an important discover ! because , before the 19 century , there wa n't it ! in my opinion now advertisement make really product seem much better than they really are , because the men that have to advertise the product want only sell it , and they do n't worry if the advertisement doe n't correspond to the true . i think that this is a big problem , and the people do n't worry about it , but they might ! the person who sell a product must be honest ! because the man who buy the article must have the thing that is advertised on tv and that he ha thought to buy . for example there is an advertisement on tv that speaks about a course of english in milano . the course , is advertised that is in the centre of milano , but it doe n't ! and another problem is that is advertised that the first lesson is free , but it doe n't ! in my opinion the person that advertise wrong thing are very impolite and stupid . the advertisement in general must tell the truth ! another example could be the advertisement of a cake ! in tv the ordinary people like me and my family , see that cake that is very simple to do , and all of the ingredient are include , but in reality it is not very simple and there are n't some of the ingredient ! this is a very orrible thing and i 'm very infuried with the person that advertise these thing .
