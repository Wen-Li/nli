some people agree that young people enjoy life more than older people do . however , others disagree . in my opinion , i think the former statemment is true . this is because young people are energetic , brave , and chanllengable . young people always have energy to do many thing . for example , they will use their free time to hang out with their friend . they will go to some place to enjoy themsleves a club , bar , and movie center . furthermore , young people are more attracted by the colourful world rather than stay at home . they are afraid of grounding because it is indispensible for them to have fun . in addition to being engergetic , people who are young have bold to enjoy their life . for instance , they try to do thing which older people afraid to do . like ferry wheel . one can conceive a 80-year-old man sitting on the ferry wheel will almost kill him , but not a young person . they are always being curious about new thing . moreover , they will not bother how much money have they left . instead , they will have a great time to spend the money to find their dream beautiful life . finally , young people can endure the chanllenges . a example is , they will chanllenge new stuff to know the right way to enjoy life even including doing drug . on the other hand , older people prefer a peaceful life . it is clear that i agree with the statement because young people have energetic spirit both pysically and mentally . therefore , they will not feel tired by having fun in their life . also , they are never afriad to pursuid their happiness in their life . lastly , they are the people who can be chanllenged to enjoy life . for the previous reason , i think young people enjoy life more than older people do .
