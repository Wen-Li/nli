i do agree with the statement `` most advertisement make product seem much better then they really are '' . we all have a great infuence on all these advertising item . there are many mean of advertising like the television , newspaper , ad on road and many more . so , every one get an opportinuity to see one or the other . one example or the reason why i agree with this statement is that , once i brought a cream which say it remove all the blemish and left over mark in just few day . the advertisement wa soo well that i wa just impressed by just seeing it one time . and it wa just not more then a moisturizer , which just did nothing which it had to do , but made my skin so oily . one more example is that once i brought a solution which say that remove all the dirt in the craks of the leg , and make them smooth , but it remove the dirt by not only removing only the dirt but also removing layes of skin . i wa just shoked and even scared of using new product from that time . these are not only the example but they are many more , just take the car insurance company , it say too much but never doe all that it say , by saying many rule and condition for all the instrutions it gave . we can have one mare example like the calling card it say , which say the voice would be very much clear with so many minute . . and many more . but what we get truely is thatonly the minute to talk which are are really not worth or useful with out a clear voice . we can take one more example like the alarm which we use for safety purpose by getting impressed by seeing the advertisement , it do work a it say , but is it taht useful a we heard from that advertisement , we need to just think of that . there are many more like the clothes , gold , food , restaurents , fast food center , and many more , whch are just differnt from what is said in the advertisement . these are few of the reason which make me agree with the above statement .
