in my opinion it is true that teenager and young adult do not provide enough time of their recreational time to contribute actively to their community . there are three point to look at why this development ha taken place in the last year . first of all , it is obvious that the young people are facing a overwhelming selection of acitivities and entertainment platform . whereas our parent had no other choice than helping their community because it wa traditionally and morally imposed by the society and also there wa nothing else to do rather than this , young people have a great range of possibilties how to spend their recreational time . they can choose between a wide range of physical , artisitc and cultural activity . most young people do not only limit themselves to only one activity , they even attend to several . hence they do not have any time left to provide to their community . secondly , the society ha been changing over the year and the development tends to lean towards individualism rather than communalism . it is of utmost importance to be outstanding and perform extraordinary in order to stick out of the mass . it is not important to look after each other or to help each other , it is more important to ensure one 's own life and well-being . you can find this phenomenal of indiviualism throughout different social class . since the young people grow up in this kind of enviroment where it is essential to perform indiviually , they do not experience the benefit of being part of a community which can back you up in any circumstance . for them , helping their community seems like a burden . therefore , they are not willing anymore to contribute anything to the community . furthermore , there is another point which ha to be considered why teenager do not participate at their local community anymore . many community are outdated and do not know how to promote themselves in a appealing way . if the community would possibly agree on rejuvenate their image and improve their program
