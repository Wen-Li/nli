both understanding idea , concept and learning fact are have a different role in the student . but i used to support understanding idea and concept rather than to learn fact . as everything in the student academic class are useful to the student so they must have an idea about that concept . so student can easily learn that topic and he can use that learnt subject in his future . for example if the student ha a topic on prevention of communicable disease , how can he learn fact with out knowing about the concept so he should have some idea about that topic by seeing some practical condition and there by he learn fact . understanding idea are very important to the student a it give him a solving of any critical problem . if the student understand idea and concept of the problem , he may be aware of it . not only that his mind his sharpen , his thinking power increase , his reasioning increase ther by he can learn so many fact . if they have the capability to understand idea and concept , they arises themselves a question and they will try to solve , there by thier thinking ability increase . it is also very important if the student ha some idea about the topic , it is easier for the student to learn . some time idea about the topic give him a doubt and he will do a research on it also . if the student with idea will always be a intelligent and his mind is sharper . if the student ha anidea in one topic then he dont feel that is harder and he easily learn fact from that . even for the scientist also they first think about that topic and they come to one idea and they do reasearches and give u a fact . thus i conclude that idea about the concept is more to know the fact easier .
