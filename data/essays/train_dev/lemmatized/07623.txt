`` it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts '' wel . . there is a lot of difference in learning a fact and understnding idea and concept . . it like knowing what happens if u take a medicine when you are sick and actually taking one when you are really sick . . it just the same like you can take a horse to the pool but you can not make it drink water . . learning fact just ignites the enthusiasim in the student and it draw him or her more close to actually trying to master the fact by understanding the idea and the concept that lie in it . for instance if we can assume we are in a biology class the student are intially exposed to the fact about the concept that they are going to learn and this alone doesnt help them .. if they have to use this in their daily routine then the sole idea of knowing the fact doesnt alone help the person . . so he ha to learn it .. understand it , and master the concept . . the fact that a microorganism can be viewed under the microscope , the very fact is very exciting but if the student fails to actually use the microscope and watch the microorganism then wats fun in just knowing the fact . . but at the same time apart from study where one ha to practically understand the concept , most of the time it is beneficial in our daily rouitne to learn the fact , for example by reading a news paper you will be enlightened with many new fact that most of the time we must have never come across but down the line that bit of information might serve very handy by just learning the fact . . for example for people who smoke they learn the fact that smoking can cause cancer if smoken extensively so this fact will limit most of the smoking population to limit their daily intake of nicotine . but for student it is a must to understand idea and concept than barely being amused by knowing the fact . practical knowledge will always be stored in the longterm memory in comparison to just learning the facts . `` so , i finally conclude that it is always more important for student to understand the idea and the concept than it is just learning the fact , '' and so i agree to this thought .
