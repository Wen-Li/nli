live young some elderly , despite le active and energatic than youngers , enjoy life more than young people do . in these case , the older people need a right mind -- use their experience to view their life positive and optimism . since the older people are usually retired and stayed at home , they do not need to worry about the depression and difficultis from work . at this time , if they have an positive view upon the world , they can learn more about the world using their free time . for instance , an old people who had to give up his/her dream to travel around the world because they have to work all day long , can achieve his/her desire to experience the colorful and various aspect of the planet he/she life in . this person , inspite of his older age , like his/her life better than he/she lived before . as one 's age increased , one 's knowledge and experience also increased . if the elderly use their optimism view to contribute the world , they can enjoy a lot more than youngster do . when i wa young , my father wa only an unsignificant engeernearing assistant in a small company . but a he suffered more experience and learned more knowledge , he began to looking forward a self-improvement . he went to a graduate school and took a phd program around 40 year of age . although no one in my neiborhood thought he would finish the course , he equipped himself with his optimism and experience and overcame all the problem he faced . and now , he is enjoying his life a a physic professor . maybe one can say that youngster have more energy than the older one , but the older people have some particularly strength -- the knowledge and experience . if elderly use their own power to view the world right , they would feast their every minute and enjoy their life .
