i strongly believe that the broad knowledge of many academic subject is far more beneficial than the narrow view on specific subject . there are several important reason which undergird my position . the first one is that the world is being complicated and interdisciplinary . in other word , it is impossible to understand where the world is heading without the compound analysis on the various subject . the good example for this is bioengineeing . in these day , the field of study , bioengineering , is getting more popular . and it property can be defined a diversity and integrity of other various field of the study . it can be referred a a mountain , which is living and breathing . all field of engineering and science , such a mechanical engineering or biology , chemistry , get together building mountain , bioengineering . inside it , the each field interacts and synchronize with each other . without the ability which can have himself or herself understand other field of study , they can not participate in the interaction among field and the living mountain can not live anymore resulting in the collapse both personally and socially . the second one is that broad knowledge on many academic subject affect the individual life directly . for example , if someone know well about english with mechanical engineering major , he can teach others english a a part time job . also , the person who ha broad band of knowledge on academic subject can do thing then others who do n't . someone with qualified foreign language can make connection between his or her company with others abroad . the specialzed knowledge on one subject can make researcher deep well of study . however , the depth of the well can be further by broader entrance of it . the wider the entrance , the deeper the well go . to get their own major is , of course , important . however , we should remember that broader knowledge can make our research more profounder and valuable . it support strong base for your major . therfore , i prefer to arm with broad knowledge of many academic subfects than to specialize in one specific subject .
