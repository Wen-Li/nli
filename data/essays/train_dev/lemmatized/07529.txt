no community can exist if the young do not take an active part in it development . saying that young people do not give time to help their community would be wrong . the fact that the young generation enjoys the life and life it up ha created a wrong impression that they are not serious about their community . but if we look carefully then we 'll realise the role the youngster are playing in the development of their community . i remember when i wa in school , we were made to go to the slum area and help the child over there to learn to read and write . camps were organised by student to educate the local of a village on the importance of education . all these initiative were taken by the student who form the bloodline of any community . another example that i can recollect of the youngster 's role in a community is when i went for a vacation to a small town by the sea . the authority had allowed breaking of a ship that contained asbestos which is harmful to human . it wa the effort of the young people of the community that that ship wa made to return and a community wa saved . therefore , the youngster do care about their community and play an important role in defining how a community should be rather than just being a part of it and accepting it the way it wa given to them .
