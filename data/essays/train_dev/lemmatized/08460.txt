i do not agree that there will be fewer car in twenty year time in the future compare to the present . cars will not have a lower quantity because of the ever increasing world population and rapid developement of city . a bigger world comunity requires more car . cars are the most common mean of transport . the number of car used would increase proportionally with the ammount of people . this can easily be related to what i am experiencing . my neighbour who have five family member have four car comparing to my family who have only four member have only three car . an example of the increasing world population can be seen in country like india where the growth rate is still at high . they are also converting their traditional transportation mean like bicycle to car . in malaysia , the goverment are having a policy to encourage more child in the family . secondly , many country are trying to archive first world country status . this will cause urbanisation to be at large hence causing city to be bigger . bigger city will be difficult to access without a car . freeways are also build in these country hand in hand with the development of the city . this is because most government encourages the usage of car too . more and more car are also available in the market now . it can also be easily aquired in low price . my father told me that about 20 year ago he did not have a car and about 5 year later , he had to get one . he say that the city is getting to big and difficult to get around relying only on public transport . i feel that car ha become a very important part of our life and it would not be replace in mere 20 year time .
