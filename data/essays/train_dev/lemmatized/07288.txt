the statement of what is more important for student either to understand idea and concept than it is to learn fact is controversial . however , in my experience is more important to understund idea and concept than just simple fact . first , i belive that by focusing entirely in fact you are missing the opportunity to understund concept and idea surrounding fact . it is important for student to have a good understanding of the situation going beyond fact so this way they can extrapolate these learning to different situation . second , a a professional chemical engineer myself i have always never seen that a situation is the same twice in my career . it can be similar but not the same , the only way to tackle new situation is by being clear and understand the idea and concept of the situation . as a result of my background and training a an engineer it is almost strange to solve problem based only in the specific fact you have learned in your career . you need to again go back to the basic and focus on concept and idea to be succesful not just fact . also , by having a special focus on idea and concept you can help develop the creativity of student . it is important to encourage student to understand not just idea and concept but from there to develop their thought process and creativity . by focusing only in fact , it can be challenging to develop other area like creativity if the only thing student are facing are fact for particulat situation . moreover , by looking at the big picture you are also helping student to understand how in many situation fact can be different but the idea and concept are the same . last but not least , it is important to keep in perspective that we live in a constantly changing world and by making for student more important to understund idea and concept they will be better prepared to be succesful in the future which will bring to them newer and more challinging problem than what we have experienced in the past .
