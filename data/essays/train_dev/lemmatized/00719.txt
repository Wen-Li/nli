i storongly agree with the following idea that `` it is more important for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact . '' there are reason that i agree . first of all , what is the definition of learning ? in general , what do student come mind when they think about meaning of learining ? i think each student have different idea . some of them think learning is same a studying . also , others think that it is just reading text book , or attnding class , but what are they gaining from learning ? of cource some of them might answer that learning is given better understanding of the material . however , if student do n't concentrate during the reading or in the class , they might learn , but they do n't understand the idea and concept that they suppose to cover . therefore , understanding idea and concept is not always gained from learning . next , understanding idea and concept are remained stude n't memory longer than just learning . sometimes , even student learn the material at the moment . if they did n't understand , it is very easy to forget and hard time to understand again . because one of the reason people forget materias is that student did n't understand concept of the material even they learned before . they thought they understand idea and concept cleary but it wa misunderstand . therefore , a time go by , it might hard for them to remind the material and remember again . on the other hand , once you understand the concept and idea , it take longer to remember and sometimes they never forget . even they forget it , because they understand it before , it more easier to come up their mind . therefore , learning is not always helping student understand . some of the people even learn hard , but they do n't understand material . also , even student did n't learn , they understand concept and idea of material . understanding material is more important form them .
