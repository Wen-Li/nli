in every summer , a lot of people go paris and visit many museum , and some of them just give a short look at every paint and sculpture . it 's easier to travel in a group then travel by alone . it 's , however , in doubt if this is the best way . traveling in a group led by a tour guide is not the best way to travel . the rationale behind this is that this kind of travel will never satisfy personal interest and it donse n't have flexibility in schedule . the first reason why traveling by oneself is good is that a person can go and see what they want . unlike to touring in group , an individual can show specific interest on art or custom . to illustrate , a newspaper article show that a culture of an country ha a lot of thing that need about a year just to see what there is . thus , it 's ridiculous to going through not participating on certain part of an culture . secondly , taking a travel with nobody else allowes the flexibility in schedule . since it 's hard to know of a region without visiting the place , a person may feel like to change the time they spent on certain city or country rather than going other place . according to an survey done in the airport , visitor who have n't come to a country before changed there perception they had before in many way . in this sence , traveling alone give benefit to understand the country more deeply by giving change to a plan . to conclude , it is good to travel individually because seeing what they really want to see on a trip is important and allowes giving change in plan , even though there are good feature of group traveling like time saving and being with a person who can speak language foreign to a person . if you are planning to join in a group , think once again if i 'm giving up the opportunity to broaden my sight for a little convinience
