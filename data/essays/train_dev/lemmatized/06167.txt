i think that both life are so much different from each other . young people live in a completly different world . and the idea of `` enjoying life '' that old people have , most of the time is not even close to what young people consider `` enjoying life '' all depends on what is your own idea of living the life , for some poeple no matter young or old , the idea of `` enjoying the life '' can be partying all the time , on the other hand for other people it can be , raising a family . the difference between a young person and an old person are so big . those two different group have different style of living ; and even in those group there are many different sub-groups . these difference are based on what you believe or think . sometimes the defferences between a young guy and an old person might be few . let 's just say that the life of a young person go around his college , his friend , partying , and basicly doing what they do , they would n't be able to do no longer when they grow up . and in my opinion the old people 's life go around having peace , and most of the time around family . we all know there are young and old people who do not enjoy their life at all , they have a pretty much boring life . we all know that young people are always getting in trouble , they are always having issue and complaining about evertything . but now if we just stop a moment and think for a second , what move old people 's life in my opinion is young people 's life . just like cop , in most part of their job they have to deal with teenager . and who is always there to get u out of trouble ? yes , old people . as a conclution i can , say that both young and old poeple can enjoy their life . as a young guy , my idea of enjoying the life is : studying , partying , and basicly hanging out with friend . but also i know old people who share my idea of enjoying the life . i jus trutly believe that my time to enjoy the life in some way is now , after this will come a different style to enjoy my life .
