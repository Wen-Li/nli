some people aclaim that they prefer to travel alone , while others oppsite it . despite assorted opinion to the contrast , a for me , i would not hesitate to agree that travelling alone is the best the way to travel . there are some reason a follows . to begin with , travelling alone is free . we can go anywhere we want and have no need to listen the guide ' requirement . however , if we are in a group led by a tour guide , we have to comply with the guide ' . it entirely possible that there are some place we do not like to stay long but the guide still take u to go . then we will feel unhappy . there is no doubt that our purpose for travelling is releave stress and entertain our life . however , it make u feel more annoy . then why should we go with a guide ? besides , in nowadays some guide like to take the visitor to the place which are not really interesting place but shop to let u buy a myriad thing which are so-called `` memorary gift '' . it not only waste lot of money but also make u feel boring about the tour . to illustrate it , there is a persuasive example . last year , jane went to lushan in xian province with a lot of people , which is her first time to go there . she thought it would be an indelible experience . however , after she got there , the guide did not take them to climbe the mountaon instead of asking them to buy some photoes first . and them he also take them to a shop nearby and make them consume many thing for the reason that they can symbol that they had been to lushan . admittedly , travelling alone is dangerous to some degree . however , it is obvious that it instrmental rather than detrimental to u . therefore , with thoroughly considerating , i can draw that i would incline to travel by my own .
