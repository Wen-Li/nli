of couse , i am agree ! because if someone undertand the conceps must undertand the fact . if a person only learn fact it will be only a dadta base , it will not have a logic reasoning or brain storming . in a part it important to learn all the fact about a subject . meanwhile you can describe it but , not analze it . this is extremly important to student , espacially for a investigation or a speech . cause undertanding a theme is the base of education , and science and many diciplines more . to undertand something , a person learn first the fact , them put on test ande theorize and finaly go for a conclusion . this is learning exploring fact and deatails to make a comprenshion of a study object . for example the statement on my left view begings with a universal condition , than mean that is a deductive ideal . the part saying undertand realiy mean `` knowing everything '' and the fact mean `` knowing a few . '' `` it is more important to undertand idea and concept , than learn fact . the pasage cantains a view logic order , is almost undenailble to destroy it . not only that also express tan a student must visualize problem and solve them . in a conclusion the statement it 's a invitation to kow eveything , to explore athe world of knolege . every student hope to achieve that in all clases and thinking of than i believe than i going righ way .
