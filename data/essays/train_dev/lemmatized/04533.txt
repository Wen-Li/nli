nowadays , oil becomes even rarer and even more expensive and some people believe that in thwenty year there will be fewer car in use than there are today . we will explain why this statement could occur or not in the future . on the one side , petroleum is becoming more and more expensive to produce because there are limited area where we can find it and lot of them are unreachable or unavailable , for instance because they are under big city . moreover , government are developping tube , train or bus to encourage people not using their own car and to pollute le . for example , lot of advertisement for taking the train instead of driving are currently shown in the tube in paris . on the other side , the population of third-world country is growing , and at the same time , lot of people who were using the bike in china are considering bying a car . futhermore , lot of worker still need a car when they do not live in big city because bus are not a frequent . for this reason , it is still easier for them to rely on their own car rather than on a bus that can pick them just every hour . besides , scientist are considering developping car with hybrid motor , which rely both on electricity and oil . it could be a very good solution to the cost of the oil . for the moment , those car are puchased above all in japan but thay may be soon be sold in all the country of the world . to put it in a nutshell , the issue of the car is rather an issue of oil supply . till hybrid car are not very fame , the number of car could hence decrease . however , it would rather be the case in big city where people have other way to go to work . to my mind , twenty year is a very short time to introduce hybrid car but it is also a vey short time to make people change their behaviour by not using their can a often a today .
