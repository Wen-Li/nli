i completely agree with the statement from my personal experience and from my observation . the good thing about traveling in a group is that it 's easier for traveler . because the traveling plan is already well arranged by the tour guide , so the traveler do n't have to spend lot of time making the plan . the only thing that need is to follow the tour guide and have fun . also , since they do n't need to worry about the schedule , they can completely relax and enjoy the tour . moreover , to travel in a group is safer because the gang wo n't easily conduct crime to the person who are in a group . there is one more benifit for traveling in a group , that is , the price is often lower due to the special discount for group people . beside , the tour guide is more professional than u , therefore the traveler can get to know many history and bakcgrounds of the scene . fot example , from my observation , the honey moon would be the best if traveling in a group led by a tour guide . because the couple can really enjoy the trip without fighting with each other in where to go or which place to go first . as a result , the new marriage couple can maintain good relationship all along the honey moon . on the other hand , when traveling alone , traveler are taking the risk . first , since they might not be familiar with the place they 're going to , the plan they made would probably expose themself into the unknown danger . second , they need to worry about their schedule all the time . that would give them the pressure when traveling and make them become nervous . third , a compare to the group , the price of traveling alone is often higher . in sum , i agree that traveling in a group led by a tour guide is the best way to travel .
