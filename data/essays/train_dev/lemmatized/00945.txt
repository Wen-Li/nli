a successful person need not necessarily try new thing and take risk . the knowledge of a particular craft or art and developing on it could also make a person successful . there are a lot of artist , painter , musician , dancer who already know a particular skill or have a specific talent and they dwell on it , improve it , specialize in it and become successful . different stroke for different folk . some people are successful academically , others do well in athletics . it would be unwise for a person who is good in athletics to switch to an academic profession . it would be an uncalculated risk and one is bound to fail . it is better to bank upon what one know than venturing out towards the unknown . this is not to say that there arent any entrepreneur who havent been successful , they have been successful because they have done something no one ha done before , found something that work . but it is a matter of hard work and great bit of luck . there are many entrepreneurial idea that never succeed and also several skilled people who arent successful , but the chance of a skilled person being successful is higher than a risk taker . the knowledge of a skill is very useful and definately the right use with hard work would result in success . also one must continously strive in their own field and keep upgrading themselves . if a person ha not yet recognized his/her potential , then trying new thing to find out what is suitable is a good idea . but leaving a reliable option to trying new thing is not very safe and is not a garaunteed formula for success . if someone ha a talent and doe it well , then there arent many reason for the person to fail except , of course , the skill or talent is dormant and of no use . for example , someone is excellent at washing clothes and wash them really well , but that skill will not be awarded because everyone wash clothes in a washing machine and so the skill is useless . so , one must only try new thing and take risk if one doe not already know how to do a certain thing well . it is then one must set out to self discovery and risk .
