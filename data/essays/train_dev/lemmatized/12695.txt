i completely agree with the statement that young people enjoy life more than older people do . there are many reason for this agreement . firstly , young people take more rescue than older people . they can start any new venture , they can get into any new adventure . while older people being experienced and having lack of energy are not ready to take rescue . i belive to enjoy a life one need to be ready to take new path which will require rescue taking ability which generally youngster are fully equipped with . secondly , young people are very immature a compared to older people . being immature they can take fun in small activity , gossip , hangout with friend . they have not seen the hard part of life so they tend to believe everything and try to take thing light heartedly and enjoy whatever they are involved in . thirdly , older people have fewer friend a compared to youngster . friends are the most important mean to achieve happiness and to enjoy life . having few friend make older people feel lonely since they have few people to share their joy and happiness . on the other hand , youngster are always busy with friend . youngsters have too many people around them to share their achievement and happiness . fourthy , older people are miser . to enjoy life i believe one need to spend money on his comfort and luxury . money can bring the mean to enjoy life . for example one can go for a world tour if he can afford to do so . older people do not prefer to spend money on unncessary thing , while youngster enjoy spending money on friend , party , travel . because of being miser older people prefer to spend time at home . they do not believe in party and always try to save every penny . in sum , i believe young people have more fun in life than do older people have .
