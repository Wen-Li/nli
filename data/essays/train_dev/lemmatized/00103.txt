i do agree with the statement that nowadays young people do not give enough time to helping their community . i think it is really important that the kid of today do not only sit in their room and playing computer or watching tv . but that is how they spend their free time . they do not care about people who really need help and they are only interested in themselves . for my application for a student exchange programm with the government i wa asked to spend some time in a place where people need my help . i chose to go to a place where homeless people can have lunch and dinner . during that time i saw so many poor people , with old and dirty clothes , who were very hungry or who needed medicine . it really wa an experience for me . i helped to give them warm lunch and dinner and i felt so good when i saw that the homeless people where happy about the meal and that they could laugh again . there i felt a if i really can help people and that i did something important . but if you go in the city you see many kid who are laughing at homeless people , who are angry about them and who say that they should be taken away by someone . but who is the `` someone '' if they do not want to help ? i think it is important to change their behaviour . furthermore , the same thing happens with old people , who can not live longer on their own . the youth of today doe not care about what happens to these people . they only say that they are old and that they will die soon . but the question is what they would say if they are in the position of the old people who need help ? they would wish that there is somebody who help with their shopping , washing , cleaning the room etc . in my opinion the experience to do something important and to see people laughing again , is really important for the eduction of today 's youth . you do not only need to be good at school and know how to work but also how to handle other people and what to do for the society . for me that is , when you are ready to become a responsible human being .
