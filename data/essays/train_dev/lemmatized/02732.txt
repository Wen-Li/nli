there is this theory that it is more importante for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact , i desagree . i believe a student should both learn fact and understand idea and concept , because good education must be based on both rather than focussing on one or the other . for instance , a student must understand the concept of democracy in order to study history , but he also must learn some relevant event in history to fully understand the meaning of the concept democracy . i believe the learning of fact is not contrary to the understanding of idea and concept , in the long run , you may forget a lot of the fact you were thought , but at some point they were absolutelly necessary to understand the underlying concept and idea . throughout one life we forget and learn fact a we continue in the process of understanding new concept and idea . an education based solely on fact will produce student who are unable to conect those fact and produce original idea and opinion , while an education based exclusivelly on understanding will make for adult not fit to interact in a cultivated enviroment . the basic approach to education ha changed significantly in the last 50 year , our parent were thought rough fact , they were forced to memorize endless ammount of information to be repeated over and over again , while younger generation were brought up under the impresion that memorizing fact is useless , in my opinion , neither is desirable , nor the student who is full of fact but lack in analisys , nor the student who doesnt know the name or the most important capital of the world or the basic fact in it country history . i also believe education should be balance because student will be likely to study in diferent institution throughout their life and a well rounded education allows them to better adapt to the different teachig methodology and approach to education that each particular institution ha .
