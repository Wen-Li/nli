i am not sure but i think that is probably that in twenty year will be more car in use that now . from 1980 to now the car grow about 4000 % . the problem of this is if in twenty year we find a new metod of transport faster , cleaner and cheaper and the car will be forbiden . for example the people in in the 1930 could though that in twenty year would be more ship to went from europe to usa because it wa the only method of transport but twenty year later appeared the airplane and desappeared the ship . or the train wich were the only method of transport from a city to a other city or town in the begening of the 20 centurytheir were sustutive for the car or the airplane . other problem is the survive of the car if the oil wich is not eterny , finish . one day the oil will dissapear and the car will find other metod of propulsion or dissapear but i think that this is not the principal problem because now there are car who use electricity , sun and other type of energy . i think that it is probably that will exist the car in twenty year but will be different that now know . for example you will not drive the car will wear a computer who will drive for you and they will be faster and safety . other posibility is that the car will be able to fly . all is posibale and i think if now we can do airplane who can stop in the air and land in a little zone why in a future will be able the car fly ? in definitly i think that twenty year is a little time to dissapear the most commoun method of transport in the world but it is posibale that they will be more used or no .
