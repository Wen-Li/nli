today , we depend on car . there are a lot of car on the road in holiday , and the news about traffic jam is always on the screen of the tv . however , i do not think this situation will continue . i think in twenty year there will be fewer car than there are today . i will explain my reason . for the first reason , the public transportaion will deverop . if it will develop , people will not use their car any more . here is the example of it developing . the railload is developping now . in my country , it is decided to expand it . if there is new railload , we can go almost anywhere in my country . another example of developing is about cost . the technique of today will help that the public transportation can move with fewer fuel , so the cost will reduce . i think the development of it will be great help . i will explain the second reason . that is about fuel . nowadays , the problem of fuel is crucial for u , because we totally depend on them . that is because we must save fuel . however , car which use electric energy instead of gasoline are not still invented . the experiment can not say effective suggestion . that is why i think the car will dissapear . the third reason is growing up of the idea of health . living for a long time is the major concern thoughout history . to be more healthy , people need to walk . in our country , walking is hot now . there are a lot of tv program about health , and they suggest walking . tv ha so much power that tv can sometimes control the mind of people . if tv make walking hot in the world , there are few case people use car . in conclusion , i think people will use fewer car than people use now . that is because they use public transportaion more , because they would like to save the resource of the earth , and because of walking . i think the day come when we must become independent of car .
