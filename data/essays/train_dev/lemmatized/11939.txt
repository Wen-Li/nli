in my opinion , specializing in one specific subject is better than having a broad knowledge of many academic subject because of the nature of knowledge such a plentiness and complexity . since the 17th century , many invention were made . information used to make these invention and information provided by these invention are accumulating such that noone alone can know all of these information . for example , in a typical university there are principal department such a natural science faculty , literature faculty , social science faculty etc . . all of these department have also subdepartments . in my university , for instance , business administration , aconomics , international trade are subdepartments of social science faculty . a person can only attend only one of these subdepartments such that it is impossible to finish all of these departmens at the same time . so having a broad knowledge in many academic subject are not that much possible . another reason is the complexity of knowledge in any specific subject . when you want to cure an illness for example to cure the illness aids , you should specilize on virus which are the cause of aids . knowing many academic subject such a optic , pschology , literature will not make any use to cure aids . since you can only learn by doing it , specializing is better . consequently , specializing is better than broad knowledge .
