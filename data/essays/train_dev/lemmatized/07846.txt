i agree with this statement that say that it is more importanto for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact . one might agree with that statement because on many situation it had happened to me that i had to learn all the fact for a test and i end up learning them all , but at the end of the test is like if everything wipped out of my head and that happens exactly the same with all of my classmate . but when we learn the concept of the fact instead of the fact it stay with you forever . many time when i am in a conversation talking about history or chemistry i star talking about concept that i have learned in a period of time and explaining my knowledge that i have obtained by me understanding the concept . this are the reason for which i agree with this statement . knowing the fact can work for a day or maybe a week , but the concept stay with you forever .
