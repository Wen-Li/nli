imagine walking through the costa rican tropical forest with one 's closest friend . as you march through the various type of plant and life-forms , you encounter the rarest type of bird in all of costa rica : the `` mancha roja '' . its astounding color amaze you and you 're friend to such a point that you become frozen on the spot . such a scene would not be frequently seen with the structured group tour guided by an expert . it is obvious that when one drift away from the traditional idea and creates one 's own pathway , one will discover new and amazing thing that would have otherwise been hidden . if one doe not separate from the typical behavior produced by human nature , society would still be living under medieval age condition and no true discovery would be made . it is essential to think outside the box in order to get the best from an experience . if one us a tour guide to explore and discover the rich of our world , one will not be truly discovering the hidden treasure but instead be following a simple lesson . if that is what one truly seek , then maybe a textbook would be more cost-efficient than an expensive tour guide . with this conservative attitude of following someone around , thomas alva edison would not have discovered the lightbulb , or the wright brother would not have soared in the sky . in order to see the unseen , it is key to make one 's own path and explore , try new thing and base one 's opinion and thinking upon that , rather than on a tour guide that one doe n't even know . going back to the initial example of the mysterious bird , if one had walked along the amazon with a group of people , that bird might have been scared away by unfamiliar noise . one would have missed out on what could have been the most enlightening and fabulous experience of year of exploration . had one gone along the inexistent path , one might have seen this bird along with many other incredible animal , therefore the pre-written path doe not lead to discovery and hence must not be followed . creating our own path in life is absolutely vital to the enrichment of our mind . following a group , led by a tour guide , into the unknown can not even be compared to the experience of entering the unknown without direction or expectation . without a doubt , the best way to travel is , and always will be , traveling through the rugged , virgin and unexplored path .
