in my opinon there is no questioon that in twenty year there will be more car in use than there are today . there are really many reason why i belive this but in these essay i will limit my self to mention two , the first consernes the far distance that people have to acheve to go to there work or some where else , the second ha to do with the incresing number of people in the world . the first concernes the big distance that every person ha to acheve to go to his or her work that is the conciconce of big city and also there are some people how live in a city and travel to anthor city to work . also there is another cause of this incresing number of car during next twenty year that is the oportinity the to take credit from bank a easier a you can that help people to must to solve ther finanshual problem . the second ha to do with the incrising number of people around the world that they need more car to move from place to place easily beause they have so many work or appointement that they need to deail with and achevie in a sorter time . also i think in twenty year every one would have more than one car and maybe teneegers will have it . in bref car is an main of entertement that is now nessesery for every one and i tkink it would be more in the next few year because of the devlopment of every thing and it would be more neede to do what you are eccepected to do . i tink increasing of number of car would cause some dangerours proplems like devert type of pollutuion ; there is pollution of soinds and gaz and also that can incerse the number of road accident when it will be more us of car
