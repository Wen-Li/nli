communities build future of the nation by nurturing youth of today . i believe no human being would disagree with the above statement . whatever we are or whatever becomes of a person depends largely on the community that he belongs too . today 's youth is aware of the above fact and people always tend to make the reason of your survival better . thus , i do not agree that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their community . young people of today are more responsible . they understand the importance of community and thus consider it betterment their moral responsibility . they are aware that community are essential because man is a social animal and he need support from his peer to survive . they are more enthusiastic and work towards it . the young people have much more caliber to plan and perform well a compared to elderly people in much le amount of time . i work in a corporation where the maximum population is in their twenty . we have so many group that are functioning to helping the community . these used to be an individual effort which turned into an organisation after recieving overwhelming response from the youngster . now they consist not only people from our corporation but also from whole of the state . the one i am with , work for the special care of mentally or physically challenged child named a disha . yes it consist of middle age people too but we are never short of young volunteer who like to help . the ngo 's or non profit organisation are not the only way they are helping community . politics is a field where no youngster want to end up ; specifically in a country like india . but we have young mp 's ( member of parliament ) like milind deora and sachin pilot who at an tender age of 23-24 are helping people and trying to give a better future to our communites . young people are now diverted towards teaching too may it be part time . imparting education to the generation of tommorow is indeed a spendid way of helping the society . young people do whatever work they have to their full capacity which result in betterment of society . even investing in share market help in betterment of the society because the money flow in the market resulting in more fund for government maybe for school or even hospital . yes i do agree today 's generation is more busy with their own life . they do not find time for their family sometimes but i would rather say exception are always there . but that doe not mean that the young people are indifferent towards the community . people in our organisation work on saturday and sunday , sometimes during some function we even work late night because we believe child who are yet to come need a better community a we got in our childhood . summing up i would state today 's youth is aware of it responsibility towards the community . they understand the importance of community and thus consider it betterment their moral responsibility . even if they do not have enough time some people would plan out and work actively in organization for the betterment of the people . and we would soon realize that today 's youth face more responsibility than just being a fast forward generation .
