given a choice to choose between a self organized tour and a tour where are tour guide leeds a group of people , i would choose the first one . i would like to have my tour focus on my interest rather than the general interest of people and so having a tour guide will prevent me from doing it to some extent . tour guide may make thing easier but reduces the fun of exploring on your own . in a tour various people would want to spend varying amount of time on different part of the tour . i prefer spending more time in more part of the tour , le in some and even skip a part that is covered under the tour led by a guide . in a guided tour i am restricted to follow the schedule and plan decided by the tour guide . since now there is plenty of information available at different source ( e.g. television , internet , magazine ) , i can use that to plan my tour based on my own preference . other than that , i prefer to explore place to a much more extent than a specialized tour guide would keep it restricted to appeal the majority . i would rather learn about the place i am supposed to visit and wo n't restrict myself on the main tourist attraction . i would rather be a part of each and every minor thing that is around that place . in the trip i plan , i prefer to visit lesser place but spend more time on each place . i think that in guided tour , it is more like glimpse of what all is there to explore . some people may have lack of information or time to plan tour properly and tour guide make their job easier . but just for the sake of taking out the effort from planning and managing my trip , i would not give away the main interest that i look for in a trip , a i have already discussed above . considering all the factor , i personally do n't think that to travel in a group led by tour guide is the best way to travel .
