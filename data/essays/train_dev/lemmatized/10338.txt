i strongly disagree to the quote given . i believe that enjoying life depends on the mindset and personality of each individual , not on their age . i have confronted many teenager who stress about their academic study and social relationship with their friend and family . i have had conversation with numerous teenager who simply do not stop complaining about their life . how much homework they receive each night , how much nagging they have to bear from their parent , and what kind of social drama are going on between their friend are only a small portion of the complaint that i hear from other teenager such a myself . on the other hand , i have encountered many old-aged adult who are entering into their latter portion of their life but are enjoying their life to the fullest . they might not be financial well off or socially successful but they see thing in a positive way and are thankful of everything they have . i know an old man who ha lost his wife several year ago , but , even after such a huge emotional obstacle , he still interacts extremely well with his child and people in his community . there is no doubt that he miss his wife with all his heart , but he leaf his past to stay a his past and form a better future with every moment that he is living out . i think that when a person know how to learn from the past and to look towards the future by living their best in the present , he/she is the person who know how to enjoy life . to be satisfied with the thing that he/she ha and utilizing them to make the most out of them are the ultimate way to be truly happy and successful in life . i believe that age doe not alter an individual 's ability to be happy , but it is the way he/she view life and what he/she make out of it that help him/her find true joy in life .
