i strongly agree with the following statement that `` young people enjoy life more than older people do '' for the following reason . in my opinion it is the best age to enjoy and also if we become old we can not enjoy a much a we enjoy during young age and also during old age we will be thinking of child and also their career , settlement and marriage and become very tired and some time exhausted also and also in my opinion `` time is precious '' once it ha passed it wo n't come again . and also another reason is that more enjoyment will there during young age and also we wo n't have that much energy we do have in young age . the main reason for which i am holding this opinion is , when i use to observe my parent they are always thinking of my education and career and also marriage and always they won ' t take care of their personal life and they take care of child in each and everything . i recognized this from the way they are taking care of me . once we \ they become older and we \ they can not enjoy a they enjoyed before . this is one reason for my opinion and another reason is that the same thing we use to talk with our close friend or relative and so on . one example for holding this opinion is , i am having a very close friend and we use to share each and everything and we sometimes use to think of future and talk about it , then we have taken a decision that once we become old we can not enjoy a we enjoy during young age because in young age we will not have any responsibility and also we will have energy to do every thing and we will be mostly dependent on parent or if married early husband and also we will get from parent each and everything we want . i want to conclude that in young age there will be more enjoyment that in old age and in old age we can mostly see love towards family but not enjoyment a in young age and also only oneting everyone look after in old age is happiness . for all the above reason and example i strongly agree with the statement that `` young people enjoy more than older people do '' .
