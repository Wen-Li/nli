as people climb the ladder of success their idea tend to change from dynamic and innovative to static and conservative . i believe that succesful poeple focus and doing what they already know how to do rather than exploring or trying out new thing and taking risk . reaching a level of success whether in bussiness or in life requires time and hard work , and upon reaching success risk would be to huge of a price . for example , a bussiness man would prefer to `` keep-it-safe '' and insure his position rather than jeopardizing his whole career over a simple mistake . the same go for trying out new thing , because successful poeple are who they are due to the priciples and police that they have followed ; and for them to abandon such police which lead them to success would be highly unlikely . thus the latter would prefer to follow a path of conformity instead of radical change . another important factor that render successful poeple to aproach new thing would be their mentality ( a in how the think ) in which they tend to rely on their past experience a a measure for thier action , while on the other hand fresh mind tend to graps new idea faster and better thus striving to try out new thing and build new experience . a typical example for a dynamic mind would be a fresh university graduate which is eager to learn and follow the path of success . the ladder of success change people in many way , a they take the first step people are willing to take risk and try out new thing ; but a their journey progress they develope a new mentality which is built on past innovative , dynamic , and fruitfull experience thus paving the way for a more conservative and limited mentality .
