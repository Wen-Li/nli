some people think that to learn fact is more important than to understand idea and concept because fact make student easy to decide something to do . but personally , i think that there are a lot of factor when student decide something to do therefore , i agree with the statement that it is more important for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact . first of all , it is sometimes difficult for university student to enter a certain company . for example , i worked at ntt , the biggest telecommunication company in japan . when i wa a university student , ntt wa a top ranked company in japan and very difficult to enter . many friend of mine gave up trying to enter that company only because of the difficulty . if i just cared about the fact that the company is very difficult to enter , i might not try to enter that company . but i had a huge dream that i wanted to change the world by using the internet , and at that time ntt wa the most powerful it company in japan . i just believed my idea and entered the company . this example clearly show that idea is more important than fact . second of all , it is hard to get a scholarship . for instance , i got a scholarship in my high school day . my high school wa very famous and one of the highest level in my region . when i decided to challenge to get a scholarship , all teacher in my junior high school told me it wa impossible . however , i never gave up my concept that i got a scholarship and made my parent le burden . if i followed the fact that it wa hard to get a scholarship , i never got a scholarship from my high school . this example is the typical case that to understand idea and concept are more important than to learn fact . in conclusion , i agree with the statement that it is more important for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact .
