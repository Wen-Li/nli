there are lot of factor which would influence that statement but i think that there will not be fewer car in use in twenty year than today . on the one hand , oil price are getting higher and higher because the resource of petroleum are very limited and so the car a we know it today will be too expensive to afford in twenty year . the problem is that the resource are limited and getting more and more difficult to reach . we need to dig for oil in region no one ever lived before for example in alaska or on the ground of the ocean . the other thing is that the pollution by car is very dangerous for our environement , the ozone layer is getting thinner , we have global warming and for a big part of this the pollution by car is responsible . this ha to stop . on the other hand there is a scientific progress on running car on water or hybrid car which need le gas than the old fashioned car . they use the energy wasted at breaking to load a battery . so maybe we do not need any more or much le oil in the future to run a car . the pollution by car would decrease too . if they were running on water the only pollution would be water which is not dangerous at all . we also do not have any real replacing public transportation system at the moment and probably will not have in the near future . the bus and train are a possible alternative in the big city but in the rural area there is no such thing like train running every ten minute , one ha to wait approximatly two hour or more to get a train or bus and the bus are traveling much slower than the car . in a time where time is money , most of the people need to get a fast a possible from one point to another . so a the population of mankind increase steadily there will be more car in the future , hopefully cleaner and more secure one .
