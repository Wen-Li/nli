i agree with the following statement that it is more important for student to undersatnd idea and concept . as becuse idea and concept are mainly helpful for a student in his future use . as a student mainly learns the idea and the developement of the idea which will be useful for him in the future and in his study too . and also the concept play a vital role in the learning stage of a student a if a student ha a concept then he can do resarches based on his concept and that will give rise to the lot of invention too . as now the research on many field are going on based on the concept that our ancestor have left to u thus concept made u to invent the differnt thing in the future . and one more thing that is important is to understand the idea , these understanding will be helpfull to solve the problem , that is what the souce is given and what we have to do this idea is very important a which will give the solution to the problem . as when we think of the invention made by many inventor give u an idea to find the new invention . '' ideas mainly support the invention of the new concept '' . new idea brings the new concept in to the field and lot of development are mainly done by this kind of idea . by referring different kind of book and news paper and puzzle we can easily develope the idea , idea is nothing but creativity , thus the creativity comprises of many idea , a by having greater knowlwdge on any aspect then a different idea can take place . and again we shall discus about the concept study it will be very help full for a student because concept make him work easily and with effectively , a it can be considered a the root for a tree , a root mainly supples food for tree , a in the same way concept help to develope the extra infermation and for the further developement of the future analysis . these specific reason and example are given to support the statement that is about important for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact .
