the use of car today is not restricted to only providing transport . it ha now infact become one of the basic requirement of each individual . therefore , i disagree with the statement and feel that the number of car is surely to go up in the next two decade . we have a reason for this right in front of u when we see massive infrastucture project consisting of expressway , freeway , complex over bridge network , better road etc. being completed one after the other . there is a conscious surge in the infrastructural development today and this is happening mainly due to a realisation that the number of vehicle is going to show a definite increase in the future . more importantly , economically speaking , going by the rapid population increase in our country combined with the want of owning a car by each individual , we can say that it will be a major factor in alleviating the number of vehicle around . there are several other factor too for example : individuals nowadays are earning higher and better salary and enjoying better perk which give them satisfaction . therefore they can afford to buy a car not only for themselves but also for their working partner , which is increasing too , and sometimes also their child who wish to drive to their educational institution on their own . furthermore , some people from business family think of owning car a more of a status symbol and therefore keep several of them even if they are using only a few . though the increase in the number of car will also increase problem like high level of pollution and stress in individual , it is something that can not be totally controlled . we can foresee on the basis of the statistic of the past few decade that it is bound to happen because it ha been going on the same way for quite sometime .
