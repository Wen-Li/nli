it is often said that group tour is more beneficial than travel alone . some people might agree with this statement because group tour is not lonely and a tour gruide will guide best travel attraction . however i firmly believe that travel alone is the best way to travel . it is far more comfortable . also i can do what i really want to do without any regulation . to begin with , a single tour make me feel very comfortable . usually group tour is little bit noisy and confusing . but individual travel will be possible to a calm , peaceful and cozy tour . for example , when i wa going to japan , i went there with group . our tour group member were 15 . so every we moved other location , i had to wait until all member were ready to move . waiting too much wa made me anger . after came back to my country i thought if i had go to japan alone , it will be a much great memorable travel for me . also , individual travel give a great opportunity to encourage independence and endurance . when people travel alone , there are no regulation so people can do what they really want to do . they should planned by oneself and should decide what they eat and where they house . by deciding these thing they will be learn many thing which could n't learn on the book . for instance when i wa senior , i planned to go to america for 4weeks . i did reserve airplane , restaurant and hotel . at that time . it wa very hard time for me . but now , i think through these tour , i can be learn independence , improve my language skill , and broaden my social relationship .
