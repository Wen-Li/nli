i guess a lot of people had the same problem : you are reading an article about an impressive building ( like the pyramids ) and you do not understand how it wa build and hot it wa able to resist all the time . in case you understand the idea or concept of the building , you can transfer this knowledge to other building . in addition to that you are able to improve the concept for examble by building higher and better building . also you keep the fact better in your mind . in this essay i want to discus why it is so important to understand concept and idea . firstly , you can transfer the concept when you understand an idea . in case you understand why a boot in the water made of wood swim you are also able to understand why a boat made of steal is still able to swim . just think of these big super tanker in the atlantic ocean which are crossing the sea . secondly , you are able to improve the concept . in case you are an architect you can build higher building when you have understood why high building are stable . just think of the eiffel tower which had for the first time an iron scelleton . people transfered this knowledge to other building and increased the size step by step ! lastly , by understanding the concept it is easier to keep in mind the fact . you are then able to understand why diesel engine need le fuel than engine with gas because they use different technics . from my point of view it is really important to understand the concept of something . with this understanding you are able to transfer the knowledge to other product or to improve the concept for example by building better product . also you can easier remind on the fact by understanding the concept .
