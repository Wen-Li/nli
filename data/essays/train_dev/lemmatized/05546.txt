in twenty year time i dont think that there will be fewer car in use than there are today . the way i see it is that in order to leesen the number of car in use we have to come up with way to make u le dependent on there use meaning that we have to come up with many new trasportation way and system that are suffitient and at the same time efficent enough to surve the public . there are a lot of example for making good trasportation method that can be introduced although some had already been indeed intruduced but need to be made more effeint , satisfying and accesable for people . one of those example are train and the subway system that have been intoduced in a lot of country but not in others beacause there too small or the country cant affiord bulid and applying them . another example is the use of the bus system and again bus are used in a lot of country but not every body would be intrested in using bus case they may seem uncomfrtable and unsatisfactory . another good example is the use of beycicles for trasportation like whats been done in some of the highly populated poor country . if the the goverments came up with way to improve the trasportations system given in the example and try to come up with even newer and more advanced one i beleive we could see fewer car in use in the future my argumet is just that it will probaly take more than twenty year to see that happening the end
