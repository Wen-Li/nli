basicly , i do strongly agree woth the idea tha successful people would like to try some new thing compare with doing somethings that thay already know how to run it . i support this with the following reason . as we know , new we faced a new time that million of people suvive in this world . the compete increase every day . if we just following other 's step , we could not success . an example could give some light to this point . bill gate , who is growing from a poor boy to the richest person in the world , gave up his undergraduate study when he is a junior and then donate himself to his own caree . just think about that what if he didnot have this decition ? we may have a good professor or a good researcher , but not today 's bill . secondly , this is a idom that ' no pay , on gain ' . this is just tell you a truth that you can not success without any payment . it is real that someone can gain a good life by chance , but in most condition , try new thing and take risk mean you have more chance than other person . last , but not least , under some circumstance , some people do have some good result by doing some mormal thing before . however , in this special environment currently , most people spend their life in the same mode : go to school , graduate , get a not bad job and finally get married . how can you distinct from others ? just use your special thought . for instance , you think about thing in a totally new way , you may get more advantage to success . so , based on the above disscusion , we summurize a conclusion that the success always like to come to those people who like chanllage theirselves and dare to take risk for their caree .
