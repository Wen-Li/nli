in the begning i would like to draw attantion about the diffrence between knowledge and education . all the time most of education is specialized in one or tow major while knowledge can be in more major and you can get diffrent kind of knowledge throw riding to musc in different fildes . when i look at this phrese in the left of the secreen i try carfyully to analyse this sentince with my point of veiw . i found out that i agree & disagree in the same time . becuse it is very important that we have some people specilize in some major such a doctor be dermatologist can not see or cure canser patient who havecancer from this example i come out with my agreeness and , when i look to the knolwdge side i find that the disagreement is also can be in this matter . some one will have to have the knowledge from differnt kind of acadmic source in order to find sulotion for probelms . we realy need both people to have knowledge in order to keep this knwledge contnuing for ever and we need people to do special study to have more experince and to discover new thing with regardes to thoer specility . why do we need bothknweldge and specilatiez ? we need the knowledge to storm our mind to feed our braine like the thursty desert need the rain and we need specility so some one can do somthing acuret with an outstanding effort to came with good end like the bug they can not make honey but the bee can do that so all we need her is knowledgew and spicalties to come togother . i see that all humenbeen should gothered for the acadmic knwledge in order for this earth to beome more educated
