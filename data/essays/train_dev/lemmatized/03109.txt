generally people belive that the student should specialize in one specific subject than to have a broad knowledge of many subject , because they think that a person will not be taking all subject in there future . `` there are particular future for particular subjaects '' this mean that though there are many scope in our future be we can not afford to take every thing in our future . hence that is why we should concentrate in one subject for one particular future . according to me , we the child till class eight should take all the subject because it very neccessary to have a general knowledge of each subject but once we have reached to class nine then it is time to think about our future so it will be good if we concentrate in just one particular subject . hence from my point of view it is better to specialize in one specific subject . will specialisation in one particular subject help ? yes very much because then it mean that we are focussing in our future. , let say for example if a person dream is to study international relation then he/she ha to specialise in political science , but if he/she is taking other subject to then that might distract their concentration in one subject that is very important for the person . that is why i think that we being child should concentrate in just one subject that is very important to u and will make a lot of difference in our life . lastly i would like to conclude by saying that `` precaution are better than cure '' so it is better that we take just one subject and concentrate in it to make our future better . but it every one point of view that matter and i belive in listning to what our heart say and move accordingly . thank you .
