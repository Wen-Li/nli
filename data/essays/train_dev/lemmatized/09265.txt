young people , middle age people , old people . i think that people change with the time affecting lot of thing like , behaviour , point of view , believing , fear , pleasure , entertainment . .. i suppose long time ago , people were very worried about building the world up , but nowadays developed country have created a mass medium - business world . ancient time were season for learning , for knowledge , for wisdom , for care about human nature , a book are showing u every time we open one of them . and we ca n't make division between young or old people , but talk about society . in my humble opinion , society that care about education had always great result a ancient greeks or for example japanese , nowadays we can feel a sense of corruption everywhere , because it seems that society have forgotten about education . young people are worried for example for their weight , cause if they do n't look like the model that the mass medium distributes around the continent , they think they are not socially accepted . but this mass medium also show them everytime-everywhere , those high fat product with smile and perfect body , treating them . young people care about fashion , about the last clothing , the last film , the last videogame , or the last musical tendency . in this sense , we can say that they create their own community in different trend . for example , a disc jockey , feed their public every night , with the best music he can play to entertain people , a mozart creates great composing music for the court time ago . in such way they are helping the community , but in way never humanity ha done . young people try to hide , or to do the opposite , sometimes , that adult use to do . i know it sound like a child behaviour but you can see it . another time , another people , another worry , new social mental disease . .. as a part of the society , the world ha a lot of thing to worry about , and i think the best weapon people ever had wa education .
