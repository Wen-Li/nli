cars that are flying the amount of car get enhanced in the last few decade , but a all humanity passed behind so many other thing like horse , the last day of car are coming soon ? there are several aspect to talk about this clearly , such a the oil reserve , high technology device , and public transportation . those are going to be the deciders of the final day of car or let s say the significant decrease of the amount of the car . as we all know , the oil reserve of the earth is getting lowever and lower each day . scientist , politician , socialist and so on , think of an alternative resource to oil . the only possible solution to this problem is the solar source nowadays . it includes the technology that the car engine structure can be based on this enegry , but i do not hink so , because the technology is so expensive to apply and also not progressing fast . it won t cause any decrease in car number but in old fashioned car maybe . second , the high technology device that enables any thing possible , are not quite working on this process , and generating any development to fit in this area would take at least 50 year to give reproducible result . the new and high technology always cost very much and it can not be spread so quickly to remove car from earth . at last , the public transportation can be good example of an expectation to decrease in car amount in a few decade however , a the world get bigger in term of economical subject concerned , the wealthiness of the people is going to increase , in a manner that everybody want to own his or her car . in twety year era , no new thing seem to be coming . consequently , a the development is in the nature of the mankind , the new technologic progress are on the way , just sticking onto our fancy four wheeled car must be somehow another fancy thing , too . however , when the behaviour of people are analyzed , it can be obviously seen that since there are nothing coming newer than car in twenty year , i am pretty sure that car are going to dominate the world somehow
