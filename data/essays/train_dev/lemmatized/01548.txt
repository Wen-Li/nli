in our era , the value of everything is evaluated by it image created in the mind of humankind . the most popular technique of creating the desired image is using marketing methodology . one of the most valid and prevailing marketing tactic is advertising . some faction think that advertisement have the power to make product seem better than they are really , while the other faction assert that it is impossible to make a product seem better by making customer deceive thanks to lot of legal legislation and institutional control . however , to me , both side can be correct in different condition . first , not all the country have law and legislation for broadcasting fair advertisement that reflects the product just like a it is . in that case , producer can make his product seem more qualified in the advertisement . to illustrate , the cream used for decoration located on top of cake . in the advertisement , the manufacturer can use shaving cream instead of cake cream in order to benefit from shaving cream 's durability and viscosity , are there not any regulation about the ethic that should be conducted in the advertisement . because they have the same color , nobody can distinguish the shaving cream that is displayed in the advertisement a the cake cream from normal cake cream , and all advertisement viewer would probably think that it is a marvellous brand to buy comparing to others a no normal cake cream can seem of such good shape and durability . as a result , if there is no legal stimulus for advertisement , with the help of spurious counterpart , the product may be demonstrated a more qualified . however , if there is enough legislation for advertising procedure in a country , it is impossible to guile the customer by giving false information about product or using a counterfeit product , a the manufacturer is aware of the fact that he will be punished by the law , if he even tempts to do it . for instance , in the usa , if a producer want an actor to give a testimony for his product , it is a must that the actor should use the product for 6 month before the advertisement . in summary , in the advertisement it is quite possible to make the product seem more qualified than it is if there are no law about that . so more law should be accepted in that issue .
