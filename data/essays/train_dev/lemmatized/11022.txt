life is perceived differently by different kind of people . similarly young people enjoy life more than elder do can be stated only by viewing perspecrtives of life partially . what i mean to say is that i do not agree with the fact that young people enjoy more than the elder do completely . in my opinion youth can be viewed a stage of physical stength and vigour and also a a stage of stress and responsibility . in youth every day is a challenge and one can not afford to while away the time they have . therefore it becomes more stressful for young people . one ha to attend their study , fund their study and at the same time earn for a living , compete with their fellow classmate for the first position . then come a stage of choosing-choose a career that shall decide everything and choose a life partner with whom one ha to spend the rest of their life . once satisfied about the stage of settlement , then come the stage of feeling responsible for one 's child , their education , desire and their settlement . inspite of all these difficulty youth is an age of pleasure , vigour , adventure , friendship and love . it is a blessed state , usually with constant good health that give an oppurtunity to experiment and make the most of life . i feel unfortunate are those who do not realise the importance of youth and neglect the age under the pressure of responsibility . old age to me in a stage of peace where one ha to enoy the fruit of all the hardwork one ha done during their lifetime . since elder people are often subjected to brunt of illhealth and illness they have to enjoy life to the maximum in the destined duration of old age that they have . therefore , i opine that one ha to perceive life beautifull , all stage have their own importance and each stage should be enjoyed with an optimistic attitude . only then can one realise the importance of ouer birth .
