i disagree with the statement . i think it is more important to focus o one specific subject which you are interested in and make it to your major skill . you have to be the best on the subject you chose to gain success . there are some example to prove that one good specific subject is much helpful than broad knowledge of many acadamic subject . i have two uncle . one wa very good at business and another wa just normally good at all the subject . later on , an uncle who wa very good at business chose his major skill to business and study deeply in business . finally , he graduated very good business university and got a good position in a company . on the other hand , an uncle who wa adequately good at all the subject could n't make good choice to decide his major skill . he majored english but his english wa not a good a those people who focus on only english . therefore , he is now just a normal teacher in an english acadamy . as a result , the uncle who wa good at only one specific subject seemed to have better life in the future . another example is about a famous soccer player called ronaldo who is the best soccer player . ronaldo is only good at soccer . he is n't good at math , business and other thing . he only practiced soccer from when he wa young . as he tried to do best on his job and focused on only soccer , he finally became best of it . since he became best of well known sport , he got wealth and fame at the same time . if he tried to do other sport also , he surely wo n't be in the position he have in present time . as a result , to be a best on the subject you chose is very important . people will always look for the person who is best at their subject because they are sure the person is good at the subject . when you become the best at a certain subject , you will gain wealth and fame at the same time a ronaldo did . therefore , try to find something that interest you and do your best to make it your major .
