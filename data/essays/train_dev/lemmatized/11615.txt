the issue about whether understanding idea is more important than learning fact is a complex one . personally , i am convinced that fact are le important than idea . in the following paragraph i will try to explain the reason why i believe this . first , understanding idea is more difficult than merely memorizing fact . even a little child can memorize date , name of famous battle , name of king etc . but it take much more effort to understand the idea and the implication behind these fact . take for example the french revolution . anyone can memorize the year : 1789 . but understanding the far-reaching outcome of it is a much more complex issue ! the french revolution 's result can still be observed in the world we are living right now , where government rely on democracy rather than monarchy . while remembering a date is something anyone could do , performing a profound analysis on the plethora of cause and the multitude of effect of such an important event is not so easy . the second point i would like to stress is that learning fact is not so useful in everyday life a it is understanding concept . what i mean by this is : what is the point of learning the exact year of a battle or the death of an important person ? it might only come useful when being on a tv quiz show or when playing `` trivial pursuit '' . instead , delving into the cause , the effect and the main idea behind it , can prove useful . understanding the main idea that lie behind a fact can help someone obtain precious insight on very important issue like , for example , human nature . many antropological study in fact , rely on histrorical event when trying to explain human behaviour . to summarize , i believe that idea are more relevant than fact when it come to study and that the university should be more focused on having student understanding idea and concept behind a fact , rather that the fact itself .
