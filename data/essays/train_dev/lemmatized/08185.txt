traveling by group is an exciting experience due to you can meet new people apart from meeting the plac that is being visited , in my case i agree this statement because 3 year ago i had the oportunity to travel with a group of girl from my same age , and it just wa an experience that i will never forget , meeting people of different place , is quite nice , but it is better to enjoy a trip or a certain place with another people , being led by a guide is very important when do you really whant to know about a place , it culture , it people , and this kind of thing , it also is interesting to visit place that are only known by this kind of people . its very enjoyable having a person who can answr to all of the doubt or question that that you have about certain place , thing , culture or history of the city or country that is being visited . if the porpouse of your trip is of getting relax and get appart from people , it is better to take that trip alone , ad to discover and solve the doubt about the place alone , due to is tru that for reflexing and having peace there is nothing better than being alone , or with your family , without strange people . in my personal opinion i prefer to travel by group meeting people and being led by a tour guide , which can solve my doubt and can teach me more about the place , can give me an advice about what can be done or what can ot be done in that place , which restaurant is better and so on , also when im going in a relaxing plan with my family or alone it is better to being led by a guide because of tha same reason that i expesed before . the better advice that can be done to a traveler is to enjoy the trip alone or in goroup , being led by a guide or not , there is nothing better than meeting new place and new culture , due that kind of experience are printed on memory during long time .
