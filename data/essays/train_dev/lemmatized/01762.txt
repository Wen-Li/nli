a young man enjoy life more than an old person . many people are of this opinion but i disagree with this statement . it is true that young people have energy and excitment that keep them going . on the other hand , elderly who have experienced all kind to situation in their life time show le enthusiam . how ever this dose n't mean they do n't enjoy life . they enjoy happy moment of life a any other individual of the society . many elderly couple go out for vacation after they retire and they just relax in place like florida . many elderly go for world tour after their retirement to explore life around the world . they attain satisfaction by fulfilling their long cherished dream . many a time aged also pamper themselves with the favorite article of use like jwellary , gadget etc . if one is get involved in activity he love to do he would surely derive happiness aged very often indulge full time in their hobby and work they love to do . after the age of 60 they want to do anything and every thing that they have not not done but wanted to do while they were working to make their end meet . for example , some who are humanitarian may start volunteering fot non profit and gain pleasure by helping others in need , whereas some other may prefer to engage him self in creative hobby like pottery , gardening , music etc . it is said that old people are like kid . old people love to play with their grand child . they derive fun and excitement in playing , hopping around with kid , telling them story etc . to sum up i would say that most of time old people are independent of any responsibility thus they have enough time to relax , chill and seek joy in thing that make them happy . they have have the sense of accomplishment and fulfillment which enables them to live life freelly a they want .
