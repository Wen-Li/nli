nowadays , travel agency are providing tourist with various kind of traveling program with a tour guide which are designed by agency beforehand . these pragrams are quite conveninet because we do not have make effort to make schedule on our own and we are led by a tour guide with a reserved tour bus . however , i do not agree with the statement that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide for the following reason . to begin with , we can not have great fun and excitement which are felt while we make plan for a trip for ourselves if we use a traveling program with a guide . i realized the importance and fun of planning my trip by myself when i prepared for a trip to europe in the last summer . i had the trip with two of my friend , so we met frequently to decide which place we are going to visit , what we will eat , what to buy a a souvenir , etc . i think that we had equally or even more interesting time or even more exciting time while we make our schedule and imagine our trip compared to actual traveling . a group traveling led by a tour guide is already planned by travel agency , so we can not make our unique and special choice and plan . additionally , we will be probably restricted to the group 's decision and behavior even if we have different idea . for example , we can have some chance to choose what to eat even though we travel in a group . however , in this case , we should follow a certain choice that many people selected . it is a really sad thing that we can not eat exotic food that we really want while traveling foreign country . furthermore , we can not take public transportation because of a reserved tour bus . i found it very interesting and impressive to take other country ' subway , train , bus and tram during my trip . i must have missed that precious experience if i had traveled in a group led by a tour guide . in conclusion , i am convinced that traveling in a group with a guide is not the best idea to travel . we can have really interesting and exciting moment while we make our original and free plan for our trip . we also can behave freely if we are not included in a group . we can eat whatever we want , go to wherever we want , and even decide to take risk or advantures when we travel by ourselves . besides , we can experience minor thing which are done by resident of a foreign country such a riding public transportation and walking along river and street . these are great advantage of traveling by ourselves individually .
