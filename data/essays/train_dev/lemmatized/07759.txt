i agree that most advertisement really make product seem much better than the product really are , and that is why people make the advertisement for their product because they want to sell them for money . businessmen do not care about other people ' right , only thing they just wanted is money , money , and money . athough some product which are made by famous company are actually pretty great , but most of product are not a well a the adertisements shown . i still remember when i wa a child , i saw a very cool advertisement of a toy , but my parent told me i should not buy that because the real thing is impossible a well a the advertisement said . i disagreed with them and finally bought the toy which i wanted at that time . after i got home , i wa so exciting and opend it without taking off my shoe , and i found out i wa wrong . it wa the worst toy i had ever seen before . i felt so sad . i wa cry for whole night . after that time , i do not believe those beautiful advertisement . i think it realy dishonst for people who bought these product . the businessmen make the advertisement which are too different from the real thing . it is fine for me if there is only a little different between the product and advertisement . but sadlly most of advertisement for the product are too `` wonderful '' which make me think it is impossible to be . i realy hate those advertisement , but that is how the thing work , i could not change that . i think in the furture there will still be a lot of people buy those amazing product , and they would understand and learn a new lession , `` do not trust those dadvertisements anymore .
