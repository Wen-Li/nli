i agree with the above statement , because it is really an inportant for the student to analyse , understand the idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact . without knowing what is there in the particular topic how can a student read the fact an memorise it . its very important for them to understant the main idea f any topic . in understanding the the given topic the student can easily grasp the related fact an figure about the topic or subject , an can easily memorise them . its really a good thing for a student to get the main idea of a particular topic . collecting the various fact an figure about an particular topic really help a student to create new idea an creativity in their mind , an that will be help ful for them in getting the fact throughly . if the student dont get the main idea and concept about any topic then they ha to suffer a lot while reading the subject . if the topic ha been read with full of main idea an key concept then this will be help full for them in their future carrier , if at all that particular topic will come in their future then they can just easily handdle that subject or topic . some student will work more harder in understanding the fact an some will not . but it good to them only if they get the related idea and concept understand about the particular fact . say for example if the student dosnt understand the subject then they could fail or get bad result in their acadamics , an more over they will face lot of problem in their higher study . getting the topic understant by concepy really help them to score good mark an percentage in their college . so it important for every student to understand idea and concept about the topic . an it will really help them to get the subject in a right an better manner .
