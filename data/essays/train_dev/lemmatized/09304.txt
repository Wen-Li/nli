i am agree with the statement that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their community . it is true that youth of today is not much concerned about the well being of his society and is busy in pursuing his own individual interest but they are not wholly to be blamed for this because there are various other factor which prevent them from contributing to their society and community . to start with take the example of cut throat competition all around the world in every field due to technological advancement , where every individual , every firm is striving hard to achieve maximum efficiency and hence maximum benefit out of limited available resource in their hand . right from the point child take admission in the primary school , he ha to cater to the expectation of his parent , friend etc . then with population increasing and resource decreasing , their are limited vacancy in higher school , college and good university for the student so there also they have to compete in entrance examination for the limited seat . then even once in , there is not much relief since the academic curriculam is so hectic that one doe not have enough time to look after other people who need help . and we alsoo in this situation we can not expect from someone to take out time from his busy schedule and devote it to the community . then coming to the time one get job and start working in some business or firm , there also the young man are expected to do hard work , if they want a better and secure future . however despite these point , i will not deny the careless attitude of the youth towards their community . due to globalisation and mixing of culture , young people are more attracted towards the materialistic pleasure and are not ready to understand the responsibility they have on their shoulder for the society and community , which ha given so much to him to make the person , he today is , and now it is his obligation from the ethical consideration , that he give some payback to the same community .
