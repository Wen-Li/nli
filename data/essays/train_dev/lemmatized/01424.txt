no i do n't think so . because , world population is growing up rapidly . therfore the car user increase in twenty yers . the person who have a opposite view to me might think about increasing of population case something bad to nature . for example , acid rain and greenhouse effection . the gas from the car is one of the biggest reason of air polusion . if these problem get worse in twenty year , it seem to have strict control by the goverment to solve these problem . so it might be decresing the car user . but i think we do n't have to worry about that . because today , there are car which are moved by solar system and natural oraganisum oil . `` purius `` invented by honda is a kind of car us the solar system to work . it is quite expensive but it must be le expensive in future . and a lot of country try to make oil or gasoline which made from natural thing , so there are much more car in use in twenty year . i mean the car that is kind to nature and human being .
