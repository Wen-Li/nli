as we can read on a lot of magazine , mainly on the one dedicated to environmental problem , the number of car in use in the world ha increased a lot during the second half last century . this is mainly due to the economic development , which characterised a lot of part of the world , and to the high value of the population . in the meantime we have to consider that the environment is suffering from thyis situation and that the stock of energy is continously diminishing . i agree with the statement that in the future there will be fewer car in use than are today only in part . the importance of the environment ( for exaample , in some city is not possible to use a car one day per week . .. thi in order to reduce air pollution ) and the situation of the necessary resource to produce fuel for the car bring to me to think that in the future there will be a reduction of the number of car but i 'm not able to say when this reduction will happen . as example of thethe restiction i work for an oil company and i heard a lot of time discussion about this topic . the fuel demand ha incresed a lot and the production too but the possibility to find new giaciments in order to extract petroleum are not so hight . the first reason is that several place can not be the scenario of petroleum operation due to law restriction . .. obviously in order to protect the envinroment . .. than the high level of tecnology requested ha to be considered . an other aspect that could influence the use of carshas to be anayized : the public service . our city are giving u more service day by day and people is becoming to use all the these service such a bus and undergrond . this fact too can be considered an action against the use of car in favor of the environment . it would be interesting to know the reaction of the oil company and the car producer . .. i hope that they will find an other type of engine . .. frendlier to the environmet ,
