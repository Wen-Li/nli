as the development of transportation , people travel more . the most common way of travelling is like this : going to a travel agency , flying to a place with a group people , listening what the tour guide said and flying back . i do n't , however , admire this `` common way '' and never consider it the best way of travelling . the biggest problem brought by having a tour guide is the absence of freedom . you have to go to one place after another exactly a the fixed plan . the schedule wa full of different arrangement and you could rarely get the chance of walking around alone in such circumstance . for instance , i once went to hong kong on my own while a friend of mine went there with a group of people and a tour guide . as soon a she met me in hong kong , she started to complain about her trip . she said that she could n't go to the place she really wanted , eat food she liked , and even the shop she loved . all she did wa taking bus to different place and walking around a a walking machine . she wa very upset about her trip and did n't find any pleasure in it . another nightmare brought by group touring is shopping -- a group of tourist are often brought into a shop by the tour guide and forced to buy product . this is quite true in some coutries according to my own experience . since guide could get money from the shop , you may be badly treated by the tour guide if you did n't buy anything . nobody could have a nice trip in such case , is n't it ? for me , i prefer going to place myself , without a tour guide or other unknown people . when i travelled to hong kong , i only booked my plane ticket and hotel , for a cheaper price , by travel agency . my travel is like this : i walked in the street of hong kong , went to those small local shop that a tour guide would never introduce to you , eat those really `` hong kong '' food that you may never eaten in a big restaurant , and talked with local people about their daily life . these are thing you could never have when attending a group and led by a guide . leading by a guide is an experience of `` viewing and listening '' , but not travelling ; only when you walked in a city or a place of interest on your own , can you find it charm and fall in love with travelling .
