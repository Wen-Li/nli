here the statemanet is correct , so i agree with it a the present day doe not have engouh time to think for oneself , how he help the community ? so he wa not helping the community . first look for the past day , there man ha le information to know , le luxiries , le work . there life can be lead comfortably with le money . that is why people involve in the communitypart , especally student or young one , bcause life span is short . then look for th present day here the information to know is vast , so no time to diviate . now th world is in the hand of th people i.e every thing is available . a the human desire is vast . so he end up in a wild goo change of thing . no self satisfaction , so notime to look for the others . so he never bother about the surronding world . second thing is the excessive growth of population . each city is having the lackhs of people , it may vary depend on the type of city is it metropolitan or capital city . depend on it the community sige varies . for the such large population . there are many problem and public ca n't solve iy a it requires more money . althogh collective impact may help , it is a difficult process . a every body look for the govt help rather than hlping the society is the main route cause for the le involvement in the community work . shortly it is the increase in the population and work schedule of student leading to decrease in the involve of community work . then i can coclude that , the main reason that is inferring is incrase of burden on the every student leading to this . then there is need for the govt to look after this . a the student must involve in every thing it is the govt must easy every thing .
