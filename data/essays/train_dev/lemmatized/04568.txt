i 'm agree whit this statement . for example , thinking to the i-pod , a new type of mp3 music , the advertisement that the productors do , is too unreal . they say that if you have this mp3 , you have more opportunity to be considered by your friend , or by other people , that you have something more that give you what other have n't , give you celebrity or more opportunity with the girl or the boy . but this is only an object that beetwen a few month you will change because is out of mode . is nothing special , it ca n't give you everything that they said . the producer use the pubblicity to bring the people , to influenced their choice and for doing it they must invent , they must associate to their object the figure of geat , wonderfull , special even if is a common object . another example could be rappresent by the use of yogurt for the regularity . in italy there are more society tha make yogurt to help the people to go to the bathroom , and they say that if you took one of this every day you can get it . but if you try , the quality that them could apport to you is not real how they said . it 's dipend from people to people . so we do n't believe in everything that they tell , because there is always someone that tends to tell a lay for having we to his part .
