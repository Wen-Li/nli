when i see the commercial on television , i see many good which look so facinating and useful . however , are they really useful like the commercial 's explanation ? i do not think so , since i believe that the advertisement is a way to lure the cumstomers to buy and to maximize the profit . thus , seller will only show the beneficial and useful side of the commodity . thus , i agree with the statement that most advertisement make product seem more useful than they really are . first , the nature of advertisement is not to show people how bad the product are , but to convince them that these product are so beneficial to people 's life that they should buy . as a result , people who make the commercial have to make product seem much better than the reality . for example , my friend once bought a physical training machine which wa advertised for it quick result . they said that it will decrease people 's weight by ten pound in a week if they work out an hour with it . however , when my friend tried it out , it did not show such result even when she exercised with it for many hour . another reason for most advertisement to show only good part of the product is that if the advertisement show the reality of the product , customer are not going to buy it , and producer will not be able to make a profit . to be specific , tyrenol , which is a famous medicine for cold and fever , is also infamous for it side effect . i once heard that it can increase the possibility of getting cancer . if the advertisement for tyrenol say ` this medicine can cause cancer , ' who will risk the chance of getting more serious disease to cure cold ? i believe that human are easily convinced by what is good , but more easily drawn away by what is bad for them . therefore , if producer make a advertisement which show every facet of the product , including the bad one , people are not going to buy the product since they mostly see the demerit they will have on them rather than the good effect . producers know well about such a nature of human ; thus , they will make advertisement which make their product look better than the reality so they could sell more .
