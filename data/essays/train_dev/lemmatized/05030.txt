i agree yonug people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their community . i am going to cover my opinion about it . i think it occur specially city side compare to country side . i am going to explain covering some exampls . in country side , they work a a farmer in huge farm . they have to coorporate each other managing agriculture in their farm . so they would participated in their community automatically . now however , contrast city side , they may not know about neiborhood even they can not know their name . because they do not need cooporate each other to live . their parent just work and manage their family in a day . if young people have to give enough time to help their community , i think that their parent or around thier adult teach how to join , help or cooporate together . because yong people doe not know how to join or help their community same a around adult not to join it . and their parent or their around adult have to consider something hold festival or event that young people will have more intersted in thier own community . then if young people is interested in thier community , i think they would became to consider join or help thier community . i coverd i agree yonug people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their community . because young people deos not need to join their community generally that they live . but if they more help together , thier aound enviroment would be changed lik
