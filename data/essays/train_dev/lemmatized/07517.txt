maybe right maybe wrong but i 'm not looking to this topic so dark . . because i 'm also young person but i dont think i 'm not giving time to help my community . . or at the topic what it 's trying to be asked by helping ?? what i see in turkey is mostly young people study in university just for studying . few of them are really studying to be something or to make something for their community or for thier country . . but in other way not only the young people is the one to blame ! so many university graduated young are still ca n't find a place to work in turkey . . in turkey i say because this is only what i can see . . i do n't know if it is thesame in other place . . but for sure this is being happening in turkey and i 'm really afraid . . in such small town still small girl are being saled for money ! and so many of them ca n't even go to scool . . so how can we wait from them somethigs to help thier community when they grow up . . they could n't save their self . .. what is important first is to prove the parent ; the father , the mother and also the brother . .. first we have to blame ourselves before asking to agree or disagree about what young make for their community . .. lets ask this way then ; thus community give enough time to help young people ? ... so last thing to say is ofcourse i do not agree this . . i wish it to see young people spending so much time to their community but i do not agree also what world or life giving to them . ..
