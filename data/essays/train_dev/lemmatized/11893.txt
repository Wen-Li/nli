i believe that both my grand mother and i enjoy our own life and fell happy through such daily day . in my situation , i think that my way to enjoy is quite defferent with my grand mather . therfore i mean that there is a big defference point to enjoy of life between young people and older people . however personally , i agree with this atatement . firstly , when we go outside , especially downtown , there are more thing which young people enjoy with , such a amusement park and shop that of older people . therefore they can enjoy their free time more easily older prople can . secondly , because generelly young people are active and out going . therefore they have more oppotunity to meet a lot of people . through these meeting , someone can have make a good friend , the other can find soul mate in rest of your life . i think these oppotunities make our life more fun and exciting . thirdly , many young people have specific dream in their furture , such a what they want be or what they want to in the future , and they must work hard for it . thats completely great thing . for example , a friend of mune are now studing so hard to be japanese teacher . although , of course , she sometimes feel negative or stressfull for her hardship she always sparkling . i xan feel that she is enjoying her life very much and satisfied . in conclusion , i agree that young people enjoy life more than older people do , because of these reason . however , i think that the older people should enjoy their life a muchas they can , and many of them do already . i hope that we can enjoy whole of our life regardress our age .
