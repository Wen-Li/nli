i agree with this statement . advertising is an art , an art of making product seem attrative and perfect . it is also the art of convincing the consumer to buy the product . consumers who are not wise enough or who are too influencable buy product because of the advertisement . first of all i would say adverstiment company tend to have a lot of money so they can make beautiful , attrative advertisement . they have a lot of mean to attract to consumer . tv advertsiments are the easiest way to convince a consumer to buy your product whereas written advertisments in newspaper for example are le convincing because they are not interactive . on tv ad you can see people use , eat the product the company is selling . they reach more easily the consumer . second of all , advertisments are made to make product seem better than they are in real life . it is an art . for example when you see an advertisment for a frozen pizza , the pizza always look hot , savourous . usually you can see the cheese melt whereas when you buy it and you heat it up it is nothing compared to that advertisment , it is a normal frozen pizza not a home made one . third of all advertisement is a lure for consumer . people do not buy a product for it consistency but for the way it look in the ad . sometimes ad tend to lie about the the quality of the product for example toothpaste that make your teeth white a the snow , or a soap which eliminates all the imperfection of a teenage skin . to conclude i would say advertisement make product seem much better than they really are because it is one of the goal of advertsiment the first one being to sell a product . but to sell a product in huge quantity you have to make it special , better than the others , attractive or even emphazise the result of this product .
