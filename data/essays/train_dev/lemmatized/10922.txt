in rapidly chaing world , it is clear that those who are not unerstand idea and concept are unlikely to succeed . some arguee that it is ideal to learn fact . however , i agree that it is unrealistic to learn fact . because , doing so prevent them developing thier knowledge and finding more rational fact . first . learning fact do not increase thier knowledge . this is because if people learn fact . they become weary of the fact . which make it difficult to develop thier ceative knowledge . for example , recent study show that student who learn fact produce knowledge 30 percent le than student who understand idea and concept . this is because student become fed up with simply fact . it make them dull . a a result , learning fact prevent student from develping their knowledge . second , understanding idea and concept help student find more rational fact . this is because they can find more rational fact from experience to understand . for instance my son ha learned from learning fact to understanding idea . i disappointed whenever he do not understand principle of something . however , after he change the method of learning to understading idea . he finding more rational fact . if he had chosen to learn fact . he would not have been able to find more rationl fact . in short . it is impractical to learn fact fot student . since it lead to lower knowledge . furthermore , experiece to understand idea and concept help them find rational fact . although it 's easy to learn fact . it prevent them growing thier professional life .
