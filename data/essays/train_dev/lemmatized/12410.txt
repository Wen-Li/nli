i totally agree with this statment and i blieve that every thing in our world ha it own advantage and dis advantage and so doe advertsment . advertisment mean announcing about some thing wheather it is good or bad . but comercially ; you do not have to show the bad quality of your product other wise peapole will not buy it for example if you advertised that your product is not suitable for olders also the youth will not buy it so you have to lie and say it is suitable for all people to give it the chance to compete you have to say that your product is tcken rapidly to incourage people to try it while in fact it is stored in all shopps once i bought ashirt and it wa advertised that absorbs sweat without harming the skin but after only one day i suffered from allergy up to two monthes after that irealized that it wa not made from cotton but from pollyester once again i bought a pincil and it wa advertised that it will last with you for at least one year but unfortunately it wa brocken at the same day so finally i agree with the statment above and recommened all people not to rely only on advertisments
