as we know , young people are more energetic , enthusiastic , and enjoy better health , then it is true that young people enjoy life more than older people do ? personally speaking , i do not agree with such a contention . first , the life of young people are much more streassful than that of older people . the generation of our parent or grandparent were born in the 1930s to 1950s , when the population in china wa relatively small . by contrast , most young people nowadays were born during the birth boost in 1980s , therefore , the competition for education opportunity and job position are much more fierce for them . they have to work day and night to support themselves financially . second , young people are in a specific phase of their life when there are more trouble and frustration than older people . for example , young people would feel overwhelmed with anxiety or stress when first falling in love , when getting married , when expecting a baby , all of which are new to them , so that they are not sure whether they can handle . however , the life for older people is more peaceful and smooth , without such anxiety . what 's more , young people might probably have some financial problem , especially when they are frustrated in job hunting . by contrast , most older people have pension and they are covered by social welfare system , such a medcare , so that they are emaciated from such financial trouble and are living a more secured and decent life . third , older people are carefully protected and highly respected by the whole society , however , young people tend to be neglected in some way . nowadays , young people are encouraged or even forced to move out of their parent ' house and begin an independent life by themselves . sometimes they are living in detachness , loneless and isolation . by contrast , older people are respected by the whole soceity , and they are refrently visited by his child a well a social worker . in numerous family get-togethers , it is not hard to tell how happy they are , with a pride of self-accomplishment . in sum , although we must admit that young people are more health , energetic and enthusiastic than older people , at the same time , they are facing more stress , competition and anxiety . what 's more , older people are carefully protected and highly respected by the whole society , but young people are negelected in some way . thus , i do not think young people are living a better life than older people .
