there are two side to the question whether young people enjoy life more that older people do . on the one hand , one could say young people enjoy life more than older people do . they still have their life ahead of them and , due to their youthfulness and good health , are still in the position to aspire a bright future a well a to have all the possibility to live their dream and achieve their goal and what they may want in life . also , the chance that young people are impaired physically and/or psychologically are way lesser than they are with older people . on the other hand , one could also claim the opposite and say that due to their experience , older people are more in the position to enjoy their life to the fullest , despite mental or health problem . after a life full of experience and adventure , older people know what to acknowledge about life and not to take everything for granted - they will know who and what is important to them . to conclude , i believe that one can not find a final answer to our initial question , a it is merely impossible to measure joy or better a person 's capacity to enjoy life . a young person can also be pysically and/or psychologically impaired in the same way an older person can be absolutley healthy and fit despite their old age . in addition , some young people have already gone through a lot of hardship despite their youth , while some old people have never faced a severe problem . whatever the case , i believe it is not so much a question of whether a person is young or old , but rather a question of people individual character , outlook and attitude that enables them to live and enjoy life to the fullest .
