i agree that people must try new thing and take risk rather than only doing what they know how to do well and that is because when you learn new thing and do new thing you meet new people and that is good because once you known alot of people you will succeseed in your life and if you do n't take the risk and stay where you are you will not be able to know new thing and new people and that acually be boring and le fun and you will not be able understand the thing you face in the future if you do n't known nothing about anything exept the thing you know from before but when you learn new thing you will be able to see thing more clearly than before and if you do n't take risk you are not living you life like you should you must take risk and learn new thing and meet new people to be a successful man . for example if you have two company each one of them work in a kind and one of them fail you will have the other one , but if you just work in one kind of work and have one company you will lose everything that is why i like learning new thing the taking risk .
