i completely agree with the statement . although i can not be one hundred percent positive about this fact i think there is a clear trend towards reducing the use of car in our society . i must admit that i completely support it there are several reason that support my opinion . first , there is an evident increasing trend in term of transport diversification that ha a direct impac in the reduction of the use of the car . tube , aeroplane , urban bus , fast train . .. are new way of transport addressable to the public that did n't exist before . when my parent were young going from madrid to barcelona on a plane wa unbelievable a there were just one flight during the day and they were extremely expensive . nowadays , with the drop in price of flight ticket , nearly everybody can afford it . the same happened with the tube . in the past , just a few city had tube system whereas currently , most city have underground or are planning to open it or increase the number of line second , governments from most country and the european union institution are continuously encouraging the public transport and the fewer use of car . in my opinion , this is considerably reasonable taking into account the pollution that car generate , the congestion and the high number of car accident . for example , in some city a london , frankfurt , rome , etc . .. to access to the city centre , citizen have to pay a certain amount of money , which clearly show the government willingness to reduce the number of car third , a new communication system develop ( internet , mobile phone . .. ) the need to actually move from one place to another ( let 's say for a meeting ) reduces and the need to use car reduces a well for all the reason explained above i think that there would be fewer use car in use in the future . big car manufacturer a toyota , ford or mercedes . .. will have to struggle in the future in order to achive good economic performance . i am pretty sure that they will try to encourage the car sale offering attractive discount etc . .. but i do not think that they will be able to stop what it 's already an increasing tremd
