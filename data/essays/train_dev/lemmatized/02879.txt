the pace of the development in science and technology is hard to compare with any of the previous period . we witness a post-industrial revolution , or in other word we are transforming into a knowledge-society . with this great transformation , academic world is also reshaping it way of doing research . the number of the research area are increasing and interaction among discipline become more frequent . in this context , a broad knowledge of many academic subject will contribute much more to our scientific knowledge than to specialize in one specific subject . specialization in one specific area is sometimes good for instance , in discovering a new medicine . but , there may be waiting a number of opportunity with a broad knowledge of academic subject . therefore , in scientific research there is an incresing tendency to make inter-disciplinery study . for example , economics and physic are rather different two subject . but , scientist from these field are arranging joint-congresses in order to find solution to the problem of theis field . biologist and sociologist are collaborating to understand the nature of the behavior of animal living together like ant . this kind of inter-disciplinery approach can open new door for some critical invention . using nano-technology for some vital heart problem save a lot of people life or at least increase the quality of their life . finally , in a very rapidly developing enviroment of science , inter-disciplinery studuies will bring a lot of suprises to our life . so , it is better to have a broad knowledge of academic subject and education system much revised with this approach .
