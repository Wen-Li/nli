i knew what communication mean , it mean that i have conversation with others and i should listen to others when they speak . but sometimes i do n't listen to them , and just i talk to them what i want to say . i still confused what i should do when i communicate with others , even though i know what it is . i guess i do n't fully understand what is communication , but also i somehow misunderstand what it mean . in my opinion , understanding idea is more important than what it is . i am pretty sure there are a lot of student like me . even though they know a lot of fact or definition , they really do n't what it mean for themselves . so very often student could misunderstand what it is . for exemple , even though i learn what is communication , i did n't try to understand that concept and i just admit this idea without thinking . after all , it lead me to misunderstand what communication is and i could n't use this concept very well in my life . i think all fact and definition should be adapted to people . if one doe n't mean anything to them , it is really nothing . it can become something when it is used by people and adapted for their life . i learned a lot of thing when i wa young , but i could n't remember all those , such a geology , biology , literature . however i still remember what i need for my life and my career . i still remember very well economics , math , english . it is because i need latter more than former , not because former is not important . if student find the meaning in what they learn , it is very helpful for their understanding . for these two reason , i believe that understanding is more important than what it is . all people could learn what it is , but just some people could understand and use it for what they really need .
