i feel certain that it 's better to have broad knowledge of many academic subject than to specialize in one specific subject . first of all , i consider having knowledge of various subject could be a valuable advantage for general culture . i really think that is important to be polyvalent and to be interested in different subject . however , you should be aware that all information are not right . consequently you should n't be lost in a ' `` vast ocean of information '' . furthermore , you are not limited , that mean you are able to talk with different person about various subject whereas a person who is specialized in one specific subject are not . when you are speaking with friend for insance , you can take part at the conversation and express your opinion about the topic since you have studied several point about it . in a nutshell , although being specialized in one particular subject do seem to offer certain advantage like depthy knowleges , they are outweighed by the advantage of acquiring knowlege of several topic .
