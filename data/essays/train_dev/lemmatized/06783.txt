while i am 18 year old and still going to school and will continue to do so for at least one more year , i agree with the statement . it is extremely important to achieve a high of a broad knowledge a possible . i think that knowing a lot in many different academic subject will get me further . basic knowledge is the key to success . i believe that this is the reason why several `` gymnasien '' in switzerland for instance focus on a broad knowledge . eventhough no student will be able to use every subject he or she studied in school or university later on , the subject are essential for doing a great job in the chosen profession . for example , if i will go study and specialize in business later on , i wo n't get anywhere only with my knowledge about business or economics . in the business world you need a strong sense of language and communication skill . no matter what you choose to be , language is important , especially english . if a person ha no knowledge in english , he or she wo n't be able to contact someone in another country or work internationally . also important , wherever you work or what you study , is math . a person will be confronted with math question all his life and will need to apply math in specific situation . it is rough to get through life when one doe n't have a broad knowledge . nowadays it is even more important , since one can change his job or academic field of work more easily than before . in the olden day people chose their proffession and usually stuck with it for the rest of their life , always doing the same thing . today , one can easily switch to a totally different field and still do a great job . in this case one clearly need to have a broad knowledge to accomplish such a change . in my opinion it is getting easier and easier to do so . in some case you do n't even need to major in business anymore if you want to work a a manager . it 's simply important to study or work in the field you like to achieve high academic or work related success . of course in this case , a sense of knowledge in every field of study is essential . it definitely is important and reasonable to get a much of a broad knowledge a possible . specializing in any specific subject is not wrong either and also important , but it is way better to do so in addition to a broad knowledge .
