it 's quite common to hear judgment about young people nowadays . it 's even quite popular the idea that they are poor in spirit and too selfish to spend time on someone else life . well , i think it 's the way adult use to solve some their internal problem , completely not tied with what the reality is . the reality is that young people nowadays spend much more time to helping their community than before , and i think this habit will increase in the future . the modern life ha brougth u to stress our time in order to do a much a we can : or better , in order to earn a much a we can . this behaviur entay an important aspect : the rising of a new concept of common culture . what i want to say is that now every young people is enough preperred to understand that is better to work and to make effort for the community instead of behaving selfishly . any good action can only improve the common happyness , but our happyness is just inside this commonwealth . it 's even more and more evident how young people are trying destroy old stereotype of thinking about what is defferent . although until few year ago hostile behaviour among human race were deep radicated in common thinking , new social dynamic are strongly addressing young people to accept every kind of difference . thus making easier and faster the growing of a new common sense of belonging to a community ; and it 's this new sense of belonging to make u spend more time with this new family . anyway the elevate number of young people involved in volunteer group , such a medical team in poor area of the word or even very young people helping in housekeeping elder , is a confirm of what i 've stated . in conclusion , i can even well understand why many adult think that most of young people ar poor in sprit : are not them to teach u in university class that yhe only god we must pray is money ? and the only way to earn money is n't time ?
