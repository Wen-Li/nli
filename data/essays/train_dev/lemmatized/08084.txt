in light of the latest developement that the whole world witness on regular and daily base , this issue is considered of a particular impotance and it 's pretty vital to refer to . let me first explain explicitly my total rejection and opposing point of view regarding this statement , a it seems so reticulous to me though , i have my reason for having a full faith that the world would see an outrageous and sharp rise in the number of car , not merely in the next twenty year but till the technology introduces an alternative mean of transportation , my belief is based on the ground that a long a there is an considerable increase in the population , and a long a we see an expansion in the job that depend entirely on the car and other different vehicle , the production of such car wo n't cease and eventually this will lead to street pregnant with car so to speak . the car were and will continue to be a very sensitive and indespensible element in our life , so who could imagine himself even for one day without that mean of transportation which mean giving ride to people to their place of work , giving ride to the kid to their day care , can we imagine a hospital whithout the vehicle that transfer the critical case to it in the sprinkling of the eye ! a well a to the above-mentioned reason , there is another key issue that i must bring up , the car is considered the way of living and the source of livelihood for the overwhelming majority of the people ; such a the cap driver , truck driver and even the driving license instructor , so accepting the idea of dropping off the number of car in the next few year will lead u to the thought of ending up with million of people out of work . in conclusion , i need to stress on the importance of the car in our life on the large scale , regardless of the disadvantage it could have .
