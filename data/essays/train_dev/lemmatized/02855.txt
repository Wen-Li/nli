i disagree with the statement that considers it better to have broad knowledge of many academic subject rather than to specialize in one specific subject . in the following paragraph , i will attempt to explain my position from different perspective . in my opinion , someone who know `` little about a lot '' , will probably be unfamiliar with the specific in each of the area he or she know `` a little '' about . the probable outcome is that this person wo n't be able to do anything his own and will need specialist in each area to help him or her . instead , if that person were to specialize in at least one area , then people can go to the person for help on a specific matter . the person can , in turn , ask for help or advice in area beyond his or her expertise . from an economic perspective , i think that this optimizes resource . from a social perspective , i think that this creates social interaction , since people will continue to need from each other . it also prevents mistake . why ? because many mistake are made by those who think they know . finally , i think that the future is tending to a world of more specialist . in day to day life , we see that university offer very specific course . on the other hand , we see that company are demanding precisely that . it is no longer sufficient to be a lawyer , or a tax lawyer - for example - since some company are looking for a specialist in transfer pricing , which is a very specific part of tax law . to summarize my opinion , i think that from an economic and social perspective and for other reason described above , it is better to be an expert in a field than to know `` a little about a lot '' .
