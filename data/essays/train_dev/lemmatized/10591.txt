first , to decide wether or not to study a subject deeply , a decision for what a person want to be in the future must be answered carefully before . having a broad knowledge of many academic subject is really essential for our daily life . people are created to learn lot of information on aregular basis in order to coupe with the enviroment in which he life in , and a person which ha no base of knowlege can not survive within a society . for example how can a person explain to himself the idea of how the planet revolve around the sun or how the moon is able to rotate around the sun without losing it track ? or how can the sun supply the high amount of energy needed to light the earth , without learning science ! can you see , thats the diffrence between an adult and a baby . being able to use all the academic knowlege accuired during our academic study is essenciall even in our work . but goin on with this idea people will spend a lot of time and effort only to accuire broad knowlege . while having a specific subject in which a person can specialize in is very important for his work . trying too gain a deep knowlege about a subject is just great , cause why to study other subject that you donot like and miss the knowlege that can be accuired on the subject that you are not intrested in . now and by studing the subject you favour you can always gain lot of information a you wo n't be bored a this is the field of your intrest and you will keep on increasing your knowlege on and on . i really think that studing on a broad scale would be better a a person may have many field of intrest , besides he would have knowlege in other fiels of study that may help in the field that he want to specialize in a most of the study that we learn are somehow linked together in a certain way or another .
