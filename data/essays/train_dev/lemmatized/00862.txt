where i live , japan , poeple spend their vacation on travel around the world . therefore , there are many tour designed by tour company . some pepole prefer to take these tour with friend led by a tour guide , but i find more advantage that planning a tour by myself is suitable for me . therefore i disagree with this statement . of course , there are some advantage to travel led by a tour guide . for instance , people feel at ease when they are led by a tour guide who know very well about the area which they visit . also , sometimes a tour le cost to stay hotel or transpotation than pay by myself . although there are some advantage to take a tour , i definitely choose to travel by myself . the primary reason that i can cite is i can more enjoy a tour with free plan , bacause i do n't feel comfortable if i have to travel with a person who i have n't met before . it is more comfortable for me to travel alone or with friend . socondly , if i travel led by a tour , i feel i have to be punctual even though it 's my vacation , my precious day off , because i must not make a tour plan confused and get others in trouble . on the other hand , i can take my time to visit , buy something or eat nice meal a long a i want . i do n't feel guilty at all . therefore as i mentioned so far i definitely choose to travel without a tour guide otherwise i feel stressed on my precious time . i just want to enjoy and relax on my vacation effectively .
