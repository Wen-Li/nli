with great sadness i will have to say that the statement that young people these day do not give enough time to helping their community is absolutely accurate and true . the present generation ha become selfish and very goal - oriented which lead them to ignore thing that really matter such a helping one 's community . the chidren nowadays just want thing for themselves and forget about the interest of the public in general . peer pressure and pressure from the society to achieve goal have lead the present generation to forget about helping the society a a whole . these day the concept of family value , tradition and culture have lost their meaning and the young people often end up neglecting these important concept . things such a community service , helping out the old and infirm and respecting one 's parent have gradually declined and the younger generation ha become essentially selfish in nature . young people nowadays value other thing more such a spending time with friend , going for movie etc etc all of which have assumed great importance . the selfishness of the present generation is seen in the way they achieve their goal . most of them are ruthless in their manner and will stop at nothing to get what they want . very few youngster actually understand the true meaning of helping the community . the community play an important role in shaping a person-his desire , action , thought , opinion etc . all these are very much influenced by the community to which he belongs . interaction with member of our community is absolutely essential for u to grow , form opinion and most importantly , to become a better person . what is required is a change in the thinking of these youngster . they have to realise that there is nothing more important than helping one 's own community , family and society . ignoring their responsibility to their community will do more harm to them than good . it is time they realised their social and moral duty and move towards becoming good and responsible citizen .
