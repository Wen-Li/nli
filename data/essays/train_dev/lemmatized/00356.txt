whats is life without trying new thing ? well , life is all about trying new thing and improving in various field . what if thomas edison ha not invented the first light bulb ? we still would have been living in the dark . im kind of a person who like to try new thing and give them a shot . i believe that trying can make the life and the whole world a better place to live in , and yes only successful people try new thing . using risk can help you alot when you try a new thing . and it is really boring to have the same routine your whole life , life is meanless without trying new thing a they can improve your life and get it better in many way . we could have stayed on mailing our friend from other country around the world by using the mail , but it take day for the reciever to get it , but a new technology wa invented to mail your friend and keep in touch with them all the time , and this new technology is called the internet , which made the whole world like a small place where u can reach your friend and mail them all the time and they also can get the mail at the same time , the same day . so internet wa inveted in so many day and the inventor never stopped , kept trying , worked hard and he used all the risk to get what he want and what the people want to make their life better . yes , life is all about trying new thing and never stopping until you get what your goal or purpose is , and yes i totally agree with the statement of `` successfull people try new thing and take the risk rather than only doing what they already know how to do well .
