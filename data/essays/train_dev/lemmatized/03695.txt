generally speaking , i agree with the statement . in my opinion it ha gotten harder for young people to get involved in community activity . it is true that le an le young people participate in activity of their community , but there are reason to do so . first of all , i think that the expectation of a young person 's environment , especially parent and teacher , are very high nowadays . it is expected from a young person to earn good grade at school or at college , to participate in extra curricular activity to show a wide range of interest and many young people have to work after school to earn their spending money . there is not much time left to engage socially . besides , in our society young people are told everywhere to have fun rather than being socially engaged . this raise young people 's expectation a well . but i believe , that most young people can not be held responsible for wanting to live like they are told to by the medium and their environment . in other culture young people do not experience the same kind of freedom young people in the usa have . often they are told to take care of family member or friend , which is a social engagement a well . in the western civilisation the family structure and social connection have been weakened over the last decade , which might also be a reason for decreasing interest in social work . so the problem of the declining number of young people who give time to help their community is overall a societal problem , that ha to be dealt with , because there is still a necessity to encourage young people to engage socially . communites often depend on people , especially young one , who are not paid for the work they do . moreover , it can be a lot of fun , being an active part of a community . it is always a way to meet a lot of people who share your interest and it can be very inspiring to work with elderly people , for example . young people can lern a lot from them .
