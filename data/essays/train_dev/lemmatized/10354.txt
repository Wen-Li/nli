it is a common statement that today young people do not give enought time to hepling their community . although i think it is not always true , and each case should be considerated a part , i agree with this statement for several different reason . nowadays we are living in a world much more competitive than the past one wa , furthermore , family is today normally composed only by parent and son and this fact doe n't help youg people to develope their sense of comunity . firts of all , the word where we are living in is getting more and more complex : for a young person is more diffucult today to achive his or her goal , to have a successful career ad a good job in order to give safety to his or her new family . this fact implies that today there 's generally not enought time to spend on taking care of someone else , like their community . the second problem is related to the normal structure of a family . living in a such a small unit does't permit to develope , from chilhood , a sense of comunity and solidariety for other person . if someone is used to live in a family with many brother and sister , and also grandparent , uncle and aunt , he would be maybe more sensitive to the problem of the others . in conclusion , i have to agree with the statement that sais that today yong people do n't spend much time on hepling their community for the reason that i explained before . i 've said `` i have to agree '' because i think this is not a positive fact , and it give a bad idea about young people , but , with sorry , i have to say that this is the truth .
