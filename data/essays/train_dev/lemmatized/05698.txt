advertisements as a part of system i surely agree that advertisement make product seem much better than they really are . however this is not simply caused by advertisement . it is also related to the capitalist system and marx 's idea of commodity fetishism . by those process , peole easily see those thing more beautiful then they actually are . first of all i want to describe the basic consequence of commodity fetishism . people by caring more about the exchange value of commodity instead of their use value , get integrated to the system . marx argues that by this way people are controlled by commodity that they actually had created . i think this is the basic feature which underlies why and how advertisement make product seem much better . if people were not a part of the system and were not controlled by the commodity , they would n't be buying thing that actually do not need . however by living in the system they do n't care for the real feature and use value of thing . a person who really and only care about the use value of a product would n't be atrracted by the commodity which are now seem much better than they actually are . advertisement can give them more value because the system allows simple product to act a they have a real value independent from people . if those condition were not available , no matter how good or succesfull an advertisement is , it could n't show a product much better . because without those condition there would n't be a human consciousness which would perceive them better than they are . if only the use value could be cared by people advertisement would even not be on stage . so when i say that i surely agree with the assumption it is because of those underlying feature . for commodity to control people , the system need the advertisement in order to manipulate people more effectively . so a the system is still exercised and work properly all of it part should also be working properly . and a the advertisement is a part of the system , it ha also make it job and show product better than they really are .
