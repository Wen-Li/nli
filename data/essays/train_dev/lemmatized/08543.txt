i would rather think than traveling in group and led by a tour guide is the best way to miss what can be thrilling in discovering new country or place around the world . the reason for which people choose to travel this way hide what they usually feel a a great delusion at the end of their trip . experience of travel ha to go through such kind of delusion to discover it true identity . first , one of the favorite reason for people to prefer a guide is that they are afraid to `` miss '' anything . things ( museum , building , an so on ) `` have to '' be seen . such a way of thinking assumes that thing which are vital need to be known from the largest part of people . but what one ca n't miss is what chance help him to discover . sreets or building we love in peculiar city reflect our personnal relationship to these city and that is more important than to remember vaguely building a if we only saw them in guide book . what i do n't want to miss when i travel is the progressive link that i build with part of a city wether they are in guide book or not . that ca n't be planified . also , people feel more secure when they travel in group or when they follow an experimented guide . although this can be a strong reason in some part of the world , i personnallly appreciate when a trip contains a bit of danger because danger is a significant part of the pleasure to travel . when one want to reduce danger to a minimum , excitation disappears at the same time . not to be the master of a situation is one the major reason to travel and this go from the foreign language to real danger . last , to travel in group is often considered a more interesting because of the possibility to share an experience with other people and because of the diversity of point of view . but is n't it another way to miss the only truly significant different point of view , that is the point of view of people from another country ? i prefer to travel alone because it obliges me to meet people instead of staying inside of a familiar cultural environment . once one 's in a group , one ca n't escape the group .
