i totally agree with the statement that ` successful people try new thing and take risk rather than only doing what they already know how to do well . ' let me start it by supporting myself with a saying - ' winners dont do different things , they do things differently ' . history give ample example of people who chose a different pathway for them altogether to achieve succes in what they believed . taking risk come in way of trying out at new thing . of course people are worried because of unseen worry by selecting a path le travelled . quoting name of few people hailing from different region of society and from different discipline but successful in there deed - mahatma gandhi , elbert einstein , wright brother , henry ford , bill gates , sachin tendulkar , michael schumacher . all these people achieved success . success doe not only come from a study oriented field which is clear from the example stated above . every one is not created with a same bent of mind , there are people wgo are strong in sport and other extra curricular activity . they perform well in those field but only if they choose to take a risk of choosing a track different from the usual . there lie the risk but it is only psychological if they are ready to work gard towards it . who said success cant be achieved in sport ? who said freedom could not be achieved with non violence ? no one choosing to do a regular task would believe the fact that a brick layer 's son ( michael schumacher ) would be a success synonym with car racing . ideas develop in thought and thought have to differ to develop new idea , and wright brother are perfect example for that - noone thought of flying in air but their different approach led to the gretest invention of all time - the aeroplane . all these factor sum upto a success story . new thing and idea and taking risk only lead to development .
