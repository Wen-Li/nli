nowadays young people are more concerned about their ownself than helping their community . everyone is becoming selfish and mean . they see only their benefit and not the others . for them , social life is important till the time it give them enjoyment and self satisfaction . after the satisfaction is over they turn to some other place where they have reason to go . when young people do n't find any reason that give them some benefit , they will not turn to that side also where others want some help . i have realised this from my personal experience . once i thought to teach some student from my colony . specifically those who are staying in our neighbourhood and have problem in studying . i told my friend about the same and asked her to help me in the matter . she laughed at me and said she would prefer doing something which will pay me and will give more enjoyment . i didnt listen to her and started a common class at my home for my nieghbourhood child . i tierd improving their reading skill in which all were lacking . by reading anyone can go anywhere in the world without hesitation , can gain knowledge about various topic . . reading is an important factor which mostly parent and teacher overlook . it should be a general habit of every student which student dont realise in elementary class . teenagers are more concerned about the party and club but least bothered about the people around u . the attitude of is so rude towards elder and even youngers . we are educated and talented so we should take the best output from our education and knowledge by helping others . young generation coming up should think about others also , if not the whole world then atleast a minor part near to them to make some change and improvement in the system . young people are the future of the country leading to the world ' future . i do agree that young people nowadays donot give anough time to help their communites and this can be changed only if an individual want to change .
