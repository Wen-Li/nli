who doe n't know advertisement for for sporting article , like nike or adidas or for car , like the new mercedes or simply for food , like milk ? in these advertisement the product are looking always good or are n't they ? so the question what i want to discus now is , if the advertisement make product seem much better , than they really are . on the one hand i think that the product that are advertised are very , very bad , because it is often shown only the whole article and in most of the case never the detail . you only have to look at the case of food , because there are often pesticide found , when this food get tested in labor . i think everybody can remember the chocolate chaos at the big supermarket hofer in austria . also the advertisement of car look always superb , but in reality there are so many failure , a i have seen on the car of my father . with this car we always had problem , because the electric wa not well working . as a result of these failure there will also be danger for human be affected , from the bad technic , a well a from the underaverage bad food . but on the other hand i think , that the product , which are shown in an advertisement are really a good a they seem , because behind this product it is very often a lot of innovation . who doe n't know the nike air system in shoe ? it wa a simple development in the past , but today still work , because the people know , that this is a good a in the advertisement . moreover i think , that product , which have been tested for long term by the company , will increase more and more on quality and finally it is possible to itentify this product with the advertisement . as a conclusion i would say , that neot everybody should look only at the advertisement .
