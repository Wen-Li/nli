some say that life is a long long and endless road until it reach death . therefore , life doe n't only end when one get old . people usually think that old people are boring and lifeless because of their weakness and lack of physical action . however , older people tend to develop their mental inteligence and imagination . tha't why most of the philosopher and mathematician reach a peak a their carreer when they are old . as a consequence , they do enjoy life by using their mental power in order to succeed in different field , or by writting and thinking about life in general . but do young people enjoy life more than older people do ? i personally do not think it is the case . young people tend to look at life in a more material way , playing in park , having a girlfriend , practising sport , therefore , they do not appreciate the deep meaning of why they are living . it is mainly due to the lack of culture and experience . by growing up they will develop their sense of observing thing and therefore , trully appreciate the meaning of the life they are living . i saw once a film by a canadian director ( denys arcand ) named `` the barbaric invasion '' that talk about all of the barbaric invasion that come to meet u in life . the main caracter , an old man , look past his life : the different book he read , the different woman he slept with . . therefore , becomes furious of not being able to enjoy the thing he used to do when he wa young , he finally decides to commit suicide . this if a good example to show that there are old people that do not enjoy themselves , and to support the idea that the peak of a lifetime is when being young . i think that every person can enjoy life to the fullest , whether young or old , by doing the thing he enjoys doing the most . that is when he can reach a mental satisfaction , by dedicating himself to the true meaning of life that is to enjoy life .
