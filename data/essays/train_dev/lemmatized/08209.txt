people are always trying to achieve success in their life . no everyone will be a successful person because it might involve many personal characterists . i really agree that a successful person is someone who try new thing and take risk . jason , a friend of mine , is a good example of a person who try new thing . jason wa unhappy with what he wa doing in his job , then he decided to quit it and open his own bussiness . for many year he saved his money and after last summer he decided to run his own office . he oppened a new kind of drug-store that i have never seen before . his client buy medication over the phone without having to leave their house , everything is done over the phoner or via email and all merchandise are delivered at people 's door . jason ha been so successful with this new bussiness that he is thinking about to open another drug-store . he made last month more than three thousand dollar . a successful person is someone who take risk . maria , my friend from my medical school , is another good example of a successful person . she graduated a a doctor in 1995 and since there she actuelly never worked a a doctor . instead , she prefered to run her own company . she started selling medical equipment to big hospital and started importing medical supply from united states . she took a huge risk on her hand by leaving a career a a doctor to become a simple seller is a big risk , but she didnt care about it . now she manager the biggest medical supply company in south america and she became a rich and prosper bussiness woman . to sum up , being a successful person in life requires some particular personal characteristic . a successful person is someone who thing about new idea and make this idea work , but not only that , a successful person is also someone who take risk even this can ruin his/her intire life .
