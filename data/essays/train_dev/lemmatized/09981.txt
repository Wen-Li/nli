i agree to the statement that ' the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide ' . the best reason to put forth is of the knowledge the guide ha because he ha been to the place earlier and know a lot many thing about the place . if i were to plan a trip with my friend the first thing to do would be to hire a guide . many reason can be put forth for choosing a guide to help u through the trip , primary reason being his knowledge of local place . if i were to book a hotel i would n't know the pricing and also to get to place , hiring a transport could be a big problem . the guide come in handy for he know the most economical place to stay in and also these day we see guide getting into contract with local driver to help traveller have the option having their own transport to see the various place of visit . i have recently come across a travel arrangement company that ha their own dedicated staff a a guide for helping the traveller have a memorable experience . the guide being local to the place have a good knowledge of the local place of visit and would help u getting a good feel of the local culture by showing u the place that show the true local culture . even there are place of eating where we can see the real taste of the place . these can be only be visited if have a person guiding u to these place . often a guide is like a local friend helping u in staying at the best hotel at an economlical price , eating the best food , visiting the best place . i would like to end the topic by stating that the guide is the best person who can make our visit exciting and helping u out in planning the trip with only a little monetary cost .
