some people beleive that young people enjoy life more than older people do . others beleive that older people enjoy life more than young people . i beleve that young people enjoy life more than older people , i have some point suggests my opinion . first , young people have healthier body than older people and this help young people to reveal the world by traveling every year to a new country with a new adventure while older people do not have the ability to travel too much so they prefer staying at home . second , somebody may say that older people can do whatever they want their sequence day because they are retired from their work so they are not busy . but still young people beside working and getting tired they can go outside every day like shopping going restaurant enjoy playing many sport like tennis , soccer , and basketball . young people 's life is so interesting while the older people are so bored third , young people have the ability to read more and to reveal new knowlege , while most of the older people must wear glass and sometimes they get confused to read the word and to see them clear . also the older people are more angry and nervous while the young people are not . sadly , every individual will grow and rise till the death , i mean that the young people will reach the level of eldness , so i advise the young people to enjoy their life before getting older .
