i agree with the view that it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subject than to specialize in one specific subject . of course , i understand that some people think it is more desirable to concentraring on one specific subject . in my opinion , however , obtaining broad knowledge is better for the following two reason . first reason supporting my idea is about practical aspect . these day our society ha large number of social problem to solve . i believe that we have to get broader and more knowledge which is required to appropriately deal with the problem . in order to strrugle with the tangled social problem , we must have broad knowledge of many academic subject . for example , contemporary society ha environmental problem globally . when we make effort to find a solution to this kind of problem , for instance , global warming , we have to utilize the knowedge , finding and theory not only in the area of natural science but also social science . in sum up , we have to study biology , ecology , natural history , law , economics , politics , and so on . thinking this way , we find that it is much more important to study variety of discipline broadly to solve the actual social problem . second of all , i think that we cannnot learn one specific subject well without broad knowledge of many subject . personally , more often than not , i can get someting about one subject when i study another subject . for example , when i learned mathmatics , i understood platos philosophical theory . in this way , we often get profound knowledge about a certain subject while studing another subject . that is why , i think it is helpful for getting special knowledge for these reason , i think it is better to know wide range of academic subject .
