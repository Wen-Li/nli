it is better to specialize in one specific subject . i have a some rasons for my opinion . first , to specializde in one specific subject is very usefull to get a job . for example , when you want to be a carpenter , if you learn about carpenter specifficaly , you can be a carpenter easier than you learn broad knowledge , because you learn deeply about carpenter , and also corpenter doe not need too much broad knowledge . second , to have broad knowledg let you take more time to learn than to specialize in one specific subject . so it is very serious problem for people , because thier graduation will be late , and time to get a job become more late . third , to specialize in one specific subject save cost to learn . for example , if you have broad knowledge , you have to take much money for many textbook to lean all of them . in contrast , if you want to specialize in one subject , you can get few textbook about just the subject . so you do not have to much money to get staff for learning . in conclusion , it is good to specialize in one specific subject because of getting job and saving time and cost . it is vey important reason .
