i think young people do not have to take more time for the community . so i disagree with this . there are 2 reason why i disagree . the first one is the increase number of the old people . and the second one is working hard for the community without no money is not a good idea . first , there are too many old people in this world . that mean there is not enough young people to help in the community , especially in japan . almost 25 percent of the population in japan is the old people . so adult say the young people must help the community more often , but that will be too many job for the young people . there will not be enough young people to do the job . so i do not think making the young people work more for the community is not the best idea . second , working for the community without no money is not good for the young people . there are many young people who do not have a job and having a hard time to live without their money . so working without the payment from the country or from some company , it will not be a good time for the young people . because many young people want some job for their life . so if old people need some help from the young people for the community , they should give them some payment . thus , because of the increase of the old people and no money to the young people for the work in the community , i think young people do not have to help for the community more often .
