cars are the indispansible part of our life . i ca n't imagine how life would be if there were n't any car . they are like the member of our family . because people like car even more than it used to be . they are trying to make their car more comfortable and beautiful since they spend so many time at road . some people consider that car wo n't be the part of our life in twenty year because the oil reserve of the world is decreasing very rapidly . so maybe only rich people will be using car in the future . can you imagine this , maybe there wo n't be traffic jam . and also this is not a real proof . i think we wil be more dependent on car in the future because our life is changing in so many way . the density of population is considerably increasing . so these people will need car to go somewhere . i am totally disagree about the idea that we will use le car in twenty year because people have began to use new source instead of petrol such a biodisel and electrycity . from my point of view that will help humanity to save the environment since that doe n't give harm to environment like petrol . and also technolgy is still trying to develope new kind of thing to support car to work . what is more , what will the people do if there will be fever car . are we going to fly or something like that . i think what is said about this is not based on scientific evidence because we need car and we will drive them at least a hundred year . we can also say that the woman driver are more than in the past and they will be more in the future than now . so the factory take these kind of thing in to account . nevertheless they do n't seem to stop producing car . to sum up , i believe that car are the part of our life and people do n't seem to leave them for a long time . although the bad impact of car to the environment we ca n't disregard how useful they are .
