some people believed that older people enjopy life le than young people , because the young people are active , erengetic and maybe have more time . but in my opinion , it is not ture , there are at least three reason for my believe . first of all , most older people have their clear goal for their life , after more experience , they know more the more meaning of life , and know themselves more . then they could easily choose their type of ilves based on the real surroundings . it is exciting and meaningful thing to churse up the goal they have . so they will feel enjjoyful during the time to get goal . another important reason of my believe is that the older people have more chance to do the thing they want , because they have ability to arrange their time and have enough money to help the ti \ hing they want come true . for instance , many people like travling , no matter young people or older one , but the young people it is much more difficult to have a comfort trip than older people . obveriously , the young must face to much problem , the last but no least reason for me is the older people experience more will understand more fact of the problem in everyday life , they can easilly face to the bad thing which can not change , avoid bad thing before it happened , solve the problem which had been happened . on the other hand , older people cherish the beautiful moment more than the young people , because they understand it is difficult to have the changce . so in front of the real life , even bad thing happened , older people will have more enjoythings to do
