the definition of a successful person , is that he is an expertise in all field . success always drive people to try out newer avenue and newer field , doing a mundane , monotonous job will never lead to path of success . therefore , i completely agree with the fact that people should try out newer thing and take risk to go ahead in life . we can look at this by taking few example . if a person is a science student , who doe research work on various kind of protein , etc . and he need to keep a track of his work and record all his work , then by learning computer he can arrange , save , retrive his data properly . even though it cost him some effort and time to learn , the person should go ahead a , it give him better taste of success in his work . another example is that of , of making choice of choosing a career in a newer field , which had not been developed that much presently , example that of stem cell research , but in long run this is going be the major one in curing the genetic disorder . so the person can take risk of entering this field , which will surely fetch him success . furthermore , when it come to bussiness people , they got to try newer thing and take risky decision , since thats how great bussiness tycoon have grown up . coming to investing in share market , is also a risky job , since you never know status of share the very next minute , but the one trying to take risk never go back , since he is craving for success . finally , by looking at all the above example , i can confidently state that successful people are always on a try out for newer thing and willing to accept risk , since it the taste of success that is more important in one life .
