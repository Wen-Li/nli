it is hard to say that which one is better . but if i were given a chance to choose one of them , i would rather to say that it is more important for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact because understanding idea and concept are more beneficial than learning fact . let 's shed some light on the disadvantage of learning fact . it can be misleading information only if the fact is an exception of the idea and concept . for example , let 's assume that some frog are dark brown but most frog are green . if a child look at the dark brown frog , he of she might consider all frog a dark brown frog . as this example , wrong information may be worse than not knowing . also , it ha small advantage which is that people learn more vividly . on the other hand , to understand idea and concept help people understand fact more . if someone ha no idea about specific idea and concept , he or she might not be able to catch that which idea of concept belong to the fact . unlikely , if i understood some idea and concept , i could handle the fact better . from my experience , when i wa on camping , i needed a fire . i realized that i forgot to bring a liter . then , i could make a fire easily with glass because i understood the concept of light reflection . it wa very useful . i wa proud myself . as all is concerned , i prefer to understand idea and concept . in my opinion it advantage always overweigh the advantage of to learn fact .
