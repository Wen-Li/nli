young people enjoy life more than older people do i am truley agree with this statement . i support this statement because young people are with full of energy and power to enjoy and celebarte each of their day a a festiwal . on the contrast old people have little energy to enjoy . as time paases the old people are become le energetic , emotionally weak and depend on young people in every aspect of life . another reason , i support this statement is young people are full of sprit a they have not seen the hardship of life and they have the companion or a partner to enjoy with them , on the other hand , old people have seen many problem and they usually stay alone a their partner are not with them or their child are far away . they either are studying or they left them alone in long journey of life . furthermore , the young people are well in every aspect such a health . they are also independent finencially . whereas old people they are not healthy socially and a well a mentally and they have to depend finencially on others . and in the last i would say because of changing pattern of life the true meanig of enjoyment is lost . now a day people are become very materialstic and parctical and they try to within themselves . but in older time people used to enjoy with others and were very social . last but not the least to enjoy life age is not the limitaion , you should have tendency to enjoy ever aspect of life . and young people should take care of their elder and try to enjoy with them also
