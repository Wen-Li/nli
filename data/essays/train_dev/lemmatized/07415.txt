i agree that the best way to travel is in a group with a tour guide if the destination is one that 's new to you . if one is visiting a country for the first time , and especially if one doesnt know how to speak the native language , and is completely unfamiliar with the visiting location , it is best to go with a tour guide . tour guide are very qualified and have a lot of knowledge about the country 's history , custom , food , tradition , culture and must-see monument . they also provide useful help regarding hotel and good eating and entertainment location . this is very beneficial because not only one see and experiment a new country , but also one get to know about it , to grow a a person and a a citizen , expanding one 's horizon getting to see more than meet the eye , experiencing the history of the place , the way people behave and live in that specific place , one get to feel embraced by the country and it culture in a way that engages you to it , in a way you 'll never forget and hardly will experience again . the first time i visited italy and learned about it artist , it culture , music and history i fell in love with it , the first time i got to interact with it people i wa certain i would come back one day and live the rest of my life there , in italy , in rome . .. i learned that there 's more to italy than a colliseum , there 's more than the language and there 's more than the famous ` gondola ' to it , it 's what 's behind all those creation , the thought , the magic , the inspiration and the passionate drive what make that country so beautiful , passionate and perfect in my eye . that 's why i belive it is better to travel with a tour guide , it take you farther , you get to travel not only with your body , but with your heart and mind . however , if the destination is a place one 's already familiar with , and specially if one 's traveling with a partner , or in a honeymoon , it would be much more comfortable to go a a couple , without any tour guide , rediscovering the country by one 's own mean and visiting the place one want to visit , not necessarily the most visited and popular place , but for instance , one 's favorite restaurant , one that probably not much people know about , but that it 's excellent and brings back beautiful memory . also if one 's traveling with the whole family , especially with small kid , it would be very difficult to pay attention to the tour guide without being interrupted by a tantrum and fight between brother and sister , so it would not be the best idea to go with a tour guide . for instance , i am from venezuela even though i 'm living in the us , and i think i know pretty much everything about my country , so visiting my country with a tour guide wouldnt make much sense to me , since i already know it and the place i like to visit and that are so special to me , and it would only take time from me visiting my best friend and my family , all of whom live there , and since my point of visiting would be to see my friend and family again , having a tour guide would only be an obstacle in the way of enyoying my trip , therefore it wouldnt be beneficial for me in any sense . to conclude , i think it a great idea to visit a country with a tour guide if that place is new to you and you would like to know and learn about it , nurturing your mind . however if it a place that 's already familiar to you , it would be much more enyoyable to go with a partner and enjoy the country a you know it .
