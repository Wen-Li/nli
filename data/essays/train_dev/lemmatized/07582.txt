i agree with the statement that it is more important for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact . the purpose of education in a particular field is to provide the student with a generic framework of idea and concept . the student understands these idea and concept and applies them to complex real world scenario to provide solution to problem or to contribute effectively in an industry . mere knowledge of fact doe not enable the student to solve problem . let u consider education in the field of fluid mechanic a an example . a student learning concept and idea of fluid flow can utilize his knowledge to simulate flow of oil in well and reservoir and thus contribute to the oil and gas industry . if he doe not have fact and figure he can easily procure them from a library or even the internet . on the other hand a student who merely memoizes fact and figure may not be in a position to undersatnd their significance in real world scenario and hence of no value to the industry . it is human nature to remember and appreciate complex form of information if they are logical . concepts and idea help the student to visualize the problem in a logical way a compared to mere fact and figure . consider for example the study of ecosystem for extinction of certain specie . a student who understands the idea and concept of an ecosystem and how a generic eco system work can clearly analyze why a particular specie in an ecosystem is becoming extinct at a faster rate than in another ecosystem . on the other hand a student who ha learnt just fact and figure of ecosystem find it difficult to apply his knowledge extensively to analyze solve complex problem in his field . thus we see that by having a good understanding of concept and idea enables u to solve real world problem in a more effective manner . thus we conclude that the purpose of education can be best achieved by giving more importance to understanding of concept and idea then just fact .
