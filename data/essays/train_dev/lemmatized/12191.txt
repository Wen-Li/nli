i would agree with the following statement that `` it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subject than to specialize in one specific subject '' . if we learn many academic subject it increase our knowledge by having a good command on all subject . there are many myriad reason to support the above statement . if many academic subject are studied then we can gather more information about any subject and we can be brave ourselves in facing any problem or question regarding a particular subject if asked by anyone . good research can be done on any subject by picking one subject from different academic subject what we have learnt . if any topic is concerned to some other subject what we have learnt then we can have an idea . the main reason of having broad knowledge of many academic subject is that we can settle in any of the field i.e in a good job related to the subject what we have learnt . if a person specializes in only one subject then he can become expert only in that particular subject and ha poor knowledge if the question are asked apart from his subject . so in this world day by day the knowledge is increasing a lot so the people should also have keen interest in increasing their knowlegde to the peak level . otherwise they ca n't compete with the student now a day . each and every student should have broad knowledge of many academic subject to settle in their life . it is considered a important part to the student life by not sticking to only on subject and becoming expert in that one and only one subject . having broad knowledge to discover many thing in many subject add success to our life like the way scientist do . so good knowledge in different subject lead to good maturity among different subject . in this way i agree to the statement to have broad knowledge and not to specialize in only one specific subject .
