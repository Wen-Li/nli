i agree that young people enjoy life more than older people do . unfortunatly , i sometimes hear that elder people are bored in their daily life . there are some reason why i think young people enjoy life more tahn older people do . first , young people have a lot of energy to move their body . some of them enjoyed suports , travering , and working . they can do many activity . even though they are tired , they sometimes continue moving without enough rest . if they sleep well , they will be fine the next day . furthermore , many of them do not have serious health problem . many elder people have something health problem , even though they are healthy life . because they have been older , it is natural thing . many young people do not have health problem which elder people ha . in addition , the life style between young people and elder people are different . when i visited a retirement home , an activety director said , if i could come there a much a i could , it would be helpful for them to escape from boring time . they usually stay in the home because it is hard for them to go out by themselves . therefore , if they do not have any outside activity , they spend their time on a sofa to watch tv . however , young people can go anywhere and anytime by themselves . they can choose how they act on their daily life , but for elder people , they can not have the kind of choice . these reason show young people tend to enjoy their life more than elder people do . young peple have some benefit to enjoy their life more than elder people , so they should enjoy their life . if young people provide enjoyable life for elder people , the elder people have more enjoyable life than they used to have .
