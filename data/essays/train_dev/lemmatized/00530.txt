different people have different answer to this statement . it depends on the person 's personality , perferences and character . those people who have more working experience will think that the advertisement make product seem much better than they really are . i hold this view point too . first of all , company hair many movie star , famous singer , a well a those politicans to sing high praise for the product . consumers will think the product will a good a those star , because they wo n't hire those unfimilar people to the mass . but actually , will those product ' quality is a good a those star ? i think most of the time the answer is no . we should judge the product quality by experient or by our experience . second , most advertisement use a lot of fancy method to attract consumer . they use television , radio , magazine , newspaper and internet to attract them . these kind of mass medium can give the reader more colorful and lively demonstration . it exceed the original product and give the consumer the fake idea . third , most advertisments express their idea with too much good word . we all have the experience that we were introduced a kind of product by the advertisments that their product is the best in all of the same product , their product can be us more than 100 year , the car they sold is the cheapest . but what is the truth , maybe it is a very bad product .
