i agree that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their community . being young myself , i can mirror my experience and provide reason why young people are not giving enough time to help their community . first of all , it a competitive world these day . the day the child is born , the parent of the child start preparing a road map for their child and before the child can understand anything about life he is on his way to reach that perfect goal . in the run for that ultimate achievement , he get so occupied in his own struggle that he forgets that there 's a community also which need his service . as he struggle harder he get more and more self centered . in the fast pace of today world , when everything is getting nucleated , people are loosing touch with each other and that is one big reason the young people are finding le and le time to help their community . another similar reason is that a the world is becoming smaller and globalised , people are moving from their native place to newer destination for job or personal reason . this shift make them loose touch with their community a they struggle to get absorbed in the new place . with successive generation , they get farther and farther from their native culture and community and at the same time they do not feel one with the new community they become a part of and because of this reason they are not able to contribute fully to the new community also . furthermore , there ha been a degradation in moral these day . the spirit of community over oneself ha given way to more selfish aspiration . one factor that i would ascribe to this degradation is lack of interest on the part of parent to teach their child properly and give them lesson in community work . as the parent themselves are occupied in their life they forget to teach their child a lesson or two about community service . finally , there ha been a growing tendency among youngster to look at the government for welfare work . they feel it is the government 's duty to help in the development of community . they do not actively participate because of their expectation from the government . what is required rather is a more active role from young people in helping their community and realising their duty towards the community .
