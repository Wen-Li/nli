i am definetly agree .... we all love watching tv , every time we saw the new advertisement we get excited at least i know my self i do . .. even i do not need that stuff stilll i want to have it . i think it is in our natura , we all same . .. television make them more desirable of course ,,,, also i think those people they know their business , you know what i think that way because they are succesful , because they make the people buy more and more ,,,, for example couple month ago i have seen some commercial on the tv . i went to shopping to the mall . and than i have got whatever i saw at tv . i took them home of course i start to use them after couple of week later they had so big scratch on it . ( it wa a cookware set ) they were not like this . when i bougth them it started after i ued them , please listen to this on the that commercial about that stuff : it is stainles , very good ,,,,,,,,, of course it wa baloney ,, i trusted that commercial and than i went to buy that stuff . otherwise i would not but it . they can be tricky some time that is why we should not trust them but not that much ,,, we still check them every once for a while ,,,, like i said before we buy something we all have be very carefully . otherwise sometimes our money can go for nothing . after i had my cookware i took them back , and than i told them , `` that is not nice , you can not take adventage of people like this '' they knew i got mad . but no problem i could return it , i got my moey back . of course they asked receit , first thing , i showed it to them . the i got back home it wa relief , this wa lesson before i buy something i will be carefull again
