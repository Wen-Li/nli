i do not agree with this statement . in my opinion it is much more important to be good in one specific subject then to know a litte about many subject . so i think you do not need any people who know a little about everything . they are not valuable to the academic issue . for example it need to find a solution on a problem that is much specific , like improving social condition . there you need no knowledge about global warming or the different planet on the milkyway . on the other hand you need no knowledge of the social structure if you want to find a solution of global warming . so in my opinion our society need specialist and no allrounders without a deeper knowledge of a specific subject . of course it would be nice if you are a specialist on a subject but also know something about the other topic . but firstly you need to get the special knowledge of one thing before you may care about other issue . there is no goal in knowing a little about everything . the people who know a litte about everything can participate on conversation about certain topic but they are not valuable to solve problem which need a higher level of knowledge . every part of society need specialist . even our chancellor ha her specialist who are involved in the problem which belong to their field of knowledge . so specialist are the most important people in every government , company and even family . so for me it is important to become similar with one subject what mean becoming a specialist . this is the reason why i disagree with this statement . specialist on academic topic keep the world spinning around . withouth those guy there could not be found any solution for problem which require a high level of knowledge .
