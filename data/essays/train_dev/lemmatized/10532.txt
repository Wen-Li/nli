it is hard to agree or disagree with such a statement . in my opinion it is obviously a double edge statement . first of all it depends on the way one may define the expression `` successful people '' . what doe `` being successful '' mean ? someone who doe something well is successful . howvever it is true that if you understand the expression `` successful people '' a being rich then the statement might be relevant . let 's take the example of financial market . the more risk you take the more money you can earn . this is what is happening nowadays and what can explain the growing number of financial mecanisms . the success , or the money here , is considered a a counterpart of th risk one may have taken . it doe n't necessarily mean that people who simply do what they already know to do well are not successful , in fact it mean that one may become even more successful taking risk . nevertheless , in this case success is not assured . and the statement is a double edge one in that sense a well . the more risk you take the more you can loose . as a consequence the statement could turn out to be reversed . finally , taking risk is even different from trying new thing . trying new thing is not necessarily very risky . and successful in this case could be understood a `` recognized '' , by society for example . for instance , an inventor . someone who invents object or who discovers phenomenas , because he is very smart and because he ha tried to go beyond what he already knew , will be considered a a successful person and will be recognized and remembered a a successful person . as a conclusion , i would say the relevance of the statement depends on the definition one can give to the word and the way you understand it .
