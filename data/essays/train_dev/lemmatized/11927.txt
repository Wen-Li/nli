with the television and the others mass medium in the last 50 's year we had seen a development of the advertisement . the advertisement is used to improve the market of a good , but in a fair market the advertisement can not be false , the adrevrtisement ha to show the good in a realistic way . it is troue tought that most advertisement make product seem much better than they really are , but the point is that the product is the same but there is under , uncovered , a communication game that can change the perception of the peaple , sametimes is a music , sametimes the combination of the color , other time the situation that is rappresented . so , the point is not the quality of the product , but how you feel when you have that product . i think that customer have to know that advertisement sametime change the real importance of a product , that there is a psicologically game under the advertisement . is important understand how the information is real and what is fair in the market and if is fair that advertisement make product seem much better than they really are . the most important example i think is the cigarette advertisement , this can show u how a bad good , nocive for our healty , is trasmetted like a good product . i think that everybady should think before buy something .
