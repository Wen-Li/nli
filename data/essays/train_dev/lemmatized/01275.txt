the issue at hand is whether in twenty year there will be fewer car in use a compared to today . the issue is important considering the social , technological and environmental factor governing life on the planet . i disagree with the statement , a i believe that the car might increase in number comparitively . one reason why i disagree is owing to the social factor such a economic condition of people , standard of living etc . . people are increasing in number , their taste and preferenceas are changing , their living condition are also subjected to continuous change , most importantly the standard of living ha been changing . for example a normal clerk would go for a two wheeler to save for the rainy day but the same person would like to live a luxurious life , purchase a car when he ha saved enough and ha fulfilled his responsibility twenty year down the line . another factor is the population growth . as the population increase more and more people might purchase car . m oreover a car provides more safer and secure mean of transport a compared to moped , autorickshaws etc.keeping in view the growing traffic , road accident and other mishap , people who can afford will psychologically tend towards owning a car . the technologival development in the field of automobile will help evolve faster car , fully automated , eco friendly and thus gear up the purchase of car a people will try to keep pace with the fast world ahead . the economic conditons of people will also take a leap twenty year from now and owning a car will no longer be a prerequisite of the rich . thus in conclusion i would like to claim that there will be more car in future than today considering the various factor discussed .
