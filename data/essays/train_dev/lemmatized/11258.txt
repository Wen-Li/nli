i believe most advertisement make product seem better than they really are . this is because the kind of thing shown in advertisement do not take account of real life condition , also to differentiate product from other competitor they are hyped for their goodness . firstly advertisement make product seem better than they really are because when advertisement is made they do not account the real life condition . for example when an advertisement of a bike is shown the advertiser do not take into the account of braking , stopping , idling of the bike when they show the mileage of the bike which is most of the time never turn out to be actually achievable at all . with hyped mileage quoted in the advertisement the product in this case the bike seems to be a better than it is really a it can not deliver the quoted mileage of advertisement . secondly company intentionally make good advertisement of their product than they really are to differentiate their product from the other product which are available of other company . by doing this they try to create a branding and a niche of their product which is very much smiliar to the other product . take for example laptop company like acer , hp which show about the ease of work , graphic display which would not cause eye strain . but in actuality it doe it and is very similar to the other product . ultimately advertisement make product seem much more better than they really are .
