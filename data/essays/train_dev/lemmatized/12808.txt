i agree with the statement that young people enjoy life more than older people do . in my view there are a variety of argument to support this statement : first of all young people do not have a much duty a older people have . the do not really have to think about how to feed their family or how to raise and educate their child . consequently in my opinion young people have a lot more flexibility . for example when i want to go on holiday to visit some of my friend in spain and can do it . as a unmarried student i do not have to ask a wife or a bos for the permission . furthermore young people have more leisure time . you can not compare the time people spend at work with the time young people have to be present in school or university . even when preparation time is added a regular job take far more time . according to my personal experience my leisure time and especially my holiday are twice a long a those from my father . moreover young people are often in a better condition than older people . for me it is important to do a much sport a possible . i really enjoy to keep myself in shape and to train a lot . with regard to my father or my grandfather i noticed that older people are often injured or can not accomplish their own expectation . i recognized that this fact is every disappointing especially for my grandfather who had been an excelent sportsman . taking everything into account i think that my year at school and university would propably be the best of my entire life . therefore i am a little bit scared of growing older and be confronted with the presented disadvantage .
