i think that economical growth is strictly connected to improvement in people 's creativity , that lead to new innovative solution . i think that experiment can turn a man into a successful person . for example , when i arrived in my current newsroom a law reporter , the rivalry with my collegues spurred me to find new solution in order to reach better result . i suddenly noticed that my older coworker were too attached to obsolete idea and were not really interested in radical improvement , but i went forward with my idea . i tried new type of telecommuting , from internet to laptop to digital photo camera in order to provide my article in real time . the outcome wa amazing : the productivity increase of 60 % and we were able to print more page with better article , thanks to the new speed of working . one time i had to take high risk that , fortunately , turn out in amazing result . i used undercover brand new tecniques , unknown in the history of the journalism in asti , my hometown , and i could unveil the biggest political scandal ever occured there . ten actor were provided with bug and i eavesdropped drug bargain between a well-known mobster and a group of corrupted politician . a prosecutor , on the base of the evidence collected by me and my assistant , took a successful judiciary action against these criminal . however , sometimes an experiment of new thing can turn into a failure . before wright 's brothers , a lot of scientist tried to built a plane but they died during the tryout of the device . and some inventor , like antonio meucci , did n't reach success . infact , he actually invented the telephone but the merit wa taken but another person , graham bell . in conclusion , i keep to strongly believe that being open-minded is always a success , even if it doe n't make you richer or
