knowledge is an ocean whoose depth increase a you go deeper . so , it is next to impossible for a human being to have a complete expertise over any subject all what a person can do is have a good approach towards a topic so a to have the best available information about it . in my opinion it is always good have an idea of vairious academic streames and then cofine your study to a particular one when you have acquired a elementary knowledge of many . it is very important to have fundamental of variegated discipline , even if it doe n't relate to you . take an example of curriculum followed by the junior high and high school where a student get to learn almost all most all possible field of study right from science to econonics to language and history . this help to decide what field you may take up in your future . having a knowledge of different type of feilds expose you to experiment . you can use your knowledge for relating two different aspect of study . moreover it creats channel for the exchange of idea . else how do you expect an electronics engineer to have a discussion with an automobile engg or a computer technical . we have real life example like leonaordo da vinci , albert einstein . who have knowledge of multiple feilds like science , art , philosophy and have still proved to be genius in what they did . focussing on one single aspect through out your lifetime will lead to a wan and gloomy lifestyle with le interest to learn at a point of time in our life . whereas interaction with vairious particular will help you discover and energetic to learn . having a broad knowledege of many academic subject doe n't not signify specialsing in all of them but it definetly boost you to come out of the nutshell of a particular filed . learning is a process which ha no end so one must keep working towards the expansion of his ` ken ' . expertising any particular area doe n't guarantee success neither doe it hinder your path towards it , but exploirng different idea keep alive the desire to learn .
