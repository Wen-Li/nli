it is a well-known fact that most people 's purpose in life is to succeed , whether it be at the family , academic or working level . now the question is whether or not we really need to exceed our current ability to be considered a successful person . in this regard , i think that it would be particularly interesting and relevant to deal with the business world . on the one hand , i tend to think that an employee deserves the right to be considered a a successful person to the extent that they previously had to prove educated and motivated enough to meet the employer 's requirement for a specific position within a company . as a matter of fact , given the level of selection regarding a position of teacher in macroeconomics , i argue that the status of successful person is not to be neglected . however , i want to highlight the fact that the applicant is all the more granted recognition in the way that their knowledge is not sufficient in these situation ; indeed , not only is the applicant 's academic background important in the hiring process , but the ability to teach to a given category of student is also to be considered . on the other hand , i also think that we could consider the concept of being succesful from a different point of view . indeed , i also agree with the argument according to which successful people try new thing and take risk . for instance , the latter quality could enable people to evolve in a company ; why would we have to restrain ourselves while we could take advantage of external opportunity to improve in particular field . as far a i am concerned , the only risk would be to fail . and it is a well-known fact that everyone learns from their past experience and mistake . as a conclusion , it is worth-mentioning that the definition of a successful person is subjective in so far a this concept implies to first define our current ability and then our objective in life . successfulness can be considered according to different level .
