nowadays there are lot of selection or attraction for young people to spend their leisure time . i agree with this resolusion that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their community . my primary reason is that they are indifferent from their community . especially where i live , in tokyo japan , young people are not interested in their enviroments . we do not know even our neighbor . it is totally different from the old era in which people used to help each other . in this era , we have the system , what is called , goningumi . it consists of 5 neighbor . this 5 menbers must help each other . for example , at funeral the neibors have to be receptionist and make dish for comer . this way of thinking to compensate each other still remains in my hometown , but it is definetely decreasing . the communication among people is getting lower and lower obviously . it might be because of the invention of internet . we do not need to communicate neighbor actively . we can buy or enjoy thorough the internet even in case of emergency . the core family is also the evidence for their indeffrence . they like small group . another reason is that the system of society can not allow them to help their community . i mean that young people have to aquire the up-date skill to catch up with the improvement of the computer . the content and how to use new software is developing day by day . then they tend to consentrate on studying at home , and consuquently they do not have enough time to help their community even if they are willing to . for these reason , i agree that young people nowadays don not give enough time to helping their community . this might be because of u . we had better encourage them to devote our community more .
