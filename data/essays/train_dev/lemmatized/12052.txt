i think that the statement is correct ! in our consumistic society an object 's value is no more calculated by considering how much useful is or how good doe it task ! now for most of the good have to be '' cool '' and have '' good looking '' . in order to increase the '' coolines '' of an object the producer spend a great amount of money in advertising and promotion ! in example apple computer pay a fee to major of the cinema in order to make machintosh computer appear in movie ! if you pay attention in film you can quite only see mac ! an other exemple [ excuse me for speeking always about computer but i 'm studing computer science engeneering . .. so i 'm a sort of computer geek ] again froma apple is the '' look '' of mac . .. the apple 's coputer line have always an extremely cured design ! an other way to convice people of the '' cooliness '' of a product is to associate the product to famous people that are known being fashion ! '' fashion '' ... this is a key word ! in our world in order to sell something you must get it become fashion ! think about the ipod . .. it is the most popular mp3 readr of the world . .. and not for it technology ; it is famous due to the fact it design is '' cool '' ! so now having an ipod mak you a '' coolo '' person ! for the people of the 21st century being '' cool '' and fashion is the most important thing [ in particular for young people . . in fact for the beeing par of a group , and in particular the cool one , it what they aim for ] . counting on the fact that most of people in the civilized world watch a minimum of 2 howr of television a day . .. the best way to let product be known is through tv ! not only by spot . .. but also trough '' subliminal '' messagges ! this consumistic society want to keep u slave of : '' be cool or be nothing '' !
