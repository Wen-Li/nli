i do agree with the statement . i think that people who take risk and try new thing are more successfull than people who do only what they already know how to do well . the first reason why i think that way is very simple . when i look to a baby i am automatically sure of my answer . if a baby do not try new thing such a walking instead of going on his arm and leg and if he never take any risk such a eating some warm meal he will never walk and will never be careful about the heat of what he eat . he will never become a man . then i think to innovation . i think in particular to the man who invented the electricity . i am sure that when he tried his machine which produced the first watt he took great risk because of the possibility of being electrocuted or killed by the oil company of that time . i also think to pierre and marie curie . when they discovered the new element , radium , polonium and the others , they were confronted to an high rate of radioactivity . it is also impossible to say that they were not successful people . finally i think about art . art could not have developped if some crazy - a they were called in their era - artist did not think about painting in new way or painting different thing than those painting until them . for example picasso invented the cubism , and when he did it he wa just trying new thing and finally he ha beco ; e famous all over the world and his painting are nearly the most expensive piece of art on the world art market . that is for this three reason that i believe that successful people try new thing and take risk rather than only doing what they already know how to do well .
