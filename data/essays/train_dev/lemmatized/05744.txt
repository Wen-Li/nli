in my opinion it is in general better when you have a broad knowledge of academic subject . firstly , in many academic subject , you need a overview about several topic to understand the relationship within one topic and between different theme . i study economics at the university of applied sciene in nuremberg . for example in finance i have to know the theoretic basic in finance but i also need the knowledge of mathematics , tax and law . so i am not only specified on one subject . during the semster , we have many differnt subject which all stand in relationship to economics . for example , marketing , finance , law , tax , accouting . english , general mangament etc . secondly , it is not sure , that someone always get a job in that subject that he ha studied . so it is possible , that he had studied finance but now work in a marketing department . the situation on tte work market is not so good and so it is better to have a broad knowledge . my friend studied logistics and now he is working a banker , but while his studytime he must vistited lecture of finance and assurance . so he ha not that problem to work in this field . but there are also subject in which it is better , when you are specified . for instance in medical : it is not possible , that every doctor know everything . you need someone for skin dea but also someone who ha knowlegde about cancer . in this case it is of advantage , when you have a specific knowledge . on the other hand it so for the human brain impossible all to know . in a conclusion it is to say , that it depends on the subject and how deep the subect is related to others . on the one hand it can be better to have a wide knowledge , on the other hand it can be useful to be specialise in one academic field .
