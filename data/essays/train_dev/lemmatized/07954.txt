in my openion , successful people should try new thing and take risk rather than doing what they already know how to do well . people can improve their skill , knowledge and achieve a great successthat can help them to become a famouse person . i have three reason to supprot my openion . reason first is if the successful person try new thing than that person can improve skill . if his / her work is more riscky than whtever he/she did before than that person can get more experience . for example , one ancient people investgate how to make a wheel out of wood . after that they made cart by using that wheel and they became successfull . after making a cart they did n't take any risk to make any equipment or any vehicle . so , do u think that we are able to use car today ? no , we wo n't be able to use car but , they worked ahead and took risk and find more way to use that wheel . theire skill of understanding increased by their risky work . second reason is if successful person try a new thing and take risk than only doing what they already know how to do well , than that person 's expereince will become limited . that prson doe n't know anything rather than he/she already know how to do well . for examle , if the person suceesfully become a teacher and after that he did n't read any source . than , his knowledge will become limited . if a student ask him question and that teacher will not be able to answer his question . only becouse he wa satisfied with his success , he did n't studied anything accept whatever he studied during his school and university and he stoped reading . consequently , i strongly disagree with the statement about
