i disagree with the statement that young people enjoy life more than older people do . now , to make the statement clearly , i define the age of each people . i set the age of young people around 20 , and the age of older people around 60 . i can not decide which people enjoy more because both of them ha different kind of thing to enjoy their life . so , i would like to compare some point . the ordinary difference between young people and older people are the phisical ability , the quantity of money , the variety of the experience and so on . now , i compare these thing between young people and older people . first , a to the phisical ability , young people ha more ability than older people . so , we can say that young people enjoy more than older people such a sport or dancing all night or other thing which need energy . second , a to money , most older people have more money than they were young . so , older people can enjoy more than young people when doing something cost a lot . for example , my parent enjoys their life with using more money than it used to be . they go to the restrant often and eat delicious meat , and they go to concert or see the show . these thing are cost too much for the young people to enjoy often . third , the quality of experience is greatly differd between young people and older people . because young people have not know various thing in the society yet , they can experience new thing everyday . so they enjoy knowing new thing , new people , new way of thinking . on the other hand , older people can live with their various experience for their long life . in the 60 year , they experienced various kind of thing which the young people have not expereinced yet . so , they know more enjoyable thing than young people . considering these point , i can not say that young people enjoy life more than older people do . both people enjoys their own life with their own step .
