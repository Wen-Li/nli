have you ever seen a movie that the car ride not on the road , but in the sky ? at least , most people have ever thought about the surprising situation . i agree the statement that there will be fewer car in use than there are today in twenty year . that 's because science technology developes rapidly and the air pollution is a crucial problem . first of all , science technology 's development is rapid . today people can send a e-mail to others who line in other country . and they can go easily abroad in several time . so in twenty year , there will be more transpotation . then the use of car is reduce . in this s ense the neumber of car is declined . next , the air polution is the main issue in term of environment all over the world . each country try to reduce harm material . one solution is restriction that person do n't allow drive . in korea , new policy announce that a day of week do n't have to drive . in case of my father do n't drive in friday . in conclusion . in twenty year there will be fewer car , due to technology and air pollution .
