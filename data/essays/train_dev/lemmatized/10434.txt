the statement say that student should importantly understand idea and concept instead of learning them . this is a question that i face myself a a student almost every day . on the one hand it is necessary to understand the theory that lie beneth all fact and all new information , in a way to get a solit knowledge how thing work . on the other hand it is also necessary to just learn new word or relationship . without that base knowledge it is not possible to communicate with others because they do not know what you are talking about . i guess there is no black and white view whether to say that a student should learn everything new just by heart or to understand just the fact . it must be a middleway you have to find to combine this both view . when repitition is the aim then i would say that learning the fact is enough but when it is necessary to find new conclusion and relation between different case then it is a must to understand basicaly what the new information want to tell . nowadays the knowledge is given to everybody through various database like book or the ultimate information base with techonolgy of the internet . it is just a matter of how to find information and how long you need to access the new information . it is getting more and more unimportent to know every fact by heart with help from data on page like wikipedia online . with that help it is just a matter of a few second to access the right topic and to get any information that is so enormous nobody could keep in mind . to come to a conclusion i wish that in many more field then today already exist student learn the `` why '' standing behind instead of just pure fact and knowledge they will never need in that particulaly case in the future .
