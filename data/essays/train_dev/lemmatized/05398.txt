i agree that successful people try new thing and take risk than only doing what they already know how to do well . trying new thing may involve risk but could be more beneficial from financial perspective , fame and recognition . for example , if a person is currently working for a company a a salaried employee , he or she may draw a predetermined salary for a particular period which is a guaranteed earning . but , someone trying something new may be at risk of losing the current job . however , this person is inclined and determined to start up a small part company . he or she establishes a company with loan from bank , assistance form legal advisor , collaboration with other firm in the same or similar field . by doing this , the person get in contact with various people , agency and customer through which he or she learns different thing at different time from time to time . also , this person now provides employment to a small group initially which may eventually become a larger firm . with the establishment in place , the person strives hard taking new risk on a continuous basis in the process of becoming a bigger firm through diferent expansion using his or her multiple contact . to rise to this stage , the person 's determination coupled with risk taken is an important factor . having not taken the risk , the person would be still working an 8 hour shift with a small paycheck with huge risk taken and conferring the growth of the firm , the person now contributes to the economy by providing employment for a larger group resulting in more tax dollar to the treasury . with the personal finacial growth and contribution to the economy , the person is recognised for his or her hard work with instant fame and recognition . supporting the statement , us ha a number of exmples to state starting from sears to bill gates . all the famous personality have proved that they took ton of risk before they were recognised for what they are today .
