nowdays , advertisement are a key element of trade business . indeed , advertisement are always used a a mean to improve sell of good . some person think that most advertisement make product seem much better than they really are . i agree with this statement . the reaon why advertisement were invented is to increase the level of sell . therefore , advertisement promote product and must convince the buyer that he need the promoted product . to this aim , the product are presented a the best product ever invented eventhough it is often false . advertisements are created to attract customer , to make them buy the proposed product . for instance , it is common to see on television advertisement which explain that the presented product ha been tested by a certain number of customer who expressed their satisfaction when they used the product . however , there is no proof of such study and those result can not be ascertained . the promoted product must appeal to the customer and therefore , lot 's of technological mean are used in order to improve the picture of product . indeed , nowdays , lot 's of software are invented in order to fix picture , to erase some elemets of the picture . to some extent advertisments are often diffused on television , the best way to attract customer is to show a beautiful product , with nice colour and nice shape . for example , advertisemts often concern food product . when a cake is promoted , the nice colour of the cake will obviously attract the customer . in the same vein , the nice shape of the cake will also appeal to the customer . therefore , the customer will buy the product , thinking that he will get the same article a the one exposed in the advertisement and he will be desappointed because the cake can not have , in real , the same colour a the one obtained thanks to informatic sofware used for picture . as a conclusion , advertisments are always using false information and it is difficult to put boundary between well conducted advertisemenst and false information .
