mobile industry ha developed for decade and people surely derive lot of benefit from driving car . in a short time , like five to ten year , people like the one who enjoy the feeling of driving are still in need of car that have high quality . however , in a generally longer period , like twenty year , i agree with the speaker 's assertion that there will be fewer car in use than there are today . to begin with , now nearlly every country and every city lay special focus on developing and improving it 's public transportation like the building of bus and metroway network . in twenty year time , i am fully convinced that the public transportation will be very well developed and by then people will find taking the public transportion is faster and cheaper than driving their own car . secondly , a people becoming more concerned with their health , they may choose to walk or riding a bicycle to work or to other place if it 's not very far from their home . this also serf to reduce the number of people that buy and drive car . thirdly , thanks to the medium and education , people are now becoming well aware of the deteriorating effect car could cause to the environment . governments are taking out procedure and making regulation to restrict the number of car . for instance , government would place very heavy tax on the car that people buy and restrict the time that car could be used in the city . in sum , the car industry will be survive and the quality of car they produce will keep on improving in twenty year . however , the quantity of car is inevitably going to reduce due to the development of public transportion and people 's concern of health and the regulation that the government taking out to protect our environment . i am optimistically to say that the world will be a cleaner and safer place to live in twenty year .
