i partially agree the idea and to travel in a group with a tour guide supposed to be one of the most efficient way to visit a place , especially when people go to the country where they never been so far . as for me , i usually travel with my friend and i have no experience to company with the person , such a a tour guide because i believe that there are following disadvantage to do it : i do not wast the time by visitting the place which i am not so interested in ; and i hope to have a look real aspect of the country or place . the people who participate in a gruop traveling must be varioused to age , interest or sex . to fulfill the satisfaction of every visitor , travel company would take them many sort of place regardless thinking about what or in where they actually would like to experience in the trip . the travel time is limited and at the same time i really want to make it fun , therfore i should go or do only what make me have interest . further , travel company tend to emphasize only good aspect of the place to a travelor , in order not only to make them have a fond of memory there , but also to make them come back there . i am tired of seeing a place where most of tourist visit and having a meal which most of them have eaten . taken together , for the person who hope to know the place where he or she visit deeply , like me , should have a coonection or freiend who dwell there for a long time and they diffinetely take he or she the restaurant or bar which tour group rarely visit .
