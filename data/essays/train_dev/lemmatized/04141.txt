i disagree with the statement , i prefer to travel alone without a tour guide . because traveling in such condition spoil the numerous opportunity in traveling . the first reason i am against for the idea is the tour can easily become reactive . travellers can lost their opportunity in learning about the destination . the traveler who are also a customer of a tour guide do n't need to learn about the destination . the service supplier , the tour guide ha made a tour completely . all the traveller have to do is following the tour guide . it can spoil the oppotunity to enjoy the travel deeply . for instance , when i wa in high school , i wa in a grade trip committee and organized the trip . i am sure that people in the committee worked harder to know about the destination so that we , the menber in the committee enjoyed the trip the most . we could understood many thing in the place , for example , the reason why the custom is like that , why people think in that way , etc . the second reason is that it can cause traveller not communicating with people in destination . it ca n't be said that you understood the place not knowing the people in the destination . due to the security reason , tour guide are scarcely introduce many kind of place . to add to , the traveller ' chance to communicate with people in destination were taken away by paying money to the tour guide . they threw away the opportunity to reserve hotel , resarch the transportation , what temperature or weather there , etc . it is much work .
