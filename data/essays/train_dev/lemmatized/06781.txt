i partially share the idea of those are thinking that young people today do not give enought time to help their community . first of all i would highlight that we shoud split the world in several area a well a in differents category of family . in my opinion in some area of the world like china or countries underdevelopped young people are helping their community due to the fact that they are part of a large community with the same problem and with the same historical link . in that case the community can be defined every think is around the people and doe not need a further of explanation . at the contrary in countries more developped people are living in their little ireland . it is very hard to dentify the community . if community mean family i am assisting to a reduction of the relationship between parent and child due to the fact that the young , in many case are alone during the day and they have not any guide reference for their life . if community mean religion i would like to say that most of the young people have different interest than the religion today because they preefre to spend their spare time in a different way . if the community is the sport team in that case
