every year , million of traveler , everywhere in the world travel . from a rich business man taking his wife on vacation to a kid and his bundle in a hurry to explore the planet . a trip in an unknown location need to be prepared obviously . .. and a tour guide is always ready to take the group to visit the local wonder . but is it the best way to travel ? i personnaly disagree with this statement , i think it deprives u from the spontaneous and adventurous aspect of a trip . when i travel , usually to unknow country with my friend and family , it is of course to have a good time and see odd sight that i may not have the chance to see again . but mostly i like the feeling of freedom that i get : i can go anywhere anytime . but being led by a travel guide kind of take that aspect away : following an exact map and program of the visit . .. and many time the guide is n't a personal guide , for that you have to follow others to see thing that you did n't even want to see in the first place . a personal experience : during a guided tour of paris , few year back , i wa stuck ( so to speek ) in a art exhibition that i did not plan to attend . but since i had no car , and no money for a cab . .. i wa obligated to stay with the group , being bored out of my mind . more then that , of course staying in a nice hotel with a minibar full of drink is nice , but i also love backpacking : going from place to place without a perfectly planned trip , staying at hostel , without the feeling that i have to follow the map exactly a planned . in that case being led by a tour guide would be denying the whole definition of adventurous exiting backpacking . to conclude , i would like to say that following a group led by a tour guide is a great way to explore the city , you get to see all the important sight , but it might not be fit for some people such a me who enjoy adrenaline boost .
