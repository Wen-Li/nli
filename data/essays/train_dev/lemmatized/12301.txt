traveling is a major booming industry in modern society . a myriad number of people travel abroad even though they have to spend a lot of money . there is a ongoing debate whether people need tour guide when people travel exotic place . a substancial number of people prefer traveling with tour guide to traveling by themselves . however contrary to this opinion , i strongly believe that traveling with out a tour guide is better because of more exciting experience and saving budget . first of all , people who visit new place will experience more amazing experience . people will venture enexpected situation that they have never suspected . the rationale benind this is that if people follow the tour guide who know all the schedule and place , people wil lose their interest and curiosity . by exploring new place without any experienced knowledge people will feel the freedom and excitement . when i when to sydney without a tour guide , i could understand that city by exploring myself step-by-step . therefore visiting without a tour guide is enjoyable . on top of that , people who do not travel in a group led by a tour guide save a lot of money . tour guide job is high-paying job . so tourist should be responsible for hiring them . one of my friend went to japan for two time , she said that she could save more than 1000 dollar when she went to japan independently even though she stayed longer . in this sense , traveling without a tour guide is more recommendable for the people who try to save money . in conclusion , the best way to travel is not in a group led by a tour guide . people can experience more staggering experience and can save fund . traveling is really appeling but need much money . all in all , people can obtain beneficial profit by traveling themselves . without a tour guide 's help .
