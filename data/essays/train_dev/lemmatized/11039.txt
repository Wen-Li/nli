while we are studying it is good to know what should i learn . should i keep working in a subject that i already master or shoud i developpe a wildspread culture ? on one side i could specialize in order to become one of the best in what i am doing but having no ability to recycle myself in another suject , while in the other hand i can learn enough to have an overall culture and knowledge but no special skill . a lot of scientific developpement would n't have happened if scientist just focused on one subject . for instance , even if einstein improve the way a viewing physic , he would n't have been able to developpe his theory if he had n't mastered mathematics . usualy great intellectual have a broad knowledge that give them a new way of seeing their specific subject . so in many way both assertion are complementary . personaly i am a very curious person . for me all knowledge are good to fulfill my intellectual curiosity . therefore i found it interesting to fly from one subject to another that to study one field that would allow me to become the best in a subject that i only few can understand . for this reason i believe that it is `` better '' to have broad knowledge . it is more social . however our social environment and our society enhance expert . if you want to be hire by company , wathever you are doing , you need to be good at it . that the reason why school and university are providing student with a very precise knowledge . you can easily find cours of developpement economy or in french middle-age litterature . our culture is driven by experise . at any cost , you have to master at least one subject . in my view this attitude is dangerous to culture . culture is diversity , therefore one shoud seek for a broad knowledge , rather than a specific subject .
