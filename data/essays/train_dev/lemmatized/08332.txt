in twenty year , i believe that there will be more car in use than there are in today . however , there will be not such a huge difference . the difference will be about the car type . with the reason of limited petrol source , the car manufacturer are already focused on different type of car that run with different power like a electricity . furthermore , the usage of car , need to be analsyzed under the type of customer expactatitons . the answer of the following question may give u clearer idea , `` why do the people need a car ? '' transportation , more comfortable , time saving are the sample reason that the people always would have one . with the link question that i sated above , there are hundred of different brand available in the market . it is not just about the brand also about different type of car like luxury class , racing , diesel-economical , small or vagoon , etc . the another reason that there will be more car in twenty year is high competitive market . if we look at any magazine or newspaper , we can easily see many different advertisement everyday . the car manufacturer always come up with better deal and better quality of product . as a summary , i do not agree that there will be fewer car in use than there are today . the reason of finding different type power source and also car manufacture ' reasonable offer will always create a wish for consumer to have a car .
