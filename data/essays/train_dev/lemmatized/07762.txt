when i read about successful people 's wrting about their life , their success is always based on their very special new method or invention . moreover , nowadays new challange is develop brand new idea . every human being always seek new idea and new product to make them successful . present world already ha been developed too much for regular idea or invention . moreover , people who succeeded always had hard time with them . in my opinion , because they faced with their problem and they overcome it , they can called successful people . first of all , the successful people 's common stereotype is not satisfy to the present situation and always challange to the new one . walt disney did not satisfied with his current society 's broadcast . he invented variety disney character such a `` mikky mouse '' or `` minni mouse '' . this new character contributed to obtain child 's attention , and it becomed the fuel for walt disney 's success . in addition he nevered stoped to create new character , his unstoppable tring also make his success more shiny . second of all , the people who reach their success took lot of rick than ordinary people . it is not true that person can make their forturn in one try except the lottary . successful people always took higher risk to obtain more new and valuable result from their try . when the bill gates wa young man , he wa attended to harberd university and he wa respected by others to just attend in the harberd . however , when he tried to make the microsoft program , there are some episode about he failed at his class in university . bill gates gave up his reputation of harverd . normal people usually not doing it . third of all , successful people did not stop to develope themselves . they always try new thing with risk but never give up about it . they try and try untill they get satisfied data or result about it . then they start to new try based on their collected information . piccaso is the famouse artist of the modern age and his one painting value like more than million dollar . his work at that time wa not that noticable because his painting wa too creative . however , he did not give up drawing . he just kept draw and draw by his way . after he died , until now , we thought his painting is very creative and we gave him a creadit for it . in short , successful people try new thing although they could take serious risk , and they never give up untill they reach their goal . therefore , i strongly agree with the statement that is given .
