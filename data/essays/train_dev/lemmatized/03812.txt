i fully agree with the statement that succesful people try new thing and take risk . in our everyday life , we have many example that confirm this opinion , but the most important one is given by our interpreneurs . interpreneurs are always risking a lot in term of money and time . moreover , enterpreneurs are always innovating , trying new thing in order to survive in the market , to be competitive , to improve their position on the global market . the main result of this behaviour is the success that everybody can recognize a tipical of enterpreneurs . on the other side , we have the low level employes . they only do what they have been teached to do at the beginning of their carreer and they do this work for all the life . very often , this kind of people are really very good in doing some specific work and they usually work for all their life for the same company . generally , they never take any risk and the company fully protect and support them because they have a very strong know how . but if we analyse the life of these people we can see that they never achieve any success . to conclude , i think that to be succesful in the life , we need to take risk and try new thing . moreover , in this way we can keep alive our mind , we can train our creativity , we can better express ourself a human being . i think that we need to live a deep a possible our unique life , therefore we musttry a much a possible new thing !
