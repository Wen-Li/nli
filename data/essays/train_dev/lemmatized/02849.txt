i agree that there will be fewer car in use in twenty year than nowadays . reasons for this opinion is a mentioned below . to begin with , traffic problem is already reached it peak . as a korean dwelling in the city of seoul , i always have problem to find an empty parking lot when i drive out in the city . similar to myself , many people living in seoul doe not use their car if it is not really necessary because of parking problem and traffic jam . moreover , these phenomenon are getting worse . also , since more and more population are concentraing into major city including seoul , there will be le car . secondly , the metropolitan city are setting up the plan to establish more and more natural park in the city area that there no-car area and street are increasing . it is expected , in seoul area , that there will be so many section that prohibits the access of vehicle after twenty year , it will not be efficient or comfortable to drive car in the city area . for example , one of the plan of the mayor of the city government of seoul , newly elected , is to convert the yongsan u.s. military compound into a natural park . he is even planing one of the bridge to be walk-only bridge to let people feel the natural environment of han river . thus , using car will be decreased because of it inefficiency . thirdly , development of public transportation is magnificent nowadays . in seoul , there have been influx of car for last 20-30 year , but nowadays , many citizen use public transportation including bus and expecially subway . there are 12 line of subway in seoul that you can reach to almost any place in and out of the city . since the cost of petroleum is ever growing , using bus and subway are becoming much faster and cheap . in sum , it is expected that there will be fewere car in use in twenty year . this assertion is on the base of the reason taht serious traffic jam , growing area of car-prohibition and efficiency of public transportation .
