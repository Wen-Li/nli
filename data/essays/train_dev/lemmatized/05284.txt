always it helpful to learn and understand idea and concept than to learn fact . i agree with this statement , because idea and concept form the basic building block of any subject . learning i dea and concept lot of expertise what do we need in any particular field , for example , if we consider a child trying learn how to ride byscle . in this process if we taught him the key idea and concept of riding a byscle , which are fristly blancing ofbyscle in order not fell from byscle on to ground . secondly about how to move the byscle forward , which is done by paddling the byscle in a cyclic maner . if the child coherently doe the paddling and balancing of byscle , he may ride the byscle with out anybodys help . the child may drive a motro bike with little help from his friend or parent he know the basic of riding a byscle . if we consider idea and concept for student carrier , they are also important in thire life . for example , if student dont understands the key idea and concept from his class work it difficult for him to write the end exam a wel a to particxipate any type of quiz conducted on the basis of the concept and idea . if a student is best at understanding idea and concept in a subject , he will be getting good grade in his examination . on the other hand if he undersatnds only fact which are asscociated with that subject , consequently routing to a end which is quite dangerous for his carrier . but in some case fact are more important than that of idea and concept in order to live a pleascent life . so according to me i whish to learn idea and concept asscociated with any sort of subject . which will lead to a better understanding of the subject . so i prefer learning idea rather than knowing fact .
