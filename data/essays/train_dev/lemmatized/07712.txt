enjoying the life ha nothing to do with age , a a matter of fact , i know people whose age would reflect no enjoying of life at all but that in the other hand demonstrates that enjoying life is better explained by the will to live . young people have misunderstanding about what enjoying the life really is . enjoying a day , enjoying a piece of cake , or just the blue of the sky and the evergreen three of your house , enjoying the sensation we experiment within everyday , love , lust , sadness , etc. is sometimes more deligthful than trying to impress other one by doing crazy thing or by just leading to the drug or alcohol that are nowadays commonly referenced a enjoying the life for young people . even enjoying life is not basically age determined , there are also situation on wich a person may have a tremendous physical or phsycological impediment that may result on being torn apart from the rejoycing of life , but even among these people once someone told me about a story where two sick people are on the same hospital room , but just one got the opportunity to see trough the window , so everyday , the one that had no possibility to see trough the window asked the other one to tell him about what wa happening on the outer world . with great level of detail the person near the window always used to tell about how nice wa the weather outside , about how pretty wa a young girl that most of the time used to pas by the street , and so on this man used to describe even the leaf from the three that changed togheter with the season . unfortunately this man passed away and the other man unwilling to see anything requested to be changed to the bed near the window , and so it happened , but terrible and great at the same time wa his surprise when he saw trough that window , and could just see a wall , a huge wall that made it impossible to see anything . so harsh is this lecture that must help u to understand that enjoying life is up to one 's self , it ha nothing to do with age , nor impediment , it is just a matter of will to live , desire to reach happiness .
