cars have been well developed nowadays , they have become a common tool in our daily life . few issue are a likely to attrct widespead pulic attention a that concerning the using of a car . i hold the notion that in twenty year there will not be fewer car in use than there are today . there are numerous reason and agreement to suport my idea . here , i intend to explain couple of them . to start with , car are sign of weathy , people try best to save enough money to buy car . my parent often say that when we get enough money , we will buy a bmw . my mother said that she will buy me a car when i get married to show how wealthy she is . and also , my boyfriend always talking about buying a famous car when he earn enough money . all my friend and relative are dreamed of having car . people tend to have more money with the fast developing economy , which mean that more car will be owned by family . furthermore , owning a car is very convient to any place . for example , i live in a countryside . there i only one bus each day heading the capital beijing . so each time i want to go to beijing , i will ask my uncle who ha a car to send me to beijing . this time , i went to beijing to have the toefl test wa the same . i always dreamed of having a car by my own . there are so many people that complained the inconvinence of not having a car . despite such siginificant evidence that show the car will not be reduces , some disagreement still exist . some one argue that car are so polluted . the government are trying to limited personal car . although i can not deny that there is minor tendy for decreasing car , i believe the proportion for the increasing amount of car is much lager . both for personal desire and convinent puporse . from what ha been discussed above , i can safely draw the conclusion that the amount of car in use in twenty year will be much more than today .
