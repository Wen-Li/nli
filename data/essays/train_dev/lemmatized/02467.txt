nowadays advertisement have a big impact on our life . they can be very infuencial on our decision and choice related to the our shop . we can find them everywhere , on television while we are watching a movie or a show , on newspaper , on internet and also on the street . sometimes when we open our mail box we find a lot of advertisement about for example restaurant and shop . not always what they tell describe the real quality of a product . in fact i think that often they make product seem much better then they are . sometimes for example we buy a product because we have heard so much about it and it incredible property but latter when we use it we realize that we have been stupid . in fact the product quality doe not corrisponds with the description in the spot and furthermore we have problably spent more buying it instead of a similar product which wa not advertised . in particular i believe that these advertisement are more powerful with child . in fact they usually ask their parent to buy a game or a pair of shoe because they have seen them on television , they have been attracted by the presentation of this product and they really believe that they can reproduce what is showed on these advertisement . in conclusion i think that it is better to be a little doubtful when we see these spot . when we buy a product we have to be carefull because sometimes a common product which we have not ever see before can show the same property and quality of the one which is advertised . we will problably save money .
