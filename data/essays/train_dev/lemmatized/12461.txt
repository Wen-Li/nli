this statement present a difficult question : it is better to have a general type of culture or to specialize in a specific matter ? the statement asks that the first aspect is more important than the second one , but i am not in agree with it : i think that in modern life is important having a good preparation in all the field of culture , but also it is indispensable to have a specifical knowledge on a matter ; in fact this is the role of university , to prepare a student for the specifical job he think he will do in the future . i have an example that confirms what i have said now : one of my friend , mario , ha a great passion for the study ( he ha readed all the volume of his encyclopedia ) , but he doe n't have studied a specifical matter , because he ha n't frequented the university , so he ha n't a job yet . on the contrary , my friend luca ha studied mechanical engeneering and now , only two month after finishing the study , he work in a great society of engeenering , and he gain a lot of money ! in syntesis , i think that a general culture can help you to grow and to become more adult , but the way to obtain a job that can satisfy you ( by an economical and also professional point of view ) is to study a specifical matter . i also think that the person who ha writed this statement ha a more utopistic view of life than me .
