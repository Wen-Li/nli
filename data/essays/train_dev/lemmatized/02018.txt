recent research say that to void to get older , you need to keep yourself young . i am still young , but i love reading and i love to see the eye of older people giving advice , hugging other people , or walking on the street . the sadness usually pervades each of their action . usually my grandfather love talking about his life when he wa young . why ? the most obvious reason is that he felt more alive . his bone , his articulation , arm and leg , were strong and flexible . but also his heart wa stronger and flexible . a short italian movie called `` per sempre '' ( for ever ) talk about a lady who fall in love with a married man who doe n't love her in retourn , and she fall into a deep depression until the moment she wish to die . might be happen if she were 15 year old ? i dont ' think so . the art director in fact wa a mature man , who understoods that after a certain age the antibody of our spirit are not a many a when we are young . the perception change . a year is much longer when we are 5 year old then we are 80 's . every experience change u , and the time is not reversable , even if albert einstein discover and theoryze the relativity , but he never theoryzed any kind of `` back to the past '' . an interesting aspect might be the illusion of immortality . maybe there is some kind of internal biological measure unit , just given by mother nature that say that at the age of 18 , rich or poor , well-educated or not , we are expressing the maximum potential of what we will be in our all life . we look around , and we are the best of the society , beautiful , strong , smart , and all the people talk about u with expression a `` the next generation '' . sometimes i like to stop by an old grandma , and i just like to dream about asking her phone number . .. but only if she were 20 ! so i just start talking about the weather and ask about her life , her past , her youth .
