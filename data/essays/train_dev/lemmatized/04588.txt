i agree with this statement because a succesful person must be imaginative . this person ha to take risk and must have a proffesional way of solving problem . but the other type of person , who only solves problem with classic type , can not achieve in life because that person is narrow minded . in addition to this , the radical movement that a succesful person ha made will open the door of achievement . the ability to create is the same meaning to try new thing . by this ability , a person can absolutely do such thing that no one ha ever able to .
