cars have been vey important since they were important . at the first time not many people could afford it , but now most of the population owns , unless , one . however , in the last year we have been told many bad news about the enviroment . cars consume petrol and then it burn in order to make the car work . the result of this activity affect a lot to the atmosphere . the ultraviolet ray are entering in our sistem , crossing all the cover of the atmosphere . the enviroment is very polluted , and a a result of this animal are desapearing . anyway , car help in this situation a well a the human being action . in the news they recomend u to take the bus in spite of driving everybody their car . if that idea work the enviroment would improve . besides , animal are n't the only one that are affected , human can suffer many injury , for example problem when they breath or even it can be seriouly affected to the sight . moreover , block of flat are part of the problem of polltion , many house look dirty what that 's a consequence of the pollution . from my point of view i think that if in twenty year there will be fewer car in use than today that mean that people will start to take care of the enviroment . not using the car constantly a much a we do now implies le pollution . although car not only affect to atmosphere with the pollution . there are so many reason why i agree with the statement . cars are very noise and much if they are in a traffic jam and they are in a hurry . when they start shouting to each other . that 's not good for the people who is every day hearing this unconfortable noise . in a long time this can cause many health problem such a stress or even heart problem . finally , i wolud n't like to forget saying that the le car in use are in the street the more bus driver will be , that mean that there will we le unemployed people .
