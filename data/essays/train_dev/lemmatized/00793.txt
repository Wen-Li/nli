it is more important for student to understand idea than learn fact , the human ha long memerise and short memerise . when we try to remember something whether difficult or simple , finally we hope that it will be the long memerise . the opposite is that just know the fact . i am going to have three my own example and opinion for showing that to understand idea is more better than learn in fact first of it , i use trigtion algebra or even a sentence in english class . when we are going to understand about how to use or calculate . we should understand the idea of it or the question dont have limit in any situation . if you just learn fact , then you are going to figure out nothing in the math , because it too many thing you learn in fact , or it too many thing you dont try to understand idea . second is about a sentence or a new vocabulary that you have never seen before . if you try to understand whats going on in this sentence or try to know whats the definision about this vocabulary , then a soon a you dont need to remember or even '' learn fact '' , you can understand or to know how to use it , because you understand idea , and the sentence or vocabulary will become part of your body and in your mind for the long time . third opinion about understand the idea is when understand whats the meaning of the stuff then it more easy than just remember it , because the question or a sentence will always be changing whatever or anytime , if we learn fact in algebra you will remember for your all life , if it english , then you will remember at first second or first two day , but after the day then you will forget , then your study life will be always in remember and forget . my conclusion is we should study to '' understand idea '' not to learn fact . and above those three opinion i
