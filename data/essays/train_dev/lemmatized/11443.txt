i agree with the statement . i think that succes in these day ha a lot of implication about money and carreer , but i thik that succes it 's not just about these kind of thing but about being the best human being that you can be . and because of this you ca n't really settle for what you think is ok . because in order to become more than what you are , you must realize that there are possilbilly other way for doing thing that you just have n't imagine . a successful person , it 's an innovative one . successful people have been changing the world since human appeared on it . you just have to think about the way we live now and the way people live two thousand year ago or more . and everything that we enjoy and give for granted , wa somebody 's idea . somebody that just wanted to do thing a little different or just not like people told him o her thing are suppossed to be , but doing thing in his o hers own way . innovation will lead to a successful live , a it make our way of live a better one . ambition , will never let you settle with what you have or let you keep doing just what you think you do already well . ambition , may blind some people , and thus it ha a negative connotation , but , the ambition that make you always go forward to your next goal it also a very important element of success . taking risk it part of life , and peolple who have the determination to take them when it matter , usually are moved by the feeling that out there , there must be something better , something they deserve to have . so yes , i think that successful people usually try new thing and take risk rather than only doing what they already know how to do well .
