successful people try new thing and take risk rather than only diong what they already know how to do well . most people wil agree on this statement , and few will not . what make people believe in this statement or agree with it is that it 's true about successful people that they are risk taker . and what will make people do not agree with the statement is maybe because they think that taking risk is not what a successful person is based on . its a matter of different opnion . the cause why people belief in thsi statement is that , in business study they study about successful people an about how can you be a successful business man when you grow up . so the thing is there is a chart listing the basic charcteristics of a successful person , and a risk taker is one of those basic characteristic an it actually one of the most important characteristic in a successful person . however , they agree with this statement because it based on true fact and on study that have been taught for student in school so they can not be mistaken or wrong in what they teach the student . on the other hand , people who do not agree with the statement , is that they just belief in their own opinion and in what they think . and that 's not wrong , it 's good for a person to belief in himself . but in ome case you have make sure from what you say or what do you belief in , so for you to not be embaressed infront of other people . at the end i would like to give my opinion , and it that i actually do agree with the statement . because i studied in my school and specifically in business study that from the main characteristic of a successful person is to be a risk taker an to try new thing .
