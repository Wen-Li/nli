i agree with this statement because in my opinion a successful people have more money to spend than normal people . they can try what they want , and in their opinion anything is forbbiden . they want to try always new experience , know new thing and sometimes take risk . last week i have read to the newspaper that a famous italian singer decided to spent a month in a unknow place ( probabily an island ) . he want to stay alone . none can go with him . he ha not a personal phone because in this place the phone do not work in this way he can not communicate . he want to stay in contact with the nature . for find food he can only fishing or hanting . in my opinion it wa a very dangerous experince but i think that the only reason that this singer decide to go is to increase in success . if he doe not the economic possibility i am sure that he do not go . i think that is important to increase your knowledge , try news thing but there are some limit that we must respect . it is good to do small thing but well than more thing not well . i think that a dream that the man have is to fly , but for natural condition it can not possible .
