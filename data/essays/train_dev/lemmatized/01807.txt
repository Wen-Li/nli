we live in a world which is very interesting and contains plenty of knowledge . is n't fair to say which one is better for u , either in having broad knowledge of many academic subject or be a specialized in one specific subject . i beleive we should have knowledge of many subject and be a specialized in any one subject to which we feel that suit u . let u have example , as we are in our school we are taught to different subject like mathematics , life sciences , social studies . as we grow up to university level , we are given a chance to choose what we are interested in like medicine , engineering , business administration , music , law etc . so i beleive we should have enough knowledge in all aspect of life . if i beleive in having broad knowledge of many subject rather than be a specialized , then it is highly impossible for me to remember the thing . for example a doctor ca n't be a lawyer because the medicine knowledge is endless where a the lawyer ha to remember all the law and he ha to upgrade himself with change in government and in `` law and order '' . so a person cant be specialized in many subject . let u say i beleive in second point of being a specialized in one subject rather than have enough knowledge in various subject . .. suppose i am secialized in business administration and if someone asks me about the business i am able to answer to all of their question and if one day someone asks me anything irrelevent to my subject of business i may not be able to answer the question . if we take an example of sport , we often have interest in many sport but we love only one sport . thats why an football commentator can not do commentary in badminton because he may not be knowing of the rule correctly . learn the good thing a much a we can whether it may be from a scholar or from a small kid because learning never end .
