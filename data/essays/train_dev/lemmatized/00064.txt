i very much agree to the fact that young people enjoy life more than older people do . the fact that they are energetic support the previous statement . biologically speaking , the metabolic rate in the older people are very slow and thus will be left with very le energy to work with . as the immune system go weaker and weaker , it becomes difficult for the older people to be active . in contrast , the younger one are the most entertaining being . with a very high metabolic rate the younger people have lot of energy to perform their function . its not that older people do n't enjoy life but then , it is just a comparison . sitting at a place is a kind of enjoyment for the older people a they suffer from all sort of problem relating from limb to heart . such is not the case with the youngster . they are always enthusiastic and energetic , always eager to be active in all the action that are up . the function and the party attended , the sport played by the youngster can not be performed by the older one a their age restricts them to do so . let u take an example of a grandfather and his grandson . the state of activeness that is seen in the grandson is by far , incomaparable to that of grandfather 's . equally true is the fact that the grandfather might have enjoyed in his childhood . but taking his age into consideration he is rather adviced to take rest and be under certain limit for the sake of his safety . an older body can not cope up with the high energy consuming activity unlike the youngerones . not to be partial , older people have their own way of enjoying life which might be difficult for the youngerones to follow . nevertheless , it is the young people who can work upon the stress level much elegantly than an older person . although , older people do earn money , travel a lot it is the yougsters who make their way a step higher in all respect . true to the fact that younger people enjoy life more , they dont tend to force thing like in the case of older people . that is the reason why many corporate company have restricted their worker to continue beyond an age of 55 in most of the country . although it is very strictly followed in government office , it hold strong enough in the private enterprise too . it is only in the safety of older one that they are adviced to be little rusty .
