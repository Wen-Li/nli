the one of my favorite hobby is traveling . i disagree with the statement that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide . i think , when i travel without any tour guide , i can go any place which i would like to go , and i can find my favorite place or thing , and i can get more strong friendship . fistly , without any tour guide , our travel will be more flexible for planning where to go or when to go . in my case , when i traveled with a tour guide , there wa the place where i wanted to stay for more longer time , but he said `` we must go to next . '' i felt unsatisfied . secondly , it is possible for me to find a place or a thing which is not so famous . that is to say , i will get my own special place or thing . i do not like crowded place , so if i can find unfamous , but very good place or thing for me , i think i am happy . finally , if there is no guide for our group , we will get togehter to make our travel more precious . i have a friend good at making a schedule , so with her i feel more happy , and our travel will become more valuable , moreover , our friendship will become more strong . for these reason , i think the statement that the best way to travel is in group led by a tour guide is not so good . traveling is very exciting , so i wish i could go everywhere .
