the issue at hand is that whether knowledge of many academic subject is better than specialization in any one particular subject . i believe that specialization in a particular subject is a better than having knowledge about many subject . i believe so because specialized form of knowledge lead to complete knowledge about the subject at hand . firstly , i beleive that specialization in a particular subject is a better option because it involves greater in depth analysis of various detail and it influence on other thing a well . for example , consider a heart specialist doctor who ha specialization in heart surgery . such a doctor is better than other general physician when it come to heart related ailment . such a specialist is in a better state to advise thing related to heart problem . additionally , specialization in a subject is better because a specialist can do the research work related to a particular specialized field more effectively and efficiently . a research done by a specialist is more credible than a research done by a non-specialist . for example , newton wa a specialist in his field , so his research and discovery are still considered great work in his field . any one can not do such a research and lead to great discovery , but only a specialist like newton can . finally , in my view , a person with specialized knowledge about a particular subject is better able to communicate thing and impart knowledge to others . to bolster this , consider the point that all our professor and lecturer in our school and college are specialist in their field . a physics professor will be able to teach physic more effectively than any a science teacher who ha superficial knowledge about that subject . so , by stating all these point i conclude that specialized form of subject knowledge is better than superficial knowledge about many different academic subject . a specialist is the only person whose ha great in depth knowledge about the subject at hand .
