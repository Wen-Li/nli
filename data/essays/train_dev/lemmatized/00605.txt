the business of selling product is quite hard . the decision making process of the customer depends on the usage and the price of the product . so you have to be the sheapest one or you have to provide an innovation . if you are not one of these you have to find a way to be noticed by the customer . one possibilty is to show the customer a product which differs from the real one . the illegal tuning / upgrading of advertisement with non-real information or visual part could be defined a `` lying to the customer '' , but it is a possibility to increase your current selling amout . the problem of this difference between the advertisement and the reality is , that the customer will realize these normally after the buying process . as a result the customer will not buy any product of your company in future because the think that you are not providing the product which you offer in your advertisement . so you are able to increase your current selling amout by `` tuning '' your advertisement , but on the long run you will decrease the selling amout of all your product ( not only the product you have communicated in the advertisement ) . marketing is becoming more and more important in the business of management a company . but marketing say , that you should have a look to the customer to find their need and to provide a product which help the customer to solve their problem . marketing doesent mean , that you should sell a fridge to the north pole . the importance of the company brand is increasing all the time because the customer doesent have the time or the knowledge to evaluate a product . so the customer will decide on subjective criterion if he will buy a product from company a or company b. because of this you have to take care of your advertising decision because they will infect the future of your whole company . further it is illegal to tell the customer fact which are not true . so the customer or your competitor can hire a lawyer which will be fight against you in front of a judge . this is not really good public relation for your company . in my opinion you should not lie to the customer because this will infect your company negative on the long run and you are not only responsible for your margin , a well for your employee .
