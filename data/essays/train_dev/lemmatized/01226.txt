the issue stated by the topic is wheter or not in twenty year there will be fewer car than today . i believe that it is impossible to have le car that today . one reason i believe that will not be fewer car is because to have a car mean to be indipendent , and who want not be indipendent ? i mean that in a normal family evreyone want to have a car , for instance a car is necessary fot the husband to go to work , another car is necessary to the wife to go either to work and make shopping , and we can not forget son or daughter . so the situation is very prevedible , if everyone want a car , the number of these car wiill increase in the future . another reason i think there will be more car in the future because a car is looked like a stutus symbol . for example who ha a expensive and sportive car , like ferrari , want to show to other people that he or she is a rich man or woman . another reason i think that there will be more car is that today a in the future there is the opportunity to chose your favourite car , i mean that there are a lot of kind of car and a lot of brand . automotive factory are trying to satisfy customer need with specific kind of car and give to them the possibility to chose almost everything in a car , for example the colour and the material of the seat , the colour of the whole car , and also the model of the engine : diesel or not . as we can see people can obtain it whises realized and often without paying a lot for a car . in conclusion in the future the number of car wiil be higher than now , because peole need to be indipendent and choosing a customized car is not anymore difficult .
