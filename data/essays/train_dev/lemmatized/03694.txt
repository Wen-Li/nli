i totally disagree with the statement , even though oneself may believe that it is true to a certain extent because of the fact that young people love to play and no certain entity hold them responsible for their action and the consequence of their action . the following are the reason and example that explain why i strongly disagree with the statement mentioned in the question . firstly , if we examine some of the extracurricular program offered at elementary and high school around the world , we will find that many of these program are devoted to helping local community . these program include activity such a ; cleaning side road , collecting charitable donation and different socially responsible endeavour . based on a research conducted by a leading consulting firm in europe , it wa shown that 5 % of a young person 's time is being dedicated to assisting their local community . secondly , social responsibility and helping community is becoming a very hot topic in the corporate world . this phenominon ha extended it effect to outside of the corporate world to invlove the rest of the society . therefore , many people are becoming more aware of the importance of being socially responsible , hence , they are starting to convey the benefit of being socially responsible to younger people ( i.e. their kid , student , dependent . .. etc . ) . finally , many young people group are being used a great example of time dedication in helping community . not only their community , but also international community . for example , a group of kid from france have gathered their toy and other belonging and sent them to lebanon to help the kid who have left their home because of the current israeli-lebanese war .
