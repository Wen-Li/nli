people it accustumed to travel with a big group and nothing is better than going with a tour guide for achive that . in my personal opinion it depending to the place you go the desicion you may choose . personaly i like the most traveling alone because it give me a feeling of freedom that isnt in anywhere . id also like that because it the only way to stay alone with nature and with my oun feeling and thought . eventhough , it is important to recognized that going to a touristic place alone is not some much funny : you will may not dance with anybody , or you may not get out of the hotel . on those trip im so agree with that statement . going whith people make you meet people , known other personality , and the most important . share with those who sharing that life experience with you . in the other hand , a tour guide give you the oportunity of a payment facility . you also have the security that those organization give to you , even when you have to pay a little bit more . when you are alone you chalenge with more problem , you have to respond for anything , so , a good it is it , is the responsability you assume . finally i can said that in my opinion both option are valid depending on your point of view . mine is clear : i prefere even all the responsability traveling by own way and my own preference .
