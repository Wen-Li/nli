did the young generation really forget their due to their community ? are we really that selfcentered ? i tend to say that we are definitely not and that it is the image that is reflected by a minority of people who do n't care about others . first of all , i 'd like to say that - working in a hospital myself - i have seen many young people takeing care of the older generation . in fact , and this is what stroke me most , when i started working there , a great majority of the staff is made of pleople under thirty year of age . they all seem to give the best they can in any situation . this is why i ca n't stab them in the back , pretending that we are n't helping our community anymore . secondly , i basically think - a i wrote at the beginning - that this image is ha been created by some people , who , in fact , do n't care about their community . but is it really only their fault ? no it 's not . the way pleople act , stronly depends on the education they got from their parent and on the environement , the condition in which they have grown to the person they are today . on balance , i refuse to think , that all young people are that selfcentered a the question let u thin . while some may not help , other still do . we do n't have the right to put all egg in the same basket .
