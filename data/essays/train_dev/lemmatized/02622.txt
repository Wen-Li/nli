there different attitude toward taking tirp . some people prefer to act individually and take trip by their own or by a coupl of close friend . on the other hand some people are defender of tour packeges and rely on tour guide . i personally think , taking trip specially for strange and unknown place need a grest deal of information about such region . first of all , there many unpreditable condition which at first may seem so interesting whle practically it could turn into an unwanted disaster . for instance consider you want to go to a place which have hered alot about it breathtaking and spectaculatr view . you are tempted to take trip and visit that region . while trekking you feel that you are attached to earth and could not move . suddenly you know that you are in the marshland . in such situation there is no remedy while you could visit there by a group . furhtermere , in a group most of people could take more responsibality and all work are done more organised in comparison with individual action . by sharing different responsibilty and task no person will feel exhuasted and consequantle the journey will be more enjoyable for all . for instace in a climbing one could prepare the food or one could carry the stuff . moreover , generally speaking group collaborative action increse individual 's sense of responibity and consequenty from scial aspect these people could become a good team player and in other soicial action they couldact ecffectively . to sum up there are many vitues in group travel . firstly , decreasing the possibility of occuring some dangerous and unpredictable event . in addithin sharing resposiblities among group member wil make traveler relaxed . finall being in group stimulates people 's sense of responsibilty for other social action in future .
