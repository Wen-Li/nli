to have broad knowlege is important , but to specialize in one specific subject is more important for researcher and engineer to research and develop new thing . therefore i disagree that it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subject than to specialize in one specific subject . one of the most obvious example is in research laboratory . it is impossible for one person to have broad and deep knowledge , so we must cooprate each other . to research a big project , for example to make space ciatol to make nuclear fusion power plant and so on , it is necessary to gather the professional researcher and engineer which have deep knowledge and experience about it . combining them , new thing are developed and researched . when researcher discus about some new penomenon , if they did not have knowledge and experience which specialized in one specific subject each other , they could get in conclusion , deep knowledge and experience are more important for u . they are useful for u to become specialist .
