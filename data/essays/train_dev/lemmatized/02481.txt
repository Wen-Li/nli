i wa allways thinking about what will happened in the next year , but every day i have adeferent ideai , and there are some of them . some time i agree with this statement becuase in the next twenty year mabey the human will invent anelectritical door that we an pas throw it and suddenly we find our self in another place . or human can invent a flying car that we can transporting inthe sky for ashort space , and ithink this what will happend and we will say good bay to car and trians . but what i 'm thinking now is : this oil who long it will stell with u ? and when it will be runout ? if this happend so we will not see car or plane or train even ship , all of these thing will go away and this time will be the camel and horse time . but mabey we will atened to the natural sourse for the energy and getting and improve our life . and these natural source are : first the energy of wind . a we know the wind ha strong energy , and if we know how to use it by puting big fan on the huge mountain , also the sun can give u alarge amount of energy , and we can get this energy by the sun cell , the same cell that artifical moon have in the space , and this way were used by some people and they said it a useful way for getting energy , becuase we can used for car , plan , or train and save the oil for another thing . in aconclusion i think car will be kicked out inthe next twenty year , but not all the car becuase the car which move with the sun cell will still in our life .
