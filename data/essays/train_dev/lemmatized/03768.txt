every day we can see a lot of successful people in the street , in our school , in our place of work , in our house . i think that successful people have a lot of courage because generally they take their success from try new thing , new solution , something that nobody have try before . it is a great risk because no one can know if a solution is good or no . the success of that people belong to this courage . they have no fear to try something new . it is good but it is also dangerous because in some case it is more dangerous than pleople can think . a lot of businnes men are famous , rich and successful because they try something new , and in a lot of case dangerous . in fact a lot of people lost everythink they have a conseguence of their take risk . in the other hand doing what they already know is more simply . some people prefer doing something that they already know because they prefer to do it very well even that doing something that they do n't know . if they do something that they do n't know the ca n't do it very well . in my opinion it 's important to find a compromise of these two idea . it 's important to try new thing in order to became successful and it 's not sufficient to do something that is already known . but it 's also important be carefull and not to take risk that can be too dangerous . it 's important to think a lot before doing something important for our success , and it 's also important to think about all variability than we can find , and all the problem that we can find when we try to do something that we have never do before . i say these thing because i am very carefull . i do n't be the kind of person that try to do something new without thinking about all consequence that the action can produce .
