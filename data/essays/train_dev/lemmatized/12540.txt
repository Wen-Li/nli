it is often said that selling product honestly is the most important commercial norm . however , i would like to maintain that effective advertisement help the product approach to customer because i believe that packaging product is more important than the product itself and advanced promotion of the product must be crucial before their launching in market . first , outer appearance which can be described a packaging or design is really important for customer . some of them may think highly of it rather than inner element . for instance , we can witness modern economic conception of marketing . it give different value to product except the actual productive quality . when we see the advertisement of apple 's ipod or starbucks , we do not only consider it flavor or taste , but their design , logo , symbol etc . for modern customer , design must be one of the important criterion . therefore , great advertisement are really important to custo second , a new product can not be welcomed in market without appropriate advertisement . customers can not purchase the product unless they know it is now available . it is a fundamental function of advertisement of a new product . on the other hand , i remember a falling motor company 's advertisement dramatically changed the company 's fortune . that is korean kia motor company . although it wa about to face a bankruptcy , the company 's advertisement of a new model stimulated customer ' buying desire . we can simply see how effective advertisement provide the company with the opporunity of survival in competitive market of motor company . in summary , i would like to emphasize how advertisement are one of the fundamental step a well a of the important choice of commerce . i am also confident that appropriate advertisement would result in unchanging loyalty from customer .
