in twenty year there will be fewer car in use than there are today ? i am not able to support this point of view , ` though i wish i were ( for i do not only have no use for a car myself , but i also car a being one of the major factor that cause the greenhouse effect and global warming ) . i will ( try to ) mention several possible argument supporting the assumption that the number of car will decrease , opposing each and evry one of them right away . after that , i will try to establish further argument emphasizing my point of view . a traditional argument for the vanishing of car ha always been the worry about sufficient fuel supply . considering the need for oil on the planet and the fact this natural resource is a limited one , either the number of car will have to decrease ( for there will soon be no more fuel to run them ) or there will be new invention in the field of motor vehicle ( such a hybrid or solar car ) . the latter ha been a great wish of ecologically-conscious people . nevertheless , car lobby ( trying to maintain their traditional market ) a well a oil lobby ( trying to sell their last barrel of oil before they have to look for other occupation ) counteract such development - with great success . there ha not been a considerable evolution regarding motor vehicle which could end the dependency on oil : hybrid car , for example , still use fossil fuel ( for otherewise they were ` pure ' ) ; solar car on the contrary do n't have the ` performance ' which is demanded an wanted from a car . still , the former alternative may be relevant : the end of oil . opposing this argument , one ha to mention that oil company ( a stated above ) will attempt to sell all the oil available on the planet , which will take another 50 year approximately . therefore , until oil 's gone , the car remain and they 'll remain at least another 50 year . another argument is that of the development of public transport , which is very easy to answer by referring to the countless remote place and region on the planet , which will hardly ever be supplied with public transportation vehicle such a train or bus . one rather sophisticated argument , the one i consider the most rational one , is the reference to the social ( infra ) structure of large city , which make car often aviodable , e.g. by using subway or monorail . yet , there are more than 6 billion people on the planet . not all of them can inhabit such highly-developed city and are therefor dependent on car . to my very own mind , a very decisive argument is that car do not only fulfil a purpose of trnsportation , but tey are also considered a status symbol . people want to ` show off ' with their car . this need hav made ecocologally-poor company like gm so successful , and in my mind must be a major argument for car maintaining a plague on our planet .
