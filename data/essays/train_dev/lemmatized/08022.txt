`` nothing is better than to be youth ! '' , is somethin that my grandfather is reminding me about everytime we meet . so maybe it 's something true about it . i personaly agree with the statement . there are much more young people , who seem to be confident and happy about their life than in the elder population group . the biggest fascination about being young , is the freedom you have and all the posibilities that still can be reached . when your young you can make mistake and wrong decision , which doe n't mean you have failed for ever . there is always something new to see or to do when your young . for example get in contact with people from all over the world . travel wherever you want to , and work where you decide . the life can be so unexpectable and spontanious while being a teenager or student . if you 're bored by your situation , a a student you have the complete range of possibility to change your life , and to enjoy again . in my opinion , to be old , is the absolutly other way around . if you have an own familiy , which of course can be very nice too , you ca n't change the way of your life immediatly - what young people can do . later on , you hardly can change anything , including a boring job you 're put into . many old people seem to me frustrated and unhappy about their life - unfortunately there is hardly any solution for them . to show up the sitiuation even more clearly , i would argue that young peolpe change the world and the rule of life . the older people just follow the newborn trend . and i don ; t have to emphasice that it is better to controll others , to enjoy every new development is the plessure of the youth and not of the older one , do i ? for many old people their last plesure is to see their relative achieving and growing up . they follow the life of others people and not their own . .. truely frustrating . the option of get new hobby , or ability is something exciting . but this is mainly reserved to the 17-32 yearold group . i am peronaly very confident and lucky eith my life and in my life , and enjoy every day , all the possibility and oportunities . car
