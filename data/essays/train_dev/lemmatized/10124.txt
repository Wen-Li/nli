no , i firmly contradict the statement that in twenty year there will be fewer car in use than there are today . cars are used for the purpose for the travelling from one part to the another and it is considered luxurious and the most important medium of travelling . so , we can expect a development in the technology to provide more and more car which will have a very good mileage and will be comfortable with seat and it 's pick-ups , instead of decline in their number in the next twenty year . say for example , there were old fashioned maruti car ( maruti 800 , maruti van ) and ambassador car in the 1980s but with the recent development in the technology of car ( like the maruti suzuki swift , scorpio , tata indica ) , it ha improved the vehicle capability very efficiently . that is accepted from more individual that maor and more car will be seen on the road in the next twenty year . so revolution is in all the field and also in the automobile engineering , so that research will make better car in future and the purchaser will purchase it and so more car will be seen . another important example is that the busyness of the big city is more increasing day afterday . so , we can say that there are more and more car seen on the road a it wa seen twenty year before and so the prediction are accepted with evidence . from the pollutio 's point of view it is seen that the city get heavily polluted due to the carbon monoxide and smoke which is more and more enforced into the air by the vehicle but the increase in the vehicle is the obvious thing from this point of view , and the most important factor from this the increase in the number of car , purchased by the people and run on the road with more and more in number day by day . so , i support the development of technology , so i , not only support the increase in the number of the car in the next twenty year , but firmly agrees it . so , the above statement is is not at all acceptable from my point of view .
