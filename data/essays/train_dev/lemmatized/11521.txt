i think that actually it is better to specialize in one specific subject rather than have a broad knowledge of many academic subject ; because in this way a person will have a great knowledge of it 's own campus and will be able to investigate more about it , get deep into it , and dedicate enough time to get a complete management of this subject . our world is specialized , everything is divided and classified . everything is organized and put in a way that every little thing is different to the other . the perfect examaple of this is a carreer in college . the program are divided into faculty and the career that a person can pick of , like : engineering , business , teaching , music , medicine , etc . every single one of the mentioned before is specialized in a field of studie , and deal with different aspect of knowledge , math , biology , language , politics , etc . a world of possibility . it is not possible to a human being know all about something ; just a little bit of everything . if a person dedicates it 's entire life to study astronomy ; investigate , make study , ask question , promote project , etc. , surely will get far and will adquire a huge knowledege in this field . that person will go beyond than someone who study a little bit of many academic subject . this take time and effort , and there is not enough time in a human being 's life to get knowledge in many many different subject and get a far a if there is specializing in one specific subject . in the school , the kid get all the basic knowledge they need to start . then is their decision to go for the subject that they are more interested on . this doe not mean that a person ha to specialize in one and only one subject and can not know anyhting about anything else . this just mean that that person will be more wise in that specific field and will contribute more to society and the world . specialize in one specific subject is equal to a better and deepest understading of it .
