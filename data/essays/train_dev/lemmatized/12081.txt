i agree that knowing broad knowledge of many academic subject is better than just knowing one specific subject . the first reason is that knowing just one specific subject period is over . knowing about one specific subject is important but with one subject is not enough . in ancient time many people tried for a long time with just one way and our generation 's goal is to combine the knowledge of many academic subject and improve it with uniq idea , for example , these day biomath and computer programing based on math analysis is important rather than just math and biology and computer , so combining the many academic knowledge is important . the second reason is that today we need more practical thing occured by subject . for example in math , many people think that math doe n't need in real life . but math is used in computer , music , we can fine nature ha a paterns of math and also it is used in health and biology , that mean we have to find new away to use our knowledge with many other academic subject to improve out society and world . from above , it is important to look and know about other subject because combining the many subject 's knowlege and making paratical thing by these subject make our world strong and improve .
