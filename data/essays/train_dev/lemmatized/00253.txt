i do n't think that this statement is correct . in germany young people have the choice between `` zivildienst '' and the `` bundeswehr '' . most young people say `` no i do n't wa n't to go to the army ( bundeswehr ) '' and instead spend nine `` social month '' ( zivildienst ) in for example hospital or `` altenheime '' a place where old people can go and where they live until the end of there life . in that nine month , every young person can help their community and the hole society . in germany the social sector wouldn'y be able to survive without these `` zivildienstleistende '' , the guy who do n't want to go to the army . i for myself did n't want to go to the army because they could't tell my when i can go there and when i would be finish . so i decided that i make these `` social nine month '' . these nine month gave me the oppertunity to help old people , speak and listen to him and to give them a good feeling . it maybe sound cracy , but old people are realy happy when they see me coming . often they are left alone , nobody of there familie come to visit them so they are happy to have someone to talk with . i also think that there are many young people who do a lot without earing money for it . in my freetime i play handball in a club and every year we organize a big party where about 600 people have always ( ! ) a lot of fun . to organize such a event you need a lot of people and everybody help to make this possible again , year after year . what i want to say with this is very simple . the money that is earned with this party is spend for the smalest child in the club . they get new ball or tshirts . all the money is spend for a good use . here this is called social engagement and i think the different form of engagement are also under the young part of the society still not dead . a lot of young person want to tell the older one there idea to help and to make the different event much better for everyone . another example in my opinion is the pope visit in colone at the `` world child day '' . over 500.000 young people wanted to see pope benedikt . that show me that on the one hand religion is not dead ( insted it come back ! ) and on the other hand that a lot of young people whant to `` push '' society and there community forward . in the last time you can hear much ofter guy that want to publish there opinion to take influence at the public meaning . i think young people do a lot more to help there community a in the past , even if the way young people chose is often not that understud a young people want to .
