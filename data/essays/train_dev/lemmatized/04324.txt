the given statement is , `` young people enjoy life more than older people do '' . most of the people agree with this statement a the present generation ha much advanced environment for entertainment and lot of new place to hang out in group . i like to disagree with the statement . as i have mentioned in the earlier paragraph , it might seem a if younger people enjoy life more than older one doe . but that is not true according to my concern . in the present generation one could notice that the technology have been improved and ha lead to the next level in advancement . this , in addition increase the study in science and in other area . in order to compete in the world , young people have to study more and automatically spends more time working , in order to improve the skill . i would like to add the phrase , work hard and enjoy later . if a person enjoys life in his young age , he definitely can not compete with the future generation and hence suffer in his old age . but in the case of a person who work hard in the young age , can make good fortune so that he would lead a safe and peaceful life in the later age . also . only at the young age , people would be physically fit compared to to the aged one and furthermore have good stamen to do hardwork . i would like to add a real time example to support my statement . all the personality whom we have hear 'd and come across in our life would have worked hard in their early age . i think everyone would accept this fact . i would like to point out a person known to me who is leading a happy and fortune life . in his early age , he use to work at textile factory based on daily wage . there he studied his work keenly and worked hard so that he became permanent employee and got promoted . later with his knowledge , that he gained from his experience he started an individulal unit outside that manufactured the spare part which the company is , frequently in need of . now he is one of the major supllier of spare part for that company . any person who life prosperous life and who is assumed to be one of well known personality would have worked hard in their earlier life . thus working hard in early time give fruitful result that make people enjoy ther later life period .
