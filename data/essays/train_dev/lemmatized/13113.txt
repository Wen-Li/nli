nowadays , the business of automobile is in great expansion . everyone use it in his everyday life because we often do activity , work or study very far away from home . having a car ha become the objectif of everyone who ha his driver license . i 'm in this case . but it becomes more and more a problem of society . as far a i 'm concerned , i think that a lot of reason will show u that driving a car is dangerous for the environement and that it 's useless . i think that the development transport will replace the need of having a car . we can go almost everywhere in france for example with the train and in time record ! we do n't need car to make a trip ! moreover , the public transport in city are the best way to move . it becomes really difficult to find park and we are everyday stuck in traffic jam . in paris for exemple , we earn time to use the metro because the authority do everything for driving a car to be a nightmare and a lost of time . people become stressed and it ha an impact on the relation between them . but in fact , the action of the authority ha a link with envirement . there is so much pollution everywhere and especially where car are very present that everything is done to dissuade people to take the car . associations and lobby who are imvolved in envirement question try to show u how dangerous for our future it is to drive car . i think that my generation understand the danger and will be ready in twenty year to use the other way of locomotion if they are enough and concsiensously developped . the only thing which will change this prediction is the business of electric car which are le dangerous for the future !
