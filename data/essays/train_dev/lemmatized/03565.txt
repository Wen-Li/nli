are we human or machines ? society ha been developing in many different way according to human necesseties . this human vision ha gone dissapeard . actually we move in a very high stressed world , ( obviously , in developed country ) , that sometimes doe not allow to people to increase their human value and their helping in their community . probably , many year ago , young people did not used to do such thing that young people , at this moment do . we had more relathionships each other 's and also we had more dependence on the rest of the people . industrialisation , technical development , new discovers , independence , competition , stress . .. have really made changing the world . firstly , parent want to give to their child all they had n't when they were child , and in many case they are making a mistake , and in this way young people ca n't think in thing ' value and the cost of them . secondly , sometimes child schedule is like a minister schedule . i mean , it seems that they have to full all their time in the whole day , going school , learning music , learning , sport , language , and many other thing that you could imagine . after that , they arrive at home totally exhausted , so they do n't have the strong enough to spend another part of their time helping their community . at least , this is what is happening in medium class family in spain , the place where i live . thirdly , they have a great adversary , television !!! oh my god !! i think it is the principal and horrible nowadays ' enemy of our young people , they coul spend all theri time watching it . finally , i must say that we coul try to avoid many thing and to be more creative with our child , and incentivate them to value human relathionships , only in this way they could probably help their community .
