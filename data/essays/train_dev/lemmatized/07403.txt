i agree with the statement that the number of car in use will be reduced twenty year from now . automobiles definetely ha brought a drastic change in the way people use to travel before . the car especialy have added a lot of comfort and pleasure to the people 's life . with car available at a cost , affordable to most of the people the number ha increased drastically & will even increase in future a well . this increase in the number of car tend to create traffic jam , which is the most common site especially in an over populated country like india . so when the road are blocked due to innumerable number of vehicle , it is obvious that it take long time to reach your destination & if this becomes the daily routine it vexes the people , so they ultimately look for alternate mode of transport , like the train or other mean of public transport . the train & the other transport system definetely reach earlier & also spare the driver from the stress he encouters while driving on his own on the busy street . these factor definetely encourage him to use train more often & use his car le . with increase in travelling time , people also tend to stay in house closer to work place , so that they can walk over the distance rather than to fight the traffic with the car . with increasing awareness regarding the hazard of air pollution & the effect it ha on health of human , the people twenty year from now i think will be much more sensible and use le number of car to keep the earth 's environment cleaner & safer for future generation to come .
