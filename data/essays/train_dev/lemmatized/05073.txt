i definetly agree with the statement : `` most advertisement make product seem much better than they really are '' because , if i am not mistaken , it ha always been a use of persuation to perfectionized material who lack characteristic . the advertisement company do this because it is their job to captivate the attention of all human being . if they did make product seem better that they are we will live in a world full of boring and unuseful thing . for example , let 's stay on entire day in front of a television watching and analyzing commercial . how many time people have seen a mcdonald 's or a burguer kings commercial with a gigantitc , juicy , and the most fresh vegetable ever seen ? always . why ? becuase it attracts people , it make people want and desire thing the really do not want . in myentire life have i eaten a burguer like i just explaines ? no . people often confuse reality with illusion . commercial ar specifically made to make people beleive they will find and eat the best burguer they have tasted in their life . another example is the big board in the middle of the road . those big board are made to catch , immediately the attention of the driver and the passenger . the big board are often filled with announcement of new clothing , a new alcoholic beverage , a concert , new kind f food , etc . i think the best way to make product seem , a little more of what they are , by this method . this methos is simple and acquirate , and will help u catch the true glance , freshness , originality of the product . as people know , we live and will always live in a world full of unrealistic and illusory advertisement in order to get people to want , buy , feel , taste the product they are announcing . it is just a metter of how much we are going to let ourselves be persuaded and how much and to what extent we are going to let people sell u thing they know they are unable to produce or give .
