i agree with this sentence , since i think invention are the base for development of human culture . everyone go on doing what he had always done , but in this way world will stop in a specific situation and maintain it shape forever to our eye . i will give two simple example about this to confirm what the sentence say . the first example regard invention . if all people in the evolution of human being had used what had been previously discovered by someone else , probably now we would use stone to make fire . so , risk is the key world . it , s important trying something new , even if it will not be usefull , to improve our situation day by day . the second example is relateds to my own experience . i had never played yoga until three month ago , bacause i thought it wa boring and not so usefull a other people said . then i wa forced by my girlfriend to attend a free lesson , and my life is completely changed . now i fill very relaxed , and not always angry for everyday problem . if i had n't risked three month ago , if i had continued with my opinion on yoga , now i would n't have filled so good . and nothing ha really changed apart from the course , but now i approach situation in a more positive way . for tall these reason , i will give a final suggest : `` do n't stop trying ''
