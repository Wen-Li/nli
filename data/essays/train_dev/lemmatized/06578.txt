productivity and profit are the core aspect of our economy , this way , company advertized to improve the image of their product . the result is that most advertisement make product seem much better than they really are . they emphase on the main quality of their product in order to be attractive and of course do n't focus on the defect , or le attractive effect . fisrt of all , advertisement are maid to spread the knowledge on a specific product , in order for the customer to buy it . of course it ha to be attractive and to show specific ability . it can look much better than it really is . for example , take the pill that reduce the weight , it commounly sell miracle a one is supposed to loose kilo in one week . that seems great , and someone willing to loose a size would be tented . the advert doe n't explain that it must be associated with a strict diet to be effective , and customer will certainly be disapointed . on the other hand , it wo n't be a effective if they expose how it really work , people will be more carefull , and the main purpose of the advertisement would't be reached in term of quantity . but it also true that a satisfied customer will easily purchase again the product , and have a better effect in the length . for example , the yogurt that explains they reduce not only the fat but also the sugar , and taste good , is explaining everything about the diet , in contradiction with a lot of produts that claim they are 0 percen fat but contain a lot of sugar the customer can also ask for advice before purchasing and thus have a real idea of the product . he can also compare different product and choose the one that match his requierements . most advertisement make the product look better , but the customer is aware that everything is not said or explained , he must read between the line and use his personal experience and knowledge .
