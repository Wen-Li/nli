i agree with quote because that they ca n't just only stay in what they already know they have to try new stuff just like what already , they should get more experience . another reason that i agree with the passage because try new stuff never make you hurt your self but it make you learn lot of thing from these new thing , and maybe . if you success you can try to conected on your work , it probably will get you better . things is for you to find out but is not for them to fid you this is a very simple thing to understand . but some of them think that if they try new stuff maybe they will probably lose lot of stuff from what they usually have . this is why they dont try new stuff , because they are afraid and they think they will lose every thing . why lot of rich people are success , because they take a chance to try what they got and what is new for them , and they are not afraid of it . it really depends on if you want to give a chance or not , however if you doe not try you still can be successful , taking a chance is really a good optunity for you to get new stuff . this make me think alot on how people use what kind of point of view to make what kind of diction . every one ha a different point of view and they all think it in a different , some of them think it in a nagtive way but some of them dont . this is really important point about how they think about trying new thing . when ever the chance come , you should take a shot to try , because it never hurt you it only be a better person . chance is not always stay beside you , so doe trying new styff . so i think every one sould at least try once .
