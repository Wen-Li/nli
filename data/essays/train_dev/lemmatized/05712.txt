i agree about this topic . most people want to acheive what they are doing . and they do n't satisfy about that . they continue to try new thing and they want more thing . for example , in my country we have `` samsung '' company . and it is biggest company in my country . they are trying a lot of thing even they are the biggest campany in the country . today another country use samsung compant too . this campany is already international company . but , they are continue trying for another thing . i think this become to be biggest company . if people already got a successful life , so they stop what are they doing . then another people will break thing and be higher . for example , i know a one preson like this case . he regent about thing . and trying to be a better life . but it is hard to built that he made . everybody have to try new thing , and do hard about what they have . i think people have to be more polite when they have a successful life . and have to work hard . human do n't satisfy about one thing . in my case i do n't satisfy one thing that i did successfuly . i find new thing and i want to achieve that successfully . even the animal do something successfully they find another thing to do . and they want better life than before . everybody in the world want successful life and they wil continue to try new thing . for this reason we are living better life than before . if they did n't try new thing , than our life will not be different 200 year ago and now . therfor , in my opinion i agree about this topic . and i will also continue to try new thing .
