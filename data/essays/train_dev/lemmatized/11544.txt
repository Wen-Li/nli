i think both point are equally important in college but in your later life it would be more important to understand the argument and basic than to learn the fact off by hard . nobody can understand a theme just by learning simple fact , it is the complex idea that make someone understand . everybody can learn thing off by hard , but not everyone understands the material . and the understanding for me make a person grow not only it mind but also it personality . but still there are some benifits to both side . when i had history class in school for instance , i wa always really good in understanding the idea and concept that were discussed , but always when i had to write an exam i had problem to remember important date . and that is what history mainpoint is , is n't it ? the result wa that i never got a better mark than a three . that is just the average mark in germany . but when i started to study the date which resemble the fact in the question . i suddenly got much better mark . on the other hand if i just knew the date i would have gotten a much worser mark , because i probably would n't have understood any of the assignment . but i also think that there are case where you just have to know simple fact . in some part of biology , chemistry , physic and math , in all science . i mean if you have to lable body part of an animal or human , there is no way in doing that without knowing the fact . an eye is an eye and not a leg , this is quite obvious . the same is with mathematical formula , this are fact you really need to know to get a good mark , because there is no way to get a solution without them , except you are a good a einstein and you derive the formula on your own , but i think even for a genious it would not work out right to do that . chemistry and physics are just the same . also in this subject there are big part where you can not go far without the understanding of idea and main concept , especially not in higher level science . i think the the two skill of understanding idea and learning fact are interrelated . a good student really need both . but in conclusion i would still say that understanding is much more important , because in later life you will not get a job by just telling the pythagorean theorem . but you have to understand basic idea .
