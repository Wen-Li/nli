advertisements are the most important and most effective toll in order to present a new product and to make that product to be desired by customer . i absolutely agree that most advertisement make product seem much better that they are . it is not certain that when first advertisement emerged and and how it wa . but , it is a fact that , advertising affected the life of people not only the producer but also the customer . today beyond the developing technology , teh producer can present their product to whole world . this is done by satellite television , news paper , or internet . as the producer konw that their product can be followed by all of the peole in teh world , they try to pull attention of those people with different and strange type of advertisement . for instance , one of the worldwide known trade mark use football player who are very famous all over the world . by this way , the owner like to give a message to the people such that : `` do you see , most famous sport men use my product , so why you do not ? '' . even though that product is not very good really , the people - due to that advertisement - believe that product is the best . an assumption may make the idea more clear . assuming that there is a new kind of drink and no one knowns anything about it , the producer absolutely know that the drink is not a good a other existing drink in the market . but s/he design a very effective and impressive advertisement . what will be the possible affect of this advertisement ? when the people ( potential customer ) see that advertisement , they will think that the drink must be very good and delicious . so they will be forced unconciously to buy that drink and - at least - try it . this tendency to buy that product is totally due to the effect of the advertisement . all in all , advertising is a very wide area in the world due to all of the people can know about the product very easily . not all but some advertisement are designed in order to make people pay attention to the product , because the people who present the advertisement know that pulling attention of the customer is the first step of forcing them to buy the product . therefore , most of the advertisement , today , are just tool to show product much more better than they really are .
