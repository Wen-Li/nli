some people think that lessand le car will be used in the future , while others belive that traffic is only going to get worse with time . even if i would like the first thing to happen , i am not very optimistic about it , and i will now explain the main point that support my answer . first of all , i am afraid that if we take into account the entire world and not only the developed country , we can see that in many region having a car is still a luxury that not everybody can afford . but a these place get more and more advanced , car will be introduced a they were in europe and america a long time ago . as an example , when i wa traveling throgh south america last year , i came across something that surorised me . even in remote spot along the amazon river , people managed to get car or motorcycle , and this not only wa a sign of their wealth , but also a mean of living . but the main idea here is that only five year before that , there wa not a single car in that area , and they said that each month the number of car wa increasing really quickly . on the other hand , we could think that in twenty year there will not be enough petrol reserve in the world to keep up with the fast growing in the number of car . nevertheless , i am sure that alternative way of power will be developed a soon a the act of obtaining and trading with petrol is no longer profitable enough . in a word , although i dream with a world with le pollution and traffic jam , i can not deny the fact that , a it wa said in a very famous movie or play , `` money make the world go round '' . therefore , i am afraid that while having a vehicle help a person to have a better life , no-one will exchange that for a better place to live in .
