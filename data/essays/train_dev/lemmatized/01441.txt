i agree with the following statment because the person would have more general knowledge than knowing only about one specific subject and having other subject are for extra creditation and lead to a more smart and informative student . specializing in one specific subject is good because it concentartes on what the student would be willing to do int he future and what he want he be , thats why he want to be specialized in one specific topic but it also ha a negative effect on the person because then he wont know any other information but only about his specific subject . for instance a student want to specialize in buisness and he take subject that only deal with business and nothing more , and when he want to change his mind it would be very hard for him to change his subject in the future because he only took for a specific subject . having other academic subject would help the student to have seek more knowledge and have more information and he would actually be better in his specialized subject from the help of other subject . specializing in only one subject will then be boring because the student would be working and studying the same subject over and over again in which he wont have other subject or elective that would be different and give him different information . if a student specilaized in one specific subject and then in the end fails that subject then that would be a big loss and after all the student have been through he fails , so if he had different subject and the subject he want to take , atleast if he fails in his specialized subject he ha other subject to turn to incase failure occurs . having other academic subject is better than specializing in one subject for alot of reason which are negative and positive .
