the advertisement announces are invading the space of city , the radio , the tv etc . fot this reason some people ca n't stand them , furthermore other people consider them a a type of `` art '' . those are simply personal opinion , but , the real problem is when the advertisement do n't say the truth . it 's a great problem like all lie . some people think that is n't a problem and thay say that the person ha a skill to decide a product indipendently on basis the only functionals of the product . but i disegree this opinion because often the advertisement do n't speak about the only functionals of the product but it promise other characteristic that do n't depend by it . in conclusion the advertisement must be controlled and they must speak about the product only with it real characteristic .
