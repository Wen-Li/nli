cars are one of the best invention that ever been made eventhough it ha many advanteges and disadvanteges like pollution and transporting faster on the other hand but `` people say that in twenty year there will be fewer car than there are today '' well i definatlly agree with this statment beacuse in twenty year the tecnology will be better that today . the tecnology will rise and many other invention will be made there will be car but not anymore on disel or petrollium . the car will work on the battery or there will be a car that is made up from glass that wil trap the sunlight and store them for the car to move . there will also be people that drive airoplanes or maybe ship . .. even that now adays we have plane and ship but in twenty year plane and ship will be used a much a people use car now . . before 20 year or maybe more than that , there wa few car , people used to transport with animal and only a few of them used to have car , car were expensive and that what will happen to the generation after twenty year . . plane and ship will be le expensive than now . also many new kind of transportation and new idea will be disscoverd . . people may start living on the moon or on other planet so for sure they will be invention to drive there or to transport . . finally time move fast and no one know what will happen next but we know that many thing are changing , technology is rising and idea are comming up from many clever person and i hope that i 'll be one of them someday . to invent a new way of transportation that will make it easier and more useful than the car so everyone will use without causing pollution and be comfortable with .
