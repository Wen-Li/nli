we live in a rapidly evolving world , so we can hardly predict the change that will occur in the future . the tecnologycal progress , in particular , modifies any aspect of daily life ( instruction , communication , transport , etc . ) . at the same time , progress involves serious and unpredictable problem , such a pollution . some people belive that in twenty year there will be fewer car in use than there are today . according to them , the rapid development of alternative kind of transport will risult in a progressive decreasement of the use of car . faster , cheaper and more advanced machine will replace car . on the one hand , sophisticated airplane and high-speed train will provide a good alternative to car for a long journey . on the other hand , efficient public transport should replace car in the city . in my opinion , these prediction are quite excessive . first of all , the entity of economic interest involved in the car market is too relevant to desappear in a few year . in addition , even in relatively developed country , such a italy or portugal , the public transport system is still obsolete and not efficient , and it could hardly replace car . however , although car will remain an essential part of our daily life , it will be necessary to modify radically their production tecnology , in order to face the problem of pollution . the more car will be used , the more they will be echological .
