many people feel that most product seem much better than they really are . i strongly agree with this statement because a a customer i deeply feel how different the product on advertisement and in the reality . the purpose of advertisement is to attract our eye . after customer are been attracted they will most likely to try and buy the prodcuts . when we look at the advertisement on the cosmic product , we will get an idea . most lady love to have the same smooth and soft skin a the model on the tv so they spend a lot of money on it . the reality is , when we buy the product and use it for a while , the effect is not worth the price . the brand lancom is not really worth the price being charged in the store . some advertisement is pointed toward certain population . calcium , for example , is often being misunderstood by customer . it usually consume by the woman and eldes , and they wish to have stronger bone . however , the calcium is being discribed a something ha a magical power on the advertisement , so a famouse brand is much expensive than a regular brand . the reality is if you only take calcium without expose yourself under the sunshine , calcium ha no affect on your body at all . the purpose of advertisement is simple but the expense is quite expensive . some company spend a lot of money on the advertisement so they probrably will reduce the money they spend on the product . in some place , the company put old and new stuffing in their sweet dumpling , but they put on the advertisement is `` the most delicious and fresh treats '' . in general , advertisement is a tool of the business guy to sell their product . a nice and attractive word and picture are essential to them . however , a consumer , we realy need to pay attention to the money we spend and do not get fooled by the advertisement .
