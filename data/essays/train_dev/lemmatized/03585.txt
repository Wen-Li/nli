although a broad knowledge of many academic subject can make a person very interesting , i really consider that nowadays the promotion of specialization is better for many reason . firstly , if a person is focused in a particular subject he or she is going to feel very motivated to improve his or her knowledge , because it is his or her election and probably he or she really like that field . moreover , specialization is very important when you are a job seeker , particullarly when you are looking for your first job . there is not any chance for people knowing many thing in a superficial view ; oit is easier to find a job if you are an expert in a particular field . i can concide that a broad knowledge is useful sometimes , for example when you have to manage a small company with a short staff . but that is not usually the common case because most of the people work in medium or large company . thus , the proportion of people working under the umbrella of general thinking leader is quite higher than the number of leader itself . usually a general knowledge is enough to fit properly your specific subject in the framework where it must be insert . we can consider also this dilemma is the history . if the modern society have promoted the broad knowledge more than the specialized one , it would have been impossible such a fantastic development . in summary , although a broad knowledge is necessary sometimes , society had better promote deeper knowledge in the challenge that we are facing , and for that the specialization must be a priority .
