some people say that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide beause of convenience and obtaining information by tour guide . both way of this argument have advantage . however i would side with that best way to travel is alone without tour guide because of free and beneficial experience . now then i wll present this opinion by considering these two advantage . on the one hand , traveling with a group led by tour guide might be said to cause advantage . on top of that if people travel with their guide they enjoy their tour conveniently . in other word the schedule is already settig so people just travel without thinking such a where i am and then and so on . in addition the tour guide give the tour information whenever people travel about there information . when i wa in high school i travel america led by tour guide the tour guide make my family feel convenience . on the other hand , . travelig alone without tour guide would give many advantage . firstly , if people travel alone they enjoy free and without inference and they can wander anywhere that they want . if oppurtunity to travel is given to me i want to travel swiss that i want to go . secondly , trveling alone is good choice by experience directly . in other word this is useful to social peronrelationship and social experience . so traveling is very good . all thihs considered , two way is both best way . however i think that traveling is more beneficial and the best way . that 's because free is more important to me that convenience led by tour guide . eventually , i thik that the best way to travel is alone .
