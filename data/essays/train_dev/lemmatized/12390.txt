one of the most important thing in humann life is to have a hope or a goal that he achive to do . no one can live without a dream . but the dream of people are different from one to another . some people all there dream are to have a personal benefit while other people - who love their land before theirselves - always want to do anithing to benifit the humanity . well i thing that every one must to have a dream to benifit the humanity for several reason . the fir reason for me to say that there is n't any person who can live without the modern life advantage . noone can live without a tv , a computer , cold water etc . imagine that the famous scintest adeson-who invent the electrical light - ha said that `` i do n't want to invevt anything , all my hope is to relax and rest '' . if such a conversation had happend so you would find the earth now dark with no light . so this great scientest sacrifice his time to do somthing to his community , and therfor you hear his name in every where . the second reason i think is that , you every day take from earth and from socity . thus , you must pay back those thing by thinking about other people and thinking about the future of earth and try your best to improve it . finaly , and for the reason i listed above , i think it is very clear that every boday must think about his community and do his best to give him every thing that you have to mark your name in the book of earth history , and to pay back a small part of the huge thing that the earth ha given you .
