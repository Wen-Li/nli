the issue at hand is whether or not is necessary to take risk to succeed in life . i think this is a very important issue because it ha to do with our personal behaviour and most of all with the way everybody look at life in general . i am convinced that the only way to have success is to take risk and to try to walk road that nobody walked before . my first reason to support my thought is my own experience . when i finished the university in florence , i decided to come to mexico because i wa convinced that i would have greater opportunity to realize my dream than if i had remained in italy . i took the risk to go to a new country but today i can say that it worth . another reason why i think risk is strictly correlated to success is because i am convinced that all the way that take you to success must be difficult . as much your dream is bigger a much it will be more difficult to realize . but difficulty naturally implies risk , because without taking any risk thing are much easier to realize , but also they give you le success . of course not everybody like to take risk . as i mentioned before it depends on our personal behaviour . on one hand there are some people that enjoy life without taking any risk , following a routine that they already know very well . on the other hand there are some people that look at life a a continous change , a taking risk all the time . i think i belong to the second group of people a i get bored very easy when i am doing the same thing . for all these reason i conclude that people who think of success a the main goal of their life , must take risk and trying new thing a many time a they can . the bigger the risk , the greater the success .
