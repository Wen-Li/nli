in a first approach , we may think that young people enjoy life more than older people do . young people , and even more very young people like child , do n't take into account several factor of the life , and they seems to enjoy life . for example , the every-day-life of a child is not a much difficult a one of an adult . someone take it to the park , he can play with the other child , even if he doe n't know them , the communication is very easy . then when he go back home , he do n't have to take care of the lunch or dinner , he just have to seat or to be seated and he eats . he doe n't have to buy product , to cook them and so on . elder child seems still to enjoy life , and therefore they are more independant than when they were baby . they do n't have yet to borrow of earning one 's living , they must just have their homework done . then , when one become an adult , several problem appear . first , after having chosen to make study or not , one must find a job , and then a appartment . then there are the tax . but people are independant . between 50 year old and 65 or 70 year old , some people have accumulated money , and they can now have the benefit of it . they have no more young child , they may travel when they want or just where they want . of course , the elderly people , living either in their own house or in a retirement house , do n't seem to enjoy life a mush a the younger do . of course the death ca n't be further and further . .. so they must enjoy every event , even if it may look very common for the younger people .
