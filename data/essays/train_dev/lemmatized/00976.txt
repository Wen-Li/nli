i do not think that young people enjoy life more than older people do . for me , enjoying life is not a question of age , it can depend on society , freedom and possible activity . in a hedonistic society , an elderly could enjoy a much life a a middle aged man or even a child , for they would all live for fun and for the moment . indeed , carpe diem is a motto who could make an old person enjoy even more life than a younger one would . freedom is also a factor for slave , prisonners or a paralised man can not enjoy life a much a a free man would . to be albe to move and do what you want to do when you whant to do is esential for a full enjoyment of life . adopting this point of view , it is also possible to add money a a criterion to enjoyememt of live . possible activity is also a major factor . by saying activity , i refer to cultural activity , in direct opposition with survival activity such a eating or sleeping . to have nothing to do will not allow you to enjoy life . this is where the conflict between young and older people reveals itself , for some say that older people have le numerous and interesting activity than the young . i would argue that it is untrue . i must first claim that the number of activity itself is not essential , a long a monotony and boredom are not reached . the interset of the activity is a different matter . young people , and i must admitt that i include myself , commonly find that activity destined to older peolpe are le interesting . added with the fact that older people usualy addmitt to miss their activity they dissmissed a long time ago we can think that the statement is true . on the other hand , if we ask to older people if they would start their old activity again , most would refuse . we must see that activity for the younger are not banned from the elderly , it is them who no longer want them . activities are more or le interesting depending on the point of view . hence we may say that enjoying life is not a matter of age and that older people may enjoy life even more that young people if they encounter the right condition .
