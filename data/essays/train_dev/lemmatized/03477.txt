i totally disagree with this opinion . to me , the best way to travel is to visit a country alone , or in a reasonably small group of friend . when i travel around , i want to discover the real nature of the country i visit and i want to decide alone the thing i want to see , and these thing are not possible in a guided tour . guided tour are maybe an optimal solution for old people who are not totally independant , for people who are afraid of the fence that foreign language can create , or for people who do n't want to spend much time abroad . but this option is definetely not an option for me . guided tour sell you organised , prepared , `` pre-chewed '' travel . they make you run from one hotel to a point of interest , from one restaurant to a pseudo `` traditional '' show . you can visit france in 2 day , europe in a week , and have a picture of you in front of all the must you `` have to see '' . i want to have time to feel the atmosphere of a country i visit . i want to explore the hidden region , to go out of the the beaten track . when you travel in a group , it is impossible to meet local people . you stay with your conspecific because it is easier , certainly more confortable . traveling alone force you to exchange with the local population , to speak the local language , to share the local culture . and to me , this is the most interesting part of the travel . guides in a guided tou are generally professionnal multilingual guide who are hired by the travel agency . they come from the same country and have only a specific knowledge of the country you visit . best guide are local people who can present you the really traditional aspect of their region .
