i agree the idea that `` successful people try new thing and take risk rather than only doing what they already know how to do well '' , becasue i have three model of the successful people . first , one of the three successful people is my old brother . when he wa a junior high schoo student , he did not like to study very well . he did not study , so his grade wa not good . but one day , he met a high school teacher in the town . then he thought i want to be his student , so i want to take the his school entrance exam . but the school study revel is high . i should study hard . after my brother met the teacher , he studied very hard . so he could get better grade than before , and he could be one of a student of the teacher 's high school . second , one of the three successful people is mr. toyota . he created the big and famous car company in japan . i think the company wa one of the famous car company in the world . when he wa a child , his family wa poor . becasue he must help to his family in his child age , he could not get studying oppotunity well . his father 's job wa small bike store , so when he graduate junior high school , he wa president of the small company . then he created idea of corporation like big american trrain comopanies . the idea wa very big risk then , becasue it wa not common idea in japan . today , his company became a big company . third , one of the three successful people is syoinn yoshida . he wa one of the most famous people in japan . he wa teacher in meiji era . when he wa teacher , he thought japan should learn from other contories like england or america . but then people , who go to abroad without permittion from government , wa very big crime . but he tried to go to america . he swam to the america 's big boart at the night . and he tried to go to america . but then american officer did not permit because america did not want to attack . but the story made japan courage .
