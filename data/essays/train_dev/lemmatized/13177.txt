i like to travel on my own schedule and leisure . so i disagree that the best way to travel is by being in a group led by a tour guide . for me travel signifies unwinding myself , discovering unknown thing and waking up and sleeping when i want to . by giving the tour guide control of this time and lettting him/her run my schedule would be sure shot recipe for ruining my holiday . from my childhood day i have memory of certain trip i took with my parent where they signed up for group trip with a guide a part of the package i remember being tired and bored at the end of the day . all the place we went to were predictable and crowded . but when there were day trip we made to the beach around and just lazed and played in the sand it brought me joy and the picture always were a delight to watch . one exception to this is when we visited a world famous sun temple in india which date back to several hundred year my father hired a tour guide and he explained to u the meaning of different sculpture and their significance in history since this temple wa located in one of the oldest kingdom in india . now that my husband and i go on holiday together we do not follow any schedule . the last time we went on a vacation unplanned we discovered a safari that wa not listed in any of the local attraction . we ended up staying in bamboo hut right on a strip of a private beach with it own kitchen . the adventurer in me will not let me follow any set pattern of visiting famous attraction based on someone else 's prediction of what need to be seen . of course , if i visit france i will go see the eiffel tower or any world famous attraction in that city but i may just sit on the side and observe people as i will grow older and perhaps have more time to travel , i know the wanderlust will not fade away and i would like to travel and explore the world . i also know that while travelling i will come across diverse culture and people and their food and habit . i want to use my travelling experience to know how and why people live the way they do and while i do that i hope it will help me and my family understand the world in a better way . that is the legacy i want to teach my daughter - of tolerance and understanding for people who dont necessarily eat or look like u . a group travel with a tour guide will definitely not help me achieve this . i would think it will fulfill my role a a part of this world instead of just coming home from a far away place with a momento and a memory of a luxurious hotel .
