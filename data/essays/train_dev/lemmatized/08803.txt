during the ` 70 vance packard sustained that advertisement is fake , is something that persuades every single customer and make him/her buy a product even if he/she doe n't need it or is not interested in . anyway we have to highlight the date written above : we are talking about the 70 , far and far away and moreover we have to consider the critical economical situation of that time . that 's way i firmly disagree with the one who think like packard did . just few people study advertising and it world and that 's the reason why they do n't know how advertising work in reality . it work just because many study have been done from different discipline like pscichology or sociology to understand the customer deeper . the customer knowledge help people , who have to communicate a product or an idea , to reach the target need and desire . nothing more . there is a new customer in the society , someone who just buy what he/she need or really want , is an active person who doesn ' let the advertisement decide for him/her . the buyier ha become more critical to this kind of communication and more to the one broadcast through television . it ' s also important to keep in mind that this job ha strict rule and a deontological ethic like other profession . subliminal advertisement is not allowed at all , it 's consider illegal in most of the country . even if i appreciate advertisement , i have to say that sometimes some company try to make the product more interesting to u but than ialso have to remind that we still have a great power of decision making . if only people known how advertisement really work , i 'm sure they will appreciate a i do . it 's not a dangerous a is thought . everything still depends on u . you can buy something only if you want to .
