these day , we can see so many advertisement on tv , or in newspaper . these are all very attractive , so i think advertisement is really important thing for company to sell product well . however , i think that most advertisement make product seem much better than they really are . there are several reason . first of all , i have a friend working in a section of advertisement of a company , and i heard from him about it . accoroding his talk , in fact , most of all campanies trying to make product seem much better than they really are in order to get consumer 's attention and make product popular . in addition he said that they can not win the competition with other company if there is no advertisement like that , and this situation is same a these other company , so it is neccesarily for selling product . moreover , i have experienced some of it . when i wa in highschool , i wa on baseball club of highschool . second summer in that club , my baseball shoe wa broken , so i bought a new shoe on-line . when i first saw that shoe on-line , it seems to have really good shape and beautiful sole . however , when i got the shoe , i wa so disappointed to it . it wa so different of the picture i saw on-line . as you can see , there are some opinion about it , in fact wa are attracted by that advertisement .
