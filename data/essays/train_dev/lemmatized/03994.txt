i think the human being ' life is bound to the risk factor . it ha always been so since the primitive were chasing animal with bare hand . at the time the difference between a successful and an unsuccessful person wa to live or die . our society inheritated the risk factor from our ancestor . in the actual society , made of people doing the same task everyday , taking risk is the key to success in the evryday 's life . i think that taking risk and try new thing is very important for everybody , not only for people who want to succeed . i can not imagine that we would have reached our actual wellness society if somebody had n't taken any risk . for example if the wright brother had n't tried to make their aeroplane fly , we would still be travelling land and sea but not in the sky ; by contrast many people died because of flight . maybe if the wrights did n't try we would have saved many life , but we would n't be able to travel around the world so quickly . one more example would be the longest jump made by a famous dirt bike rider . riding his motorbike he jumped 60 meter long and estabilished a new world record . if he hesitated before jumping he would n't have taken any risk but he would be just a regular rider , not the world record holder . by the same token he could have unfortunately died , but it 's the price sometimes people have to pay to succeed . i think we should manage the risk in the everyday life , but it depends on situatons and mainly on the limit . the difference between taking a risk considered fool and succeeding is so slight , but i think it 's exactly what make u different from each other . we can manage the risk and reach higher level in the university , career and society . of course the everyday work help u improve ourselves , but in the end it 's up to u to take a risk and try new thing or not .
