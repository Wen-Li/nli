i dare say that i agree the statement that it is more important for student understanding idea and concept than lerning fact . because idea and concept are fundamental value . they must know these value so that they can apply various setting . the value help student to extend their knowledge and skill too . i am a nursing major . when i wa a practitioner , i focused to learn fact . in this situation , the word `` fact '' mean some daily routine activity , such a way to clean wound or skill of checking blood sample , etc . but since medical technology is improving and most of the thing are done easily with some equipment , i do n't use the technique in these day . but we still use our knowledge to analyze the data . idea and concept last long . then , if i have unerstanding the concept , i can apply the idea to the diffrent situation . if i understand the theory that cultural background affect on people 's behavier , i can understand how to care a forein patient . if student have enough knowledge about fundamental of the area , they can apply it to other situation . it will help them to solve problem they would face . moreover , fundamental knowledge help student to extend their study . if a student wish to study in postgraduate course , the basic knowledge of the related theory are required . if i leaned only daily routine in one ward of one hospital and neglect to study the concept or idea , i could n't continue my study for the mastral digree . therefore , i support the opinion that student should make higher priority to undestand idea and concept than to learn fact . they are basic value which last long , can be applied to different scene and can be used for brushing up the level of study for student .
