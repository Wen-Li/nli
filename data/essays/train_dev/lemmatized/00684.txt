it ha been such a long time since i completed my academic education and ha been working a a professional that it is impossible for me not to agree with this statement . sooner or later school come to an end and professional world start . in the turkish educational system you have to decide on what you want to do at a very early age and that decision doe not always turn out to be the ` right ' one for you . what are you suppose to do when you realise that you have made the wrong decision at the very beginning . it is very hard to start from all over again . as an experienced professional i belive having a broad knowledge of many academic subject is always better than specializing in one specific subject , for it give you the space , in other word the freedom you need until you decide what you really want to do . it will be easier for a person with many aspect to get a job in the professional world rather than wait for the ` specific ' opportunity . when one applies for a job it will be to his benefit to be aware of many subject , for the boss are usually looking for young people with a broad vision , eager to learn and capable of applying what they have learned . i also believe that after deciding that one is on the right path , specializing in that field is inevitable if one want to promote . i would like to finish with giving an example from myself ; i graduated from business administration , i worked in a travel agency , in a factoring company and at the moment working for a non-profit organization a an expert on the european union and i owe all this to the broad knowledge of many academic subject i learned in school .
