first of all i think it hardly depends on your business wheter you should try new thing and take risk or only do what you already know how to do well . so in some job it is just important to be good at like for example someone who work at a bank and ha to check the financial situation of a company . therefore you do not have to take any risk or try something new because there are strong rule you have to keep . if you are reliable and doing this job well you can be very successful . on the other hand for example if you would like to get a successful architect you have to do something that differs you from the other architect . thus you have to be willing to take risk by for example developing some new type of style . but that is very difficult to handle because just a really small number of invention are also done in reality . so it cost you a lot of time to develope new thing not knowing wheter you will have success or not , but if you are able to create something really new and fabolous you will normally be much more successful than a person who doe not take risk and try new thing . accordingly i think you can say that everyone should try to increase his focus of view and stay in touch with new developements because nearly everyone ha to learn his whole life . you will never be able to learn everything and new aspect come to daylight every year . so everyone ha totry new thing more or le . in conclusion i would say that you should try new thing and take risk if you want to become a very successful person but you can also have success if you are just well in what you are doing . so it depends on your job and what you are willing to do .
