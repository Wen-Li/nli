my opinion on this subject is that young people can easily enjoy life , more than older people because they have le responsabilities . besides when you are young you do n't think about the consequence and about the future so you do thing older people do n't . in a way my part is that the society where we are living nowadays give u this image that young people are enjoying life being consciousness . moreover when you are young you can do mistake and people tell you it 's because you have not a lot of experience . it 's a common thought that older act better because they have experience , since ancient greek time . i think once you are older you prefer to have a simple and calm life , whithout doing some big party with a lot of alcohol and without seeing friend every time . maybe older you want to stop all this . but it can be different if your life ha been borring and if you had responsibility earlier like a child or a house to take care , maybe you will prefer a life with more action . for my part i 'd like to say that i am enjoying life studying , going to party , having a lot of friend and so on , but i know that my dad had a family very earlier so he had to work and at night could n't go with his friend because he had to study late for university or to take care of me a a baby . sometimes i think that he would have prefered a different life but he ' s enjoying now the way he life . so to respond to this question i will say that it depends on the way you want to live when you are young and especially when you are old . as far a i am concern i think this topic is a reality for u now but only the seeing part of the reality because medium for instance like to show young people in this way , it 's a discussion of society
