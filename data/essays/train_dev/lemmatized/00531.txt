there is no denying that whether young people enjoy their life more than the older people do ha become controversial , not only to professional , but also to the public a a whole . it take all sort to make the world . some believe that young people enjoy their life more than the older , and would like to put an end to it , while others who think older people enjoy their life more maintain the disagreement to it . as far a i am concerned , i vote for the latter . there are numerous reason why i choose to disagree with the given statement , and i would in here explain a few of the most important one . in the first place , it is easily observed in modern society , young people have to endure more pressure and competition that older people do . both common sense and our knowledge can inform u that most young people have to deal with peer-pressure . what 's more , in order to survive later in their life , they are facing enormous competition with other youngster . an illustrative example that can be easily found . high school student have to worry and struggle for their mark in order to acquire an considerablely good education . in contrast , old people just need to go to community centre and enjoy their life . after all thing considerred , i think the most important reason for stating older people enjoy their life more is that they are respected by younger people . in other word , their life are more appreaciated and high-classed emotionally and psychologically . an example that accompnies this point is that a senior with a family can be respected by his/her child or even grandchild . according to a recent survey by statistic canada , 80 % people whose age are below 30 believe that older people should be respected and 90 % of those who are older think they are happy and appreaciative about the respect they get from young people . nevertheless , young people 's life can be more enjoyable to some extent , such a a higher energy level they obtain in their daily life , but this merit is speculative . after considerring the bigger picture , you will think believing older people have better life is a wise option . after understanding all the reasoning above , it is now safe to say that stating older people 's life are more enjoyable is a more sagacious and wise action .
