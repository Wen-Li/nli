coming to the end of my undergraduate education in the area of molecular biology and genetics , know is the time for me to select a specific subject from my area to begin graduate study . in four year , we have covered a broad range of topic from cancer to pathogenic bacteria . definetely , knowing a bit from all topic in this scope will be a hard and unproductive task . this idea applies to interdisciplinal study in academic subject . firstly , a short glance to the academic program of any university would reveal the broadness of program . trying to obtain knowledge in all or at least in several of these area will push the limit of a normal human being . secondly , it is a fact that the more subject you learn about , the le specific information you will have on each of them . i always thought that having a shallow knowledge on many thing is not a very desirable thing . i am a person who would like to be focused on one thing and dive into deepness of that thing . another thing is that , a person excelling on one particular subject is given supplementary information from other area . in other word , you do not see the life of cell for four full year in molecular biology , it is blended with mathematics , physic and chemistry . a last reason for why i am opposing the idea of having a broad knowledge of many subject is because i believe that everyone should be contained in their own subject and should not jump to the others ' . if i knew statistic a good a i knew microbiology ; why would there be a need for a statistician ? to conclude my discussion , i would again like to emphasize the importance of co-working of expert from different area in harmony to achieve the big thing , rather than one person trying to know and achieve everything just by himself .
