marketing is an activity that ha grown fast and steady for the last few decade . some argue that it is exclusively a lucrative , almost an inmoral activity . others regard it a creative and valuable a art . probably the fact that ha been critisized more convincingly is the fact that advertiser tend to overstate the quality of a product in order to sell it . people who make such kind of statement , a the one presented above , are convinced that marketing is the exclusive art of embellishing reality and lying about it , since it present a product that is not quite what is promised to the consumer . and of course almost everyone ha suffered a huge dissappointment when buying for example a tooth paste that doe not whiten the teeth in five second , a it wa stated in the package , or when noticing that a package of regular battery last the same or more than the one the bunny said would last forever . i believe , every proffesion is susceptible to human vice . lying is therefore not exclusive of advertrisers , nor is it characteristic of them . i think there are , of course , advertiser who will be willing to sell any product regardless of it is something benign for society or not , or if it is actually the product they are promising to consumer . nonetheless , these event occur in almost every proffession , accountant that do not pay their costumer tax , driver that drive unsafely , real estators who sell damaged or overprized property . so , the fact that some people will want to take advantage of other people is present wherever thers is interaction between human being . the only thing we can do about it , is to rely on ethical ground and hope that eveveryone will perform the job they are expected to in the most honest manner .
