i agree with the statement that successful people try new thing and take risk rather than only doing what they already know how to do well . history is full of example of those people who met their goal and realized their dream by going beyond the ordinary and by taking risk . to my mind , success and complacence do not go together . one ha to be continually motivated to seek new horizon in life to succeed . an example of a person who took risk rather than doing what he already knew how to do well is bill gates , the chairman and founder of microsoft . he left a top ranking university to pursue his dream of being an entrepreneur . he could have stayed back and pursued a conventional career but his risk taking endeavour revolutionized the way the world work now . richard branson is another successful business magnate who like to take risk and try new thing . he learned to dream of the impossible at an early age and his business and life are glaring example of a successful life , well lived . mahatma gandhi wa a lawyer in south africa and could have stayed in that position his entire life but he decided to change the course of his destiny by being honest to himself . he wa deeply hurt by the colonial treatment and took the biggest risk of his life by dedicating himself to the cause of non violent freedom struggle . the people who like doing what they already know how to do well will never have the opportunity to expand their horizon in life . most of the successful people i have known are the one who take risk and try different thing in their life . how can a business expand if they lmit their market , how can a student get good grade if he is content with his lot , how can a country advance if it is closed to new idea and change ? thus i agree with the above statement and think that successful people take risk and try new thing because it is these two quality that helped them attain success in the first place .
