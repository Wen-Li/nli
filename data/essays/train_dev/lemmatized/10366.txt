traffic in big city is the source of a lot of bad consequence . the environmental pollution is the most noticeable , but also side-effects on driver ' health are evident ( e.g. , stress caused by traffic jam ) . all this is due to the large usage of car by private citizen . improving public transportation service or providing suitable incentive to prevent people from riding alone also for short movement could contribute to solve this problem . pollution caused by gas released by the car while moving endangers a lot the planet where we live , also by warming the weather . the exhaustion of the petroleum resource on the planet is paving the way to research about alternative propellent . they have been studied for the last twenty year ; unfortunately , they take to an increase in the cost of the engine too high to permit they are included in mass production . i think that this solution would only solve part of the problem . a better solution would consist in improving public transportation service . in many part of the world these are still insufficiently deployed or unreliable ( in italy train are rarely on time ) . however , my opinion is that the most effective strategy would consist in educating people . people should use car only when effectively needed ( many of them use car for very short movement ) . in addition , novel possibility , e.g. , car pooling or car sharing , should be supported by incentivating people to exploit them . the usage of a car by a single people take to great resource waste . i am not sure whether in the next twenty year the use of the car will diminish . i rather believe that some solution need to be found to make the statement become true . the education of people not to use car for short movement or to exploit sharing strategy , and a drastic improvement of public transportation are the most effective solution i advise .
