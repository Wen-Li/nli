i agree with the following statement that `` it is more important for student to understand idea and concept than it id for them to learn fact . '' it is very easy for student to understand idea and concept rather than learning them . if they understand once they will never forget it and will be able to recall all the idea and concept . for example , in a classroom teacher is teaching something valuable and helping student in understanding the idea or concept with the help of some example or experiment and due to this student will catch everything very fast whatever teacher ha taught them and will recall it easily in future . students understands easily with the idea and concept rather than making them learn the fact . they will not remember the idea or concept or fact if they are made to learn it forcefully . learning never help in understanding the idea or concept . ideas and concept are always clear to student by understanding because understanding make it clear to them and they pay attention to it and show their interest also . on other hand their interest keep on reducing and cause lack of attention if they are made to learn fact forcefully . ideas or concept about anything help student to picturise or visualise the situation and doubt are cleared . its not necessary that student should always learn . there are otherway also of teaching student . now day time ha changed teaching should be made by seeing the student interest and capacity of learning . studies should be made easier to student by making them understand the idea and concept . gaining knowledge about something is easier by understanding it the process of learning ha changed or replaced by understanding idea and concept . at end i would like tosay that if we really want student to improve then i suggest that the process of understanding idea and concepst is better than learning fact .
