in my opinion , it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subject than to specialize in one specific subject . this is because a person with a general knowlegde of many subject is usually more prepared for a lot of thing in life than a person that know perfectly everything about a single subject . i believe that a person who know about thing like science , math , history and art for example is much more prepared for living in our nowadays society than a person who know only about cooking let say . there can be a man who is the best chef in the world , he can be very succesfull in what he doe , but how usefull can it be to know how to make the a wonderful birthday cake when you do n't know how to divide it in exact piece for everyone ? or how would he know what food is good or bad for human being ? or how would he know how to advertize his food ? how to manage and create a restaurant ? these and so many other reason are why it is important to have at least a little bit of knowledge in many subject . also for personal satisfaction , i think it is important to know about different subject . i believe a person always feel better when they know more . i certainly believe that a someone who know everything there is to know about a subject , like cooking , also feel pretty good ; but going to back to the chef example , how would he feel if he go to a dinner with all his friend and they start talking about history or politics or world affair ? in my opinion he would rather stay home next time and only meet his friend when they want to eat his wonderful dish . i think being ignorant in a lot of thing can create a low self-asteem for many people , even if they believe they are the best in one single subject . in conclusion , it is better to have a broad knowledge of many academic subject than to specialize in one because it doe n't only help u with our daily life but it also give u a personal satisfaction , because we know about more than one thing .
