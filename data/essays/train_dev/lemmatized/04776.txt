i disagree with the statement ' it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subject than to specialize in one specific subject ' . in case of broad knowledge of many academic subject we need to study all the subject and become familiar with all the topic in the subject . it is difficult task to do . where a in case of the case of specialize in one specific subject is an easy process to know abt the subject . in specializing one specific subject , we can learn more about the topic and we can learn very deeply about the subject and become a gem in that particular subject . when a person go to a job he just see that in which stream or subject the candidate is more intelligent and the interviewer asks the quieries related to that subject only . interviewer see the candidate that how much deep knowledge the candidate ha in that subject . when we would like to do postgraduate course we will be specizlized in a specific subject . specializing one specific subject is a good and easy process . we can get deep knowledge in the subject and do some researsh work related to that subject . as an example if a person is specialized in artificial intelligence , he can make many program and make intellegen computer program . he can write program self . borad knowledge of academic subject is we should learn all the subject in the academic year . we need to grasp all the topic which is big problem . it is very hard to graspe all the subject and a tuff task to remember all the topic and point in the subject . we can not be able to specialize in any field . it is difficult to understand each topic in the subject and it take much time to prepare all the subject . it is not an easy task to have broad knowledge of academic subject . broad knowledge of academic subject is some what helpfull to shift to differernt stream and also different specialization . but we cany be perfect in any subject thus specialization in one specific subject is better an we can deepen knowledge . broad knowledge doesnt help and we will not be perfectrt in
