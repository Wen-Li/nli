the word advertisement come from the root ` advert ' , which mean ` to draw attention ' . the central motive of all advertisement , is infact to get considerable attention . and the advertisement , generally go beyond simple enumeration of product feautures . they try to make a product look much better than it really is . i totally agree with the statement . while , advertisement today are much more sophisticated , than they were a few decade ago , the chief theme of an advertisement wa always to get more public attention , so that the product could sell better . initally in 70 or 80 , only the feature of a product and customer testimonial were greatly exaggerated . this made a product look much better , than it really wa . inflated customer testimonial helped create a sense of a happy consumer . while , such technique were already creating a sense of false product perception , it is only in past 1 or 2 decade , ha the advertising become so complex and sophisticated . people , child and adult are beguiled by the aura ` modern advertisement ' creates about a product . this aura is better known a ` the brand ' among the marketing and advertising firm . these modern advertisement basically create implicit association of certain product type with certain behavior , in the consumer mind . associations like - if you drive ` car z8 ' you are cool . or if you use certain perfume , you will be much more attractive to the opposite sex . these association create illusion in front of consumer , hence ensuring that they can not make rational and logical choice about product . moreover , with such advertising it is no longer necessary for a product to be good , in order to be commercially successful . a regular garment line with similar design , could command twice the price with a celebrity endorsement . such , technique ensure that consumer and the manufacturing company ignore what is really important - the product , and not it 's aura . also , this false image , contributes to what is called the mad consumerism . people getting insane to get certain is not good for society . with advertisement and branding people are sometimes unable to seperate wheat from the chaff . what is really important and what is just a fake . i strongly believe , the advertisement make a product look much better using various method . however , such marketing doe harm to the society in general , and consumer in particular .
