in my opinion there are two type of student ; one is learning by searching the issue deeply and the others give up searching when they understood the idea and concept but it doe not mean that to learn fact 's not important for student than understanding idea and concept . trying to understand the fact behind the particular issue help student to get a wider view about that issue . this kind of behaviour also help student to learn questioning the reason of event which are effecting whole life of them . but on the other hand to give up following the fact can not help u respond the problem . by this way accepting the result becomes easier than solving the problem . i can easily assert that understanding of fact is a important a important understanding the idea because by questioning the event understanding also becomes more easier . i mean that only understanding the concept can not improve knowledge by itself also the importance of learning fact is great . so i can easily say that many time a student should want to learn the intuition lie behind the concept . it is like a sense of wonder and it is like a mean for development or improvement in life . education system also ha a great affect to make student notice the importance of learning fact or reason during their education period . because the strategy that they are taught in the school age will also effect the way of thinking during their life . so an education system should teach student to search a concept or an idea before accepting the it directly . on the other hand it doe not mean that understanding is not a important a learning fact . it 's like a chain and should follow each other . i mean that after understanding the concept or idea the other important process should be applied which is learning the intuition behind particular issue . consequently i am not agree with the following statement that understand idea and concept are more important than learning fact for student . process of learning fact is also very important for student . such a kind of learning strategy can lead to success in many area in their life of student .
