i think that in today 's world even if a product is of excellent quality and is very useful , it still need to be advertised in order to reach it sale potential . having said this i completely agree with the statement that most advertisement make product seem much better than they really are . there are couple of main point i want to state here in support of my conclusion . first , there is no way for the consumer to validate the claim being made about a product in advertisement . the only way to figure out if the claim are right is by actually using the product or talking to others who have used the product . the advertiser of the product exploit the dificulty faced by consumer in validation the product related claim , by making claim which have no suppoting evidence . the best example of this is the claim made by many of the weight reduction pill on the market . the advertisement claim that the pill will reduce weight by 50 to 100 pond in couple of week . second point is the fact that the advertiser use well know celebrity to advertise and market bad quality product . just because a is acting in an advertisement for a product doe not mean the product is good . most of u know this fact . but association of the celebrity with the product doe seem to influence people buying decision . this tell u that even though the product is not of the best quality , the advertisement made it seem good just because it ha a celebrity cast . for example in india the superstar actor amitabh bachhan act in so many advertisement for product which are bad in quality , but just because he is part of the advertisement the product are baught by many people .
