nowadays , there are numerous debate about the issue whether or not the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide . some people hold that travelling individually is better . others , however , contradict it . from my point of view , i firmly agree that travelling in a group is the best way for the following reason . to stand with , travelling in a group will be much safer . in other word , if people have a trip with other people , they will feel much safer . a survey in the toronto star talk about that travelling individually will be more dangerous than travelling in a gruop . for instance , when i am travelling in a group , if i have any problem or dangerous , the member who are in my tour group will help me out from the problem . therefore , travelling in a group will make people feel much safer . in addition , travelling in a group will make people spend le money . that is , people will spend le money in travelling in a group than travelling solely . the reason is that the tour company will have so many discount about the hotel , the restaurant and the entry to famous place . a person who is travelling in a group , for example , visit to china just need to spend $ 400 , while anther person who is travelling individually should spend $ 800 . hence , travelling in a group will be cheaper . finally , travelling in a group will make you visit more place . in other word , when you are travelling in a group , you will have a chance to visit considerable more place . you will be a stranger when you travel to that place , so you wo n't know which place are worth for you to visit . if you join the group when you are travelling , you will visit dramatically more place . consequently , travelling in a group will make people have a chance to visit more famouse and beautiful place . based on what i have discussed , it is self-evidence that travelling in a group is beneficial for people . travelling in a group will not only make people feel much safer , but also let people spend le money and have a chance to visit more place a well .
