a lot of people specialize themseves in one specific subject at university and take corse in the same department in order to have degree in a particular field . we can wonder if it is good to have a specialized knowledge or a broad one . having a specialized knowledge on an academic subject could be great if it is in the view of being a researcher , a specialist or a technician in a certain field . moreover , it is easier to concentrate on one specific subject during study and it is easier being more known because specialist of some subject are rare . for example , it is rare to find a specialist in treatment water process and so some people who are could have more chance to find a job after graduation . to the opposite , having an overview of science and some knowledge about religion and phylosophy is necessary in every day life and also because some field could cross others . for example , taking course about both politics and economics is better to understand the way a country go . it is also very important to discover thing in order to know what it seems to be the more interesting and which correspond the most to a personnality . according to me , the best is to have broad knowledge of many academic subject at the beginning of the scholarship and to specialize at the end . it is like that the american university work and i think it is better than in france because people are too specialized . in united states student must have credit from others department they are studying in in order to have an awarness and a culture more important and so they can compare and choose a field in which they are interested in in order to specialize themselves after .
