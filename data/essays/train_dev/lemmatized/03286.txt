world is progressing towards pinnacle of technology and science everyday . people have become more conscious about living standard . earlier idea wa to save maximum money for generation and thus , people spent le in luxury . nowadays , buying a car is much easier than saving money a government keep track of all your black money . can you think of depositing black money in bank ? do n't you plan to change your car with changing fashion ? do you really care for saving for future ? today , people think for comfort and not money . so , who can think of reduction in number of four wheeler ? i believe that car is not a status symbol but ha become necessity . can you think of going to write your exam by bus ? oh ! it is really pathetic . i would prefer a car a it will keep my mind relaxed and air conitioned environment reduces fear and anxiety . i disagree with the statement , `` in twenty year there will be fewer car in use than there are today . '' although , industrialization and increasing number of vehicle on road ha led to major problem of pollution , but this doe n't mean that people will stop buying car . we always have alternative solution to a problem . now you will say that fuel is on the verge of exhaustion . but , with increasing technical and scientific advance we can come out of the problem of lowering volume of petrol and diseal . you must have heard of `` biodiseal '' been used successfully in brazil . there are so many alternative fuel available these day . thanks to science ! what about gasoline ? it is widely used a an alternative fuel . in india , new delhi ha shown dramatic result by using `` compressed gas '' ( popularly known a cng ) . it is known a clean fuel thus saving environment from pollution . so , now what you say ? do we really have to stop buying car ? after twenty year , will there be any change in number of car ? in my opinion , yes there will be change but a positive increase in number because now people are more educated . they care for environment and thus fuel these day is used judiciously . scientists all over the world are experimenting in order to find oil from bacteria and plant . `` jatropha '' , a drought resistant plant ha been a boon for dry country a these plant can be grown in harsh climate area also . they are found to release oil which can be collected by harvesting the seed of this plant and then sent to industry for purification process . so , there is no need to reduce the number of car a so many clean fuel are available . they are le toxic than fossil fuel . technical advance are on the way to create a pollution free environment and give hope for new horizon leading to more luxurios car in the future .
