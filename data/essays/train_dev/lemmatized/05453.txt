by virtue of having ` been there , done that ' , i believe that older people with the gamut of experience that comprise their life , enjoy life more so than the young one who are yet to find their foot . a younger body also implies a mind that is yet to develop to it full potential . despite the physical crutch that age may come with , it remains a magnificent process of learning and developing a an individual . it is said that with age come experience . the experience of year past allows an individual to view situation differently . the reaction of a 6 year old on getting his first cycle might seem more jubilant than that of his grandfather but the quite pride of watching his grandson gleam with pleasure , speaks of the hard work and commitment that the wrinkled face one see ha learn to put in , to give others such joy . my friend 's sister , rita , had had a fight with her friend ayesha over a trivial matter . whlist she did n't want to b the first to aplogise , she still spent the day in a foul mood waiting for ayesha to initiate the peace making process . for a young person , a certain situation might seem more complex than it actually is and that wa the situation here till rita 's mother explained to rita that she needed to judge what held greater importance - her own pride which forbid her from calling , or then her relationship with a friend . as an older individual , her mother wa able to share her own perspective that would enable rita to make intelligent emotional choice in the future . as one get older , it can not be assumed that one stop enjoying one 's life . ' i feel young at heart ' , ive heard my father say many a time which brings me to the only conclusion - the number of candle on your cake do n't decide how happy you are but how you spend the time that is marked yours .
