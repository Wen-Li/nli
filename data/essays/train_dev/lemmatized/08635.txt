poeple strive for success in many way . some people specialize in what they already know how to do well . others , however , are brave enough to try new thing and take risk . given the fact that we are living in a rapidly changing society , i agree that successful people are the latter one who continuoulsy change their path of life . firstly , trying new thing and taking risk often lead people to see new opportunity . the technology and business are changing fast . if people stick to the old way of thinking , they may be left behind by the society . so we should be open-minded to the new environment . for example , bill gates , the founder of microsoft , took great risk when he decided to quit from university and start his own business . that wa indeed a very brave and insightful choice for an undergraduate student to make . because bill gates seized the new opportunity without hesitation , he gained great success . noy only can we have new opportunity by taking risk , there is also higher rate of return . when people only do what they already know how to do well , they have little room for improvement . thus they can not gain more for themselevs nor contribute more to the society . in contrary , high risk often implys high rate of return . those who try new thing often get more because of the risk undertaken . my marketing professor , for example , changed his career several time from amanager to aconsultant to a professor . he really gain much life experience and at the same time make good fortune . as stated above , trying new thing and taking risk would bring people valuable opportunity and good return . we all live in a increasingly competitive society . that is why we should adapt to the changing world by changing ourselves . is exactly the way that lead to success .
