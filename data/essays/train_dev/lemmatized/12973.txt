some people believe that young people is helping their community nowadays . but i think those activity are fewer than before . my primary reason is that our communication with neighbor are le frequent especially in the urban area . highly civilization of city allowed u to live without neighbor . for instance , when child get injured in the evening , we are able to get some medicine in a convenience store . there are no nesessities to be helped by the community . also , the oppotunities young people make conversation with their community member are gradually decreasing . as they have to study at private school or in their own room , they do not have enough time to go outside to make communication with their neibors . considering all the above factor , i conclude that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their community . although helping their community are sometimes strong in rural area , those activity are totally getting rare .
