i agree with this sentence , because if i do only the thing that i know to do well , i do n't understand nothing of new , and i never grow up . in my personal experience , i took a very hard carreer for me . in fact , study is not my passion , but i think that today , in the world , and in particular in italy , the success of a person begin with a high level carreer of study . in this way i began seven year ago a university 's course of mechanical engineering . i found very much difficult during these year , but searching to pas these problem i become stronger than when i began the university . but the risk in the life is to be too happy for the thing obtained , and to think `` to be arrived '' , and conseguently do n't see the world around u . i think that is important to never `` seat down '' , and continue to do thing that we do not well , in the way to understand alwais new thing and to make a better person to themselves .
