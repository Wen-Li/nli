i completely disagree with the statement a a lot of young people who are the next leader of the nation are not putting in enough effort in to helping their community . life ha become so fast in the twentyfirst century that peole are always busy running around not understanding what they want at the end of the day . they are so busy with there study there career and there futhur and the day to day stress they forget the very importance of building a community which would look after each other instead of place were there is a lot of crime , drug abuse etc. which would intern effect there personal life . young people these day are so self obsssesed that they dont have time to even think about there next family member . they have a lot of time to go to movie or coffee place everyday and cant afford to take atleat an hour in a week to help their community . this can be changed a in my case were proper guidence from the older generation and determination make a change in the community . with proper motivation from the older generation this can be changed a wa the case in my community when we in first moved to the community where i live now there wa no proper waste disposal , people would just trow there waste in front of their neighbour house are on the road which intern affected them with fly and mosqutioes . to over come this problem we were advised by older people to come up with idea to solve the problem , this led to sucusfull change in the waste , few of my freinds and me joined hand to collect fund in the colony bought a large bin that placed at one corner of the colony and every house had to dump there waste there and there would be the garbagge collector to dispose the waste . this wa achevied due to the involvement of youth from the community . if it made by law that every week a certin number hour are be spent doing community work by the youth i think the there would be a larger undersating and responsibility would be develpoved . this is followed by the community in stay every month we donate fund to charity organistions like `` cry '' from screening of movie , organisating event etc .
