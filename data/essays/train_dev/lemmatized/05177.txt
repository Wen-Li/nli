succes is a commum goal of every one . but the definition of success and a successful person differs a lot . some people think that succes is a logical and a natural consequence of a well done job , but others defend the idea that only people who dare could be successful . in my own point of view , i am partially agree with the first statement . in fact , to succed we do not need to be especially smart . and the success of what we do depend rather on the occurancy and the perseverance of our trial than on our willengness to take risk or on our curiosity . we have several example of success story of ordinary people that excelled in their traditional job and reach fame and wealth by offering their customer a usual product but with better quality . and that relying on their own experience and know-how it mean that their success wa due to the fact of doing well what they already know how to do . this point of view doe not exclude the fact that a lot of people have knew success by taking risk or by tring new thing , way or method : it is largely admitted that the dare , the courage and the curiosity of pioneer and scientist permitted to the humanity to make great step in the way of prosperity and developpement . also discovery and invention will be impossible without a touch of imagination and risk . in conclusion , i can say that a success is a sweet meal that need , a ingredient , a bit of risk , a few of curiosity and a lot of know-how and a well done job .
