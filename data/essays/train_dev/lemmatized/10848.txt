i strongly agree that student should learn the idea and concept of anything rather than learning only the fact . the point which i will cover are a below : # ideas and concept reveals the actual knowledge of the student . # facts could be an illusionary knowhow about the subject . # conceptual knowledge make a deep impact on the colleague and professor and to attain more of the credit . # facts could be somewhat useful or maybe considered for timebeing but idea generating the fact would be the one every individual is interested to know . # importance of deep knowledge in today 's competitve world . # conclusion as a saying go on : `` half - knowledge is dangerous '' . the very friend of a man are always `` who '' , `` why '' , `` what '' , `` where '' . and these all lead u to know the idea and concept behind every invention , every fact , every rule , every quote , every event that occurs or happens . i would not be wrong if i say that i usually like to carry these four question with me when ever i move to unkown place or to any interesting place . well , starting up with the essay i would like to stress on the point of `` complete - knowledge '' . i suppose that this term is mentioned by me just to make my point self-explanatory . infact , i would say that a person with knowledge is the one appreciated everywhere . and the matter is simply that a student will be able to get more of the grade and could get more attention if he ha the collection of various innovative idea accompanied with the fact told by him . now for example , a student preparing for any of the project presentation will have to elaborate and present his knowledge and research related to the topic of the project . and in this case it would definitely be the best part for the student to collect the fact related to his project and to make them know how they were possible ? would n't that be a fantastic thing done by the student to make his classmate introduce with a new topic and in an educational way ? ofcourse it would be ! but i am not completely disagreeing with the point that knowhow of fact is also important sometimes . `` as i believe something is better than nothing '' . but usually fact turn out to be an illusionary concept with no basis to support . this may lead a student to a condition of `` nowhere '' . but surely , a student will be able to get more of the accolade , extol , credit , grade on his complete and deep knowledge based on fact and figure . today 's competitive world demand knowledge with deep root to sustain in the developing and fast - growing company . every day new invention and creation are forcing the company to seek great mind to get in their company and in lieu to this great mind , always an acutal knowledge is required . still , a student should for sure attain a much knowledge a possible only to survive and to rise in this competitive world and prove his worth . he should gain more and more fact and work out the way through which thises fact have been developed . his research probably would then be the most attractive part of his resume for a company to hire him . hence , knowledge is important and somehow with a basi and so idea , concept and fact together be the best part of having sound knowledge in a student life .
