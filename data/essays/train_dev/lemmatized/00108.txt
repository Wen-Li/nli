today , young people do not give enough time to helping their community . i agree partly with the previous statement . the first point , i wuold like to make is that the young people nowadays are very busy with own engangement , that do not have enough spare time . i think , that this is the main motive because young people do not give enough time to helping their community . as regard me , i am a student at university , i do not ever have time spare . i am always busy to work to university . many time i do not have time to see my boyfriend and my friend , also i have feel to to helping my community , i do not have time to make it . therefore , last year i suceed to organize a big party , in my country , to gather money to helping the poor childern . in addiction , sometimes i helping the child of my country to make homework . these event seldom happen , because i do not enough spare time . my situation is similar with the situation of my friend . in conclusion , i think that today , yuong people do not give enough time to helping their community . in addition , i think that the main reason of this type of bahavior is that yuong people do not have enough time .
