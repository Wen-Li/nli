to talk about the statement `` most advertisement make product seem much better than they really are '' i must first confess that i 'm a marketer . i studied marketing and i worked in marketing , and it is our job to make product look a good a we can , and sometimes we do magnificent job . so with that said , yes , i do agree with the statement , advertisement make product seem much better than they really are . advertising is created to make people buy product or service , that 's the only reason why company spend so much money advertising . advertisements are designed thinking on the consumer , is for the consumer and it need to convey to the consumer that the product is awesome , the best . not all product advertised are awesome , not all are garbage , but it is the advertisement purpose to show the product a good a it can be shown . one example of advertisement that show the product much better than it really is , the new coke black . `` it 's coke and it 's coffee '' , `` it 's the best of both world '' . yeah right ! , the product it 's horrible and yet their advertisement is so inviting and you really think you are going to get coke with coffee and that the combination is going to work . i mean , i love coke and coffee why not together ? well it just doe n't work but their ad sure do . another example would be the ipod . ipod 's ad are so fresh , it make you feel like dancing . but ipods are really not worth the price . it 's only because their ad are good that our perceived value for an ipod is higher . i had an ipod , it broke two month after i bought it and in the ad it looked like it wa a great product . the last example i will give ha to do with telemarketers . creams that will cure acne or cream that will get ride of unwanted hair , well i tried both and neither worked . advertisement purpose is to advertise so people buy or request servicesit is it job to make product seem much better than they really are .
