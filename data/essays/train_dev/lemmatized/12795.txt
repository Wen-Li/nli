i do not entirely disagree with this statement but i do disagree to some extent . in my opinion , successful people do not just try new thing and take risk but they also work on improving what they already know . for any person to be successful they should build there success on experience . what i mean by experience is taking time to make mistake and learn from them . this also mean working hard in order not to repeat previous mistake . this is where success is built on doing what we already know . on the other hand , it would not be very smart to keep our same old information a this would not improve u in any way . therefore we should take chance , take risk - but within limit which we set for ourselves of course - and learn to experience day by day . success can be recognized in many aspect of life , and a time pass we could be successful in many different area . i mean by that : success is not necessarily related to each individual 's area of expertise . a person can be successful educationaly , a well a in there work field a they grow up and also in there personal life . success in school is based on studying , comprehending and practicing in order to achieve good result and ace test whenever we can . in school we could learn to be successful for example by keeping the same efficient way of studying that we got used to in order to achieve our best . where risk are introduced could be by trying some new way of learning perhaps suggested by a classmate or by taking the chance to learn a new language or study a subject which we do not guarantee to like but why not take the chance to be successful in somthing new ? ! in conclusion , one should always learn to do their best in order to succeed whether or not that involves trying something new .
