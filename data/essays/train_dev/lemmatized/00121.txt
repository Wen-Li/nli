there are studenst in the world . they want to learn something from their teacher or their family to become success . if a student want to resolve the situation to become sucess , he/she must know the idea . understanding idea is more important than learning fact for student because of the feature and the usage . students want to know the speciality of the idea and concept . specialities show where the topic come from . for example turks are living in a democratic city . if they do not know their past they can not know the importance of that democracy . for this reason people learn their past and their history . if people can not know their past and they live in domocratic country . they can not discus or protest something is oppsed to their country . they must know how they become in this situation and they can use it if it is necessary . knowing speciality mean that knowinf idea and concept . understanding what the idea is about is necessary for learning something . if a student start to learn something first of all she/he must know the name of the idea and than the information about the idea for using it . if she do not know anything about that she/he can not realise the fact . facts can only demonstrate the result but to understanding well it is not enough . for example there is oss in turkey and the student study oss for getting a chance to pas a good university . i studied too and i learned the idea and concept . if i learn only the fact i can forget the fact during the oss . understanding fact mean memorizing because we can not know the idea . we can only know the fact and this is not enough . for this reason teacher explain the topic with their concept and idea . so the student can know the fact whenever they want because understanding idea pas the people to the fact . to summerize understanding idea is important for remember and using idea .
