the school education is a very important part of people live . the school education method change among different culture and it can influence the future life of person . it is not very easy to answer this question because either undestanding idea and concept or learning fact have pro and con . when a student is very young , it is very difficult to him to understand idea and concept . for instance when i wa in elementary class i rebember that the majority of lesson were explanation of fact . i think it wa a correct education method because i wa not able to understand idea and concept . before beginning to understand idea and concept it is important to learn fact ! on the other hand a student in secondary class need to be stimulated with lesson concentrated on idea or concept . if a student of a secondary class follows only lesson full of fact , he can be very leasy and he can lose the interest in study ! nevertheless there are particular topic in wich the student must learn a lot of fact to try to understand . for instance history is full of fact and is full of idea and concept too . but a student can not understand historical idea and concept if he doe not know before the crononogical sequence of fact ! in conclusion , i disagree with the statement that it is more important for student to understand idea and concept than learning fact . i thing that both understanding idea and concept and learning fact are important part of the student education . in particular learning fact is the basic support for consequent understanding idesa and concept .
