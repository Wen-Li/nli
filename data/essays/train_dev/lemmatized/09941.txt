yes , i agree with the statement that `` young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their community . '' infact , in today 's highly competitive world , most young people 's sole focus is personal success and glory . an aim that they start chasing from a very young age . from getting into the best college , to getting the best job and making the most money . these are the priority that drive the young these day . helping the community is never really a pressing concern for the young . take for example the `` brain drain '' in country like india . a phenomenon where most young and brilliant people choose to pursue their study and career abroad in country such a the usa and others in europe . their main motivation is a better standard of life and earning more money . most of these people never return to their native country and a a result deprive it of their input and the much required help . young people who do have strong moral and want to help their community and country , often feel helpless in doing so and feel that they do n't have enough power to make a change alone and that they would be in a better position to help their community if they were successful and powerful . as a result they put off helping their community , while they pursue their career . some of these people do follow their original intention and work for their community , but most get caught up in their worldy affair and find that they do n't have the time or the inclination to help their community . well in my opinion , it not really the fault of young people who are driven by their ambition and ca n't find the time in their very hectic life to help the community . you could say that the world is heading towards this situation of apathy because of the ever increasing need to stay ahead of the competition and succeed in the global environm
