i 'm agree with the affirmation that say : young people enjoy life more than older people do . i have twentythree year old therfore i am a young boy , in this period my life is very enjoy and for this i am happy . in this last year i have done some thing , many of this wa very important for my growth , many of this wa very enjoy , but at the other hand there wa some bad moment . moreover i can say that in my life the good period are more present than bad period . i 'm young and this thing is very beautiful , in this period of my life i can do some enjoyed thing , for example yestarday i played with my friend at football , in other day i had played at baseball , cricket , basketball . . young old let me do this thing , becouse my body is ok , i do n't have problem , i 'm healtly . at the moment i think that i can do everything ! it 's a good sensation , the best i have never had . at the other hand this good period ca n't continue for all my life , in this case i could is an highlander ! there is a period of our life that all thing is more difficult than in youth . this difficult period is when the people come to be an older person . this is the ultimated state of our life , when our body come to be ill , old . .. i think that there are some good moment in this sad period , the close contact with our relative develops one strong rapport , is important , in this manner we can be more happy than only . in conclusion i think that young people are more enjoy than the older , but we must love our life , becouse in unique and indispensable .
