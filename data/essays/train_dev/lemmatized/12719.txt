people have to study lot of thing in their life . some of them want to interest many thing and others prefer specific thing . although having lot of information releated to anything , it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subject than to specialize in one specific subject . if you want to have broad knowledge , you have to work hard on everything . this way is very difficult for people . in addition , you can not achive something properly if you chose broad knowledge . furthermore you can not know everything about your subject , because you have to study for every subject . on the other hand , specialize in one specific subject is not difficult a another because , they have to work on only one topic . this event provide some adventages for you . for example ; because you work on only one topic , you can do your research broadly and you know everything about this subject . as a result , to specialize in one specific subject is better than to have broad knowledge of many academi subject . i think people use this way to be successful .
