i do n't agree with this statement . i think people can enjoy life no matter how old they are . i also think a person can feel miserable no matter they were young or old . the reason people enjoy life ha nothing to do with there age but is caused by other external factor and circumstance . one factor that help most people to enjoy life is being around the people they love . this mean that an old lady could enjoy life by being around her grandchild . it also mean , that a young boy can feel miserable and unhappy when he is living away from his parent and friend . another factor which cause people to enjoy life is health . people in good health usually enjoy life more than other sick people . this mean , that an eighty year old man who is in an excellent health condition is most probably enjoying life more than a sick eight year old boy . never the le , i believe that financial security help people to enjoy life . richer people usually ha more mean to enjoy life than poorer people . this might sound shallow , but no one can deny that it is true . this mean that a very old billionaire can enjoy his life a he can use his money to do fun activity like travel . at the same time , a young poor man may not be enjoying his life a he does'nt have the mean to have any luxury . in the end , i would like to stress how i do n't think age affect how much people enjoy life . i think you can enjoy life wheather you were young or old ; however i believe there are other thing which help some people enjoy life such a good health , money and being around the people you love .
