i think most people think that the most important is a learning . thus , i disagree with this statement that it is more important for stduents to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact beacuse student need to know about the fact . moreover , if studnets know the fact , they can have higher quility conversation . first of all , student have to know about the fact because they are an idividuals in the world . for example , i have read a news about a girl . one day , she walked to home . she felf that someone wa following her . she wa afraid of it . she wish the other man lived same apartment . a man kept following her and the other man also wa following her . when she arrived at home , she had to take an elevator . the man who walked with her , he also took same elevator and got off same floor . he talked to her that there were a man who is murderer so i followed you . this happen wa really serious . moreover , after she got this experiecne , she realized that the fact is so difficult . in addition , if student learn fact , they can talk to adult about it . for example , i always talk to my father about society . my father also tell me many thing about it . thus , when i talk to another older people , i can talk to them very easily . in conclusion , i strongly believe that it is the most important for student to learn fact becuase they can have experience and when we talke to people , opposition people think that we are smart .
