when i wa young , i tired many new thing and took risk of doing anything . i tried skipping english class when i wa in grade 5 , i tired yelling at my parent when i wa 4 year old , and i tired copying my homework from others ' when i wa in grade 2 . now i think back , and i regret . i surely should not try new thing or take any risk when i wa young or when i thought about the result . after 18 year , i do n't think i 'm more favourable or more successful than other people . maybe i should do what i already know how to do well is better for me . many people say that they should try some new thing instead of following the path they already do well . however , they still have their improvement to do the thing even better . well is not good , perfect is good . they should try to do their thing perfect before they try new thing and take risk . in this modern competative society , people afraid to fell off , people afraid to lose . no one want to be the loser or no one want to lose their game . why should they have to try new thing or take risk to do the thing they already know how to do well ? they should just follow their way to go . taking risk or trying new thing maybe is good for advance , or even get the better result . but if they try to do perfect in the thing they already how how to do well . somehow their result are even better , or even they will be happier . people will praise your ability , your knowledages , your thought . nevertheless , what if they lose when they try new thing and take risk ? they will be so upset and maybe they wo n't have any motivation to do what they already know how to do well . the result is more harsh for them or they ca n't even take it . so , in sum i think they shou
