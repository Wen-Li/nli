i believe that people will use much more car in twenty year . i have two reason to support this . first , the population of the world continues to grow . in most of the development contries , the speed of the growth of the population is acceralating . if there will be lot more people in the future , there will be much more demand for the car . especially , the ratio of the people who have a car in development contries is not so high . so there could be a great market oppotunity for automaker . and the automaker are now making the strategy to take the share for the pie , a we are able to see them in their annual strategic report . second , the car will be much cheaper in the future . now automaker are trying to make their car in china and other asian contries . this enables them to make their car much cheaper . that 's because , they can cut the salary of workiers who work in the plant to make car . so that many people , even in development contries , will be able to afford a car . however , i do n't think the same type of car that we are now using will be used in the future . the enegy they use to move car will change , a the crude oil which we need to make gasoline is not enough for u to use continuously in the future . thesedays , the automaker are trying to develop car which move by using some other enegy like hydrogen , solar power , electric power and so on . the car which use new technology are still expencive . however , in the future , i 'm sure they will be much cheaper . in conclusion , i 'm against the statement . there will be more people living in the world , and the cost to have the car will be cheaper . so , the car will be used a lot more than now .
