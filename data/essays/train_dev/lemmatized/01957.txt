understanding idea and concept is more important for student than just learning fact . the ideasare the thing that should come first when they learn something , and it will let them to take step forward . to make them more interested and be able to solve advanced problem , they can not avoid to learn the idea and the concept . first , the idea and concept help them understand the fact , and it may make student interested in the topic . knowing the background or the reason why the fact occur or occured is very important before they learn the fact . for example , to learn about the world war two , they should learn not only the year it started , the year it ended , the number of people died , but they should know learn more about the background of the war . knowing why it happened , why it wa ended like that , etc. may encourage the student more intrested about the war and might think more . next , they can advance their knowledge and skill from learning the idea and concept . those who know the idea and concept would be able to answer the problem in many kind of situation , whereas those who learned only the fact can only answer the problem in the way they learned . we can see it especially in math exam . the idea and concept would help them to answer advanced problem that they had not solved before but it is possible to answer by using skill they had learned . to develop the student ' knowledge and skill , the idea and the concept have big role . in the class room , the teacher should take much time to teach them the idea and the concept . then the student would be more interedted in the topic and , it would be easier for them to understand the fact .
