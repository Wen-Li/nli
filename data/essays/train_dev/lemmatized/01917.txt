rich people in other word , people who are prospered in specific field are more likely to challenge new thing . there are some supporting idea and fact that lead me to agree to this statement . first of all , i would like to ask you that is it fun after completing a particular subject ? i think people need some kind of stimulation in your life . according to the statement , it said `` taking risk '' . i inferred this a challenge . for instance , a president of a company successfully complete a task he got , what he will do next is do something else exciteing . i guess most of people in the world are greedy . the greed will make those rich or the successful people to step on the deck . this is a fact that i have a friend who successfully run a business in brunei . he run two jewellry shop and an enormous restaurant in the middle of the capital city of brunei . i thought that would be enough for that time i meet him few year ago . then recently , i called him whether he is doing well or not . i felt that his response sound like a kind of depression but also an excitement . what he wa doing is trying another thing , in other word , challenging . he actually wa doing a currency exchange . however , a you can see he got bored of running the shop and restuarant therefore he sought new excitement in his life . in conclusion , people are more likely to somehow improve and increase their ability by challenging something . it seems more in the high-class , i mean rich or successful people , beacuse of their wealth . enough money to challenge new thing rather than poor . it is nothing excited if you do the same thing everyday . due to these thought and the experience i agreed with the statement .
