at first glance it seems to be a baffling question but if you 'll take a closer look you might reckon to say that this subject need to be examined . this esssay deal with a broad description of why it is necessary to have a broad knowledge of many academic subject . first of all i would like to say that it is indispensable for any kind of student to broaden his knowledge . let u assume that you earned your bachelor 's degree in sport and that you would like to get some overseas working experience . due to the fact that you attended a univerity that did n't allow you to learn a foreign language it wo n't be possible for you to fully indulge in new surroundings . furthermore you can just work in a small working field that doe n't allow you obtain more responsibility . i am quite sure that you will soon feel uncomfortable and that you might regret that you did n't take the opportunity to broaden your academic skill . rome wa not build in a day and it is quite apparent that you can hardly obtain more knowledge from one day to another . if those student who just focussed on a specific subject , such a sport , attended different class , besides their major , it would be easier for them to survive in the capitalistic world . i am trying to reinforce my point of view with a quotation of darwin . '' the survival of the fittest '' , express a fact , based on several incident that took place in the early 19th century . you can easily link it to our assigment . thus , what happens to those student who attended business class besides their normal major . let u assume that they have learned how to plan task and how to meet their target via shedules and agenda . maybe these business class taught them how to control people via '' carrot and stick '' or through normal philanthroposy . these skill would truly broaden their possibility to apply for other job , such a managing sport event or leading an enterprise in the field of sport . i am pretty sure that everybody take advantage of a broad knowledge of many academic subject , a i 've examined in the line above . i grew up with the belief that a person never truly finish his education and that there is something new to learn with each day . referring to my introdcution it is vital to succedd academically due to these hint .
