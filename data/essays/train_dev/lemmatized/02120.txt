yes i agree with the statemen , `` successful people try new thing and take risk rather than only doing what they already know how to do well '' a people gain success they experiment with new idea and take risk of implementing those idea . the main purpose of this experiment is to increase their growth and success in field other than what they already know perfectly . for most of the successful people success is not the only goal , but their goal is an increase in success with the passing time . i think risk must be taken so a to explore other field inorder to achieve success . success of an individual depends mainly on his self confidence and his skill in adapting what he dont know . trying out something is the basic step of attaining success or failure . only after trying out something that is new people are directed towards success or failure and in case of success people try to expertise themselves in that particular field and later on try for some new thing to add on to their success . an organization which is successful in providing people with a soft drink of a particular flavour will later on take a risk of trying out something new by introducing a new drink , if it fails then the drink may be withdrawn from the market but in case of success the gain a huge business and sale . success it attained by dedication , hardwork and skill , a successful person feel independent and keep on trying new path or idea to increase their success . but people who dont try new idea maintain the same position at which they are present since a long time . success is achieved by taking riks and implying new idea , new idea are helpful step and a right path for people who are successful .
