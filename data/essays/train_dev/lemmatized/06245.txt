i agree to have to have a broad knowledge of many academic subject than to speciallize in one specific subject becase learining many subject give you many succeful carrers and have a better futer while having only one subject you will be bored learing one subject and just have the same subject every day while others can mix up and enjoy having many subject learining one subject is more easer and you can finish it faster but the bad thing is that you can find a faster job becase there will be others that they will have much highr degree and they will have much highr rate and faster then the one who studied one subjectstuding many subject creat many friend any other class and they can help you in many different way exampel some student in the biology class will help me in my homework or my project and in other class also im going to have other friend who are going to help me in my homework or presintation but studing with the same class dosent allow you to creat many friend studing many subject alows you to ask many teacher about many sort of thing example if you need a certain and specifc question you need to ask the teacher who is specific in this subject but if your studing one subject it diffucelt to ask other teacher about a question you want to ask i prefer to study many subject becase im going to creat my own futer and have many freinds from other nationality this is my propose in life .
