i beleive that , it is only people who will to take risk would become sucessful . once a person is sucessful he would always want to increse his popularity by trying out new thing . he would never want his business or company to be stagnant . in today competitive world , people are paid for their creativity and creativity is nothing but trying or finding new way and thing . first of all let u consider the field of acting . a moviestar would become sucessful because of a particular kind of role . for example shah rukh khan , became popular for the role of a lover . but he doesnt portray the same role in all his movie . he ha acted a a villian , an action hereo etc , and still he is the number one hero in india . his sucess in the role of a lover boy did not constrain him from trying other role . infact he is one of the most versatile actor in india . let u take up industry a another example . a company would become sucessful for a particular produt say a chocolate . the people of the company would not stop at this point by selling only their popular product . instead they would try to venture other area like ice cream or even soap or shampoo . carrying out the same technique may always not lead to sucess a many other people could have copied the same technique . well it is always safe to carry out thing the way one already know and there may be no fear of loss or failurewhile taking a new way may end up in a problem . i feel it is better to take risk and enjoy the sucess it brings . thus taking risk and trying out new way ha it own advantage and disadvantage , one need to be daring enough to take the risk .
