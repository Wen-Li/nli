i dont agree that young people enjoy life more than older people . enjoyment and happieness doesnt stop at defenite age . it depend on many other factor which are more important than the age . it is not nescessary that young people enjoy their life more than the older people for many reason . we can find many old people who enjoy thier life by different way for example , if we will see the traveller to any country , we can find that lot of traveller rare not young people . on other hand , there are many young people who dont enjoy their life a old people . so enjoyment mainly depends on the person himself so if he / she someone who like to enjoy his life and ha many interesting thing to do in his / her life , nothing can prevent that to occurs even if the person wa old . some old people live their life a young people and some young people live thier life a old people for example , there are some young who dont enjoy thier time and dont like advantures or to try new thing they seem to be a complex people . on other hand some old people they like to enjoy thier life so they do any thing make them happy so when you meet them you think that you meet young people not old one ! some people think that young people enjoy life more than others because the period of their life is the most exciting time and full of playing and new experience because young people like to try any thing new but certainly this is wrong opinion because old people also have their method and way that make them enjoy their life for example : marriage , money , travel , friend , ... etc . so the life is enjoya
