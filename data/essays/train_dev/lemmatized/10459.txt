as far a i am concerned , i think that young people nowadays give enough time to helping their community . maybe my answer seem to appear like selfish even if it is not my aim . at first sight , i think that nowadays young people ha got a great deal of work to do and therefore le freetime . for instance , young people must go to university to study but on top of that most of them are forced to work besides their study to earn some money in order to pay their school . as a result , it is hard for these young people to find the time to helping their community . actually when you finish your school at the end of the day you want to escape from reality and therefore relax and ease the tension of the day 's hard work . you do not want in your leisure time to go and help your community . i am conviced that when you are young you have to take advantage of life . consequently , you have to enjoy yourself and have fun because you know that one day when you will become a grown up you will have to support responsabillities and obligation in your town or city . moreover , sometimes in certain situation young people wo n't have enough experience to deal with the problem whereas older person will make the right decision . nevertheless , it is undoubtful that helping community might be a rewarding experience for young people because they will improve their knowledge thanks to the older advice . in fact , it should be an opportunity for young people to evolve in a good way . even if these young people think that helping their community is a misfortune it can also appear a an asset because thay can learn a great deal of thing that will help them in the future . but the main problem a always is time .
