in my opinion , it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subject than to specialize in one specific subject . having broad knowledge of many acedemic subject give u a lot of information about various topic . this help u to identify the area or subject in which we are interested . for example , an individual who ha knowledge in arts , history , economics and sciences will have a larger scope to select his interested area of study and pursue his higher education in that domain . but by specializing in one specific subject , the scope of selection of other interested subject is lost . also , broad knowledge of various subject give u a larger scope for inter-disiplinary work . having considerable knowledge of two inter-relating topic , can help u understand the subject much better . for example , having knowledge of mathematics can help a lot in studying physics . modern world demand integration of more than one technology . also , it would improve the job oppurtunities . as the world move towards development , the company which hire individual want them to be flexible enough to work on more than one project at a time . individuals who have broad knowledge of various academic subject are helpful in this regard . moreover , having knowledge of more than one subject will always be helpful in job search . also there are certain job which require the knowledge of more than one subject . for example , for an effective design of an automobile , it would be better to hire a person who have knowledge of mechanical engineering and also who can simulate design on a computer system there by reducing the manufacturing cost by a great deal . from the above fact , i conclude that it is better to have broad knowledge of various academic subject than to specialize in one specific subject . we need individual who are multi-talented to make innovation and make society a better place to live .
