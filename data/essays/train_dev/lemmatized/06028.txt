personally , i think that the real big opportunity are the one that are n't discovered yet . in other word , to feel the real success , one must go for the unknown , which all the successful inventor and discoverer basically do in common . in the decision step of what to do , one can fall in to a dilemma of whether to do something unsound or to do the proven . this decision is what make the difference and enables the subject to add the word `` the great '' after his name . as long a the gain is considerable , i think that taking risk is not a big deal . that also includes an optimistic vision for the future which , a a matter of fact , everybody should have . this vision will lead anybody inherently to success , so after this vision , the second thing to have in life is a bit of courage to try new thing . the history of mankind is full of such example , like christopher colombus or galileo , who were under extreme pressure because of their belief about the fact . considering today 's liberated ideology , running after `` the new '' is indeed provoked by almost every authority . another concern about what to choose for life is the purpose of life in one point of view . when the primary purpose is only the money and material , there are many `` ready to cook '' opportunity to follow , which will make one pretty rich only with some effort , provided that it 's based on something he/she already good at . but , in contrary , is one is after his/her `` spiritual '' success , then it 's the ideal that 's to be chased for . after all , a quote from the holy bible summarizes it all : `` for where your treasure is , there will your heart be also '' .
