i disagree with this statement . there are three reason . first , anybody can enjoy it life whether he/she is young or old . that 's the matter of feeling or thinking of individual , not age . you can see it from the statistic about the age of suicide people . the number of older is n't different much a younger people 's . they die because of dissapointment to their life . i think that may be one of the proof of young people doe n't enjoy life . second , that olders who usually move and speak slowly may give an impression to people to think they are boring or have nothing to do . it is not true . thanks to their experience and knowldges come from their long life , they know how to enjoy and have fun in their way in any situation . older third , the number of older people who go to educational facility , like city college , is still increasing . that mean they have passion to get higher education and enthusiasm to earn new knowledge . compared to older people , younger seems spend much
