i disagree with the follwing statement . in fact , i hope to become a person that i 'll be specialized in one specific subject . now , i 'm studying mechanic engineering at the university and when i 'll be finished , i 'm going to work in an industrial factory . so this is one reason on about i do n't agree with that opinion . in fact i have to learn always and always knowledgement about mechanic problem because this is a condition that it 'll let me to enter facily in the world of job . so i still have to study more to reach that goal . in spite of this consideration , to have broad knowledge of many subject is a condition that can also give important result for the future . to know other argument such a economy , literature or foreign language is another opportunity and , with this culture you can have interesting result to improve your career . but i think that it 's better to know only a sector of own job . maybe , one explanation can be given . until i wa a young boy and i wa ten year old , i just had a clean idea about what i'be have wanted to do when i 'd have became an adult . so i always wanted to be an engineer . my father is an engineer and also my grandfather wa an engineer and maybe this can be one factor of my choiche and of my opinion about this statement . so , i went to the tecnichal school and i receveided a diplome a mechanich . now i am a student of politecnico university and hope to have the degree a soon possible .
