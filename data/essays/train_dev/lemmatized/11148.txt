in my opinnion , successfull people try new thing and take risk rather than only doing what they already know how to do well . i regard this statement a true because i have a quite different definition of success . if somebody is really successful , he/she should not only manage something that he/she is supposed to do but she should always improve his/herself and have an aim to make innovation by the mean of self-optimisation . this ha a vital role on someone 's career because it would help the person to be realised by other others and promote . on the other hand i do n't state that should always take risk and alter the way he/she know . the time and the place that a person would try new thing and take some risk is also very important . if it is a wrong time or place the thing can get worse and worse . for example if your bos give you an important project that should be prepared soon you should n't take a risk at this situation and you also do n't have the right to do that because you can harm the prestige of the company which you 're working in . to conclude , i think that one should try new thing and take risk after gaining some experience and feel ready about change which would make a person sucessfull and admired .
