i agree with this opinion : most advertisement make product seem much better thant they really are . there are 3 reason why i think so . the picture of advertisement are usually very attractive . for example , the picture of the apartment 's part of the room . it always seems larger and brighter than they really are . however , the customer actually visit the apartment , they say the room is not a good a they expect . also , sometimes it is not a clean a the advertisement picture . the good which the company sell are also more simple than the company say such a music player . the company sings the productons of them can record and play more clear that what the production used to be . however , sometimes there is a no differance between the new one and the old one except the price . there is one more reason here . our imagination help to think better when we see the advertisement . if we watch the commecial on tv , we get the good impression at first even thou we do n't know how the product really are . then we think we want it , but when we see the product with our eye , we disappointed with it . it is because the product are not a attractive a our imagination . because of these 3 reason , i think most advertisement are not a good a than they really are . they commerce just good point of the product , but we need to have critical thinking . t
