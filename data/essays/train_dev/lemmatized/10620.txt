being led by a tour guide while travelling in a group is one of the best way to do , where this seems to make it more special and interesting . a person would get to know more people from the group , which will make the trip feel enjoyable . a tour guide will help in discovering alot of new stuff , and will show the tourist so many amazing place , especially if this is their first visit to the country . people usually travelling alone to another country and trying to explore the best place by themselves , are going to face much difficulty doing that since they do n't have any idea of what they are looking for , and whether they will like or not . unlike the tour guide , who will save the tourist plenty of time introducing them to all the hot area , one after the other because he know almost every location in the country . moreover , people sometimes pas by alot of old building without even noticing their significance and their history too . while , a tour guide will provide the toursists with all the detail and the history of related to these place . tourists are going to enjoy it more , and they will feel better after being told what to do and how to react to a certain situation opposing them . a tour guide will help the tourist spend the best time , so they would know what to do and where to go , incase they visit again sometime later .
