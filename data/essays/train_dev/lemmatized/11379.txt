i do not agree that young people enjoy life more than older people do . i can not support this idea for two interesting reason . first of all , young peole have le free time than old people do . think about the development stage of a human life chronically . when they are student , erery day is full of something to do mandatarily such a homework , tutorial , lesson . also young parent are so hectic almost everyday earning money , working house chore , taking care of chidrens and being social to survive the difficulty which come into their life . just during the holiday they can relax and enjoy some time , then they have to struggle again after those certain time . it is hard even to think of themselves and their life for a short time . on the contrary , old folk are quite often seen taking a walk , reading substantial book , playing golf , crusing on a beautiful ship and so on . second , young people have le money than old people do . actually young group make a lot more money than the other one . however , they have to spend a great portion of money they earned for a variety of purpose . for instance , a young couple with child have no chance to save their money at the bank . especially , lump sum of money is spent on their child such a child care , food . education stipend , clothes and so forth . there is scarecely a chance to use some portion of money to be used for the family vacation . that is the biggest opportunity to get away from daily mundane life and spend money to enjoy life including themselves . on the other hand , old generation are spending money usually for themselves . all the child are independent financilly , so they do not have to worry much about money a young generation do . most of old people eat out and make their life even simpler . with extra money in their hand , they can invest to earn more money to use . i strongly can say that life is more beautiful when it is sunset due to the above reason .
