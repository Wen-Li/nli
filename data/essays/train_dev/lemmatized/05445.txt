these day , since the transpotation is developed and many people are financially stable , they have lot of opportunity to travel in other country . of course , there are several way to trip , however , i personally agree the idea that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide , due to the following reason . first of all , people can get lot of benefit to follow the experienced guide . because they are in the strange country , they do not know the information about famous place , convenient hotel , restarants and so on . in addition , the guide can prevent them not to get lost , and any inccidental danger . if a traveler confronts a trouble , the person can use the wary , from the guide . in other word , emplying tour guide is useful for travel . moreover , people can plan or choose the perfact travel curriculum . for example , if a person ha not enough time to travel , he or she can get best iternity through the advice from a tour company , and spend time usefully . in addition , the peroson can spend le money to trip , because the travel company usually require not costly price . lastly , group activity is interesting , especially in the newly place . people usually meet new people in traveling . therefore , they have chance to be more sociable and make wider human relationship . they can also learn and share their opinion about new thing each other . it is also preciouse experience for individual . in conclusion , traveling with a tour guide offer convenient service , cheaper expense for trip , and more joyable time with other people . nowadays , most people think that personal behavior and private is more important than any other thing , but in traveling , from my point of view , it is different .
