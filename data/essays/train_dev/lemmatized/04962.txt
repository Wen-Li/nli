i do not agree with the statement that young people are not giving enough time to help their community . this is a relative statement and like all relative statement , it is bugged with contextual inconsistency . when comparing two time period from a perspective of societal contribution by young people , we need to understand that the challenge and expectation var widely and thus the statement ca n't be empirically justified . moreover , the current society is a result of the action of past and to blame it implies that the value enshrined by the society of the past were not that great , thus challenging the underlying process on which the statement is made . just like organism , society also evolves . as such it ha become bigger , more varied , adaptable and faster . the value system it espouses is radically different from the past and thus are the action . to compare the action of young people in the current socitey from the value lens of the past society is doing great injustice . the current young generation is expected to perform well in all sphere of life , be it a home , school , college , work , friend circle , society . this is putting a lot of pressure considering that the time needed to perform all this activity ha not increased . such wa n't the case in previous socities . despite that , the young people are very motivated and concerened about the scocety and it 's well being . this is visible if you look at most of the socially oriented organization are staffed by young people , be it peta , greenpeace etc . there are a lot of demonstration around the world to stop the ravage of war that drive their force from the youth of today . the younger generation is looking at novel way of making a change . the new breed of social entrepreneur are forming non profit company that are run in a professional way to contribute to the betterment of society . this can be ascertained by the fact that there ha been a mushrooming of social oriented business course all across . the work place are providing outlet for their younger employee to engage in socially relevant task , besides their normal task and they are lapping it up . the younger generation , in my opinion is more awakened and sensitive about the need of the society . they are doing all their very best to fulfill the social duty in a more efficient and effective way . the only difference being that the area which concern them are different from that of the previous society , which reflect the challneges of the present and not the past .
