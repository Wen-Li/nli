since car were invented by human , each generation get more and more car . my grand-parents had one car for the family , both of my parent had their own car and now i get mine . this situation underline a lot of problem that we can discus in this essay . i will talk about the resource such a gas or petrol , about the environement , about the public transport , about the new technology and i will conclude with my own vision of the future . the first argument that come to my mind when i think about vehicules is the problem of the natural resource . indeed we are more and more on this earth and we use more car . but we do n't have unlimited resource . there will be no more petrol in le than fifty year and we will have to find a solution . the second argument is the one of the environment . cars reject a lot of carbon in the air and that 's so bad for our earth that is suffering more everyday . with le car there will be le pollution . but are we ready to stop that situation ? those two argument are a reality and in the fact , they will contribute to say that there will be le car in the future . but there are two argument that i want to talk about and that could show the contrary . first , public transport are not very developped except in the big town . for example , i live in angers and if i want to go to my school it will last 40 minute by bus against 5 with a car . to finish , i 'd say that there is new techologies for the car resource such a the clean diesel that contaminates le and that consumes very le . that make economy for everyone . to conclude , i think that there is a fatality for the car industry , with no resource there is no car but i think that we will develop new technolgies such a oil carburant or thing that could provide a cheapest and cleanest resource for ours transport . my conclusion is that there will be more and more car in the future .
