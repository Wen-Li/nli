in my view young people enjoy life more but moreover in an other way . three argument are on my mind why i am able to sign this statement . in the first place young people do have much more free time . while young people are normally finished around 5ish with school , adult have to work longer . furthermore young poeple have more holiday and are free on the weekend . my father ha his own enterprise . normally he return home for dinner . but while he is still working , i watch tv or i play tennis with my brother . i guess sometimes he could use more free time so that he would be able to do such activity and just enjoy . that brings me to my next thought . older people have more responsabilities than younger people . according to that , adult need to invest more time into complex thing such a tax or bill . my father company count 300 worker . he is responsible for everyone . if you have to keep up with such a big responsability , your day can be stressy . young people do not have to worry about that because they count on the help oh their parent . finally young people have more energy to do activity . it is natural that a young body is fitter than an older one . the bone are still young and the body of a young person is still growing . when my mother an me go for a walk up the hill she is the first to make a break . my leg are younger and i am able to wlak longer distance because of my condition . in conclusion there are several reason why young people enjoy life more than older people do . the most important is that young people have more free time . in spite of that older people enjoy life too , but in an other way .
