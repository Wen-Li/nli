one may travel for a variety of different reason , leisure , work or education , and may do so led by someone or planing the activity oneself . although traveling in group lead by a tour guide is an option i do not believe it is the best way to do so , primarily because it caters to the need of a group not to the individual . this lead to loss of opportunity , time and overall enjoyment of the activity . take for example , taking a lifelong dreamed tour of europe lead by a tour conductor . first of all one is stuck to a scheduled list of activity that someone thought would be interesting . if in a particular city you want to visit an unscheduled historical site you will probably not be able to do so , therefore lossing the once in a lifetime opportunity to view something you really wanted to . you could of course skip the tour day , but what would be the purpose of taking the tour in the first place . since there the mentioned and dreaded schedule , if someone is late for any activity , and someone usually is , we loose more valuable time . not to mention patience , influecing our state of mind throughout the day and possibly the rest of the tour . these are probably very individualistic point of view . and i defenitelly do think there are benefit of traveling in group led by a tour guide . but for my personal need i would rather to plan my own travel .
