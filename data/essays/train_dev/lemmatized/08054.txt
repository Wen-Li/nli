petrol is the main source of energy used nowadays but the problem is that scientist 's research say that there is n't alot of petrol still stored in the earth 's crust . most of the petrol which wa underground wa dug up . people nowadays use a lot of petrol for their car and they do n't think about the future . they dont think what will happen when the petrol run out ! . the petrol dugged from the earth 's crust is decreasing every day very rapidly due to the huge number of car present on earth and the factory using petrol a a source of energy . as the petrol present decrease it price will increase a lot ! . sometime in the near future the price of petrol will be very high that alot of people ca n't afford it , so people will have car but they ca n't afford the petrol !! ironic is n't it ? ! . on the other hand , a lot of scientist are now devoting themselves to stop this crisis before it happens . so they are researching different source for energy like solar energy and electric energy . there are other source of energy that are being researched but electric and solar energy are the one being focused on but the problem is that both this energy source are not dependable . first , the sun give out vast amount of energy but the problem is it is not available all day long . it is not available at night . second , electric energy is a good source of energy but the problem is nowadays electric energy is conducted by conducters which work on petrol so that brings u to the first problem !! . there is no definite solution to the problem of petrol being finished , the only thing people can do is that they try to decrease the use of petrol now to try and stall this crisis from happening . so in my opinion in twenty year definitly there will be fewer car in use than there is today .
