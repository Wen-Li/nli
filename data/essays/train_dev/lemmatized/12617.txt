i do believe that it is very important to have a wide culture in many and apparentely differents subject . subject that a a fist approach can seam radically different are in the end just a different develop of the same initial path . an example come from the classic greek where phylosophers were the fist astronomists and mathematician . i think that only having a broad knowledge of different subject is possible to go deeper in a specific one with later study . the risk to be too much specialized from the begin is to not be able to approach an eventual problem in a different way . an example is when i wa a student at the university and i wa attending the mathematical class , at that time i wa really surpriced how student cominig from classical study , after some first difficultes , became the best of the class . they were able to use the broad knowledge of different subject and use them in a specific fild . i am worry when i see school becaming too specific in the early stage of student path . i think that industry and economic world is too in hurry to have a technician , a kind of robot able to use some specific skill well and fast . i am sure that the real progres is in the hads of people that are able to solve problem in a wide rage , because it is important that for each small change in one direction something , maybe far , will change a well . i had a specific education and many time i suffer my lack of istruction and i use most of my free time to read classical poem .
