i guess it is more important for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact . my opinion is based of my expierences of sixteen year of school learning . if a student understands the idea or the concept behind a thing he can more effective do it by himself . if he just learn fact mostly he can just give back the fact of the experiment but if he understands the idea he can use the knowledge for other experiment . for example the student learn on theory the fact how to drive a car . they know how to use the acceleration , the brake , the clutch and the gear . they learn at 10 km per hour that they have to shift the gear up to the second gear and at 30 km per hour that they have to shift the gear up again . thats not bad because they know how to drive now but if they dont understand the idea of this they just can drive the example car and if they have after they driving license another car with more horse power they do not have to shift the second gear up at 30 km per hour because if the car have more horse power you have to shift the gear up later . but if you understand the idea or the concept of driving that you have to shift up the gear if the motor begin to cry than you can drive every car that you want . of course the student that learnt the fact can learn it everytime again in each car without much advising but it is definitly more effective if the student understand the concept of driving . in this example i hope to get underline my opninion why i think it is better to understand the idea .
