the statement that advertisement make product seem much better than they are in reality is very true . when i am watching tv at home and get to know new advertisement i ignore it . if product would be a good a the advertisement promise them to be people would only buy product of which they have seen an advertisement . for example there are only star that advertise for a product when you watch tv . alone this fact show that advertisement manipulate the watcher . of course there are product which you see on tv that are really good in reality but most of the product are not a good a you think they have to be when you see them on tv . the producer of a new product have to think very well about what kind of advertisement would be the best for there product . concerns pay million of dollar in order to produce a new advertisement clip on tv in order to increase the number of sol product . if that would n't work they would not spend such sum of money . of course the number of sold product also depends on whether the product is really good or not . i think that it is better to compare product or to to ask people which product they prefer instead of convincing on a supermodel that that is just enjoying an ice cream on tv . but there have to be people that are believing everything that is told on tv , radio or in some magazine and those people make that the concern benefit with their advertisement . personally i believe in the experience i made and decide if i take aspecial pizza once more or if i should choose another one the next time . advertisements do n't have any influence on me . as a conclusion i think that only few product are a good a actor ensure in advertisement because i wa nearly everytime disappointed when i bought a product that i admired on tv . perhaps i have had always bad luck .
