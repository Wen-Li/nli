the issue at hand is whether successful people should take risk or do what they already know how to do well . the issue is important because we are faced with a lot of daily `` risk '' in this manner . i believe that one should try new thing and explore all the oppurtunities around him/her . i believe this because ' life is full of risk and if someone ( a successful person ) doe not take any risk , then he/she will end up losing/missing a lot of good oppurtunities that the life brings in . first of all , i believe that all the risk generally offer a great benefit in return . if one doe not want to take any risk , he/she will receive no benefit . for example , a bank offer you a new type of bond which can bring you an additional income of 1000 $ per year . that is great ! why not go get it , and go for a 100 $ bringing '' safe type '' because `` you already know how to do it well '' . in my opinion , a person who go for a 100 $ is not aware of his/her ability , and it is a shame to not to take a risk . in my view , a successful person would never miss it , and that is why they are called successful ! secondly , life is full of risk and one can not be successful by choosing to stay conservative . everyday , life brings in thousand of new oppurtunities to a lot of people and most of those oppurtunities can add beauty to your life ( of course not everything is related to money ) . for example , take a risk and join a good club to meet new people : beauty can be in term of friendship , why not ? that is why , i believe that a person who always go for what he/she already know can never discover new oppurtunities in life , but a successful person utilizes these oppurtunities in all the good way . finally , in my opinion , successful people do not lose oppurtunities . when one observes , i believe that one can infact detect successful people by detecting their risk-taking behaviour . successful people are generally the one who not only takem but `` catch '' more risk . to summarize , i would like to say/and suggest that everyone should take more risk to be more successful . taking risk will always bring them better thing in many way that will make them successful . if napoleon bonapart wa alive , i believe he would say `` risk , risk , risk , success , success , success '' instead of `` money , money , money '' .
