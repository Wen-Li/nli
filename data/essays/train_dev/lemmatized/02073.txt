when i first came to sri lanka , in 1993 , there were hardly any car . instead , bus , train and tuk-tuks were ideal mode of transport at that time . there were lot of bikers in the street a well where some would be selling icecream or simply be on his way to work . after living five year , my father had taken few year off his work . together a a family , we emigrated to edinburgh for couple of year . i wa around 15 , when i wa back in sri lanka . everthing wa different . yes , i could still see the tuk-tuks and the bus in the street . however , bikers where some used to sell icecream or bread , had completely disappeared . instead , there were million of car . known for having wild driving style in sri lanka , moment spent on the road were n't very safe a it used to be . more traffic , more accident . currently , the situation ha gotten much worse . where it used to be just 15 minute from school to home , it is now 45 . of course , it varies on different time of the day , but however the fact is that the number of car have certainly increased . i can not see why that will not be the case 20 year from today . the situation will only be changed , if there were an alternative mode of transport which will offer the same advantage offered by a car . for example , convinience , availabilty and comfort . trains , nor bus can neither fully satisfy the demand of the people . unless there is a superior advancement in transport , i believe car will hold dominance over all other mode .
