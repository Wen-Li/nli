i neither disagree or agree the statement that young people do not give enough time to helping their community for various reason . first of all in past time people especially youth ha much more spare time compared to present time youth . morever the obligation of the youth are much more than the former one , a an example in my country due to economical reason almost 80 percent of collage undergraduate ha to have a lte night job to cover up for his or her collage fee and expense . therefore it is impossible to make a fair comparison betwwen generation . secondly , in my country , turkey , although the sharing and helpful community of past turkish culture doe not seem to exist a it wa 15-20 year ago , there ha been an significant increase in both quantity of charity union and their member number with comparison . moreover , according to my observation , 3 out of 5 people who join this kind of organization are mostly in a age range of 18-30 . they help people with disability to adapt the society , arrange a support group for misbehaved child and woman , give lecture for poor family child . today the community service and charity work are done much more organized compared to way back then . in conclusion , the condition of today and past generation are very different than each other . altough it may be seen that youth spend le time for helping their community stillplays significant role to help it ,
