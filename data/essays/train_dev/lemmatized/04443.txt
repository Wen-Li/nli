when i wa younger , i wa not good at mathmatics . then my parent recommended me to go to a place where i can study for math more . according to the experience in my past , i strong ly agree with the statement that understanding idea and concept is more important than learning fact for student . the reason why i think so are understanding idea and concept help to memorize easily and it make me be ready to solve more complicatied problem . first of all , i can memorize the element easier when i can understand idea and concept . understanding idea and concept mean what i learn becomes my knowledge . for example , i went to a place to learn math when i wa a child . then my instructor taught me how a formula wa made . every formula ha an original partern . so i just remember several basic formula and then i can get different formula by myself with the basic formula . usually teacher recommend student to memorize every single formula a if they are all fact we have to learn . however , my instructor showed a process how formula are made . the behavior lead me to understand idea and concept of formula . therefore , understanding make the amount of momerizing . secondly , understanding idea and concept give me more flexible comprehension when i have a more complecated problem . for example , a math problem , there are different level of problem . and for tough question , sometimes i ca n't solve tough question with basic idea . in that situation , it doe n't work to learn fact because i need more creative and flexible solution for the tough question . at the time , a my instructor did for me , if i understand idea and concept of math , it will be much easier to creat new way a solving the problem . as my conclusion , it is more importand and acutually more effective for student to understand idea and concept than to learn fact because stuents are required more creative thought . facts can not change anything because fact are already complete . that 's why it is a fact . however , understanding is
