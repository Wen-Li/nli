i agree with the statement `` it is more important for atudents to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact '' here are a few ponits to impress upon this statement . first , understanding the concept of a particular idea in a subject provides the student with a not only with clear and strong foundation in that particular subject matter but also enhances and expands their creative aptitude . for example understanding the concept of the physical formula v = u + at ( where v = final velocity ; u = initial velocity ; a = acceleratoin and t = time ) allows the student to apply the formula to numerous problem in linear motion . as such , the knowledge gained will allow the student to tackle the problem , however varied it presentation may be . secondly , in the feild of medicine , understanding the concept of the cell cycle and mechanism of tumor spread allows doctor to apprppriately plan the best mode of treatment that they can give to their patient afflicted with cancer , such a radiotherapy , or cell-cycle specific/non-specific chemotherapy . also understanding of the concept is important in that knowing the concept will in itself obviate the need to remember certain hard fact and figure . for example , the value of `` pi '' can be easily derived in problem ifd we remember that it is only the circumference of a circle divided by it diameter , rather than remembering all the digit . to conclude , though fact are important in many way such a historical date and event , ( in such circumstance , they are unavoidable ) they are more cumbersome and le useful in lerning especially in the science . allowing the student to try and understand concept and idea will only help him expand his intellectual horizon and creativity a
