in the fast and frenetic lifestyle that we face today , it is quite difficult to take out time all the activity that we want to perform . our youth driven by enormous worlk load , information overload and lack of tome is one of them . still many of them are taking out precious time out of thier hectic schedule and helping their community . hence though some may argure that the youth today is not lending enough time to his/her community , i would assert that youth are really spending enough time directly or indirectly for helping their community . to support this view , i would state an example of my colleague who is in the same project a mine . she really work a lot all the week but still after a hectic schedule , she is able to take out time for helping the handicapped people which a trust of her church community support . the last month , she wa able to collect sufficient amount of fund for helping them get artificial limb . her persistent effort for week and the determination were able to help the needy and poor handicapped people who could have faced lot of difficulty without the same . another point that can be considered regarding the same is that some of the smart work enabled by technology ha helped the youjng people devote more time effecvtively . for example , if earlier one were to search for the hospital and the trust that suppported cancer treatment , it would have taken a long time collecting information regarding the saem . however with the power of internet which ha become part-n-parcel of youth 's life and help group available online , they can really put effort that is equivalent to spnding hour without the technology available . it can definitely be argued that the time thatt the youth spent on mastering the internet tool and teh time spent in becoming aware of teh same ha been indirectly utilised for helping the community . thus , the above example and passage help come to conclusion that youth are helping thier community .
