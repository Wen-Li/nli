i agree with the statement that in twenty year there will be fewer car in use than there are today . my conviction is based on three reason . first , the low birthrate in many country will cause a sharp reduction in the number of future driver . it is a well-established fact that the largest number of driver are found in developed country in north america , europe and japan . it is also clear that birthrate ha been dropping during the past decade in these region . with the reduction of population , there will certainly be a reduction in the number of driver and car . it can be argued that china is a rising market for car . however , i do not believe that the growth in chinese market will make up for the loss in other place . besides , the largest number of car are found in the east coast big city , where the street are already jammed with car and can not make room to hold more . second , the gas shortage will help to reduce the number of car . the energy crisis that we are facing today will also be faced by the next generation . due to the limited energy supply on this planet , people in the future year will define gas shortage a a more serious problem than we do . considering the difficulty of discovering an alternative energy to replace gas , i am convinced that change of number of car will be pretty obvious in the near future . third , the reduction of number of car is and will continue to be fueled by people 's rising concern of the environmental issue . over the past decade , people have come to realize that the substance emitted by vehicle will cause an unrevocable damage to our environment . with the progress made in our understanding to the earth , it will become even clearer that car using the currently available fuel will have a long-term , negative effect on the atmosphere and our health . in summary , i have full confidence that , due to the low birthrate , gas shortage and people 's environmental awareness , there will be fewer car in the twenty year to come .
