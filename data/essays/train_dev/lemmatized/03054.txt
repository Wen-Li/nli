educational institution should train , their student in such away that they can understand idea and concept to bulid a better society . i agree to the topic that , idea and concept should be understood than just learning them a fact . a student should have a clear view of the fact before learning it . offcourse some fact like 2 + 2 = 4 need not be understood , but the student should know how to implement it . in physic like the law of thermodynamics should be clearly understood , inorder to know where it can be applied in real world . for example a student should just not learn fact about gravity , but chid should also understand , what actualy it mean and how is it related to nature . the student should understand it concept , to know it importance and value . the idea and concept should be clear , so that the child can think of the concept which are related to it in a different way , through this he can develop a broaderway of thinking and hence improves imaginative skill . the concept should be clearly understood , inorder to remember it for a long time . if a student understand the fact then , there are lesser chance for the child to forget it . whenever , chids see something that is related to fact , then the child quickly analysis the fact , and will do necessary action if required . in subject , which are practical like biology , then it very important for the child to understand each and every concept related to the fact , then only the child can get success in that particular feild . so i feel that student should understand the concept and idea than just learning them . for every fact the student should raise a question , to have a clear knowledge about the fact .
