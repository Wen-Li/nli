i think that are both important for the knowledge of the student . but exist different way to applicate them : for example for a kid at the primary schol , maybe it 's better to understand idea and concept , because he is at the start of his study career , so he need every strument to grow up well . with my personal experience , i think when you arrive at the university is important to understand idea a well a learn fact . i 'm studing design , and how can i learn the topic of the projectation without testing on my skin how project work ? i 'm really convinced that theory without practise at university it 's not so good , the same for practise without theory . i think like this because when you are graduate there is n't anything more between you and you work life , and work in general is more about fact thant theory . so if a law student will be an advocate , it 's better for his career to star to comprend what the worker life will be . but at the same time student have possibility to learn idea only at school , so it't really important to combine a good theory with a good practise .
