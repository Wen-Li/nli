learn 's method are really important , they allow education system to be more efficient . there are several pattern which can be followed by teacher . for instance , they can choose between focus upon idea and concept s or on fact . to understand idea and concept improves student ability to develop their logical skill . these quality are required by a lot of area a mathematics , biology or economic . for example , in economics , you need to understand all market 's mechanism to be able to explain how work an economy in any country . ideas and concept merely learn you how some event are engendered . to learn fact is more important for culture . it lead student to know the backgroung of some situation . they can in this way easily picture in which condition some concept take place . by following the same economic example , we can say that the knowledge of some history context allowes u to understand why at some moment economic theory have not worked . for instance , it can be implied by an event that one of the theory 's assumptiom is no longer respected . at hence , for all these reason i utterly disagree with this statement because understand idea and concept is complementary to learn fact .
