why do we have to help our community giving our free time , if it is not cool anymore ? unfortunately , this question is thought by many of nowadays young people . the community is always going to need some type of help from everyone at any moment , therefore if we have nothing to do in our free time . should n't we be giving up some of this time for the common wealth of the society ? eventhough , young people have enough time to do many worthless and pointless thing , they never decided to opt to help people who need a lot help . why ? nowadays , the majority prefers to get rid of contributing on the community ' social problem , since they are already very busy with their own worry , such a , hanging out with their friend next week-end , plannig the friday 's party , etc . .. helping to someone else requires a high degree of responsability that not every young person is able to achieve , hence many people doe not even think about the idea of getting into that job . young people mainly think that supporting the community with some kind of subsidy or donation of money , instead of giving more freely time , are big enought to resolve the origin of the problem . however , it is well known that helping our community represents a big deal , since it force u to change a lot of our daily activity . at the beginning , it might seem rare for u beacuse we might feel lost and without having any idea of what to do or help for , but a long a we get use to it will be pretty easy , and besides it will turn into a habbit . therefore , at the end there are more benefitial reason to decide to give more time to help the community rather than not helping it . in conclusion , since i work for one charity , a the time pass , you start realizing that helping community is won
