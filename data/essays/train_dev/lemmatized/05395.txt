i think that is impossible to simply answer to this question just saying yes or not . personally , i think that a deep understanding of idea is strictly connected with the learning of the fact . i want to be clear : obviously i do not think that learning is a just a process of memorizing stuff like year , formula , concept or definition . i think that a deepper understanding is necessary , but the latter is impossible without the former and viceversa . i will make an example , from my major field of study , that is philosophy of music : it is easy to imagine that learning fact is necessary to understand idea . it is necessary to have a good knowledge about history fact about our musical history , like when a composer wrote a specific composition , when specific type of environment developed just to allow people to listen to music in silence , when composer start to use writing to preserve their work , how this symbolic system evolved during the century . when you have learned the fact , at this point it is possible for you to understand the main idea . it will be usefull to examminee the understanding of the idea of authenticity in practice performance . it is important to know , for example , when a particular instrument started to be used by composer , in other word when it wa invented , and how the performer red the score in the baroque period to understand the idea of an authentic performance of this kind of music . if you do not know which wa the original setting of a performance and how the performer played their instrument , how can you think about authenticity ? without a good historical grounding , something like a foundation in fact , your idea will be completely arbitrary and your understanding just a lie . as wittgenstein said : `` let the fact speak for themselves '' . this sentence doe not mean that through fact when can discover the final truth , this is just for god , but we can say something of meaningfull , that could describe in a usefull way the world we live in . very often who considers learning fact just a stupid thing , a way to loose time , is someone not so good at school , that probably doe not know the fact . holding that position probably he is trying to apologizing himself , because he doe not no . it sound like the story of the fox that could not get the fruit she wanted . she finally said : `` this fruit is not good to eat '' . who consider learning fact a unusefull act like the fox in the tale .
