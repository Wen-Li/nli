i think that almost every advertisment make the product it support better than it actually is . there are three main reason for this opinion . firstly the main use of advertisment is to sell the product . the second reason is that if for example contract are advertised there are mostly printed or shown on screen little paragraph with the flaw of the contract . the last reason is that everything ha not only merrits but also flaw , which are typically not displayed . in order to sell product the producer ha to display it in a good light , because otherwise similar product from other company will be bought . this situation make a better exposure of a product than it actuallt is very likely . an example might be cream that should improve the look of human skin . studies proved that they show no effect , but in contrary even sometimes hamrs the skin . if this would be told in an advertisment nobody would buy the cream . a good example for the second reason are contract of phone company . they often announce some but not all of the cost a special contract may produce . because of legal statement they have to write these flaw on the advertisment but they do this in very small letter . so if you do n't look carefully you might get the impression of a much cheaper product . in advertisments flaw of product are never told , expect there are special right a with the phone contract . but everything ha side that are better or worse especially if compared to other similar product . advertisment do not speak about these thing where other comparable product can prove better result . so they always hide some side of the product . to show this hidden characterisitcs almost every product is tested by independent magazine or something alike . for exaample computer magazine that test hardware and software . so you can not rely on advertisments .
