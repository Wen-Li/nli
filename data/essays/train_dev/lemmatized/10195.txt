the statement i am going to deal with is ` most advertisement make product seem much better than they really are ' . i agree with the statement because an advertisement is meant to emphasize the positive characteristic of certain product and not to give a objective description . there are large company which dedicate themselves to the research of human behaviour in order to analyse how to gain the interest of a huge amount of people for a product for instance in a tv commercial . they try to characterize people of different age and different origin into interest group and then figure out which interest group would be the most effective for selling the product to . then they come up with a commercial that directly point at this very special interest group and that 's why member of this interest group are so attracted to the advertisement and think better of the product than it actually is . in order to emphasis my point i would like to give an example for a consumer who fell for that advertisement trap : me . two year ago when i still stayed at my host parent house in washington i went to the baseball try-outs of my highschool because i never played baseball before . my host dad gave me one of his old baseball glove ( must have been about 40 year old ) and so i tried out . i had been a pretty good pitcher back in germany so i thought it would be much of a problem to join the team ( at least the reserve team ) . instead of showing my pitching skill the coach wanted me to catch a couple of ball with my glove . i tried to do so but i could n't really figure out how to use the old glove so the ball would actually stick in there . after the try-outs the coach told me to come back when i wa wa abel to catch properly with my glove . that day i saw a brand-new glove at a sport good store . it wa all black and had a faked autograph of saome major legue baseball player i never even heard of on it . the commercial sign right next to it said `` you gon ' catch every ball ! '' . my host dad told me it wa overpriced but for about the next couple of day i went to that store and looked at that glove . after a couple day i finally decided on buying that glove . the next day i went out to the field with my host dad to play catch . i proudly told him that i wa going to catch any ball . actually i could n't catch anything . i 'm just a bad catcher , that 's what the 60 dollar i paid for the glove made me realize and showed , that most advertisement make product seem much better than they really are .
