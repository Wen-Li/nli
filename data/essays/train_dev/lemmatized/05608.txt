iam totally disagree with this statement that `` in twenty year there will be fewer car in use than there are today . '' car , which wa the travelling mode ( venegance ) for the privileged class in early 20th century , but with the growth of the technology now the car is there in every house and in every street . the new technology make the use of car more reliable and inexpensive . after twenty year , the use of car will definetely increase with the inovation of new new automobile technology . the use of solar car will replace the use of fuel feeding car . the modern technology made solar car but still it is rare to find them in street . because they are very expensive . but after twenty year this expensive mode will also be available at reliable rate . the construction of fly over , underground tunnel and the highway were help the people to go from one place to another with saving their time which otherwise they lost by hanging out in the heavy rush . but how the people will travel from one place to another ? they will prefer for self vehicle . and if the solar car which will be reliable to get then why the use of car after twenty year will decrease ? every one want to live a fast and speedy life . then why they will waste their time by depending on bus , train . they will try to have their own vehicle and the vehicle which is comfortable and inexpensive . after twenty year the car rate will defenitely be reduced and every one will have their own car . the problem after twenty year for using the car will be of fuel , which is probably at the stage of extinction . but technology is make the solution of this problem also . the solar fuel , the energy trapped by solar module which store the energy and transforms this energy to electrical energy . so the use of solar car will be both the solution for fossil fuel extinction a well a for pollution free fuel . so in the next twenty year the people will make use of solar vehicle and if the solar car will be available then why not solar car , which is more reliable , inexpensive after twenty year , pollution free vehicle and free of petrol or any other fossil fuel . in conclusion , it is quite definite that after twenty year the use of car will increase only because of new techology like solar technology , automobile technology and also because of construction of big big flyover , tunnel and highway . the life of the people after twenty year will be more fast and hence the use of these solar car will increase .
