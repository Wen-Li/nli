i once traveled to barcelona , spain . i took many lecture about barcelona to learn about barcelona . however , guide could still provide lot of information that i never heard of . threfore , i can say that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide . first , tour guide can provide lot of information . when we travel alone or in group without guide , we have to depend on guide book to gather information of what we are looking at . it give u limited amout of information . however , guide studied for a long time . for example , to get a tour guide lisence in japan , tour guide need to major janapnese culture . so they know many thing which we can not learn from book . for example , at the guell park constructed by antoni gaudi , there is a famous bench which is really comfortable , because the design considered human 's biological structure . our group thought that this bench show another genius aspect of gaudi . however , our guide told u that this bench is not made by gaudi , but other architect who worked with him . no book included that fact . second , guide know a lot about the region , so we experience special thing . guides know where to have great meal , where to buy the best gift , and they know about local culture . for instance , my guide suggested one restaurant and we had meal together . my guide told me that if i show chef that i am enjoying the meal by making certain gesture , then they will get appreciated . i did it , and i got extra chicken soup for free . tour guide are expert . they can offer information which is not mentioned in book . since they know a lot about the area , we can experience many thing which other tourist can not . the best way to travel is following the lead of wise and smart tour guide .
