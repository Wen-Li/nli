i think the best way to travel is traveing alone . however , if i do n't used to traveling place like language and culture , i need to go there with tour guide . consequently , if i trip to somewhere at first , it is the best way to take tour guide 's help . when i wa 6 year old , i travelde in japan with my family . at that time , i wa so young trip to japan alone and i could't speak japan at all . abobe all , i could n't be knowing japanese culture . after all , i need my parent a a tour guide . they live in japan for 7 year and speak japanese very well like japanese . at that time , if i know japanese a little and their culture , i can enough travel in japan alone . if someone do n't know traveing palce 's culture and their language , they will lose their way and sometimes they make mistake like food habit . in india , they ca n't eat cow 's meat for realigious belief and they do n't use stick when they eat food , they use only their hand . of course , if we know traveling palces 's culture and language , we can travel alone . there are some reason to travel alone except tour guide . at first , we can travel freeway . if we travel some place with tour guide , they will always interuppt u until we traveld to finish . second , we can learn their culture and their language for myself . if we have a few knowledge about thier culture and speak their language a little , we can grow up language skill and our knowledge about othter culture . and then , we can explain our thinking to friend , family and relative , so we will feel achivements . i think it is the best way to trip traveling palces alone if we have enough knowledge about their culture and speak their language . we can get many thing form traveling in strange palces .
