many people argue that it is best to do what they already know how to do well , and not take risk . personally , i strongly believe that successful people are those who constantly try new thing and reach for the unknown . in fact , a my middle school french teacher once told me , `` you learn from your mistake '' . i agree with her . from my experience , i can tell that mistake often help you to improve , because you remember them afterward . therefore , you know what you should n't do next time . if you never try new thing , though , how can you `` learn from your mistake '' ? you do n't improve , because `` improving '' implies that you are dealing with something new , and want to get better . also , i think that ambition is very important . it make learning exciting , and often contribute to your success . if you keep doing the thing you already know , it can get very boring ! for example , back in france , i played the piano . after seven year , when felt like i had reached a really good level and did n't need a teacher anymore , i decided to play the cello a well . i do not regret my decision . to be able to play several instrument wa very interesting and exciting ! finally , i believe that taking risk is important because when you succeed , it give you a lot of satisfaction and pride . in fact , because you reached a new goal , you feel like a whole new person . for example , i will always remember when my father told me that we would soon be moving from france to the united states . at first , to be honest , i wa very sad . i did n't want to leave my friend and i wa afraid of the unknown . a few month after we had moved , i felt very different . this experience ha been great . now i know how to speak english , i made new friend . .. i even plan to attend college here in the u.s . if my family had refused to emigrate because it meant taking risk , we would have missed the best experience of our life . in conclusion , i agree with those who say that `` successful people try new thing and take risk '' . of course , when `` taking risk '' is too dangerous , i would not agree but in general , ambition is great .
