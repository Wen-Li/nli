the world is full of people with a wild range of different personality , different experience , and even more diffrent way of seing life . some people enjoy life more than others , but it doe not depend on the age of the body . therefore , i truly disagree with the statement that say `` young people enjoy life more than older peolple do '' . each age ha it own magic , and in every step of our life we learn and develop ability that help u to enjoy the time we are living . for example , when a young child begin to communicate with his or her mother by the use of word , probably feel really proud of it , and enjoy it . the same happens when a baby start playing with toy , or a kid learns to read . this fact can be applyed to adult when they reach their first academic degree or when they get married . furthermore , every person ha it personal way of enjoying the thing he or she doe , in addition to a unique form of expressing how he or she feel . for instance , two human being can experiment the same situation at different period of their life , react to it in a very different way , but enjoy it similarly . other fact that is important to have in mind is the concept of joing . it should vary from one person to another , besides the fact that a person can be having pleasure when other understands that the first one is suffering . as an illustration , i will state the imagen of a person cry , i can infer that something bad ha happened to the person , nevertheless he or she can be cry of happiness . in conclusion , i believe that each person enjoys life in his or her own way , and would like to add that will be very helpful for humanity to stop looking at situation from a personal perspective and try to understand that each person life a he or she want and not to compare between them .
