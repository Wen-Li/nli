the actual word is a word of stress , activity , and business . most of current young people have activity and daly occupation , but i believe that amoung those young people some have time to help their community . i realize that time is precieus and because of that i may be influence by that reason to say that i have no time for others , but it is not the case . for example , i am involve in a student union and one of my duty is to bring some love around . also , there are differents way to spreed this love . for example , sheltering homeless people by providing them with food , clothes , and cover . by that kind of of positive action i get involve in the good of my community . next , it is more ofen young people that organize car wash or party to raise money for example to ameliorate their school , or environment of work . this is a evidence that show they are involve in what is happening around them . finally , even babysitting is a way to help your commmunity . you help a familly , neighbour that are in difficulty by giving them your help . so in that way you help around you mand you in conclusion , by getting involve in my society i realize how it work , where are the issue , and try to solve them thanks to different kind of experience . i also believe that after have done something great , i feel better , proud about myslef because i have been busy but for something that will help around . i am sure that a bunch of young will be agree with me because of the positive sen .
