the idea of young people not devoting enough time for the service of the community is really controversial . some people say that young people prefer more of their time towards achieving thier goal in life , while other say that they are really worried about the community and thus they help it by one way or another . i believe , however that materialism existing in the world is withdrawing the young people away from the social service . i offer following point to support my opinion . firstly , in this modern era of rapid technological progress their are everyday there is new electronic gadget introduced in the market which provides an effective mean of entertainment to the people thus , decreasing the need of community in their life anymore . secondly , the young people are tired of all the bloodshed or trickery going on in the camouflage community which lead to communal riot or the biased decision taken by the community . like , deciding a wealthy or influential person a a head of the community who doe n't deserves it . in addition to this , the cut-throat competion prevailing in this era force the young lot of the community to work more and more to achieve success and thus most of them end up with the shortage of time for their community and family . furthermore , the corruption prevaling at different level in the community is also reponsible for discouraging more energetic and tenacious young people to be a part of it . an individual always tend to consider his / her family interest over the interest of the community of which he/she is a part . moreover , now-a-days the rigor of their hectic life and the above mentioned alternative do n't let the youger generation realize the importance of camaraderie and commuinty . certainly , herculian afforts are required to inspire the youger generation for involving in communal decision . to conclude in a nutshell , in present world young people are more focused in the happiness in their personnal life rather than offering their sevices for the betterment of the community .
