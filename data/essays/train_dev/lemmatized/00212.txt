some people say that learning fact without the understand are more important becase these day is information social . however , i disagree about it . there are a reason : if we do not understand idea , we can not use them . sometimes , we are required many information from modern society when we want to do something like writing a report an so on . absolutly , we can use it without understand idea and concept but we can not use that those are natually . in this case , i think that it is same we do n't know it . for example , my classmate , haemi kim , is a student in the columbia university alp . she wanted to write about a globle warming when she took an essay test . even though she ha known it , she ha not understood this topic . while she wa writing an essay , she could not writing anything . so , she failed the test and then she had to prepare another exam . if she figure out this subject , she could pas the exam . that is a point , if we do n't understant someting , we do n't know it . as a result , when we learn somethig , we have to understand what is the meaning because when we need to use the information , we can be more comfortable than we do n't understand it .
