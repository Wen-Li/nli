studying various kind of academic subject is more neccessary for student than studying a particular subject . of course , after learning various subject for 1 or 2 year , student need to study one subject that they specialized in . however studying widely is critical for all of the college student . in university , there are many faculty , such a literature , science , engineering , and medicine . they seem to have nothing to do with each other . however different point of view will be useful and effective when you are studying a subject that you chose , because nowadays there are many integrated diciplines in many area of reserches . for instance , some part of engineering is now getting larger and it cover some part of medicine or science . when you want to be a resercher , i recommend you to learn a lot of subject in order to have a various viewpoint . another important reason is that if you study other subject now , you will not get a chance to study them . after you became a senior student , you might be so busy that you can not do anythig except the work you have to do . that is , because there are only a few chance to study many subject , you should study different subject . some subject are sometimes concidered , when we discus today 's problem . for example , literature is important for all of u . it is an essencial tool that is used compare our own culture to another culture . due to increacing globalization , we should know much about other culture . in that case , we can use the knoledge of literature . it is dfficult and hard to study many thing in your college . if you think so , you should think advantage of studying various subject . you have to look at your life from the long-term point of view . learning sometimes make you in trouble , but if you overcome it , you can get better and better . that 's why i agree with the idea that student should study various kind of subject .
