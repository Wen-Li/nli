i absolutely agree with the above statement that there will be fewer car in use in the future , than there are today . the first and the foremost reason could be that the capacity of the road had reached the threshold and the road could not take in any more car , thereby forcing the government to provide more convenient , better , efficient and rapid public transport system . and once the pople have got used to this convenient mode of travelling , they do n't want to use their car . the second reason could be that , in future , the scarcity of oil will cause the fuel price to inflate to such an extent , that it would become very costly for the people , especially the working class to use their car on a solo basis . thus thay would be pooling their car , there by reducing the number of car plying on the road . thirdly , in future , the concept of ` work from home ' could be the default method used by the most of the bussineses , and this will definitely help reduce the number of car on the road . also , many people will prefer working closer to home to avoid the rush-hour travelling . stricter government regulation for pollution and emission may not permit all vehicle to run every hour or day . it could be that vehicle of a particular type are allowed on a given day , while vehicle of another type are permitted on another hour or day . such restriction may also discourage people from buying their car , thus putting a check on the number of car on the road . also the government may increase the tax on car to exhorbitant amount to discourage people from buying personal car . so , all these probable reason can contribute to reduce the number of car running on the road in future .
