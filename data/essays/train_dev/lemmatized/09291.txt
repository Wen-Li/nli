i agree with the statement `` successful people try new thing and take risk rather than only doing what they already know how to do well . '' successful people like for example singer or actor always have to try new thing and take risk - in other word reinvent themselves - in order to become better and stay competitive . let u take madonna a an example . when she started her career she looked very different from what she look now and the kind of music she produced wa also a different one compared to her song now . this example indicates that you have to adapt to the time in order to stay successful or to become even more successful . you have to take risk to stay competitive . in this example madonna ha to take the risk that her fan do not like her new look or her new song a much a the old one . but she ha to try it and produce new song in a different way otherwise she would be out of fashion . because of her permanent reinvention she is still today after being many year in the show business a superstar . one the other hand , one could also say that doing thing in which you are already good will improve your performance . but i think that you reach a point where you can not become better without trying new thing which mean reinvention . in conclusion , my point of view is that one can only become successful by reinventing oneself and taking risk .
