it is sometimes difficult to discus people 's view on the way of travelling because it is such a multifaceted topic . some tend to think that there are many merit to travel by their own plan while others say it is better to be led by a tour guide . i have developed my own opinion on the topic . i favor the latter position over the former for several reason , and i would like to explore two of the conspicuous one in the following passage . first of all , if we are led by a guide , we do not have to spend a great amount of time considering where to go and how long to stay . the guide ha already arranged the schedule for u . as a result , all we have to do is follow the schdule and have a good time . for instance , when i wa a junior high student , my parent and i went to singapore led by a tour guide . the tour guide wa so familiar with the country that she introduced u everything about singapore . needless to say , we visited the most important spot in the country . all of u really appreciated the tour guide for such a wonderful trip . second thing that must be taken into consideration is that we are likely to make new friend in the group . it go without saying that it is very boring when we visit some interesting place without friend . in the group , we can make good friend with one another and share all the happiness on the trip . for example , on the travel to singapore , my new friend and i played together day and night . they did bring me a lot of fun during the trip . though the trip is over for a long time , we have still kept in touch closely . of course , i do not suggest that my perspective are unassailable . there are still some advantage for u to take a travel on our own plan . nevertheless , i think the opinion i have provided above are more important and stronger .
