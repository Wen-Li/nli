knowledge is important . we all know it . nowadays , having a culture is needed to get a work . it is surely not enough , but it is the first step to success . the problem is wheter specializing or not . surely we have being seeing , in the past year , that employment market made many step to specialization . but , considering how fast competence get old , we should take the decision carefully . first of all , we have to say that a strong and various knowledge may help you a lot . knowing a bit of everything , or ecclectism , enables you with the so called flexibility , that at this time is truly imoprtant . when you know a bit of everything , when facing a decision , you may have at least a little idea about where you are going . not a clear one , though , but you cane figure it . this may be false if you have focused only on a subject . you have reached the cutting edge of it but you completely lack in other thing . if you are in a statical environment , maybe you wo n't ever have any concern . but there is always some risk . i think we all should know about a much subject a possible . the most that you know , the most you can choose . in fact , once you have tried a bit of everything , you can avoid thing you dislike . furthermore , you can more likely avoid to choose blindly , because is well known that risk get bigger when you lack of information . finally , once you have chosen your way , who block you from specializing on that subject ? training and training , your experience will yeld , but your eclectical knowledge will remain . so , at the end , yuo may reach the same level of the one who have chosen specialization . but you will have more of them .
