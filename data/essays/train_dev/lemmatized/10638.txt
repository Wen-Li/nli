i most certainly agree the idea that `` young people enjoy life more than older people do '' . i want to defing enjoying life a how much passoin they have in their life and the example of hign school student in korea and america varify the statement . first of all , korean student know how to spend their life through participating many work , demonstraing that korean teenager try to challenge and move than older people . when older people try to stay what they do , student want to move around place to experience a many a possible to learn about other culture and what to improve for themselves . also , i want to show you example when they finish their final exam . they study all the time after school and prepare for the final exam . so after the test , they do anything to solve their stress . they go to computer room and spend all night and they sing song before they can not sing , showing that how much passion they have in their life and know how to enjoy the life . second , i would like to introduce when i wa in america . one thing that i wa surprised is about sport in their life . american high school ha three season for their sport and they try to prepare for it two month before the beginnig of their season . they practice a hard a they can to defeat their opponent . during the season , they sometimes rejoy to death when they win and even cry when they lose . through sport , they learn about life and try to win everytime by live hard a they can with passion . however , adult in america is very inactive in their life . most of people try to earn easy money and spend it quickly . they do not enjoy their job and feel very hard about their life . as can be seen above , those who have passion in their lfe know how to enjoy life and spend it great . i hope i enjoy my life even though i get old a
