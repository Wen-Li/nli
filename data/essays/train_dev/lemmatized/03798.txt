i am not quite agreed with this statement because we can not be so radical . it seems like all the young people would not help enough their community . i recognize that some teenager tend to be lazy and people would like them to provide more effort but it is unfair to say that everybody act this way . now if we focuse on the vocabulary used in the statement , one word retains my attention : nowadays . implicitly it would mean that they were helping more their communites in the past . that can be true . if we go back in time , we would realize that our life style wa quite different from this we have today . people wa more helpfull , they spend more time together . now young people are more independant . i am wondering what community refers to ; to the family , to school , to friend ? young people use to spend more time with their friend than with their relative . in that case , i can understand the point of view of the person who wrote the statement . now if we talk on a mondial level , i think that young people are interested in helping community abroad . i read an article in a magazine whitin they explain that more and more young adult would like to take part in worldwide exchange program such a humanitary help in south america . they stay in for example peru to give free english lesson to child in primary school who can not afford to have an acade ; ic education because of their poverty . i think that young people give time to helping their community in some way that other people , maybe , can not see at first sight .
