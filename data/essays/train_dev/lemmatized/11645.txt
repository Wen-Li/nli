some peple agree to the statement because the duty of young people is consentrate on studying at school . however , i think three much beneficial point for youong peple to give enough time to helping their community . the first reason is that young people helping their community can experience not at their school . they may go to the house whitch the elderly person life , and help to eat food and walk . and they may be babysitter , and be able to study how to deal with baby . those experience are not given from school . the second reason is that helping their community bring many friend who are not belonged to their school . from my experience , when i wa high school student , i paricipated in the english education school for child of my community . i made many friend who are not high school student , and they are now the best friend for me . the third reason is that peple can not make time to help their community when peple work in company . so , young peple , who have much free time than worker , should pay much time to help their community . terefore i disagre to young peple do not give enough time to helping their community . there are much better to belong the community .
