most student think that it is more important for them to understand idea and concept in order to allow them to use them again in their future life . on the other hand , others think that it is more important for them to learn fact because history is made of fact , and fact are the result of the use of such idea or concept . however , in the final analysis , i believe that it is more important for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact . first of all , the fact to understand idea and concept is the most important requirement that teacher ask their student to do . for example , after a class , every student will have taken note on the main fact of the lecture and would be able to learn them back home ; but only a few could say that they understood all the idea and concept of the lecture . moreover , there is a difference between understand and learn . if almost everybody is able to learn some fact , such a date , everybody is not able to understand idea and concept , and replace them in a context or apply in other case and situation . last but not least , people that have understood idea and concept have the possibility to apply them . if we consider that fact are the result or the consequence of the involvement of someone 's idea , you can deduce that the most important is to remember the way to achieve this result . to conclude , i am firmly conviced that the most important for student is to learn how to think through the understanding of idea and concept rather than learn
