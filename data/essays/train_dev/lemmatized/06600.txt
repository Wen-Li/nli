i definately agree with the statement that it would be more important for student to understand idea and concept than it would be for them to learn the fact . to support my opinion i will give three reason in favour of the latter . firstly i surely agree with the opinion that student have to learn some fact . it is obviously important to know certain thing but it can not be the main objective . as i experienced , the thing you remember in the end are not the one hardly learned and memorised , but the idea and concept transmitted by a book or a professor . to be capable to memorise you need to connect the fact and to transform them in bigger piece , in concept . secondly it is not just important to know thing , but to understand them . by memorising number and number of fact you do n't automatically also understand them and you are not necessarily able to see them in relation to other factor . you are may not able to see the overall meaning of all the factor learned . thirdly , when actually using the the knowledge learned , you need concept and idea rather than pure fact . for example if you are a doctor , it doe not help you to just know where the knee is but also to be aware of all the different part of the body that can influence and affect the knee . experiencing pain in the knee is not necessarily caused by the knee itself . it can also be originated in another part of the body . summarising i think there should be both , the learning of fact - serving a a basis of knowledge - and the understanding of concept and idea , to be able to get the meaning of the knowledge learned and memorised . what count in the end is the ability of using the knowledge and this is just possible when having a profound understanding of the fact learned .
