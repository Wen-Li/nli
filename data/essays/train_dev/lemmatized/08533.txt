students can learn about many thing in school . when student learn new thing , it is very import for student to know what they are leaning from class . and there are some advantage and disadvantage at the same time to understand the key concept and to learn only fact . i prefer understanding the basic concept to learning fact from the text book . to understand the basic idea is not simply but , in my opinion , it can expand student 's ability of thinking and creation . understanding new idea and concept can take long time and sometimes it could take few decade for student . it can be problem to learning new thing . that 's why some instructor and student take shortcut to learn new thing . for example , when student who are majoring in visual communication art can learn the principle of ratio , so called ` golden ratio ' which is believed a perfect proportion for every object . it is very difficult theory to understand for specially freshman and it could take more than 2years , but if they can understand they can design anything with the basic theory . even though difficultes to understand the idea , student who understand the basic concept can apply what they learn through it . it can be easy to creat new thing with the basic concept . for instance , a musician who understand the principle of music element can compose many different kind of song and lythm using the basic music element . consequently , i recommend to understand the main idea when student learn new thing . even though it is hard and difficult way to learn about new thing , after understanding the notion from the basic . it would bring great abilites to student . that 's the main reason i study and research in order to understand the concept in the class .
