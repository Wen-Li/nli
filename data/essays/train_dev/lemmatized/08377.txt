i believe that in twenty year there will be fewer car in use than there are today . the first reason why i feel this is the fast diminishing petroleum and crude oil reserve across the world . according to one survey which i have read in the newspaper , all the oil reserve in the world may cater the demand for a maximum of another 100 year if the usage continues in the same phase . so the government may force the public to use le car to save the petroleum for other important task like cooking etc . , another reason is that even if we develop car which use electricity in the form of charged battery a fuel instead of petroleum or diesel , the generation of electricity need water or coal which are agian non-renewable source of energy and they can be replenishable . this mean that there is no guarantee for those model unless scientist come up with some source of energy like hydrogen gas which can be used a a fuel in the broader perspective without any problem in future . the third reason for my belief is the changing life style of the people around the world . one may wonder how this effect the usage of car . now a day , the life style of the modern man ha changed a lot , thanks to the luxury provided by the advancement in the technology . man ha so much been addicted to the technology that , even to go to the nearby grocery shop , he need a mean of transportation like car . so the problem of obesity ha started . this problem is not now confined to only developed country . even developing country are facing the same problem . in fact , obesity ha become a global problem . so the doctor are advising the people to have more physical exercise . so i think the mean like bicycle may provide the dual benefit and the usage of car will come down . so , given my reason , i agree with the statement that there will be fewer car in use than they are today .
