the issue at hand is `` young people enjoy life more than older people '' . i agree with this statement that young people enjoy life more than older people in so many way . i want to give some of the example why i agree with this statement . the first reason that i agree young people enjoy life more than older people is because young people have lot of energy than older people . for enjoying life it is not suffient having money , enregy also require a lot . for example travelling different country give so much of enjoy to u . for travelling different country money will not sufficient , lot of energy also required . but in older people they have le energy and they can not travel such long journies . in this way young people have more advantage to the older people . another reason that i agree young people enjoy life more than older people is that younger people can get lot of entertainment in so many way which older people can not enjoy . for example going to the disco and watching late night movie and playing game . but the older people are not intersted in watching late night movie , going to disco and playing game . this is the other way that older people miss alot . furthermore , some young people are enjoying life by concentrating on his job or any bussines work . some people are enjoying life by developing their company and bussines development . inorder to develop their growth for their work , so much of concentation , patience could require . the advantage for young people is they can produce lot of concentration , patience . but in older people , they have very le patience and they can not concentrate for long time . in this way also young people are more advantage than older people to enjoy life . finally , for all the above reason i have mentoined , i want to say that i agree with the statement that young people enjoy life more than older people in many way , however i mentoined some of these advantage to younger people for enjoying life .
