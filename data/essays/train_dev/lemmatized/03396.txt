i do n't think that young people enjoy life more than older people do , it is only a different way of enjoying theirselves and to perceive emotion . in my opinion there is more consciousness in the way in which older people try to enjoy and get the best from life , because they have lived a whole life and they really know what is important and what is not . they know , for example , that reading is more important than watching a blockbuster movie or than having a car race . young people waste a lot of time doing thing that seems important to tham but which after a couple of year would have lost their meaning . furthermore young people often try to have fun doing dangerous sport or thing . for instance , older people are used to visit art city and to chose quiter location for their holiday . this is not a sign of luck of will to appreciate life , not at all , it demonstrate only older people 's capacity to live without all modern stuff which seem to be central and crucial in young people 's life , a tv , music , disco , noise , crowded place , videogames , and so on , and to appreciate nature and historycal background . furthermore young peple 's way to have fun is often superficial and selfish . they spend a lot of time doing thing a watching tv or playing videogames which both are activity which do n't stimolate their skill and ability . these are also activitiese that do n't encourage guy to gather together , on the contrary they meke young people more and more lonely .
