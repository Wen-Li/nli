i disagree with the statement that young people enjoy life more than older people do . as a matter of fact , people who are open-minded , manage their time well and work hard , regardless of old or young , can enjoy their life without question . a bright and vigrous young spirit may have more curioisties than older people to explore the world . they are bound to learn any information they are enthusiastic with . they may have lot of social activity they have to participate in such a party , concert and sport and make friend . however , a young people who grew up in a dysfuncitonal family with narrow-minded , may not have mood to learn and play . they may fall in the depression and hateful environment and kill time by doping drug or hook around . they drop out from school and do not know what to do . they do not know how to manage themselves and their time a well , so there 's no good life they can enjoy . on the other hand , a great deal of vivid older people may retire from their job and they are veteran who save pension and good at how to lead a beautiful life . they manage their time carefully . they may get up in the morning to take a walk at the park , read newspaper on the bench and enjoy sunshine , arrange a nice trip and visit old friend sometimes ; cultivate hobby to make their child 's dream come true . some older people who do not manage well from their youth may suffer financilly difficulty to organize their life . they are sick and can not go anywhere . illness brings hard and unhappiness life for them . therefore , no matter young and old , people can enjoy life easily if they appreciate how precious life are and manage their time well and keep open-minded .
