with the current trend of stressing a person 's ability to understand and apply idea in modern workplace , a dillema that whether understanding concept is more important for student than learning fact arose . i strongly disagree with the statement a learning fact is a indispensoble process of a person 's development and should be highly emphasized . the primary reason is that the fact we learned and accumulated are the foundation to bulid up and enhance our understanding of idea . when we were young , we had limited ability to understand the world around u . it wa the fact we told by parent , medium and society helped u to generate a preliminary understanding of function and role of material surrounded u . our understanding gradually developed by considering the facted we learned and applied it to the situation we face . with the more fact , we would be able to unambiguously inteprete idea and help u to apply in real world situation . therefore , learning fact is conducive to consolidate the foundationa and explore our capacity of comprehending concept we encounter in later stage . learning fact also help to develop an appropriate cognition of ourselves in the whole community . facts of the past and present time of various subject and aspect of human community enable u to contruct our comprehension of our role in society and help u to determine our career and life goal . without sufficient information , we might narrow our scope and focus our attention on a limited facet of problem we met a well a life decision . learning fact broaden our horizon and enable u to explore our life in all sort of direction . as a nutshell , the ability of comprehending concept would only be practicle and utilitarian in real life situation when a person ha assimilated adequate fact for him to make corresponding decision . it is certainly not worthwile on stressing student ' ability to understand idea and ingnore their need to learn fact .
