the goal of a student is to learn the facts. a student can have this only trought the comprehension of the idea and of the concept that are behind the fact . for example , when i studied the history of rome , i had to understand why rome wa a big empire . for have the complete vision of this fact i went to find all the information about the history . i need to know the cause and the consequence . in my opinio , a big analysis of the cause can give me a complete vision of the real hystory , it can create a sense of criticism in myself . i can see the fact with my eye . when a person want to understand a topic or a fact he ha to ask himself what are the motivation of the topic , the idea . i agree with the statement because for me it 's very important to study the fact and not to memorize it . if a person doe n't want to know the concept , he choose to memorize the event without his comprehension about it . the knowledge of the idea and of the concept are important to create the behaviour of a person . a person who learn to see not only the fact but also what there are behind that , it will be a person who live thinking . before to do something he will think and he will process all the possibily consequence of his idea . when i have to do something important for my life , the first step is to think about my idea , my concept and where i want to go . by this analyse i can hypotize where i will go . this is possible because i study a lot of problem , i learn from it , i see the idea that give the fact . it 's impossible for me to give a critical idea of a fact without the knowledge of the ideas. a big latin writer say : `` cogito ergo sum '' . this phrase is not only philosophy . this phrase indicate the work of a man to have a good life . the english for the phrase is : `` i think so i exist '' the word `` think '' indicate the capability to understand . when i need to evaluate a fact i must think and only after this i can understand the fact . if i do n't think i am similar to animal . the big concept can be adapted also to a school . normally , in a school there is a teacher who teach the fact to the student . the teacher must explain to the student the complete vision of this fact , the idea and the concept . he must creates in the student the interest to understand , the motivation to increase their idea . the teacher must give to the student the instrument to arrive at the comprehension of the fact . the instrument to grown their brain .
