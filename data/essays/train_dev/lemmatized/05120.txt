i do not think that the number of car will decline within the next twenty year for several reason . there are big country with growing population which will have a huge demand for car . moreover , car become even more affordable . the environmental problem which come along with the use of car will be reduced , and alternative source of energy will be found in order to satisfy the increasing demand . thus , i do not agree with the thesis that fewer car will be used in twenty year than there are today . big country such a china or india have a huge demand for car a their respective economy are growing and their inhabitant are becoming wealthier . thus they will be able to afford buying car . as car are still perceived a symbol of power which represent a certain way of life , many individual will acquire car in order to demonstrate their new status . in addition , car might contribute to the development of the large rural territory of those country . moreover , car will become even cheaper due to industrial and technological progress . modern production plant provide much more efficacy than older one did and require le ressources in order to produce car . thus , the average cost of car will decline . hence , it will be easier to sell car even in underdeveloped region . finally , many of the environmental problem that come along with the use of car will be solved . there are already device which effectively reduce the emission of car . alternative source of energy such a electricity or sustainable fuel will be found . that is , future car will not have to rely on gas and oil . a lot of research is being done in this regard and ha already yielded some encouraging result . to sum it up , there is a growing demand for car . on the other hand , car are becoming cheaper , and the environmental problem caused by car will be reduced . hence , i think the number of car will increase and not decline .
