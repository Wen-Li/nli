it is very common to see people traveling to different interesting place in the world being led by a tour guide . my essay will talk about why i would really prefer to travel by myself instead of doing it in group and hiring a tour guide . first of all , you can easily notice that people who usually travel in a group led by tour guide are people who invest more money in their trip . that mean that the economic factor play an important role in this matter . for example , people who travel to europe and have enough money to pay a guide would prefer to do this because it would save them not only time , but also effort to think how to plan a good trip . in my personal opinion , i would rather prefer to invest my money in the trip and not in a person i do n't really need . secondly , the age is a predominant factor in this decision , a well . in most of the case , young people would prefer to travel by themselves to give the trip a little adventure . on the other hand , it is rare to see old people adding adventure to their experience . they only want to get the best of their trip without caring about fun . finally , and most importantly , people will enjoy the trip more if they feel independent to take their own decision . that 's what really matter on a trip , having fun and feeling free to do what you want when you decide to . to give you an example , when i had the opportunity to travel to argentina for work purpose , we were offered a trip to a beautiful village . it wa an incredible place and there were plenty of thing to do there . however , since we were supposed to follow the scheduled program defined by a tour guide , we were not able to enjoy and to know the place a if we were there by ourselves . in other word , traveling by myself is by far the best decision i could make .
