are you the kind of person who want to know every thing about a thing or a thing about every thing ? . in our life many people have to decide in between having broad knowledge of many subject and specializing in one subject . in my openion i believe that having broad knowledge is better than specializing in one specific subject . however , there are advantage and disadvantage . first of all , by having broad knowledge of many academic subject you will be a well round-educated person and have alot of skill that you can use in your daily life . having many subject make a person well round-educated one who is able to understand alot of thing that face him in his life . for example , if a person had a psycology course he would understand the act of his teenage child . moreover , by taking many academic subject you might have some skill that help you in certain situation . for example , my cousin used his french when he took his mother to a hospital to recieve a medical attention in france . so , taking many academic subject is a good choise if a person want to be a well round-educated one and to have skill that might be useful in his daily life . furthermore , because of it waste of time and distraction , having a many many academic subject might be considerd a a disadvantafe . these subject make a person spend a lot of time on them because ther are many of them and he must give them the same attention . also , they distract the person from foucesing on his own major subject which he us in his future job and let him spend his time on subject that he do not need in his job . so , a personn should think before in conclusion , having broad knowledge of many academic subject ha it own advantage and disadvantage , but since the advantage have more weight than the disadvantage , i think that having vroad knowledge of many academic subject is the best choice to make .
