it is important to know both the idea and concept a well a the fact . of cource the idea of a topic or a problem make it easier to understand and to remember it but it take much longer to be taught this concept . so sometimes it is easier to learn only fact even if they are dry and boring . it depends on what you have to do with the information , wether if you have to write an assey about that or if it is just for your own general knowledge . to know fact is sometimes important when you are talking to or discussing with other people . to show them in a short time that you have a big knowledge about different subject , you will need fact . to come back to the idea and concept i can say that if you have a big interest in something it is not enough just to know about the fact . also for yourself you want to know more and understand the whole thing . if you have exam in this topic , it is much easier to answer the asked question because you have the background . for myself i prefer to learn idea and concept . i am studying and at the university it is very important to understand the problem . the exam are very difficult and hard . so if you are not prepared and only know the fact , you are lost . but sometimes if i read the newspaper or watch tv , i try to remember short fact . usually i do not have the time to read about every topic too long so i just remember the most important thing . after that i know what other people are talking about , not at all but i can understand the problem or topic because of the learned fact . to sumerize i would say that idea and concept are important to know when it is your cource or work . but fact are good to know for social relation .
