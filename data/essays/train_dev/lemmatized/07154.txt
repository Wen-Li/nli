i believe that in twenty year there will be fewer car in use than there are today . the essay will demonstrate the reason for this first , fuel source available to u are limited . petroleum take million of year to be produced from natural source . the rate at which fuel is being consumed across the world will soon result in a shortage of petroleum . the low supply vis-a-vis increased demand will result in higher fuel price , making it unaffordable for the common man . second , there is an increased environment consciousness among the people . petroleum drilling can cause many accident , like burst pipeline , leakage etc. , that have many side effect on the environment . also , in country where pollution norm are not strict , there is a danger of global warming a a result of pollution . awareness of environment factor might make people rethink about mode of transport . third , public transport is very developed in some part of the world , and being increasingly invested in in other region . there is hardly any city in the world where efficient and well-planned public transport doe not encourage people to use it . therefore , when public transport is fully developed , many people will use it to save themselves the hassle of a daily commute in car . fourth , trend in the workplace are changing . many organization are encouraging their employee to work from home . this changed pattern in the workplace will automatically reduce the number of car on the road . lastly , though many alternative fuel source have been developed , none of them have proved to be viable or successful . take the example of hybrid car that use electricity - despite the government tax subsidy , the car do not have enough sale . the reason for this is that the cost of development is so high it doe not offset government subsidy . therefore , the reason why there might be fewer car in use twenty year later are unaffordability of fuel , increased environment consciousness , development of public transport , changing trend in the workplace and failure of alternative source of fuel .
