while there may be some advantage to learing many discipline of academic subject , i think that it is much better to study specifi subject . there are two reason for this : it practicality and it effectiveness . first of all , the reason why it is much more beneficial to study specified subject rather than broader area come from it practicality . for example , it will be much easier to find a good job if you concentrate on studying a limited area of academic subject . a recent survay show that about 80 % of large firm in japan want people who have their own speciality not broader knowledge of many academic area . in addition , it is much easiler to help other people if you focus on studying a narrow area of academic subject . from my experience , i found it true . for example , i could contribute to a group work by using my expertise that is mass medium study . the study group that research on the effect of the animation in japan after the second world war , need some people whose expertise is the recent history of the animation . because my major is deeply related to the subject , i could help them . it is obvious that it is very difficult to support them without concentrating on the specific area . secondly , another reason why it is much more advantageous to learn a specific area result from it effectiveness . it is clear that it is difficult to remember all of the area that you have laerned before . according to a scientific data , your brain much more effectively memorizes a specified subject instead of a broader area in the long run . therefore , it must be a waste of time to study a broad range of accademic area . furthermore , it is also evident that focusing on a specific subject lead to learing a broader area of academic subject . many great scholar such a kant , asserted that it is essential to scrutinize a specific area to understand the broader area . i found it true form my experience , too . in conclusion , i agree with the idea that it is much more beneficial to specialize a specific subject because of it practicality and effectiveness .
