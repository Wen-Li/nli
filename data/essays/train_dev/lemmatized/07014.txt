it 's clearly known that young people play more often than older people . but doe it mean that baby and adolescent enjoy life more than their parent or their grand parent ? i do n't think so for my part . i do n't think that enjoying your life can only be restricted to going to party , playing video game and taking a maximum of risk for yourself . it really that which mainly differ young people behavior from older people behavior . many young think that you enjoy life when you constantly confronte your life with danger . it 's really strange , because by definition , danger can easily catch out your life . but it 's what many young people choose to take conscious that they are alive . what it is essential to enjoy your life , is to have some interest point . and i think that older people often have many . they are often more prudents but it doe n't prevent them from having hudge amount of thing that they love to do . basically , what count is the pleasure that you are feeling when you are doing something that you like . if it 's the case , you enjoy your life . if a 70 year old man get pleasure when he stay hour and hour near a lake by waiting a fish with his fisher line , it 's his fully right . a 20 year old young man could find it so boring , but maybe the old man would find boring to go to one of his techno party . as a conclusion , when you grow the only thing that may change is the way that you evaluate danger . of course your behavior change according to this changement in your mind . it would be a pity for every child , if they already know that they wo n't enjoy life anymore when they will be older
