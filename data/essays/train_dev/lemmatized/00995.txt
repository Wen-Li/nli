it is hard to identy the one way in this dillema having broad knowledge about many academic subject than to specializa in one specific subject . according to me , to spealize in one specific subject provide so much detail in one subject , creates expert in specific subject and increase concentration on the issue , make team spretual , so the new achievement can be achieved easily . first of all to have broad knowledge of many academic subject make the one skip the detail . therefore they can never have deep knowledge about the one main subject . on the other hand , in the one will speliaze in one subject to do not skip the detail , since it ha so many time to focus on the subject . secondly , if the one try to know everything , acn not be expert of one subject . if the specific subject is specialized than , and make deep investigation about the area s/he will be known a the expert on the issue . then after , i can call specialized a expert in addition to those if the one ha broad knowlege of everything , s/he would not except the team work , since s/he can see himself a the one know everything . fourtunately , the expert would want to get the others aspect about the project and can create the effective team work and brain storming in order to achieve the result of his or her project . that mean getting information from other specialist . at last the expert can achive the result of the project more easliy , since s/he would only concentrate what they should do . if the help is needed than they can get help from other expert . therefore it would maximaze the efficeny of knowledge . as a result , being expert , ehich mean having specialized knowlege on specific subject creates team spretual with other expert easily , increase concentration and creates focun on the target and at last creates big achivement , so we need expert in order to courage big achievement .
