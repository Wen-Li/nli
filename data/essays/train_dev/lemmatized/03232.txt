i am agrre with the statement ` successful people try new thing and take risk rather than only doing what they already know how to do well ' . the successful people are always think about new thing . because that is their confident behaviour to reach their goal . if they find any new problem they will solve or they can think how to solve that problem . and they are perfect in that because they already doing their present job well . the person who are already succed in their field are able to do any risk for new thing . the successful people try new thing because they know the all secret to reach the new goal . and they are able to face the problem occuring with new thing . they try and they can easily done the new thing . for example , consider a successful soft ware engineer working with a company . assume , he work on project with ` c-language ' , and he is very successful in that field . however , he ha to learn the new upcoming software like `` java '' , `` oracle '' , `` vb . net '' , and `` sap '' programme . and he may take risk for that course . he attended the coaching to learn those at the time after completion of his work in present job . he can effort more to learn those . because he ha to enter in that field to work . then confidently he can succeed in his thought . another example , assume a successful state player of any game , he succeeded in his team with the state player . then he try to get the chance in national team . he know that it is very risk to get the place in national team . however he struggle for his aim . he is able to face the difficulty , because he already struggled to get the place in state level team . so it is easier to him to get the place in national team . finally , with the resons and example discussed above i am agree with the statement `` successfull people try new thing and take risk rather than only doing what they already know how to do well '' .
