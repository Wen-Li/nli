i agree with this idea , of course you know young people are much more cheerful than elderly people , so young guy have an unlimitede opportunites to do , on the other hand , older people do not have a chance to do such a thing , young people tend to do new thing , they are all keen to result in success , what a great life they have , teenagers just like me is full of power and passion , next talking about older people , before i get started , ihave someting tosay . i do not deny elderly people , they are great and everyone look up to them , but this is our young generation , it is our turn , the good point of older people is they know a lot of thing through their life , they can think about problem better than young people , i mean older people have good knowledge , so young people is not able to defeat older people in a way . however young people have a dream , there are so many thing and chance in front o their eye , the matter is how to get the opportunity . some guy want to be asuper star like smap , the other guy want tobe a great president like a former live door president horie , for older people it is too late to think about their dream like this , but having a dream is really good , i also have also a dream to master english compeletely , go abroad and become a maneger of suports entertainment , a numer of possiblities are lying around u . i would like tosay to young guy have a big dream , anyting gose , if you believe , you will definetely achive ,
