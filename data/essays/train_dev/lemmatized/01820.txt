it is not better to have broad knowledge of many academic subject than to specialize in one specific subject . it may cause a huge problem because if a lot of person know a little about many subject , how do they teach something in detail about a sepecific subject to another ? also how do people become a teacher with this little information ? how do knowledge can improve with a little information about a subject ? that is why it is better to specialize in one specific subject than to have a broad knowledge of many academic subject . lets consider that there is a little population in a small land and they know a little information about every academic subject like geography , biology , history , physic . .. etc . with this little knowledge it would be hard to determine geographical characteristic of the land , or specie that live in the land and their difference or similrities . even it will be hard to now what is a specie or it would be hard to know about their history and it will be hard to put thing on a road in the future . so , that will help to the population to destroy themselves more quickly . on the other hand , imagine a land which is full of people who have a well knowledge about their one proffecional area . with this proffecion they can teach their knowledge to their child or the one who want to learn about the subject . the difference between this example from the previous one is they will know much more information on a subject and that will help to develop themselves more quickly . in conclusion , a i said and support the idea with the example before , i believe that it would be more effective when people have one proffecional area than to know a little about a lot of subject because it will help them to improve themselves and also to have a well educated population in the land .
