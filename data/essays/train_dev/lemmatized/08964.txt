first of all i would like to write that i am in complete agreement with the statement . let me say some of the reason that support my decision : since there are more innovation and new thing coming in , the young peolpe spend their time doing thing that in the near future do not contribute with the development of their community . as an example i would like to say some example about what the young peolple of my country do at the moment and what the young peolple did before . i remembered when i wa at the school , the teacher took u to different place of the city in order to do social activity with the poor people , we braught them food , toy , clothes , and it wa really satisfactory for all of u . in addition to all this activity , at the end of the school , i mean in the last year , we had to do a social project whit the community and it wa a part of the grade at the end of the year , but anyway we did that for other reason ... `` help the people '' . however , after to have finished the school , i still carry on with this kind of activity and some of friend also do that yet . on the other hand , when i look at the young people now , i get surpriesed how the life change and how the activity that we used to do it before do not exist right now . what the zoug people are interested in ? ... go to the disco , play x/box , playstation , internet , watching t.v , etc. and some others activity that do not contribute with the integral formation of the person . i think that much of the behaviour the young people have , are coming from the rapidly change of the world . however we can not forget that we do not live alone , we live with other people that probably need our help and we have not realised yet . .
