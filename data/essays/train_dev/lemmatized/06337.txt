in this period of time where there is a lot information to be processed , we need both people who have a broad knowledge in many academic field and one who are more specialized in specific subject . we need a well balance between the two . the people who have a broad range of many academic field are required because they can pinpoint problem more generically because of their wider perspective . one example to this is in medical field . for instane , a generalist doctor ha a wide range of information about human body but in small depth . however , for most of the time , they can solve the problem of their patient unless the problem are very specific . there is no need for a brain surgeon to examine the patient having problem with flue or just a headache . the people who have more specific knowledge about a topic is also required because by having a broad range of information with a small depth in many field doe not guarantee to solve every problem . a brain surgeon ha a very specific and in-depth knowledge about brain and brain surgery . revisiting the medical field example , a patient who is examined by a generalist and advised to see a specialist in brain would need a brain surgeon for further examination . a generalist can not have specific and in-depth data in such a case . to sum up , we need both generalist and specialist . none of them should be overrated .
