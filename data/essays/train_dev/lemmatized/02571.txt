ford , the genius who created the assembly line , in order to manufacture more car in a smaller amount of time . since then , the production of car have increased rapidly . the cheaper and faster manufacturing of car increased the production . supplying the comfort of car to most of the the world 's population . in my opinion , i think that there will be more car than there are today . today 's scientist are testing to create a new model of car in order the decrease the greenhouse effect . there ha been the invention of oil with the use of corn , however it ha not been put ot effect yet due to the cost of car which can function with that specific type of oil . however , a the supply of oil will run low throughout the year , the demand for corn oil would rice guaranteeing the hygiene and the cleaness of the air in the environment . therefore , the people will not have to stress out about polluting the environment like today 's car . the population over the year ha risen rapidly . over the next 20 year it is guaranteed that the population statistic chart will keep soaring higher and higher . the increase of population indicates that more car will be needed for transportation . as i have stated in the previous paragraph of the hygiene of the corn oil , people would not have to worry about the greenhouse effect turing the earth into a giant fire ball , or the glacier melting and rising 100 meter above sea level . due to the increase of population the production of car will keep increasing a well . the increase in population soon will not be able to fit all the population in one metropolis . as the city become crowded the people will move out of the city into suburbian area . therefore , travelling will be necessary on a dailiy basis for most people who work in the center of the city , or have school in the city . due to the transportation needed everyday , many people will consider to buy a car . therefore , the amount of car in the street will increase , along with the area of the city and the population in the world . cars will soon be a necessary object , which the population of the world will rely heavily on . therefore , the fluctuating of the amount of car will not happen . as long a ford remains in our history book a the father of car , the decreasing of ford 's invention will not happen .
