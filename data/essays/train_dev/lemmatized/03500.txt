in these day , lot of company want from their employee to have broad knowledge of many academic subject than to specialize in one specific subject . however , in my opinion , to specialize in one specific subject is better for people for some reason . first of all , to specialize in one specific subject is good for a person . if a person only interested in one specific subject , he or she can focus in that subject carefully and he or she can know all of the detail of that subject . he or she whoever study a specific subject will be an expert of his or her subject . second of all , if an employee in a big company have broad knowledge of many acedemic subject , the manager of that company can do out of work others employee because of the person who have broad knowledge of many academic subject . that is unemployment and it is not good for economy and employee . so everybody can do their job in the big company . third of all , if a person want to have broad knowledge of many academic subject , it would be killing-time because that person can start their career in a company and he or she can start living real life a few year ago . to sum up , although lot of company want from their worker to have broad knowledge of many academic subject nowadays . because of these reason such a focusing in one subject , employment , start to live real life a few year ago it is better to specialize in one specific subject than to have broad knowledge of many academic subject .
