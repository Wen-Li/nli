we do not have any proof about this statement and so we can say many different thing . when i talk to my father and we are involved in traffic he carry on saying that he when wa a teen there wa not all this mess . streets were not full of car because there wa only one car per family . now everything ha changed . first of all every year we hear about statistic investigation that give u a completely different point : the number of car is increasing . this may be caused by the improving of our wealth condition . when my father wa young italy wa a poor country and it wa just at the beginning of it transformation in a modern country . so the actual situation doe not seem to sustain the statement . there is however some other consideration that we can do . our development can not be sustained by our planet . our supply of oil are getting fewer and fewer and we have not found valid alternative power to substitute oil by now . there is hydrogen but it is more expensive . at the same time electrical engine do not have the same performance of the actual engine . so if for example hydrogen will be our only alterntive it will probably be impossible for a family to have enough money to pay more than one car with hydrogen a propeller . the other thing that can influence the number of car is the policy of our government . as i have already mentioned , traffic is increasing more and more every year . but it will not be always possible to build new street and new route . there will be a limit . this fact can be already seen in the choice of some important city . to get in london with our car we must pay a ticket . also milan is going to adopte similar decision . so perhaps there will be a strong development of public transport . instead some country have already found different alternative . netherlands for example is the country where there is the highest number of bicicles in the world . if you walk around the street of amsterdam , you will see bicicles everywhere . even in front of bar , megastores and fastfoods . but this result is related to the choice of the government of building street for bicicles . so the politician have encouraged people to lock their car in their garage . in the end , i do not see the possibility of a spontaneus reduction of the number of car . there are too many interest often related to the oil industry and to the factory that build car . they are often important part of our economy and the government do not want to damage them . but they will be probably obliged with u to change our life style when the situation will get unsustainable .
