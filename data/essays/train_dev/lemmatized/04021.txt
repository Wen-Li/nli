studying can be a great pain for many student , and it is true that many doubt the purpose of learning throughout the course . i believe learining is an important process in which i can incorporate more information and enrich myself , therefore i believe studying in general is important . however , i believe understanding the basic idea ha to come before learning fact , which is usually more simple and interesting . for instance , i have know many friend who do not have strong base for the mathematic : they have difficulty in solving basic calculation such a multiplication with fraction . also , when a student ha difficulty in understanding , it is likely to cause her to lose interest in study . thus , lack of the basic knowledge may lead student to lose the will to study . when those who lack the basic knowledge learn fact , those fact may not seem so appealing because they are not familiar . however , learning fact can be more entertaining . and moreover , i believe it effect is the most apparent in the study of history . for example , i strongly believe that i would not be so interested in studying history , or world war ii in particular , if it wa not for the background knowledge i have gained throughout the life . because i have seen a documentary about anne frank and holocaust , the information provided in the classroom seem a lot more interesting and familiar , giving me a will to learn more about the subject . although some people may not realize the great importance of the presence of interest , i believe student should persue strong base for each subject through understanding the idea step by step . i believe interest are greatest factor which would bring change to the student ' attitude , and more importantly , their will to study . and i do enjoy knowing and persuing trivia . however , a a student and for my ability to study pleasantly , i believe it is more important to have a great understanding in the genral idea rather than learning fact by bit , for collection of the fact is le likely to make sense . but i would like to stress that understanding of general idea and learning fact can be interdependent for enjoyable study .
