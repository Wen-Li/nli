i do not believe that succesful people always have to try new thing rather than doing what they do best . a successful person is n't someone who is good in everything he or she try , it is someone who is among the best in what he or she know the best . if the former definition wa true it would mean that there are n't any successful people in life because noone can be good at everything . many people consider bill gates a a successful person . after all , he took the risk , established microsoft , and earned billion of dollar from it . however , even he doe n't try other thing that are outside of his strenghts , such a swimming . i am one of the best swimmer turkey ha ever seen , and i hold multiple national record . many people consider me a a successful person a well . suppose that bill gates wa to try a swimming career , and we competed side to side in a meet . doubtlessly , i would have won , but would that make bill gates a loser , instead of a successful person ? would it mean that i am more successful than him ? i think not . success is about what you can achieve with what you are given , not about how many risk you take . a one year old talking baby is a successful baby . a student with the iq 150 getting 90 per cent on a logic test is not so successful . taking risk and trying new thing in life broadens your vision , it doe n't have anything to do with being successful . people who do what they do best are already successful . they do n't need to wander around for new excitement just so that other people consider him or her to be successful a well .
