what road for car is it possible to predict the future ? to some extent , of course , no is a definitive answer ; yet , if there is a way to do that , it is by looking back at the past , and infer from it the trend that are likely to continue and those that are likely to stop . so , in order to try to give an answer to the much-discussed question concerning the future of car , we must refer to history . after their invention at the beginning of last century , car have mad a long road ( pun intended ) : although considered for a while a futureless object ( a it happened for most of other invention ) , or even a terribly dangerous monster , they became more and more common , and by the half of the 20th century ( in the western world ) had started to became a popular way of transportation . so , should we look only to this phase of car ' history , we would probably be lead to think that they are bound to grow in number more and more with the expansion of richness from industrialized , western countrie , to the rest of the world . yet , somehow surprisingy , the last decade of the 20th century have witnessed the increase in the number of circulating car getting slower and slower in the industrialized world , and especially in the so-called third-sector based society . in other term , it seems that , if the number of car get higher proportionally to the welfare of a people , it also reach a certain level when it stop growing , or even start getting smaller . this phoenomenon account for the fact that apart for the micro-states , the highest ratio of car to inhabitant can today be found not in the richest country such a the u.s. or canada or the u.k , but in country that have started to develop a little later ( such a italy , or ireland ) , and where the inversion of the process ha not still occurred . but how can we explain such a trend ? the answer is quite easy : when a people start to get richer it can afford car and so buy them ; but connected with wealthy often come the realization of the importance of such end a clean air or comfortable , pleasant city , which lead more and more people to prefer public transportation ( the use of which ha increased drammatically in the industrialized world over the year ) . also , other easier and more practical mean of transportation become accessible to the mass ( let just think of low-cost air company ) . all this considered , the only way to decide whether car will become more in the next twenty year is state which will be the level of wealthy and it distribution around the world at that time . if it s in fact fair to say that the number of car in developed country will have decreased , it is much more difficult to consider teh case of developing country . in twenty year , in fact , they will hopefully have began a process that will make them richer , which will increase the number of car worldwide ; yet , if some of them at least will have done so much faster than we can now predict , by that time they will probably also start to show the sign of the opposite trend .
