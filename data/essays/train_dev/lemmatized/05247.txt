i dont really agree with this statement that `` most advertisement make product much better than they really are '' . because it aways happens in the other way , that they will not be much better than they really are or they really seem to be . here come the difference , they will advertise the product by showing it good quality and the way it work or so on , but they wil not show it defect , they will not count on those . perhaps they seem much better when they advertise them and they will convince u to buy it , it after that all happens that we will come to know about the actual performance of it , which is really worse . but sometimes it happens that the product seem much better than they really are , but note it , sometimes only , it just very rare . i will give you live example which ha been experienced by me in the past . once i bought a video-cd player , convinced by the product advertisement in which it wa shown all it good quality and said it performs better than the remaining one in the market . so i bought it thinking that it will be a better option to buy the product of that company . but i wa completely wrong in my choice , because it wa always subjecting to repair and it wa not working properly . i went wrong in selecting , by seeing the advertisement . another example is an experience of my friend with a cosmetic product which promise to glow your skin , bought it by seeing the advertisement and thinking it will make her skin glow , instead it left itching of the skin and allergy of skin . so , i strongly stick to my opinion that they are not a much better a they seem to be . i conclude by saying that i disagree with the statement .
