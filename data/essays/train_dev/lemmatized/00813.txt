if we talking about advertisement of goods/products the first thing to do is to know what the producer or the seller want to reach . he want to sell his product , and he will do everything to reach his porpouse . advertisement is one of method say to the customer `` here i 'm ... and this is my product '' . who sell product using advertisement trying to show it own product much better than they really are . doing that , they , the seller , try to attract the consumer , showing the best side of the product . in particular trhere are two elementse most important than the other used in an advetisement : price and quality of good . who work in the advertising field know how to advertisement a product . for example using comparative advertisement method : say to the costumer that theyr product are different by the others . another method is to say to the consumer that his/her life is not complete without this or that or surely will be better . my opinion is that advertisement is based on knowledgement of social and human science . that is , knowing what the major part of person will think looking a good in a particular light or a particular color can be obtain his goal . we know human want what they immagine or wish . if the seller is able to advertisement his product in the way that the consumer want is target is reached . may be before to buy something , it will be better if everybody ask to ourself is what i 'm going to buy is like i see in the real and not what it seems in my mind . i that my opinion !
