i agree with the statement . there are two danger that lay within , if you specialize in one specific subject . one is the danger of not being able to find solution to problem anymore . if you become so boggled up in one subject , you will eventually develop what is commonly known a `` tunnel vision '' and implies that you can no longer look left or right of your own thought . but sometimes the answer lie somewhere outside , which you are simply not able to see or even realize if you have never heard of it . the second danger is that if you become too specific in one subject , no one else may follow your thought anymore and understand you , thus making your work and/or discovery virtually useless to society . one good example of how having a broad knowledge of many academic subject is in the field of law . a lawyer who ha knowledge only of his own national law and rule my end up not finding a solution to the problem within his own system , but if he were to look outside and compare how maybe other country or code have solved that same problem , he could adopt the solution and create a more effective system . another example would be found in the area of technology . technological progress can much better be made if you can take and compare discovery made in different sector . energy and automobile technology seem to be depended on each other . one without the other would not be able to survive . automibles need energy and energy company rely on the automobile industrie a customer and consumer . exchange in idea can only lead to improvement .
