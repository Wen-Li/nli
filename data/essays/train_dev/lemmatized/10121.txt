in my opinion in order to have a better understanding of idea , concept must be supported by fact . first of all it is impossible to understand an idea without a complete evaluation of the fact that are the base structure of the concept . if you understand an idea without knowing the fact behind it , then you are only learning a `` dogma '' . an example of dogmatic understanding is the religious one that ignores fact , because is not looking for a deep understanding of thing but only to a solution that will bring to it answer . this is why in religious learning , fact are generally avoided : they do prefer interpretation . second of all , to understand something you need to start learning the fact in order to start a critical analisys . the only way to start this process of understanding is starting from the knowledge of fact . in order to understand an idea you must know what wa the historycal situation in which this idea wa created . i 'll make an example in order to make my opinion clearer : you ca n't understand the basic idea of comunism or nazism without knowing the historycal situation and dynamic that brought to these different political , social and economical totalitarisms . at last , i would say that you do n't really understand anything if you ca n't prove it and explain it with fact . is with an empiric analisys of fact that you can prove what you have understood and why you believe so . every scientist need an experiment to clear his point , otherwise he will seem not credible and his idea not effective . these are the three reason why i believe that there is a strong link and connection between understanding an idea and learning the fact related to the concept .
