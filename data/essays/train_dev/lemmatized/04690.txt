specialization or broad knowledge whether or not specialization should be favored in academic is a controversial issue . it is not easy to completely state that specialization on a specific subject is better compared to having broad knowledge of academic subject . however , i belive that specialization on a specific subject should be accompanied with a broad knowledge of other subject . firstly , it is practically not possible and reasonable to have a broad knowledge of many academic subject . human time and energy would not be sufficient to have knowledge on many issue . even though it is ideal , specialization in a subject is only possible for mankind . to have a broad knowledge on academic subject is not reasonably possible , since it is contrary to the idea of academic . furthermore , specialization would help for the evolution of human civilization . progress could only be achieved by knowledge and only by specilization such a knowledge could be achieved . knowledge is attained through concentration , research and experimentation . however it is not possible to experiment in all realted academic subject . for instance , if newton did not contentrate on physic but have bit and piece of physic , biology and chemistry he wouldnot be able to develop his theory . similarly , if freud did not specialize on psychoanalysis many of his assertion would not exist . on the contrary , it must be kept in mind that an academic require an awareness . in order to be a serious academic , apart from specialization general knowledge and awareness is required . an academic in social science should be open to learning about chemistry for instance . specialization only ha a value if is exercised within the context of relevant discipline . for instance , a commercial lawyer , must know the code , doctrine a well a the relevant history , economic structure , managerial problem , business practice . consequently , in the 21st century it is required for human to be specialized . the primary reason for specialization is the progress of mankind . in addition to that , one most always keep in mind that a specialist always have to have broad knowledge
