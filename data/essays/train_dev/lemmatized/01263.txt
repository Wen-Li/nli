older people usually consider young people of our generation a more lazy and more self-centered than young people of their own generation . eventhough the origin of this belief is easy to understand in individualistic country , i find it difficult to accept the idea that people nowadays do n't give enought time to helping their community . indeed , i think that modern society offer more structure and organisation to allow people to help the community indirectly . for instance , system such a the social security system in france allow worker to help indirectly the people needing health care by paying tax . if this idea do not seem to apply directly to young people , once again we can argue that young people are indirectly helping their community . for instance , when they spend time working for school in order to get the needed skill to eventually find a job and contribute to the wealth of the country . some people would argue on the other hand that governements of modern society do not offer enought to the people who still need individual help , not only in term of money , but mostly in term of time . an example could be the lack of volontiers for the care of retiered people needing personnal help . if one approach consists in blaming the people having free time , like the young people , for their selfishness , and alternative attitute can be to look at who help , and who doe n't help to change the situation . modern society probably reached this point of no-return where people got used to rely on the governement for social issue . therefore it seem reasonnable to give more credit to the people who actually act on the governement - by the power of voting , by protesting , or taking part in the political life - so that social issue become a major concern . as a conclusion , they are different way of helping a comminity , and we can find , depending on the culture or the country , specific group of young people who actually give time to make something usefull , either by working hard at school , or by voting .
