i strongly disagree with the statement . old people enjoy their life a much a old people . what i feel is enjoyment is a subjective perception and doe not depend on age at all . an older person can enjoy more than a young person also . i feel enjoyment depends largely on few thing like individual psycology , socio economic status , family circumstance and friendsand health . . for example an old person of 70 yr old , his mode of enjoyment is different . he enjoys more with family his or her child and grand child or by reading spiritual thing or doing thing of his or her own intrest like reading book , listening to music or by going for a tour . if an old person ha all this facility he can enjoy more than a young person . if you select a young person his or her mode of enjoyment may be comlpletly different . he or she may be enjoying his or her life by buying a sport car , going out with friend , shopping , dancing doing thing of his or her own intrest . what i would say is , enjoyment depends on how u are receiving thing surrounding person and person responce to that situation . young person may not enjoy at all if he depressed with his perfomance in education and because of his poor economic status and lacking good friend and having no family life . and old person may not enjoy because of his health and family problem and physical uncoperativeness . i would like to end this passage saying again that enjoyment doe not depend on how old are you but it largely depends on people mentality , socio economic status and surrounings . as far a i know their is no study saying young people enjoy more than elder people .
