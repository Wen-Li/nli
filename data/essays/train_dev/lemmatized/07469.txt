in general , i would say that both are important and they complement to each other . in my experience , i would say that it is more advantageous for student to undertand idea and concept than to learn fact ; although , this may not be true in all case . firstly , the study of fact is based on the understanding of concept and idea . it is not possible for a student to understand properly a fact if he or she doe not have a basic knowledge of the idea an concept which constitute the basis of these fact . secondly , while the study of fact is based on memory , the study of idea and concept allows student to use their reasoning in order to understand the cause and effect of thing or fact . the understanding of concept allow them to establish relationship between different concept a well a their cause and effect . however , it is also important to take into consideration that each educational method ha it own advatages or disadvantage according to the student . for some student it is easier to learn through fact , while other student understand better through concept and ides . these difference depend on the type on intelligence of the student . the study based on the understanding of concept or fact varies according to each profession . for example , philosopher learn based on abstract concept and idea ; which they identify in fact . on the contrary , i conslusion , i belive that understanding idea and concept provide student with more valuable tool and skill for their future life . however , there might be some case in which it might be more beneficial for a student to learn based on fact .
