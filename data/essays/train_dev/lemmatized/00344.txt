i think i would agree with the statement that it 's better to have broad knowledge of many academic subject than to specialize in one specific subject . having vast knowledge in several kind of subject allows you to have an opinion on such or such topic whereas if you specialize in only one area of study , you can not form a rich opinion on any other area of study but your own . if you take the french academic system versus the american one . it clearly show this difference . in france , when you enter university you have to choose a section , for example if i want to major in english , i wo n't be able to add psychology a a minor . so you have to specialize yourself quite early . although this system tends to change , little by little , now with the ects system , which basically premits french student to go and study through europe with the transfer of their credit and vice versa . . whereas in the united states , each class is assigned to a specific number of credit , during your first two year of college you are able to choose within the large catalog of class a long a you get a enough credit to validate your academic year . this mean that you can take an anthropology a well a an algebra class . thanks to this system , it enables you to get to know various subject and to be able , later on , to choose in what realm of study you want to pursue your study . in my opinion , this system is part of the reason why so many international student want to come and study in america . they want to see what each subject ha to offer before specializing in one in particular .
