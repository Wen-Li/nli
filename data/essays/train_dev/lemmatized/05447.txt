`` live life kingsize '' . this is the statement which i always relate to . so i do not agree with the statement that young people enjoy life more than older people do . happiness and enjoyment in life , doe not fade away with age but more to do with the personality of the person . firstly , there is not any age limit defined for a person to enjoy his life . i have seen people who in their old age fully enjoy their life a compared to their young counterpart . so enjoyment in life ha more to do with the personality and nature of the person rather than his age . if a person is very jovial and fun loving , he will like to socialise with his friend , go for vacation with the family and will do thinggs that will bring happiness to him . these gesture of happiness and enjoyment can be done by a person of any age . but a person of serious nature , would like to spent his time alone rather then enjoying . enjoyment mean different thing to different people . for some it might be spending time with family or socialising with friend . for some it going on vacation and exploring new place . some people enjoy doing activity like painting and drama , which make them happy . so there is no specific age to enjoy these thing in life . although , one of the reason that can be stated in favor that young people enjoy life more than older people is that when you are yough you are more physically healthy to fulfil your hobby and activity , which make you happy . there are certain thing that a youger person can do , which an older person might not be able to do which so much of passion and energy . in conclusion , i would like to state that age actually doe not matter for a person to enjoy life . it depends on your own outlook and the way you want lo live . so if you are young by heart , dont count your age and enjoy life to the fullest .
