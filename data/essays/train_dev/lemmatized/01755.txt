people have saveral thing for getting in knowledge . there is many training subject that people have broad knowledge in one specific subject or in many academic subject . i do n't agree with both of it . i think people should have knowledge in one specific subject and also many academic subject . because there is many problem in the world and much of them ca n't solve by knowing one subject . it requires many knowledge about different subject . for example , in engineering problem you have to know mathematics , phsics and also chemistry to solve it . i think a person also must be good at one subject and he know everything in this subject . this give a person self convidence for example i 'm an engineer and i know many thins about steel , if any body asks me some question about it , i enjoy to tell him what he asked and i enjoy read something about it that can be in inthernet or in newspaper . and other reason for having more academic subject is that make people open minded . for example , if a writer know something about history , he can write better . knowing event in the past give him new opinion about what will happen about people . having broad knowledge in one spesific subject help people to find a job . i think if you are really really well in one subject people need your opinion and your work . because company hire 2 or 3 person for a subject but if you demostare them you 're best in it , company prefers to hire only one . i think that only having knowledge of many subject ca n't be good for u and also having knowledge in one spesific subject ca n't help u at all . people need both of it for being awerage than others .
