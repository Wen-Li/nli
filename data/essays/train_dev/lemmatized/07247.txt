cars are everthing in this world they have now become the only way of trasportation in land . this doe not mean that car are always going to be with u . in my opinon due to low oil production in the future car will suffere in demand . also in twenty year from now other kind of transportation may be developt that may under take the car industy . and also cause of oil price car will not be used u much . we have to face the truth , that car may not always be wit u . cars in the present day work with oil . due to oil foling in supply the car industry is what is going to be affected the most . becuase car need oil , in order to work and function . in 20 year many other people would have change to other way of transportation cause they now that oil will run out and car price will fall to the ground . this causing le car in use then now . due to oil distuying the enviorment many people have created alternative transportation . some other people will find in easier just to buy a bike or another product to go and work . cars are just not perfect , and cause they are not perfect they will disapear . due to oil runing out car will be very expensive cause there are only a few people that can buy a car and but gasoline . this will bring scarcity . due to this few people will buy car and so causing other way of transportation . in my opinion due to oil been such un important for car . the car will decrease in quantity sold . cause of taste of people , price , and other tecnological advance in the transportation industry . cars in 20 year from there will be fewer car in use then now .
