today adertisements are everywhere ; television , newspaper , magzine , even on the surface of the car . those product on the ad always look so nice , but are they really like how they are decribed on the ad ? no . using star is a very common stradegy for ad . for example , those famous model that appear on the skin production ad suggest people to use that product , saying it 's really good and all . makes people it is that product that actually made her so beautiful , but sometimes they do n't even use it at all . some ad about food say it would make you feel you are in the some place alse , like in the park , on top of the moutain , in the wild nature , etc . it 's just so unreal , and i never trust those kinda ad . they often us no.1 in the nation , no.1 in the state , or no.1 among same business . but sometimes you can see there are more than one no.1 ; so which one you can trust . so overall , i think ad are just used to make product look better , so people will buy them .
