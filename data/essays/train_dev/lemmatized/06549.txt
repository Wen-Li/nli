there 's a variety of reason to support the idea that a specific competence in a particuar field is much better than a wide , unclear knowledge . i want to underline the term wide and unclear , because most of the time they match ; i want to clarify this aspect with an example ; because of my technical study in mechanical engineering i ' ve always had contact with pragmatic subject such a the projection of a machine or the capability to recognize the cause in an accident ; with the preparation you aquire in a litterature university you will have for sure a wide knoledge about the fact that play a role in our society or the ability explain an autor opinion , but the lack of a specif preparation could negatevely affect the job opportunity . indeed without a great preparation on a specific topic , nobody will find on you a valuable reason to take you a a part of the factory . another plus point , is the amount of money you could earn ; i ' ve been impressed by the salary that a member of the chourus in wich i sing earn , and asking him the key of success he answered : `` nothing come without the sacrifice and the constant will the deep your knowledge '' . speaking my mind , i can assure that if you acquire a position in the enviroment in wich you work , nobody will ask you to leave the desk , and that ' s because you are an essential and vital part in the production . i can prove this with a personal experience my father had with his factory ; with the growing competivity , especially from the china an india the factory the selling were seriously affected and a a result of that some of the employer were fired , nonetheless the more able to regain a leading position in the market were preserved and after the first result they gain an award . in conclusion , we can say , how important is to have a good education , especially in the nowadays life , with the hopeness that all the effort we have made could give a great result .
