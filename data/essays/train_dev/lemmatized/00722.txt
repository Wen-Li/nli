some people think that the way to travel in a group led by a tour guide is not good . however , i fully agree that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide for the following reason . first , traveling in a group led by a tour guide is safer than travel alone or without tour guide . for example , when i wa a junior at waseda university , a famous private university in tokyo , japan , i joined the tour to french for ten day with tanada kota , my best friend at the same class , in 1990 . it wa the first time for me to go to abroad and i could not speak french language . during the stay in paris , i caught a bad cold and fever . mr. suzuki , a tour gide , wa a kind man , had a heart of gold , and spoke french nicely . mr. suzuki took me to the hospital . thanks to mr. suzuki , i could cure my disease and came back to japan . as the above experience show that traveling in a group led by a tour guide is safer than travel alone or without tour guide . second , traveling in a group led by a tour guide is more fun than travel alone or without tour guide . for example , when i wa a junior at chuo high school , located north of tokyo , i joined the tour to kyoto , a traditional area in japan , with my friend of the swimming club . the tour guide named hitomi wa so humoras and beautiful lady . so , we took many picture with hitomi . that wa a nice memory for u even today . last sunday , i ran into tomohisa kamimura , a member of that kyoto tour , at the tokyo station . we went to a bar and talk about our memory about ms. hitomi for three hour with a lot of whisky . it wa great night for me . as the above example demonstrates , traveling in a group led by a tour guide is more convenient than travel alone or without tour guide . in conculusion , i definitely agree that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide .
