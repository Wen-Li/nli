the statement that `` most advertisement make product seem much better than they really are '' is a quite provocative statement . in order to analyse this i will differentiate between some type of advertisement . as far a i think there are three especially effective way of drawing attention to a product or service . the probably most effective one are tv commercial . in second place i see magazine or poster advertisement . thirdly i think radio ad are quite effective . exactly in the order that i listed these three type i think there is a hierarchy present that is linked to the statement . tv commercial are extremely powerfull ! the human mind is affected by such commercial in a great variety of way . the visual stimulation is obvious . it is also understandable that the audio affect a person . but an immense power of a commercial lie in those factor that are delivered to the submissive mind . let 's say you have 24 to 30 image per second in a modern film . if one image per second show your product in an otherwise `` normal '' film , you get automaticly attracted to it . fortunately that way of advertisement is prohibited because the customer might be affected against his will . poster and radio advertisement only have an `` honest '' attempt to draw the attention . but still they can a well include a lot of stylistic device that can influence a viewer towards the product . colors , for example , are extremely powerfull . although different color might have different meaning in different culture . in the western hemisphere for example red might represent the wild , blue the relaxed and silver the elegant . that way a customer might get the feeling of an extremely stylish toothbrush if it is shown in a bright silver light . that way a special significance is attached to a basicly normal object . this a well might vary between culture . therefore i agree to the statement . personally i think this is the great power the advertisement have . commercials play with all the association people might have and by doing so they deliver a message that somehow praise their product or service .
