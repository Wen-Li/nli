some people believe that braod knowledge of various academic subject is more important than a special skill in one specific subject . in contrast , others think that specialized skill in a certain subject is much more profitable , because one can become the best in that certain field . i personally support the former idea , because having broader knowledge of diverse subject indicates that this could be applied more often in reality and bring advantage when deciding one 's career . firstly , by having diverse knowledge of various academic subject , i can find out in which subject my talent lie . for example , one can attend numerous class , such a mathematics , psychology , geography , biology and other . however , the person can find out that he/she is only talented in subject like calculous and science but is terrible in biology and history class . thus , the person can find out where his/her talent is and be able to make clear and benefitial decision for his/her future career . not to mention that being knowledged in various field , one is not restricted in one area when deciding his career or talent . moreover , people can apply their various skill in number of area . reason being , if a person is only specialized in one area , he can not contribute to other field of work . however , being knowledgeable in diverse area , even when he/she face challenging situation , the person can easilly apply his knowledge and therefore ameliorate the situaltion . additionally , when someone is in dire need of help , the person with broad knowledge can use his surviving skill to rescue the person . in fact , knowledgeable in only one specific subject , often one can not be well informed about what he/she must do when the person face emergency . in conclusion , even though being specialized in one specific subject is also benefitial , i believe that having broad knowledge of numerous area is much more practical and advantageous . this is largely because , people can find out their true talent and more often apply those knowledge in reality .
