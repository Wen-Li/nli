in many school and institution it is beleived that the importance in learning is by memorizing fact and concept other than actually understanding them . we are facing two very different type of learning and teaching , and i personally think that the best way is to analize and comprehend . in the older day , teacher left asigments to the student of memorizing and copying fact , date , name , number , among other thing . then , the student woul 've passed not even 1 year and he would have forgotten everything the history teacher told him to memorize about the second world war . it would n't have been of any of memorizing in the first place . now , in the other hand , i think that a more modern type of teaching is by making the student analize the problem and understand the answer . for example , in mathematics or physic , instead of the teacher giving the formula to meassure the air , or to find a number , let the student find the formula by himself . in a way , i think this type of teaching help the student to develop certain ability and it esaier for them to solve problem in a far or close future . i think it is very important to actually use the whole porcentage of brain we are capable of using and to think , and figure out our own answer . we are not born with the ability we have , but we reforce them , make them stronger . in my personal opinion , it is much more imoportant for u ( student ) to understand and comprehend idea and concept than it is for u to learn and memorize them . besides , memorizing is always boring . its funner to learn by aplying this type of teaching . thinking is fun . understanding is fun . learning is fun .
