some people say that having a variety of knowledge is better , believe that specializing in one specific subject is more desirable . i think that a lot of invention which enabled our human life to be more comfortable did n't emerged without specific knowledge offered by some brightest scholar . besides , we can get bigger responsiblity and money from specific knowledge . here is the more detailed illustration belows . first , a lot of ingenious scholar which had a great amount of specific knowledge have invented prodigious invention which make our life useful . to put it another way , only such a people who have deep knowledge can contribute new finding which lead human society to advance . for example , i think people who have wide but shallow knowledge are not capable of inventing the airplane or spacecraft that which enabled u to be transported very quickly . this typically show that specific knowledge or researsh in one subject is so important for human society 's advancement . my second point is that we would benefit from the specific knowledge more than wide and shallow knowledge . in other word , we can get more responsibility and contribute in our society . in some job , there is a role that only such a person who ha the specific idea , skill or knowledge can deal with . in those job , a only such a person can do , they are to be given bigger responsibility . moreover , in such a job , we tend to make more money because the number of people who can deal with the task is so few . when people can feel that they have a good responsibility , contribute to the society . and make more money , they are definitely satisfied . this idea clearly teach me how specific knowledge is important also fo individual person . however , some might say that wide knowledge is also important factor to live in the society . of course , when we travel to another country or watch some art , we had better have wide ide on it because we would be more impressed . but i think this fact yield nothing to our society , this fact only make individual person feel content . therefore , this position dose n't disprove my point . for these reason , i think having specific and deep knowledge is better than having wide and shallow lnowledge . my idea contributes not only to the individual but also our society .
