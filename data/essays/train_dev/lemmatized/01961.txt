regard of whether car will be fewer in use than there are today , or vice visa , people have diverse opinion . if i had my way , i would fully side with the notion that car , or other tool of transcommunication are the detriment of the environment and will be reduced in twenty year . what is beyond a shadow of doubt is that the tempo of the technology ha never been rapid a it is today , due to this , we live in a world , where the technology contributes both benefit and widespread plague . however , if there is a view that car could contributes such a tremendous advantage and convenient that would not be reduced or replaced , which i take leave to suspect , then it is the romantic and naive people who create it , not those who never fail to be with consideretion of reality and modern society , in so far a it is univeral acknowledged that car is the major reason to the air pollution , which is the vitalest problem today and leave all the people in a lanch . so , what we could deduct from general principle is that we thrive on technology , and decend on technology . to explain my meaning perfectly , let me give you a concrete example . due to the massive air pollution , what we breath is not a clearly a it used to be , and most of them caused from the pipe of the car . and by making the car le accessible and more costly to people , by stignazing them with a anti-cars compain , the authority still trying to reduce the number of car , in order to solve the air pollution . all thing considered , making the car fewer is a trend in twenty year ahead . if it is not , it would be without any consideraions of our next generation , be no regard of our own physical statement , and without any idea of other specie on the earth .
