it is interesting to travel and to know about culture of other country . when i travel , i usually travel with a tour guide . i become more pleased after i go traveling in a group than traveling freely . i strongly believe that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide because , i can get knowledge and i can spend travel money more effectively . to begin , i can get knowledge . one of tour guide ' work is to help people to understand the culture of the other country . also they need to make sure that they show the culture and some tourist give opportunity to traveler to experience the culture . to illustrate , i went to hongkong last week and it wa very nice . the tourist showed u the culture of hongkong and not only that , we could also eat food of hongkong and went to place where hongkong people usually go in daily life . he also talked about the history of hongkong that we could understand the culture easily and i became to have interest . therefore , with tour guide , traveler can know about the country more deeply . moreover , i can use the money that is spent on traveling more effectively . some people travel to get out of daily work and to get rid of their stress . they think they need to relax during travel but they need money to travel so i think it is not cost effective . for instance , when i went to cambodia , i did n't go there with a tour guide so i did n't know where to go . so i just spent my time having rest in my hotel room which wa wasting my time and money . even though i could have a rest at home , i chose to spend money and had a rest in other county which wa not a good choice to make . thus , i can save money . to wrap up , i think the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide . first of all , i can get knowledge and learn deeply about other country . also , i can use money that is spent more effectively .
