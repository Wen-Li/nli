today , we go to vacation to various place such a italy , france , or switzerland . when going on a vacation , some people prefer being in a group of tourist led by a tour guide . however , in my opinion , i believe that the best way of traveling is traveling individually without a tour guide for these two reason . first of all , traveling with a tour guide is too limited in time . for instance , even if you want see something leisurally , you would be cut off on time and have to assemble to a certain place the tour guide want you to . you would n't be able to spend lot of time a you want buying postcard in shopping area or have time watching street performance . i believe a trip will be more enjoyable when spending time leisurally with your family or friend , so i think getting limited on time is n't a good choice to make . also , following the tour guide in your trip will make you feel uncomfortable and also may cause some bad interaction with the tour guide . for example , if you are tired or want to see some other part of the country such a beautiful scenaries , or place where a famous movie wa taken , you wo n't be allowed to go there because you have to move a a group through out your trip . once when i wa on a trip to austria , there wa a suggestion of visiting the house in the movie , `` sound of music '' by the majority of tourist , but it wa not taken by the tour guide . so that day ended up in having misunderstanding and negative feeling toward the guide . in conclusion , i think the best way of traveling is traveling without a tour guide , but rather traveling by your own will . following the guide all day , week , or month will be too limited in time and make you feel uncomfortale . therefore , i believe that traveling individually will be more fun and will allow you to have more chance of looking around place and being free .
