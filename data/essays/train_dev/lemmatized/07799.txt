i claim that most advertisement push much higher level than they really are . in these day , you can see ad everywhere around ; on a highway , on a street , in your living room , e.g. tv , radio , computer . we are surronded by so many ad , but how many of them did you really see or read or examine carefully ? now you see many people are working professionally just for ad industry . advertisements usually have much le information than the product really ha . it used to be the case where there are ton of text on the poster or newspaper ad . however , some newspaper said out that people usually do n't bother to read much text on ad because we are lazy and busy on everyday 's life . nowadays you can find dod . com adress for further ditailed information for those who really interested . unfortunately , that can mean advertisement doe n't have to provide enough information on them . they can say only good thing about the prodoct . it is obvious that there are many professional firm just for advertisement . they are really professional and they have been in business many year , so they know many technique like how to attract people , how to entertain people by sound and cool cutting-edge computer graphic hollywood made visuals and so forth . who would like to make the product worse ? it is no doubt that they are working to try to make product look better in order to convince potencial custemer to buy those product . in fact , that may cause some trouble where they could provide untrue information . as i wrote above , most advertisement are made by true professional creaters and looking , sounding , entertaining really good . the thing is people have to be really careful about the information provided about many ad in these day .
