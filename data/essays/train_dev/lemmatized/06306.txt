cars will be around even in twenty year . well , the look of car might change and the size also . they might be even more environemental friendly compared to today 's model . but at the end , there will be even more car around than today . but why ? well , there will be still people around who buy them because they are very convenient . they allow you to move from one part of the town or state to another part . you could stop by at a friend 's place whenever you want . besides convenience they offer independence and in consequence freedom to each and everybody . and freedom is a very high value for each and everybody of u . cars are also a product a lot of people strive for . are n't a lot of kid playing with toy that are car ? a lot of kid dream about car and are all exited about them . but these argument that play out in favor of the individual are just one side of the coin . the other side offer economic reason . and that is why , on a world wide scale , there will be even more car than today . with big developing economy like china and india there are more than two billion people that strive for a better , a more independent and more westernized lifestyle . those demand have to be met either by building car in the country or importing them from the outside . besides , the car industry ha always been an important industry in any industrial evolution in the past hundred year or so . think of ford in the us , daimler benz , now daimler chrysler , in germany or toyota in japan . these company invented back then new technology , like the moving belt in ford 's case , and even today . think of the hybrid technology toyota is using in some car .
