this is controversial issue to decide whether it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subject than to just specialize in one specific subject . depending on personal experience and emotinal concern , we may find that some people will agree the statement , on the other hand , some people will choose the opposite decision . the choice , nevertheless , is hard to make . however , from my point of view , it is wise to agree the statement . my auguments are listed a following . the essectial reason can by seen by everyone is that having broad knowledge of many academic subject is the requirement of our morden scoial and the work you have . when i entered into the social and starting my first task , i know that knowledge of one specific subject is not enough . for example , when you examining project finance in bank , you should know many thing relating to accounting , project analyzing , risk management . during the process of examing those project , it will be difficult for person majoring in financing to analyzing the prospect of project such a steal , mobile and telecommunication . so , broad knowledge of many academic subject may help you solve those problem . another reason of my view is that the trendency of the development of science . for example , accounting belongs to the economic science and information theory belongs to the communication science . however , the blend of the theory of accounting and informaiton in the last centry produced a new catelog named the theory of accounting information . so , broad knowledge of many academic subject may spur the development of science . though i agree that there may be a piece of advantage of specializing in one specific subject , the disadvantage are abvious such a lagging the development of morden social and science . to sum up , given these reason that are discussed above , i strongly commit to the notion that it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subject than to specialize in one specific subject .
