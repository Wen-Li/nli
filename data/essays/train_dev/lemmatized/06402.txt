evry one of u dream of enjoying his life during all his living period untill his last day . but i personaly think that young people enjoy life more tha old people . fisrt young people have le responsiblities toward the familiy , so they have much more liberty to do what they want and to go wherever they perefer . they could enjoy their life by traveling or taking risk in some adventure , doing dangerous thing or crazy thing , while old people have their family and their responsibility to take into account . young people also could go to some entertainment place with their mate such u pub and diskotecs where there is so much noise that the old people could n't bear . there is also some nice place that are open exclusively for young people , old people are note permited to enter them . an other point to be mentioned it is the health issue , young people are generaly healthiest that old people , and this make them able to enjoy many thing in life for example , lasting at night , playing some amazing sport like car speed or jumping in mountain . they could also afford working hard and having an extra job to gain more money that help them to entertain them self . they could also travel to any place without reservation because they are in good health so they could bear long trip , they do n't fear that the whether would be hot or cold , they could bear it anyway because they are still young and they have strong health . so i think young people enjoy life more than old people .
