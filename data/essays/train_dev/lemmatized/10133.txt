surely i admit that young people apt to have more power to enjoy their life and left more time . however i insist that olded poeple enjoy life more than young poeple . there are two reason for this . they have more experience and money . first , older people have learned how to enjoy life from their longer period of life . they , of corse , have experience of love with girl/boyfireinds , which sometimes include faiure to success . older people should know how to belong with their partner . for example , my farther who have many girlfriend before marriage , now , ha very good time with my mother because he can lead the partnership effectively and can solve probelms easily . sometimes they go to travel togethet . they look so enjoyful for their life second , since many older people have earned the salary in company or their own shop , they tend to have far more money than young peole have , who have not worked yet or have just had a job . avarage revenue of business people after working 30-40 yea in japan no le than 500 dollar . while almost 0 or someone have debt among young people in particula for student . it make older moreover after retiring their firm oleder pople have pention . people spend money a they like . actually many older retired like topeople consume toy for their grandson with their pleasure . as these reason it is apparently true that older people enjoy life far more than young peole . their long-term knowleade and the outcome of their effort in in the wrok place bring them to happy `` second life '' with their partner and cute garandsons .
