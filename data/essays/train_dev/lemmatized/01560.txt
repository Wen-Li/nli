i agree with the statement for the following three reason : first : being young implies still long time to live . young people are always full of expectation and hope because they know there is a lot to live for them , so they can make plan for the future and hope these plan will come true . older people have shorter expectation of life and for this reason they are not a hopefully a young people . second : young people have always more energy and a better healt . when people are young they can do a lot of thing , for example playing sport , going to see new place , living far from home , going on long holiday , staying up all the night . they can do all of that because they never get tired and their healt help them to recovery fast . when someone is old , for example , ca n't play sport because of his bad health and would be risky for him to go on holiday in certain place such a desert or high mountain . the fear of dying caused by their bad healt and their age make them act with more care and enjoy le the life . third : young people ha n't seen many thing yet . this give them the joy to live and to make new experience . if they are very young they still have to fall in love and make a family . this two task make a young person more happy and full of hope . the idea of a family is very strong for young people and make them appreciate the life . an old person have already exerienced these thing and ca n't enjoy life a a younger person would . furthermore it is not the same if they fall in love again , a it wa the first time they did . for the previous three reason i think that young people enjoy life more than older people do .
