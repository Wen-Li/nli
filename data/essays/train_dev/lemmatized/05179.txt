i disagree with this question . i think older people could enjoy life more than young people . old people can feel various thing deeply beause of their experience . the thing they do not feel interesting in youg age will change enjoyable . older people know thing more than young people . that knowledge make their width of joy expand . for example , i think watching picture is typical . the young people who can be interesting in watching picture would be le than old people . watching the audience in musium proof it . young people are difficult to find out the atomospher , sence , deepth from just watching picture because of their shortness of life . but old people will be able to feel life of writer just watching picture with hinking of own life . this kind of enjoy is calm but very deeply , and this can not do young people . and old people , in main case , have grandson or granddaughter . i do not have child . but when i wa in childhood , i often played with my grandfather . he loved me so much a if there are no other treasure for him . visiting his house , he always wellcomed to me with very nice smile . thinking of this , having grandson and meeting , playing with them is not only fun but also joy of life . this enjoy is only feel old man . young people never feel this . young people actually enjoy life . playing sport , drinking with friend , etc . but i think the real enjoy for life would be for old people .
