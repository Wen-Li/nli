in this topic , some student prefer learn the fact , others believe understand idea and concept is better . nevertheless , i believe understand idea is better than learn the fact . first of all , student will usually choose to learn fact when they started the course . because the fact is easily to understand and it is ineresting . but there are some disadvanage about learn fact . it hardly to catch the main idea , student may only interesting on the story , but did n't know the meanning . it ca n't happen when you take focus on the idea or the concept . because the concept and idea are the standard about whole story . in addition , student choose learning the idea will help them faster to understand the content about this course . although the fact can let them know how to use it on the society , it still limitied . however we ca n't refuse it can lead student get some experience . it still not general for the student . finally , the fact may give student some misunderstanding about the course . the fact concluding different type of knowledge . they are all useful . but the knowledge which are concetin about the course may lead student to the wrong way . they may try to take more focus on other course . it is better to teach them the idea and the concept , couse the idea and concept can keep leading student on the correct way about the course . although i believe understand idea is better than learn the fact , it still helpful to learn the fact . the fact can give student some experience to let them do n't take the same mistake like the previous people . but the idea and concept are the key of the studying . it is the rule about the course .
