the statement about most advertisments make product seem much better than they really are . i agree about this point , i agree because this is from my experience in my life , when i saw some new product advertisement from the televioson , it always attract me , and i felt a urage from myself , i want to own that product . i want to bacome the same a they show it on the televison , but when i saw them from the shop or when i purcheased them , i found not very effective or same a they advertise . for example . the shampoo , we always see the model show their hair in the advertisement , it look like a fall . beautiful , shinning , but when you buy and use it , no doubt , toally different hair from the advertisemenrt , i think the same or similar example are not difficult to find in your life . so most advertisement make product seem much better than they really are . so some people will say , it is fake , it destory the right of customer , but this is a stratege of business . when they use some computer technique to change amd make much better than original product , it will encourage their product an oppertunity , people see their new product 's advertisement and it appeal people , then thay will go to the shop , that is an oppertunity to let the people `` feel '' their product and that can see what it is look like , they can touch that product and thay will considear about thay willing to buy it or not . advertisement is not a directly way to show the quanty of that product is good or not . it just want make interested of people and appeal tham , and let them know that product , and give an oppertunity to touch and get close to their product . this is an stratege of busniess .
