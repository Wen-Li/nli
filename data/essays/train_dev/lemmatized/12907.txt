when asked the question what the key of success is , different people may hold different perspective a per their own experience and behavior . some people believe in doing same thing repeatedly to excel because they believe that this way they will be successful ; but , i agree with the statement that successful people try new thing and take risk . the reason , i think this way is because we learn a lot while doing something new and it open the door of success . therefore , by trying new thing and taking risk , we learn something new which lead u to succeed evantually . one reason , i believe that trying new thing lead u to succeed is that new attempt always explore the new area of growth for u . when we try something new we learn about that field which help u to grow . take my wife example . she wa working in a pharmacy a a pharmacist and she wa very fond of female make up . at mi of her life she tried with an attempt to work a a beutician . surprisingly she got tremendous success and now she is running her own beauty salloon . successful people never stick to one profession . other reason , i believe that taking risk and trying new thing bring success is because it bring creativity in person which lead to success in life . when we try new thing in life then our brain work more faster and we feel more challanging . anil ambani is the biggest example . he had a creative mind who always try to do something new ank taking risk . he kept on trying new business in india and doing excellent work . his this habit ha made him most successful business man in india . in short , nevetheless taking risk ha some disadvantage of loosing money some time but this would not prevent me in taking risk in my life .
