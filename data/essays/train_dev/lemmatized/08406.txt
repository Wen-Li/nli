in my opinion in th coming year there will fewr car left in th country side a it is today . there are many reason , it is realy unsafe to walk on the road . the polution level is increasing , it diffcult to live in metropoliton city . firstly , a the popullation of the countris is increasing so ther is much le space is required to built up the road , which cause the people to send lot of time on the stop for green signal . as the time important key for each and every one people use to travel shortest distance on bicycle . secondly , the fossil feuls are depleating , which is only the fuel for the car . in the coming year when it will be finished that bring hault of the car . as the car are generating to much noise and air pollution , the will harder there rule in the future which will decrease the number of vehicle in the future . in my opinion awareness must be brought in the people mind to make le use of car a tey are threat to the society . thirdly , the public transport is much convinent and cheap for the people to travel . the metro are the best example to trvel within the city . in the coming year , the government will prefer to spend on research which give benifit to the whole society not to the specific class of people . in conclusion , i want to say that it might be possible that the public tranport take the place of car . it may be possible that in the coming future be may trvel the longr distancs through the aeroplane . as the chance of accident are increacing the people may prefer public transport than the private car . or scienties found air a the safer way to travel people may have another mean of transportation .
