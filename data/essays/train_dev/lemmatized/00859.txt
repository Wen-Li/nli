i thik thisstatement is wrong . it is right that there are more thing youg people can do are in the society . and the old people body can not do hard sport or excersises . but for both youg and old people , if they thought that the life is borng , the life will not be fun even you are youg or old . it doe ot matter . for youg people , there are thing that only young people can enjoy . and for old people , there will be thing that only old people can enjoy . the thing you want to do will change gradually you get older . i think olny youg people think that yong people enjoy life more than older people do . because they have not experieced the life of old peole . young people say this statemet only from the vidual part . they shoud talk with their grandparent . when i talk to my grandmothe , she is not boredwith her life . she say oposit thing , she is having fun with the slow life and using her money that she got from workink hard when she wa young for having fun . i am seeig my grandmother having a happy life time now and hearing this talk from my grandmother so i do not think that the old people are having aboring life and they are thinking to become tyong once again . and i do not care for being old . i want to enjjoy the life with slow time talking with my grandson or granddoughters . from these reason , i think this statement young people enjoy life more than old people do . i think everyone will think the life in old age is fun and enjoy it when thay become old and forget that they were thinking this statement .
