i am agree with the point that the it important for student to understand idea and concept than to learn the fact the main resion behind of is that if a student want to be last long good student then in that case he/she will ha to learn the basic thing behind , which will still with his for whole life and when ever in the life he will be needing it will be just recalled by him . only those people can perform well in the platform of the life who wa a good student in the past . what i think is that only knowing the fact is creating the shortcut to learn the thing , ya it help sometimes but not always that why it is very much nessary to learn the thing by the understanding the idea and the conceots . in future what will happen that if a student wa not a good student in the early stage then in that case he would be also not a good teacher , i.e. he can not explain or transfer the fact to the others . and to support my openion i am taking my own example - when i wa a student in the college ( engineering college ) then in that case my favourite topic wa the explosive and rock type ( mining engineering topic ) . so , i took that topic with very much interest and the result is now i am getting today when i joined a company then it wa a co-incident that i wa putted in the drilling & blasting department and on the 14th day i had managed by owm a blast in that perticular mine . and very soon i got the authorisation of the blasting in that mine in the 6th month , which is record for that mine , which only my personal openion . so , here all credit will automatically go to those class where i wa provided the idea and the concept of the thing . so , i am thankful to my proffesor who tought me so well , and i would like to pray with the god to provide the professor of that kind to other student also . so , student should pay attention in the class .
