people often think that young people tend to enjoy life more than older people do . i personaly disagree with this statement . i strongly believe , a i myself get older , older people enjoy life more than younger people because of the difference in experience time the one ha spent . first , old people tend to live selective life from their experience . although this seems not very exciting , a younger people always look so , the scale of `` enjoying life '' is way higher . for example , i often go to hot spring with my wife for vacation . i never thought of going to just take a bath taking hour of time in a car to reach the location when i wa in teenage . but after all the experience that i visited several hot spring , i know the wellness of it . now i know it is very relaxing and comfortable to just be there , i never offend using my time for transportation to that location . as i saw the hot spring for the first time , it wa very exciting but never felt that it wa enjoyable . since i have more experience , with hot spring , i choose to go there rather than the situation i happened to be there . i feel that i am selecting choice of event based on the experience how well you can enjoy . for the younger people , a i recall my younger age , they often look joyful only by the excitement from the first or rare experience of event . i wa enjoying very much playing with my tv game , 24 hour a day , 7 day a week , straight . i wa excited to become better at the game and talk about it in school , at that time . after all that excitement and experience , i never play tv game . now i choose not to do whatever will not my life better in term of living life . i learned from the full-time game player experience . now i am confident in spending my time for good of myself . in conclusion , a i pointed out above , i totally believe that old people enjoy life more than younger people do . i definitely think that i am selecting what is good for my life and i am enjoying my life a lot better than my younger age .
