according with the previous statement , young current people do not have a active role in the society , and i think that is true , but is not a big problem . in my country is very common that young people do not have any interest in the national economy , politic or culture that surround themself . they do not want to spend time helping other citizen in their community . they have the time , is true , but not for helping . their `` real '' interest are friend , video game and entertaiment . in my opinion , society ha the responsability to catch the attention of this young people througt to differents way that it ha . here in spain , goverment prepare special event for young people : culture event focus in young people , goverments worker are helping in the school in order to have more implicated young people , etc . we have to create some essencial value in the young people in order to they understand the enviroment in which they are living . but i sure that is not a great problem for the society , because people start the interest in the community when they need it . i would liek to explain it with an example : if we take a young boy of a development country , we have to ask u : which think need this boy from the community ? nothing . he ha a home , lovely parent , cable television , friend , video game , internet , etc . .. they do n't need anything from the community , so he is not going to colaborate with it . this situation change totally when young people start uppergrade study or start in his first job . they start the contact with the society . is in this moment , when young people understand that they are living with a lot of people and we have to talk , work , study , etc , with them in order to develop themself in their life and in the society . when young people reach this level , they want to start the colaboration with their community .
