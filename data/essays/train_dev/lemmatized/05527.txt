i agree with the statement that people should try new thing rather than holding blindly the older one . so , by this we will improve our knowledge , we will be differ in the society and we can guide others . otherwise life will be boring , pale and we will be machine doing the same stuff again and again . if people do not try new thing how the world would know that new thing could happen , for thesafer and happy life for the people . if einsein would n't have think differently how the world/people know about gravitational force or if mahatma gandhi did n't think diferently then how could india would got it independence and if michael jakson who came with pop music would not be known to all of u today . person thinking in a differnt way will make him feel he is special in this world . whenever he speaks or walk or he doe any thing he will feel like heaven and willl be confident . and where ever he go he will be the important member over there , he will get respect and he will be in the memory of billion or we can call trillion of people mind eventhough he is not there in this world . if a successful person doing the new thing then there will be another type of environment because all will help him , guide him and make his work easy with their thought and idea and he can take the help of the people with his popularity . and those people are placed in different position because thay can do any thing with in a fraction of time . or if his gioing with the same daily stuff then i think if he isa popular figure also then is no difference between a comman man and in himself . and the life will be adventure and every moment a new feeling and we will be alert every minute to achieve our goal and prove it that we can do anything with the true heart .
