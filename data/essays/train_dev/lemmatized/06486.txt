nowadays , people are trying to succeed in life in various way . they do this by learning new thing , adquiring advanced technology , reading , updating themselves with whats going on in the world , and coming up with strategically idea in which they can use these not only in the business , but personally . i agree with this statement because if people did n't take any risk we would still be far behind technology , knowledge , etc . the problem is , many people do n't like to take risk because they do n't want to lose time in trying out new thing , they usually stick to what they 're good at , at that point . another problem is that many of u are afraid to fail and just do n't want to regret the time we spent , money , our sacrifice . most people just sit around and live up to other people expectation . in the other hand , i understand the fear people have in taking risk because at the end , it all come down to one question : is it going to be worth it ? well , you may not have an answer right away but a i said , if we do n't take risk at any chance , we will just be sitting around , waiting , and doing the same thing over and over again . going back through history , if mechanical people , engineer , architect , would n't have taken risk in manufacturing some kind of transportation for the world , we would probably still be walikng through one place to another . the great discovery that have occured took place because of the people who took a risk back then and we are what we are because of those people . for example , microscope , telefone , medicine , transportation , internet . in conclusion , we should all take risk at some point of our life . we could make dramatic change in life by helping ourselves , others and the world by contributing and passing on our knowledge and courage .
