before going to the topic it is necessary to define the term idea , concept and fact . ideas on the first hand are the basis for innovation . without idea there will not be any advancement in the curren technology frontier . a good idea may change the way of our life . on the other hand concept is what we develop from the idea . simply speaking concept is the paper work for an idea . this theoritcal statement will gude the application of the idea . coming to the factswhick unlike idea and concept will mostly reveal what actually happens in a phenomina . i do agree with the question for several reason . one reason is without a proper base or idea how come a student learn a subject or what will be there to reveal . so it is required for a student to learn both the idea and concept . for example let u suppose there is a mistireous entity or a phenomina that is unknown like the `` dark matter '' in the outer space . as no information is available about it or even it existence is doubted then it is necessary to assume several property even without knowing proper fact . this is possible by devoloping a solid concept over the entity that will eventually give rise to idea about the entity and it behaviour . for instance let u assume that there is no information available about the dark matter . then what fact can be revealed about it without any phenomina stating it existence . only the concept change when the original fact are revealed . so it is highly necessary to learn idea and concept before knowing their fact . and the concept which arise from idea help in moulding our future . `` ideas are what we are living and idea are what we are made of ... and idea are bullet proof '' .
