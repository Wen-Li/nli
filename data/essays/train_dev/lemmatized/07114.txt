as i 'm italian , i can maintain that this statement is probabilly wrong : actually , my personal experience show that the trend is the opposite . when i wa a child , there were only one car per family and you could have seen the same situation when my parent were young . if you have lived in the early-fourties of the last century , probabilly you could n't afford a car : only rich people had one . now , let 's take a look at today situation , car are everywhere ! i do n't want to condemn this trend - i own a car too - but that 's a matter of fact and , i think , in the future it will be one of the main issue in every politician 's agenda . you can find many reason to explain why everyone want a car , nevertheless i 'm virtually sure that it is due to the difficult to travel around with train , bus and taxi - and the latter are very expensive here in italy . if you have a date , surely you do n't wish to be late , but if you take a train , you could never know when you arrive nor if you arrive in the right place . i think it 's time to introduce an example . today there is my toefl test , nonetheless public driver have made up their mind to strike . unless i would come here by foot , i wa obliged to drive my car . you have to consider that such a situation happens about twice a month for bus , twice a month for train , twice a month for plane ; surely it 's not surprising the fact that people prefer to go to work with thair own car . even if your family is small , a my family is , you need at least two car , because your father ha to go to work in time and you do n't want to be late for your university course . to summarize , i do n't think that car will be fewer in the next year and surely we will have to cope with pollution . if politician want to stop this trend , they are requested to improve public transport , a buse , for example . but i-m sure that this will not happen in a few year .
