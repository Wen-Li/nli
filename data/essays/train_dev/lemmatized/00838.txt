since world war 2 wa ended , young generation ha enjoyed their life more than olders . they , would-be baby-boom generation , were good at various entertainment , and were exposed splendid medium such a holly wood movie or broadway musical show . there are a few reason why young people are better at having a great time than older people . first , young people know well how to play whenever they want eagerly . they know well where is the best bar , what trend is going on , or who is the most famous actor in these day . of course older people have no time to have a fun in order to get enough money for their family like a daughter who is intersted in an expensive jewelry brand . however young people do n't need too much money because they have no one to be preserved . they just maintain thier living cost that contains money to go the best club in soho . second , young people are healthier than older people because they have young and strong body that older people do n't have . old people have to pay for their medical care , medicine in order to maintain the body . in contrast , young people are not needed to get any medical payment at all . finally , young people tend to be curious toward all of the strange thing what they have never seen before . when older people avoid a stranger from another country , young people try to be closer with positive activity . for example , in a small town , a tourist visit for his/her academical research such a modern agriculture from a strange country , young people or child will try to talk to him/her . these reason are why i think that young people are more enjoyable than older people .
