some people may think that successful people always try new thing and take risk . others may think that those people will only focus on what they already know how to do well . i believe that successful people will only do what they are already skilled . it is because they know the reason why they are successful is because no one can replace their speciality . moreover , doing what they are skilled can prevent them from being lose . that a person ha a job that no one can replace his or her position is a very important factor for a successful person . my father always told me that i have to find my interesting , and become very skilled in that field . i totally believe those word because a successful person know his interesting and keep studying it until he know a lot about his interesting . take my professor for example , she is very good at translation . thus , when some of the faculty member want to translate their book into english , they all ask my professor for help . they wo n't think about others . my professor can earn a lot money by doing translation . therefore , successful people will only do what they already know how to do because they know no one can replace them . moreover , a successful person is successful because he do anything to prevent him from being fail . can a successful person still success when he is failed ? i do n't think so . for example , there wa a once well-known company in my country . they were famous because they could produce nicely-look comuters . every body liked to use their computer . however , their bos decided to take a risk to make some lcd monitor five year ago . the money they spent on making new lcd monitor is the money they not used on improving their computer quality . as a result , they were failed on both computer and lcd monitor . did the company success ? thus , successful people will do what they are already skilled . they know no one can replace them and they wo n't take risk to prevent them from being loss .
