as science and technology develops , society burden people with a huge amount of knowledge . an important question arises for each individual , when he try to build an amount of knowledge for himself : is it better for him to concentrate on a subject and ha a unified knowledge on that subject , or is it better for him to have a broad knowledge of many academic subject . i think , it is better to choose a subject and concentrate on it detail . first , during my undergraduate year , i tried take class from a broad subject a i can . i took economy , physic , classical ballet , history of science and german litretare course a my elective course . in this way , i have gained knowledge on each of these subject . but i could study each of them for at most two successive semester . that 's why i could gain only a little information on each of them . now i still have curiosity to further improve my knowledge on many of these topic , but i could not have time and energy to accomplish such a great task . second , the number of academic subject increase in an incredible speed . what is called broad today , will not even be enough tomorrow . and the amount of knowledge that ha to be gained on a topic in order to have an idea of it will also increase a time pass . so , it is also very diffucult to develop a good and broad knowledge of various academic topic . last , but not the least is that , a person is required to find a job to survive . so , he ha to have adequate knowledge in one specific subject in order to be able to work on this subject . and it will be better for him to concentrate on the topic he work on . all in all , to have a broad knowledge of many subject seems attractive . however , it may be an impossible goal to achieve .
