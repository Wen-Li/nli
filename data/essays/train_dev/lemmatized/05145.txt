i agree with the idea the `` young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their community . '' for example , my mother often talk me about when she wa young . she talk about the relationship between the community she lived and her . according to her story , the community provided a lot of festival for loxcal childrens and elder people . for example , cherry blllosome festival in spring , fire work in summer . they held a moon festival in fall and the new years day in finter thr shrine in the community made rice cake with the local people . every case of those the event in the community , the young local people went to help to prepare and the clean up after ward . those experience help the young people to knoe the local people and to build up good relationship between another people . so , many young people want to help the holding event again and help it , the circulation holding the opprtunities and the good reletionship of the community will be made up . this is a story when my mother wa young . then , how about today ? think about when iwas little kid , i did not have such opportunity to join the local event so many time . because the plase i live is kind of old and there are not so many young people to help those event . also , actually i do not have so many familier people in my community , the relationship of our community is not so good if we compared to the one of many year ago . also , when i wa junior high scool student , i joind such many kind of volunteer work , but i did not have so many opportunites to help my own community . as long a i emember , every time i do volunteer work , i went another community which offered to help them . i mean , nowadays , there are le opprtunities for young people to searve for community . also the other reason i think recent young people do not help the comunity is that there no goiod relationship among the community .
