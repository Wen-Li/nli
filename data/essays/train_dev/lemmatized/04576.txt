i agree partially with the statement that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide . i think that joining a group led by a tour guide is the best way to visit a place for the first time . i also belive that visiting the same place on my own for the second time is a good way to discover more information . i usually prefer to take part in a tour guided group when i visit a place for the first time . it give me the opportunity to meet new people from different culture and learn more detailed information abuot the history and the secret of the place . however , i also like to visit place on my own after i wa there with a group led by a tour guide . two year ago i went to rome and i decided to join a group of people that had a tour guide , it wa amazing and the guide wa really knowledgeable . he gave u a lot of artistic and historical information about the famous roman ruin but at the end of the tour the guide said that because of the short time available , we could n't visit all the important attraction . i wa really curious to see what we missed so i decided to go back in such a marvellous city full of imponent structure of the past . last year , i returned in rome and i really enjoyed my time discovering all of the particular thing that were not mentioned in the previous tour . i also experienced the famous italian food in such nice restaurant that are spread out all around the historical area . i could feel the real essence of a city where the ancient ruin are mixed with thing of everyday life . that wa defenetly the best experience of my life and i could n't have the possibility to enjoy it , neither going there on my own for the first time , nor just going there with a group led by a tour guide .
