i agree with this statement that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their community . they are usually busy with thier own problem and eshos or with their studying so they do not have much time and there are others who are not interested in helping their community becouse they think that it is not their job , it is the others job . but not all young people think or act this way , there are afew young people who help their community in several way . in my openion i think that perants should incurge their child to do such thing .
