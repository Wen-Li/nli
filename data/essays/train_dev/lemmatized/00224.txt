although many people think older people can not enjoy life a much a younger , i think they can . often one think that old people are bored . almost everyone can talk about grandma looking out of the window the whole day watching unknown people passing the street . of course not all grandmas do that . but what about the younger one ? is it not true that a lot of them sit in front of a tv half a day and watch unknown person discussing in a talk show . would not many consider watching tv to be amusement ? the grandma at the window might a well have fun and probably she think the younger one are bored because they need to watch tv . maybe for her the man that pass by all day at 10:30 and is always in a rush mean a big fascination . .. still it leaf the point that not many old person are observerd in disco , rock concert or in the movie . but the other way round not many young people are seen in theater , hiking in the nature or in the cinema when the old western movie from 1950 is shown . maybe drinking a tea in a silent undisturbed atmosphere is great enjoyment for the older , while younger prefer to drink a coke with loud rock music in the background . there are of course many more example , but those are rather dependant on the lifestyle and personal like and dislike people develope while getting older , than to the total amount of enjoyment they offer to differently aged group . in my view it is a bit too general to discus just old and young , it just doe not take into account the many variety life ha to offer . each person is individually different and general view might fit for many but not for every single human being . nevertheless a discussed above i think that there are different way of enjoying life and those are quite different , if compared to people at different age . but ultimately the level of enjoyment people get from life doe not depend on the age and is therefore equal for the old and young .
