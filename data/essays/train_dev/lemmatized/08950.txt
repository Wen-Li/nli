well that is a good question , because i never thaught of it before ! in my country young do n't get a chance to see eachother after class ! for most of u always go to cram school till 9 or 10 p.m. after we will have to go home immidiutly or else the police will think that : hay ! what is a middle school fooling around at that late , is he going to rubb someone . and then he will take you back to the police station . after that your parent will have to pick ypu up ! but , we always log on msn or sky-pe to communicate with each other ! and we might spent 1 or 2 hour doing that a day . by doing that we will spent about 6 hour to communicate . other than that we often og out together on weekend to go biking or fishing and even golfing ! sometimes we go to others house to discus homework together . even if we are not talking about homework we will talk about something like ecosystem ecological and science . that way we can spent some time together . but if any big test is comming we will stop doing that , that is for our good . after the activity we have done all week we proubably spent more time with friend than our own parent . so i think we have given enough time tohelp our community . and even too much ! now i think i can say that we have already spent enough time on that . and also i am not agreed with that . i think i have already expland why i made up my mind to disagrss with that , so i do n't have to do it again right . no matter who said that [ young people nowdays do not give enough time to helping their community } he should take the word back !
