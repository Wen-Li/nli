advertisement play a very vital role in sale of various product . they not only enhance the sale but also bring awareness among public about the product . but i agree that most advertisement make product seem much better than they really are . there are some advantage a well a some disadvantage . it is sometimes good to advertise the product more than they really are . but not all product can be done like that . because if people become aware of it then there might be chance of decline in the sale of the product . advertisement doe good to the product because most of the people rely on the advertisement . if it is attractive then they show interest to buy . because many people who dont have access to these advertisement dont know much about the product and therefore they dont show interest to buy them . but due to heavy competition nowadays they are promoting the product much better than they are . but this is not healthy always . many try to show their product a the best product . once i wa fooled by seeing a mobile phone advertisement online and only after purchasing the product and recieving it i came to know that it wa not at all attrative a it wa shown in the promo . i nver got my money back a they couldnt take it back . from that time onwards i started being careful about thae advertisement . i make sure that i see the product before purchasing it . some of the company that give the advertisement are not reliable . therefore i conclude that some advertisement make product look much better than they are . we must be very careful about the product and it is always better to have a look before purchasinginstead of just relying on the advertisement .
