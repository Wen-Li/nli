everyone ha different opinion on whether traveling in a group that is led by a tour guide or by ownself . it depends on individual people 's various point of view . however in my perspective , traveling in a group give more advantageous to me . because , it is convenient and easy to understand the country . first of all , people can visit all the place with out any difficulty . of course it would be more interesting and advantureous to be travel by ownself , however traveling in a group give more profit to people . in my personal experience , when i tralved alone to australia , i had a trouble with the visiting tourism place , because i lost my self in the middle of the town , so i faced difficulty looking for the place . moreover , i spend about two hour looking for a information center . if i had a tour guide , i would had a wonderful vacation in australia visiting many fun place , instead of wasting time on the road . secondly , people can understand and the country easily . although , peopl traveling without tour guide can also understand the culture and country , however , i believe it is more beneficial to have a tour guide . when my mother and father traveled to the new zealand , they found so many interesting thing from there , because the guide translated all the information that they visited and also , telling story that is relevent to the event or history . therefore my parent could understand the cuture and also some traditional story with out difficulty . thus , people , like my parent who can not speak the language that they are visited , can also learnt about the countrey with out any trouble . in conclusion , for these reason that i have mentioned above , eventhough , traveling arund the country with tourt guide might be more memorable and more fun , i think however leding guide i more advantagous to me . no on can deny the importance of these asset .
