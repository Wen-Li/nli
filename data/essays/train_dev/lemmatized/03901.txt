i do not agree to the point of view that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide . first and foremost i believe that when you travelling in a group with a tour guide you have to make a lot of compromise and are restricted to the site that are covered by the tour guide . these site that are covered by the tour guide may not necessarily be the site that i may be interested in . also you may not be able to spend enough time at a certain site if you desired to do so . secondly the loss of privacy and freedom when you are travelling in a group would kill the enjoyment of the trip . when i travel for pleasure the last thing i want to do is to stick to a schedule set out by the travel group or the tour guide . when you are travelling independently you can set your own agenda and can be completely flexible about it without affecting anybody else . thirdly in this day and age of internet , i do not feel the need to rely on a tour guide for information about any place . i can get all the information about a place that i intend to travel to , on the internet and can then make a decision on what place interest me the most and than plan out my trip accordingly . lastly there is a general perception that group travel work out cheaper financially than if you travelled independently . i do not agree with this idea . with the availability of several internet based travel agent it almost always possible to get great travel deal on travel , hotel etc any time of the year to almost any place in the world . for the above reason i firmly believe that travelling in a group with a tour guide is not the best way to travel to any destination .
