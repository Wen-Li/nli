knowledge is power . without knowledge we can not go higher in education . it is one of the essential part for every person in the world to take part in it . i strongly agree with the statement that student should should understand the idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact . the main important point is that without undersatanding the idea the student can not learn the fact . learning fact is the secondary thing for a student and the primary thing is to understand the idea and the concept . for example : while doing the experiment in the ld we would like to have a concept and the idea , what are the specification what are the input and output of the experiment . the student can do the experiment by having the priority knowledge of that experiment . in my 12th standard i did n't attend the class of which the lab had been done the next day . i directly went into it to do but i am unable to do that expriment . this example is about the student should understand the idea of the auther and then proceed . while going to do the fact directly the student should have to keep the face ideal . every fact in the envinorment will be related to their concept and the idea . for example a student who is a 7th standard ask me about the planet when iam saing he repetedly asking about every word this is because of lack of idea and dont have concept about the science . it is one of the most important to have good idea and the concept about particular subject , if he is not he would have get many doubt and also dissappoints about that fact . facts come out from the concept and the idea . without concept and idea the people can not think about the fact . thus student mst have a good idea and good concept to over come in the new tecnology .
