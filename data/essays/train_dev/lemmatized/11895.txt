now day , the spanish young people ha another mentality . i know a lot of people with my same age that they have time to helping the community . but also , i know a lot of friend that certenly they do not ha any time to help . why ? because they ha to study a lot and also they ha to work to pay his house . in one hand , the young people have a lot of fun and everybody know that we can reduce that time . and that time we can dedicate to helping their community . and in the other hand , a lot of people directly they do not think about this topic . i think that side is made a very bad person . for example , always when one of those , expreses his idea the people of other country tend to archieve all in the same box . so , i think that it is a very polemic statement . i think this is not goging to change with a statement . we have to remote to the roof of the people , and there change the mentality . also , the primary education need to change in this type of child formation . if you teach a kid that there exist more important thing in the life than the money , the study , or the work . i think that the next generation they will grow in this aspect . and the people will be more happy with thw others .
