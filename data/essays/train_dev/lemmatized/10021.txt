i agree that it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subject than to specialize in one specific subject . having more knowledge could broaden one horizon ; serve a a parth to discover one true passion ; gain help with talking to other people and be capable of understanding the world around u . firstly , having more knowing of many academic subject area could broden our horizon because we know different subject in different field . each specific subject ha it own uniquness , therefore it would be better to know a bit about each area . secondly , understanding more knowledge could serve a a path for people to discover their ` real ' passion . sometimes if we are always ` inside the box ' , it would be hard for u to find other hobby and have the oppurtunity to think whether it wa truly their passion or not . when i wa in grade 11 , i studied course in different area , such a chemistry , accounting , physical education , business , history etc . i wans't sure of what i wanted to study in university , and i do n't want to limit my area of study , therefore i decided to broaden my knowledg by taking many acdemic subject . however my friend , whom desperately wanted to become a doctor , took all science course , because she had discovered her passion . as a result , i think it would be better to have a broad knowledge of many subject before specializing one , unless you have found something that you really love doing . moreover , by understanding more subject , it would be easier for people to engage in conversation with new people . everyone have different background , therefore if you have knowledge from different area , it could be easier to socialize with people whom have different field than you do . a way of knowing more subject is to read every section of the newspaper such a businss , world , entertainment etc . this could help one to know more knowledge and therefore be more talkative when meeting new people . since the world change everyday , everyday something new will happen . if we do n't have the basic background towards a certain subject , we will not be able to understand it . moreover , a lot of subject are inter-related , therefore you will need knowledge from other area in order to fully understand the material . for example , business tie with politics , political change could affect the business environment , therefore it is essential for u to have a simple background of politics in order to understand business change around the world . in conclusion , with all the reason stated above , i believe that it is better to have broad knowledge of many acadmic subject than to specialize in one specific subject .
