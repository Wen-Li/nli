some student prefer strictly learning fact , date or rule , whereas others like better understanding the main concept and do n't pay a much attention to the specific . this may derive from their way of studying , their ability to memorize and understand , and also from the way their knowledge will be controlled . knowing fact doe not require much thought , a it is simply a matter of memory . one could go , eventually , through an entire schooling using only fact : they are often the sole requirement because they make it appear a real and extensive knowledge . the people who recommend the comprehension of idea more than the mere knowledge of fact for student expect that such an understanding will provide useful capacity to a person , those of adaptability and effective thought , more important in their idea than simple knowledge . but i think that , in reality , there is n't one way better than the other , a even though they may be different , both technique complete each other . facts provide a background to concept , example and argument , to help them develop and construct new theory . but at the same time , concept explain the fact and provide their utility . for instance , knowing by heart the successive order of all the kings and queens of the united kingdom is n't of much use if one doe n't know how these ruler reigned and influenced history and international relation . on the other hand , being able to tell the consequence of henry viii 's reign requires extensive knowledge of the fact about his life , the era he lived in and so forth . this applies to any field of knowledge , literature , mathematics , biology or latin ! facts are at the source of most concept , which in return link the fact together and give them meaning . one can not go effectively without the other , unless for a very short period of time .
