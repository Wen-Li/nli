nowadays , there are ongoing statesments which people have to learn only one subject specific or learn several subject . somepeople think that people have to learn one subject in detail , because if people go out to social they definitely attend company which is related with they major . however , i firmly believe that people have to learn many academic subject . there are two reasoens which is comunicated with another field people and understand how world go . first , if people learn several field knowledge , we can communicate with another field person . most of people think we do not use another knowledge when we get a jod . however it his a misleading information . for example , if my job is accoutant , i always met several job person such a sometimes i will meet bank job person , sometime i will meet proffessor . if i met another feild of person , i should talk something such a familiar with meeting person . in that case if i just talk about one specific subject , they will definitely boring . if we learn several knowledge , we can know more several field person in our life . another reason is that it is hard to know how our country go . a lot of news talk about several field story such a economy , biology . according to cho-sun daily news which is published in korea . they reseach who can understand the news more correctly . they made two group . one is accuately learn one subject specific , and another group learn many academic subject . in conclusion of this research , 73 percent of the latter group people can understand the new more correctly . in conclsion , a i mentioned above , i agree that broad knoledge of many acdemic subject are more better than learn one specific subject .
