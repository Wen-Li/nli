in the following , i will write an essay about the statement `` successful people try new thing and take risk rather than only doing what they already know how to do well '' . if we have a look at some company , it becomes clear that this statement fit very well . for example : the first mcdonalds wa very successful until today , where mcdonalds is a popular name all over the world . they have been very successful and took risk by opening further restaurant . now this company opened a new store called mccafe , where they sell various type of coffee , cake and ice . they tried new thing and become also successful with their idea . there are also company they must try new thing because of the economic competition in the world . they have to invent new thing to attract the consumer with innovative product . i think this statement fit with my opinion . successful people completed a quiet difficult task and are also proud of being successful . if i were successful that i do n't need to care about money , i would definitely try new thing and take risk . in my opinion , life would be quiet boring if i only did what i know how to do well . on the other hand i will not take much a much risk that i will lose everything and have to start from the beginning .
