i can not agree with this statement for one simple reason : in my opinion , both youth and elderness are enjoyable if you are able to see the advantage of each age . happiness doe not depend on age , but on a cumulus of decision that make each indivudal 's life enjoyable or hateful . pleasures can be found at any age , it is just a question of finding them . many elder enjoy life despite the physical constraint imposed by age while many young people waste their life thinking on how life is horrible eventhough they have all the opportunity to change their personal life and their environment . although it is a common place , we should never forget that a long a the heart is young , the physical age is not a relevant factor . one of the clearest example of how life is nice at any age is travelling : almost everybody love it and can be done by both young and old people . at travelling , young people tend to walk a lot , visit museum , go out in the night and sleep for short period of time in the same day . this rythm is unsustainable for the average elder . however , the elder may find pleasure on more refined activity ( such a eating in expensive restaurant , sleeping in comfortable hotel or luxurious tour through important zone ) that many young people can not afford . this example may suggest that the le enjoyable period of life is what is known a the `` productive life '' , which tends to go from university graduation to retirement . however , the productive life offer many reward too : having child and professional development are probably the two most known example . to summarize , i want to mention that life can be enjoyed regardless of age ; happiness is probably the last decision an individual can take in this age when there is nothing to discover and everything is sold in supermarket .
