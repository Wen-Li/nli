`` young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their community '' . i agree with this ststement . nowadays , young people are restricted to limited number of activity by their parent . in this present world young people are almost operated by their by their parent or in general elder . they are not allowed to think pragmatically . they already have been alloted with a time table or routine in their life like what is to be done at each age in their life and most of them are kept in control without deviation from their track . so most of the young people donot give enough time to helping their community , the task which is not present in their curriculum . society and the environment of the young is also influencing them in a greater way . most of them are not even aware of the present scenario apart from the study and they not know exactly about the problem faced by the community . most of them nowadays are narrow minded . every one feel and in fact are made to feel '' why should i care about others ? what are they to me ? '' . almost everyone is living with the sane mind set . every one ha the same unique vision of their life that is to study well and earn money for themselves and their family . no one want to contribute for the society . in olden day problem were the part of everyones life . so young people who are the future of this world knew their responsibility to be discharged for the community . people at that time used to lead a practical life with broader vision . they always did thing thinking how this effect and help the society . so i feel that young people nowadays are being greatly influenced by their parent and they are not contributing to the society even though they have got a great potential . young people who are the future of this world should be properly guided in their association with the society for a better tomorrow .
