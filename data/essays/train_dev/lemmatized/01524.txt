some people agree best way to trvavle is in a group led by a tour guide and some people disagree like this . i agree this statement . first because we know the way to travel is in a group , i can make some friend with same interst , and we ca n't feel lonly with a group , if i go to travel only me then i must think the travel is so boring . also , in a group lad by a tour guide , we can know , some important information such a we can go to which some famous place in this travel , and we can know some history story in this travel , and we can eat difference food between in our live city . if you do n't in a group you can miss this . finally , we must very happy in this travel we can play with many people . and remebe some intersting thing . so i think the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide !
