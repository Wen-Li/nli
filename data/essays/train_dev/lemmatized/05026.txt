who enjoys life more , young people or older people ? in my opinion , i tend to say that older people enjoy life more . first of all , older people have much more leisure time than young people . as older people have already worked for a long time , they need not work so hard a young people . they need not struggle so hard for survival a young people do . as a result , older people have more leisure than yound people . with more leisure time , older people can travel , can have holiday with their family , and can do other activies . imagine what young people are doing when older people are enjoying their life . students at universites may be busy with writing their assigments , cramming for exam . those who have job may be doing extra work in the office . how miserable they are ! secondly , older people have more money compared with young people , making them lead more comfortable life . as older people have worked longer time than young people , they earn more money and have more saving , which can make them afford long distance travel to paris , to rome , or even to space , depending their financial ability . however , young people can only enjoy the short trip and some hiking . though no one can deny the interest that short trip and hiking can bring , they can not be comparable to those brought by the the romantic travel abroad . thirdly , older people can manage their life better than those young people due to their longer living and social experience . older people know what is most important to them . they know that enjoyment of life , instead of making money or working is more important to them . they know the value of being together with their family member , so they try their best to accompany their wife or husband . on the contrary , according to my knowledge , most young people do not realize what is important to them . they make every possible effort to make money and grasp every chance to get promoted in their working place , neglecting the happiness of being accompanied and accompanying their family member . in conclusion , i think that older people enjoy life more because they have more time , more money , and they can manage their life more efi .
