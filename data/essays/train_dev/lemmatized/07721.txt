knowledge is power . i feel that we are in the period of the knowledge explosion . i strongly feel that is better to have broader knowledge of many academic subject because they enhance our quality of life , increase scope to move around and experiment with different job and we get to meet people . it increase our employment chance , thereby brings in a lot of life , vitality and adventure into life . i would like to give an example . my sister ha studied law , political sceince , literature and ha taken computer course too . ihough it wa tough for her to coup with so many different subject with different nature , now it is paying her a lot . for her major , she had gone to the usa for her major in law . with her knowledge in many subject , she is succesful in life . i mean she is happy with her decision and now enjoying the life doing the job of her choice . another friend of mine wa only interested in mathamatics . he continued studying mathematics and he is doing the job of alecturer in hyderabad . he is not happy with his job a he is always interested in doing research . but his family responsibility and committments prevent him from doing so . he is forced to do his job . he come to u and feel sorry for choosing only subject because it is not helping even to do parttime job and earn . therefore i strongly feel and suggest to people to study a many subject a possible and increase their knowledge .
