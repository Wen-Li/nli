in the past young people helped their family in many activity such a housework , in crop and they were very important for the life and the survive of family . they had not the possibility to go to school because there were not much money to do this type of activity . in this condition they were able to help their community in different work because they had more time to spend to do this thing . nowadays the rythme of life is changed . life style of young is different in compare with the past . they go to school where they do many activity . in the afternoon they do homework and usually they do some sport . these activity are only for future or amusement of them . so they can not help community in a good way . for example , in my family we are three child . my brother work all the day , my sister study and i , for the moment , i am looking for job and so i have a few time to spend for community . in free time i prefer to relaxe . the situation is different from the past because nowadays there are too much thing to do . in my opinion , helping community is important for all people but if there are not possibility to collaborate with member that are in a community , it is right that government help the society and it member to organize different and interesting activity for all people .
