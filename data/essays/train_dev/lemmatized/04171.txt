i disagree with the statement . it seems to me that those who hold this kind of opinion limit the meaning of `` helping their community '' to activity that a traditional local community used to require of their member , helping neighbor , clearing away the road with them , participating in the local festival , for example . however , since change in society and life style made traditional comunities almost disappear , it is now difficult for almost all people , not only for younger generation , to be helpful to others in the traditional way . this might seem a lack of interest in people other than one 's own family and friend , but this is in fact not the case . people still feel the need to help others , and have begun to do so in a way different from that which wa common in the traditional community . for example , instead of talking with their neighbor or relative to solve the problem they have , they use internet to communicate with others who live in a distant area but share the same problem . this help the vexed people more effectively than the traditional neiborhood community did . another example is the growth of community of those who share the same hobby , cooking , photograph , travelling and so on . they also work a the substitution for the traditional local community and provide people with the oppotunity of making friend of different status and different age . perhaps the most important instance of people helping others is the existence of many volunteer in the time of earthquake , flood and other disaster . there is , i think , no need to mention that many young people participate in these new kind of activity of helping others .
