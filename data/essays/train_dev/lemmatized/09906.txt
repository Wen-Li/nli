according to my experience from the college year , i can say that learning fact is necessary to be successful in your undergraduate education since fact are used in every part of the lecture . also learning fact are of great value to understand the life and to make easier it for yourself . because the world and the environment that you live in is full of fact everywhere . for example , you wake up every morning , see the sun and then night come and this go on in this way . so you can not understand the difference between morning and the evening unless you know the fact about the rotation of earth around the sun . hence fact help u to examine the world and have a meaningful life . but i think that fact are not sufficient to understand everything . learning idea and concept is more important for student . because learning a concept mean learning everything and understanding every term about it . in the same way , learning an idea consists of learning every concept , every thought and every fact behind it . so you can learn the fact while you are trying to get the meaning of an idea or a concept . also fact are hard to be memorized . when you get the idea once , you do not forget it and you remember the fact by this way also . furthermore , having studied idea and concept will give u a way of thinking about people and their behavior . for example , when you are thinking on an idea or when you are analyzing an idea you may think about the people who had this idea before . questions such a `` why these people had proposed this idea such year ago ? '' or `` what kind of difference are there between u ? `` may come to mind . thus , these kind of question help you to understand the behaviour of the people and may be useful to find out new thing related to yourself . as a conclusion , learning idea and concept are more valuable to student than learning fact .
