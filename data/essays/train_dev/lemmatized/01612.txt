in my poinnion , i think it is more impotant for student to learn fact than to understand idea and concept . firstly , we live in the real life , if we do thing based on the idea or concept we may lose our mind . because sometimes , thing is going to change at any time , but we do not know when it change , or how it change . for example , there is a ancient story in china , say that there is a master of army who learns very well through the book knowledge , he can even memorize all the concept of the book . once , the enrmy attack his area , then he use the concept from the book to fight with the enrmy , finally he fails . because the enrmy use a trick during the battle while the master only know the solution in the book . this show u we should learn fact instead of only learn the idea and concept . we should be more flexable to deal the problem which appers in our real life . secondly , fact give you more impression . for instance , once you write a wrong solution in the exam , after you know it is wrong , it you will have a serve impression , and you will never do it again , because you have the experience . therefore , learn fact is more impotant for student than only understand idea and concept .
