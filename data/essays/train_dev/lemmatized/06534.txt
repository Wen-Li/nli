successful people who is doing things do you know what is the best way to be successful when you doing thing ? my friend always tell me about doings new thing such a in his house or his work or anything . he like to descover and he want to make thing differently . in my opinion , i think make or do the thing you know it already for make sure you will finish it and gain the time . first , people want to finish the thing what they have . for example , if your bos gave you research , you should finish it , so you would work for paper with information that gave it to you or from work , so you will finish it because it would be easy for you to do it ; however , you would know the routin to do it . secound , people wikk gain the time . for example , like what i said above you know the routin , so you will finish it early or on time , but if you want to make new thing maybe you will not finish it on time , so your bos will be angry . some people think you must do new thing because you have to for make new different kind to be the best and to be evolve . however , it might be true , but maybe you spend a lot of time i mean `` wast the time '' because if you did n't make it you will lost the thing that you work on it . for example , you will do newspaper . if you did n't make it on time ( new form ) , you will be late to show the custmers and you will lose the custmers also . all in all , the people who do the thing what the know it already is better because make people sure to finish it and to gain the time . i hope for people who want to make new thing , they think and think more and more before do it if they will make it or no .
