advertisements are utility of company to sell more piece of their product . and alone this hypothesis make me wanting to say : `` advertisements make produkts seem better than they really are ! '' an example for such advertisement is about car . often you can see car in tv which roll over a lonly street in a beautiful countryside with a hawk on sky . this make you feel free and good but there is nothing said about the car itself - for example if it is chep or how much petrol doe it need for 100 kilometer . also you can often see car driving trough moody street and hard theretory but in normal life i do not have the possibility to drive in that and i would not have it . another in last time often discussed product is the cigarrette . in most advertisement person who smoke cigarrettes are cool ( like at `` malborocountry '' ) and have much friend and social contact . this make you believe if you smook you will have friend . but there is nothing said about the bad thing like tumores and losing power at sport , or only about the fact that many nonsmoker do not like to kiss a smoker . also other kind of advertisement are realy problem for some group of person . if you have a child , for example , and in tv are all of these nice toy and electric car shown but you have not the mony to buy something of that it is very hard to explain this circumstance to a kid . so the advertisement can effect some familyproblems . and i think it is not nescessary to say that this toy are not that good in the eye of your child i played with it for some time . but it is not only the advertisement which make thing semms better than they are . the pacage of produkts is another important detail . an example for this is milk . i think everyone like to bye his milk in a bottle , because you can see it an it look better than in a so called `` tetrapack '' . so it ist not easy to say it is the advertisement alone .
