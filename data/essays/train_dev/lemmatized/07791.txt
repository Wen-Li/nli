young people are often independant and sometimes selfish . moreover , people who help their community are usually quite old . so some people can say that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their community . there is truth but i do n't totally agree and i will explain why . it is true that young people do not give enough time to helping their community . it is a fact that the member of this kind of association are often old . there are no many young people in it . it is a pity because young people have much time and they could use it for that . there are even some young people who have fun when they disturb their community , it is a real problem in some area , for example in the suburb of paris . but i do n't think it is really new a the statement seems to mean . it is a very old thing , solidarity wa never very strong for young people . young people like to enjoy their life , they are independant , they spent all their time for their own life . and i think it is time for them to do that . i do n't think they have to be selfish and it will be good if they help more their community . but i understand why young people give le time to that . i think it is more a question of culture than a question of age . if there is a lack for helping nowadays , it is because of everyone . for example , a young people will be not encouraged to help his community if his parent do n't . this kind of behaviour is helped by the education from the parent and the school . everybody must do something to improve the situation and putting the responsability on young people is not the best thing to do . finally i think that it is true that young people do not give enough time to helping their community . but i do n't think it is new and i think it is not the main problem .
