i agree with the following statement depending on my own experience . there are 3 reason supporting my point of view , it is more important for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact . first , the defination of learning something is to acknowledge why thing go like that which is , in other word , to know fundations and the priciples of it . to learn fact such a `` the sun rise every morning and set every evening '' is not actually `` knowing '' something , to understand why the sun act like this which could be explain a `` the earth is going around the sun '' is the real knowledge one can get . that 's why either traditional school or experimental school both tend to explain clearly to student what 's going on under the consequence . sencond , the biggest difference between human being and animal is human can understand some mind or idea which , unlike simply fact , are not visible and make a conclusion . some expriment state that , some kind of monkey can learn fact and make simply conclusion of what 's going to happen next . but they can not understand idea above the consequence . that 's the advantage that human being live and develop . so it is of vital importance to let student learn to understand idea more than just know fact . third , the yield of our society come from creation and the followed construction . creation is a complex thing which base on the accumulation of idea . when one have many idea which like brick , he can easily put some of them together to make another thing like a building . and idea is also important to construction . while build some construction , to know how can it be stable on ground is an idea of calculation . so it is more important for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact .
