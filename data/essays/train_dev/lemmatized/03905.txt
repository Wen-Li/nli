to answer this question i will first give you some idea from the business area , a i think that this is the ideal environment to prove that successful people try new thing and take a lot of risk . as you can see on daily news , a lot of people invented successful new product for example like the google founder . but these people also had a high risk in not succeeding . so , i think that you can only have a lot success if you try new thing and take all the risk this might include . one reason why i believe this is , because consumer are all looking for new not already existing thing . they want to be more and more unique and seen a individual so you should not copy an already existing product but create a real new one . if you take the tamagotchi a an example , the developer had some producing cost , but he took this risk and wa successful , because he developed a completely new product which people looked for . therefore , by trying out somenthing new he wa really successful and generated a high return on investment in his new idea . furthermore , i think that by trying out something new you will learn a lot about how thing work . of course you will make mistake , but you will not do them again if they occur the next time . for example , if you take a baby that ha touched a hot oven , you can be sure it will never touch it again , because it ha experienced the negative effect of burning his or her hand . finally , your life will be more interesting if you always try something new instead of doing all thing in the same boring way . you might gain a lot more life experience and you will develop into a real interesting person . for example , on party you can always talk about the thing you just did and you will be respected by the other people for the courage that you demonstrated and therefore , you will be considered a a successful person . in conclusion , these are the main reason why i think that successful people try new thing and take risk is the better option .
