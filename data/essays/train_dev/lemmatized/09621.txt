we do n't know why some people can success easily than others ? many people may think because they are lucky or they have always had some people to help them . however , in my opinion , i do agree that successful people try new thing and take risk raher than only doing waht they already know how to do well . because they are more creative and they know how to integrat their knowledge than others . first of all , creative people have more chance to be successed . if a person ha a new useful idea to change old stuff , the person could have more chance to be successful . for ecxample , one of my friend , he ha always had new idea to open his new business and he can find out the new business that other people ca n't see . even thought , there are many rsiks but he is willing to face this challenge and to get over it . what i mean is that if a person ha a creative personality and understand where the rsiks are . this way a person will have more chance to be successful . therefore , i would say creative and aware of risk will provide people more chance to be successful . secondly , the ability to integrat our knowledge can help u success . in the case of my friend , he ha studied in bussiness school . during the school time , he studied many different subject such a accounting , fincial management or case study . base on these skill , he knew how to combine his knowledge in order to find out the risk and creat new business . hence , i would say the ability to integrat our knowledge is a basic skill to be successed . to sum up , many people wonder how can they be successful ? the problem is that we do n't integrat and use our knowledge , be more creative and be aware of the rsiks . however , in my believe , i would say these are important characteristic to be successful .
