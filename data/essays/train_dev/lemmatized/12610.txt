we know that fact are synonymous of result . in another way we can associate fact a our daily experience . ideas and concept for year year have been evoluating , changing from time to time , even if they helped and still help to solve many scientific , socilogical , and psychological dilemma or problem . i am going to show by example how i believe that fact are more important for student , even if idea and concept remain good tool to them . first , i defined fact a experience because experience is one of the main element that motif a student . the experience help every person to face a similar problem in his or her future life . from an empirique point of view , anytime we have cloud , we should have rain . from a scientific point of view this is not right . for a student , the experience of an internship is something that is enclosed for ever in mind . this is something you can measure , not like just being given 1 + 1 = 2 . it can be in the future 1 + 1 = 3 . second , idea and concept are tool that can help to learn fact . students should be prepared for their future that fact are the concretest element that would lead them to success . because , fact are the element that would help them resolve daily problem they will faced in their working life . societies are guided by their past . in the same way , the student experience will help him face dispute between colleague , and be strong to face daily life competition .
