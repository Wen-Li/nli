i completely agree with the idea that successful people are those who are more curious than other to do and learn new thing . people that are still and do not feel the need of keep improving their ability and are not ready to change and adapt to different situation and environment will hardly become important . for instance people that think that they can keep living in today 's world withough successful people in everyday 's life are those who are innovative , take risk and a soon a they have learnt something they are already oriented to another thing . capable manager in the field of industry consider research and development a a priority activity and a tremendous key factor in order to make a business successful . let 's considere a very typical italian example , a person that reached in his life a lot of success : silvio berlusconi . he started his carrer in the real estate , he wa constructing and selling residential building , even though this market wa successul he invested his first money buying a small television network . year after year this business grew and he managed to buy other network in italy and in other country a well . it wa still not enough . with the money he gained from this business he bought a football team that wa completely unknown , ac milan . he became president and in 15 year of presidency he made it one of the most popular team of the world . but he did not stop even at this point ! he started getting interested in politics and in 1994 he became the italian prime minister . i think that this is one of the best example to understand how curiousity , capability , and inclination to try new thing can make someone very successful .
