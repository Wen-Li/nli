yes i do agree that `` it is moer important for the student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact '' .i have many reason and example to cite in support of this statement . there are many advantage if the student understands idea and concept . because the fact are already done known by others and the student have to follow the consepts and idea of that fact . for example there are many thing like the math problem and theorms which are proved by many other people so the student need to follow the rule like idea and consepts of the theorm in order to solve that . but the student cant again take the fact and the experiment on that . so it good for the student to follow idea . by following the idea we can even solve many more problem . even by using that idea we can prove some thing else . the concept and idea are used in order to find the remaning thing like proving the problem further and even we can make new meathod of solving the problem . by using some of our own idea . but it not good that we waste our time in knowing the thing which are already proved so it better to follow idea and consepts to move forword . even there is a need to know that what the fact because some time we may think the idea is correct and which may even go wrong some time . so it even necessary that the student should also be aware of this fact so that he dont get in mistake . similar way there are many advantage and disadvantage about this sentance but there are few disadvantage so i would like to agree the sentance because there are many advantage of this sentance .
