some people may think that young people do not give enough time to helping their community . others may have negative point of view . in my opinion , i argues that young people do not give enough time to helping their community nowadays . there are some reason to support my opinion . i will mention them a follows . to begin with , a technology developed , young people do not care about other thing except for the computer . they spend most of their time to surfing the internet , playing computer game , and chatting on line . for example , they like to make friend on the internet and use msn messenger to `` talk '' with each other , instead of useing the telephone . they are so intrigued in playing game online that they do not want to spend time getting along with their family . in addition , young people are protected well by their parent . hence , they do not need to work hard to earn lot of money . they fool around all day long without being asked to make money for living . whenever they need money , all they have to do is to open their mouth and say `` mom , i want some money . '' consequently , they do not care about doing something meanful to their communties . the third reason that i think young people do not give time to helping is that the environment do not give them the opportunity . for instance , young people have a comfortable and convenient environment to live . they are carefree and happy all the time , not worrying about other thing . there are no difficuties for the young people to solve . therefore , they do n't have the idea to help others and even their community . taking into account the reason i listed above , i consent to the statement that young poeple nowadays do not give enough time to helping their community .
