there are different way to enjoy the life also you can enjoy the life in different way at different age . the youngest age is a wonderful time of our life where we can live almost without worry or they are minimum . as a teenager the only worry they can have are : what dress i am going to wear for saturday 's party or why my boyfriend doe n't call me yet . in contrast when we are adult the life cames with different responsabilities : take care of our own family , spouse , kid , school , bill to pay , mortgage , car , family vacation , illness of any member of the family , the list is huge and we can fill the full page with all these responsabilities on an adult shoulder . but those are no reason to no enjoy the life on their way , living with all those worry . there are million of way that we enjoy life : getting a new house for the family , we have to pay more , but the happiness we give to our family is priceless . we can take a family vacation or a vacation just by yourself or going with a friend to that country you always wanted to go . simple thing in our life make u enjoy and appreciate every minute we live , celebrating a birthday , going shopping with our favorite friend , go fishing or golfing in our day off . as a child life is easier to live and enjoy , but that depends where do you live , who do you live with , what do you do for your life . for sure , child living in a problematic home , with parent or brother always in problem , they wo n't enjoy their childhood . from my own experience and personal opinion , there is no age to enjoy life , it is not necesary to be young to have a happy life . i came from a well formed family where i could see the happiness in my parent 's face . some young people live in continuous party , but . .. are they really living and enjoing their life ?
