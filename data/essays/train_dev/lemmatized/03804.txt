old people and young people have not the same activity , hobies , and taste . in fact , your life is totally different from an age to an other . whill young people study older people have more responsabilities . however when people are young they are not considerate a adult so they can do what ever they wish for : have fun with their friend , party a lot , not take of the house , not have duty ... altough , they have to work a lot to get a good future . young people chose in a way what they will be after . if they study well , they can have a better job . this is n't a great joy , your are in competition with all of yours friend , you might loose some friend for better grade . so in oder to have fun after school they have to be determinate . nevertheless , after school when you get a nice job well paid you will still have to work hard all your life . it 's not easy , it 's stressfull . people can be alone , when you are at school you have the oportuninity to make a lot a friend because you come from the same area , the same town , you have the same interess whereas whem people get older they fell lonely , sometimes because they do n't like their job or it 's hard for them to be part of worklife . altought if you get money you can travel a lot or sometimes enjoy yourself with your family and friend , but these moment are very rare . whem peopleget older they have new responsabilities in life : child , house and job . finally , old people can have an enyoing life when they are retired . in fact , they can do what they always wanted to do : travel , take of their grandechildren . in my opinion , when you can have a certain balance between school and freetimes young people have more fun than older people . altough life is never easy : the age do n't depend on when you can be protected or prevented from bad thing .
