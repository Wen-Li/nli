young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their community . i will argue in favour of this statement by using several supporting aspect which are directly related to the topic . one big reason why this statement is true , is that individualism and personal achievement concerning the own career are becoming the ultimate goal for everyone in society . there is no time and room left to help old people , take care of child or foster public compound . due to that increasing egotism , young people show a lack of responsibility and careness of their direct human counterpart in their nearby community . modern art of life is strongly indicating that personal achievement is a must-have and a life surviving necessity to every young , ambitious and aspiring man or woman . so if everyone is preoccupied by reaching his own goal , there is no progress of society anymore . in fact , society would decrease and loos all it value or achievement it ha reached over the century . so individuality and egotism inevitably lead to a downgraded society and is a real danger to everyone living in this society . so young people should spend more time by supporting society in a way each fit in best . it is even a duty for young energetic people to supplement their power and vitality to support their surrounding community . a equilibrium between helping community and personal achievement must be reached by everyone . but this must be taught bei the elder society member , and thus this message must be conveyed from top to bottom . if the adult can ' t reach the young people no more , one must not wonder about the growing egotism and refusal to support local or federal community . in my opinion this is a real problem to society and will preoccupy u a lot in the future . the failure of the previous generation are now seen in their offspring .
