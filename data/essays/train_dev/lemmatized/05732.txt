there are two kind of people around u in basic , successful one and unsuccessful one . there are a lot of reason affecting the success or causing the unsuccess , we all aware of them . but when we search the life of successful people , we generally face with some success story . nearly all of these story start with a risk factor . but in my opinion i am against having too much risk in life . at this point i want to give a saying that i heard in my school life `` more about le or le about more '' . when i am asked to choose one of them , i chose more about le part . because i believe that specializing on the area you are working will be the best and guaranteed way of being successful . when we think about our daily life we can see the example supporting my idea . for example , think about two restaurant one is specialized on pizza , and the other ha a lot of kind plus pizza . and you want to eat pizza . most of the people around u will choose the pizza restaurant because the human logic state that `` they are expert on this job '' . to be successfull i believe that person must be one of the best in his/her area . but at this point i want to clerify something . what i mean here in text by success is not money , therefore rich people are not accepted a successful in my mind . my successful persondefinition is that `` someone who contributes much to society '' . in order to earn big money it is true that you must have risk , but successful people , in my mind , are the one who are really know what to do and can see far future from today . in this way a person can react to the change in society quickly and this can result in reaction that may make people think a if the person is taking risk . but the person know the reason and the result of the reaction very well so that he can see the success that other people can not see at that point . to sum up i want to ask a question ; living is risk by it own why to take more risk ?
