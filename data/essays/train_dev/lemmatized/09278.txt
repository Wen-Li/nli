in the last few year technology is updating itself rapidly . to follow the new invents become very difficult nowadays . especially one of the main problem which we have in our life is transportation . the scientist are trying lot of thing to help all the world people about this problem . can you imagine what will happen10 year later ? if technological investmesments go on rapidly and scientist work so hard , it is not a different evnet to become having fewer car in twenty year . first of all , let u look at the devolopment which have done in the last 10 year . ten year ago , it wa not thought that everyone would have mobile telephone and comminucate to each other without any cable . perhaps the people who heart that had a smile on their face because that is not posible for them to have anything like this . when it come to fewer car event , this is not impossible in this view . the other thing which we must consider is the way of technology about transportatin . although many wide any confortable road are done , there is still no solution for this problem . but in last year , the number of traveller increasing faster than before . so , investmens will be much more on air transportatin . as we see in cartoon , this can be possible , too . on conclusion , we can say that , because of unexpected fast devolopment about technology , the use of car will probably decrease and instead of that the air transportation , it will probably be choosen by many people . if you see some flying car on the air a feew year ago , do not be afraid . that day probably is this day .
