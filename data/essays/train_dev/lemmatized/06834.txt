i agree wich this idea : most advertisement make product seem much better than they really are . there are two important reason why i think that this statement is true . first , today , in our society , the most important thing for people ha become the appearance , and not the really essence of thing . in the every day life of each individual , the esthethical and exterior aspect , such a clothes , beautifulness , money , richness and material thing are most relevant rather than the interior aspect , such a ethical value , love , friendliness , helpfulness etc . . for this reason people think tha is right to appear and to demonstrate these aspect rather than their essece . second , today tv , radio , paper and others form and source of information , like mass meedia have devoloped very quickly connecting group of different people all over the world . so individual are slave of this information sphere that influence them . so we can transport this two concept from the life of people to their relationship with the different kind of product , which they see and consider all day . i think that because people are are influenced and pay great attention to exterior aspect most advertisement make product seem much better than they really are . in conclusion , i think that this process is really developed , but it is wrong and it demage our society within few year .
