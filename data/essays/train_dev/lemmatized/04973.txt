in our society there are many community representing the melting pot in our country . the idea that every single person represents the whole community ha changed these past ten year . in the past the community represented a familly , a circle where people of the same apparence could stay together and grow . today , most of the young people grow without even knowing about major event , they are simply living in a virtual world based on the video-games , the cartoon . .. they do n't care about being up to date with international event , and major change in the society . moreover , the youth is an age when one doe n't really realize what implies being part of a social group . for example , group are made with people who share the same purpose , more than the same shape or root . this is why we can say that young people do n't spend much time trying to help their community : they just do n't feel it 's their community . i will use an example that occured in december 2005 in france , there ha been several destruction in the ghetto near paris and many main city . these child who were in majority le than twenty year old just reacted to what a politician said about a bad part of a certain community in the ghetto who keep on violating the law : living a outlaw . they thought their community wa insulted but it wa in fact a group of gangster who do n't represent any community . the fact is that young people lack q identity , being given an identity more than choosing one , by forgetting who they are and what is their true community . i think the most important thing is that young people receive a good education by their parent first and by the society : it is their role to be part of a society a they are citizen and own a citizenship . to conclude i would say that i agree with the fact that young people do n't help their community , given they lost their identity of being important actor of a society .
