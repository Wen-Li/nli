cars can be found easily in the world nowadays . the first thing that korean college student usually buy these day are car . because the world is becoming more globalized and mobilized , some people believe that in the near future a near a in twenty year , there will be more car than there are right now . however , i strongly disagree with that opinion for two reason ; firstly because the air pollution problem in earth is too critical , and secondly , people will make invention that will replace car in the future . first of all , cars will be fewer in twenty year because it generates too much air pollution . because of car , the air consists carbon-dixoided too much . this phenomenon is causing the world to destruction . global-warming is becoming a more of a reality because of car . the un and many other association are stressing with this problem and they are finding a way to stop air pollution . thus , because car are one of the highest priority of causing air pollution , they will be decreased in the near future . secondly , many invention are now being made to replace car . technology is advancing in a very frightining speed and in this rate , people may be able to use other vehicle a their primary transportation . also , public transportation like subway and train that run by fuel other than fossil fuel are being constructed rapidly everywhere . even right now people in korea are considering that public transportation are better than car in various way ; economical , social , political and etc . by this rate , in twenty year there wo n't be a place that is impossible to go to by public transportation . in conclusion , in two decade there will be fewer car in use than right now because firstly , air pollution problem ha become something so critical that car may eventually disappear slowly in the future , and secondly , considering the technological advancement rate a an evidence , invention in the future and public transportation will replace the role of car . nowadays , hybrid car that use hydrogen and electricity are being manufactured . however , study have shown that this method is very negative economically because when the hydrogen that will be used for fuel are divided from other part that consist h2o ( water ) , it us up up to 4 time the energy it later generates . solar power car are also making no progress these day . its time to throw away whats now useless and invent new thing that will bring a better way to mankind life .
