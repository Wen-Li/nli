actually , recentlly , young peope really to help their community . however , i disagree with the idea that the young people nowadays do not give enough to helping their community . i have some following reason for that . first , it seems that the young people dose not have enough time for that and it seems unecessary for them to help the community . recentlly , from people are really young , their parent and the society around them require to study hard for their future . some people go to cram school and go to public school far from their community . also , they do not have any friend in their communty . for them , it is not a good thing to help thier community because there is no merit for them . in my opinion even adoults do not spend time for ther community . nowadays , there are many people who do not have any rerationship with their neighborfoods . if adoults do not have relation with others in the comunitty , it is unfair to require to do that kind of thing for child , because adoults always should show the good way to live and the childrens are the tend to imitate what adoults do . thus , if people want child to help thier community , they have to showw how and why it is important and it is need . also , it seems that the situation around the community itself are chenging . i do not know there is a group working for my community , so that i do not know how to spend time for my community and what to do . past time , there are group that work for the community by correcting trash or so on . however , recentlly these group disapper and i can not find the place work for my community . so , it is difficult to find something good for community that people can do . these are the reason that i disagree with the idea that the young people nowadays do not give enough to helping their community . in this way , i do not think child di not giveive enough to helping their community .
