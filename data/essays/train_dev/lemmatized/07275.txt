the statement `` young people enjoy life more than older people do '' is a very interesting one & at the same time a really controversial one to say . it is interesting because this is a statement about two different age group & controversial because enjoying life may be different for a old person compared to a young person . i disagree to this statement because i think enjoyment is different for different people . it is a personal feeling which doe not only vary with age but also varies with each indivisual . maybe for someone partying will seem enjoyment and for someone else camping will be good enough to feel happy . there are a lot of people whom we come across , who are old but still enjoy life a much a a young person . it may seem that for a grown up person life becomes very complex , but it is no different for a young person a he/she also get to know about the complexity of life while they are growing up . it is not easy for them to face the challenge that life present them everyday . life ha never been easy for anyone and never will be . everyone ha their own issue . no one in this world is perfect . i feel different people have different yardstick to measure happiness . enjoyment come to you when you feel happy and satisfied and are not regretting any decision you have made . even if you have done something regretfull you should try to make up for it and be upto the task of facing the consequence . this give immense satisfaction to the mind . to conclude i would say that it is not your age which determines enjoyment but you yourself and how possitive you are about life . so just be possitive , work hard and enjoyment will follow you .
