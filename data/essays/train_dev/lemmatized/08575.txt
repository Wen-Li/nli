the statement state that young people nowadays do not give enough time to help their community . i strongly disagree to this . as a young person , i would like to make it clear that this statement is incorrect . i actually have proof , that young people in the community help . i believe adult get the image of young people fooling around all day because the unemployment rate is increasing and many crime are caused by young people everyday all around the world . but , this is just an image . there are young people who contribute to the community . for example , in my community , there are many homeless people . they have no job , shelter , money , nor food . the teacher in my school and the student volunteered to help them every weekend . we donate the clothing that we no longer way . we make food to keep them healthy . without our help , the homeless are not able to survive . it is important to support one another , and young people know this . another activity that i know that is helping the community , is cleaning the city . few time a month , the student at my school go out in the city to pick up garbage . we do not do this because someone told u to , but we do it because we want to keep the city clean . at the same time a sweeping the city , we are promoting the citizen to keep the world clean . it is the city that we live in , we want to feelo better living there . we have to appreciate that we are part of the community . since it is the place we live in , we want to keep it nice and clean . this is an example of an activity that we , the young people do to help and be part of the community . the young people might seem like they are always playing around but it is not true . they are not like that all the time . the adult may not always be aware , but they help to be part of the community .
