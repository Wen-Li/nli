to answer the question if there will be fewer car in twenty year is not very simple . there are various factor which might or will play a role in this development . in the following i will try to explain my point of view on this topic . if the useage of natural resource and especially oil will continue in the next two decade there might be a lack of petrol quite soon . but using up so much oil would also mean to continue wasting our environment tremendously . a lack of oil would probably cause an increase of the fuel prize up to the point where only very few people are able to even afford it . this development might lead to a thinking away from the philosophy that every household need at least one car to a more money-saving one of using public transportation system instead . in this case the number of car would of course decrease . but i think it is more likely that other resource will be used to provide energy to run a car ( for example gas or electricity from renewable resource ) . this would mean that there will be no considerable change in the number of used car . another posibility is that due to the polution of our indespensable air the people 's awereness of their environment will increase . this could possibly have the effet to make people think more sustainable about the question whether they need a car or not . if people are aware of the cause polution ha on our atmosphere they might be willed to find different - maybe more uncomfortable - way of transportation . but in my opinion i do not think that this mental change will take place - at least not in the next twenty year . to sum it up , i think that the number of car used is hardly going to change unless it get either unaffordable for most people - so they are forced to use public transportation - or an awerness of our nature arouses in the people mind which make them willed to benfit their environment not regarding their lose of comfort .
