in my country in korea , there are time to helping their community in elementary , middel , highschool . they have sixty hour a year , so they make them helping community . so they help their community not one-self . these system show that young people nowadays do not want and give enough time to helping their community . there are several reason on this situation . frist , nowadays young peopel do not perticipate the importance of their community . so they think one-self is the most importance . the do not think of their community , so they could not think of helping their community . this situation is cased by only one child custom . many parent do not want to have many childern , so many family have only one son or daughter . this son or daughter can not have their sister or brother , they do their own . in addition , these day young people have many thing to do . for example , when my cousin who is in eleven year old finished the school , she go to learn about piano , math , so on . when she finished her schaduel , the time indicates the evening . otherwise , they can not have enough time to do another thing . in brief , i firmly agree with nowadays young people have more time to helping their community . young people need to thought of helping their community , and we are not live alone . we should know the importance of community . also , government should young people keep this thought continue .
