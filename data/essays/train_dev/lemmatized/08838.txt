the purpose of advertising a product is to make it known to the public , to claim it benefit and to induce potential customer to buy the product . advertisements come in different form and through different medium : tv , radio , internet , poster on street , display in store and hand-outs in public space . furthermore , advertisments can be targeted to a specific group of people ( woman , child , elderly ) or can interest the entire population . whatever the mean of the advertisement , an ad want to convey a certain image and to convince people through wise usage of color , word , shape , size and people used in the ad . with my definition of advertisment , i agree with the statement saying that `` most advertisments make product seem much better than they really are '' . advertisements usually only display the advantage and upside of a product or service , and do not show it flaw . even if the product or service doe not have any fault , it will mo probably be shown in it best or even enhancing light in the ad . an example that i often encounter is advertisement for low cost flight . web-sites and and airline company often advertise very low flight ticket price . however , the price is never what it is claimed to be . the price advertised always omit fuel and tax surcharge , are restricted to specific date - on which most people do not wish to fly , and often do not allow passenger to travel with luggage without extra cost . so even though low cost ticket may seem attractive , they often end up costing the same amount of money a other ticket once everything is paid for . another good example constitutes fad diet . fad diet are popular diet , followed by many men and woman in the us , and are usually advertised through book , tv ad and internet pop-up . fad diet show healthy and smiling people eating whatever the diet prescribes and losing weight over short period of time . the ad however do not describe how difficult it actually is to follow that diet , how painful it may be and how easy it is to re-gain the weight just lost . they do not either display how expensive the diet is and often do not warn od secondary effect , such a depression , self-image trouble and eating disorder . consequentially , i concur that advertisement are misleading and do not convey the real value of the product or service advertised . even though there is an increasing number of regulation to stop advertiser from lying in ad , customer keep on being lurred by the shining image that ad give of certain product .
