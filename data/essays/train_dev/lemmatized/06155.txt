as an engineering student i do think that understanding idea and concept is more important than learning fact . eventhough sometimes there are fact you must learn in order to understand concept . one cannnot build a boat float if one doe not know why it float and therefore how much it can carry before it sink . the concept of physic need to be understood in order to adapt to every case and make the best choice in material , shape etc . a historian can not explain a revolution only by fact . the understanding of the idea shared by the different layer of the society is necessary and a simple description of event can not replace the analysis of the historical situation which is at stake . however , in order to understand subject like biology or chemistry you need to learn a certain amount of fact . which element is to react with an other one , how the fast and how strong the reaction is . a doctor must learn where are all the bone and the muscle in our body before he can even learn how to make a diagnosis . he ha to learn which drug can cure each illness . the learning process is not just about fact or idea and concept . to understand a concept , a fact can be helpful because our brain can associate an image to the concept . and the other way is also true , learning the idea of romanticism without reading example and fact is not worthy . global comprehension of a subject can only be reached once both idea and fact are learned . to introduce a concept , it is a common easy way to start with a fact , something that can be observed , before the ides behind can be explained .
