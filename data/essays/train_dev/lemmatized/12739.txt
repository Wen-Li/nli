many people will have different way to responding to this question . but most would say yes it is important for student to understand idea and concept . understand idea and concept open more door in life , once studenc understand concept and idea fact will come to them and , student will know what they are talking out later on . first of all , understanding idea and concept open more door in life because if the student understands the main idea of something the concept will natrally come to them . for example , in bussinuse if the student bos syas to them go do this this and this the student will imitaaly understand the idea and once he ha understood the idea he will naturally understand the cocept in order to do something . second , once the student understans the idea and concept behind something the fact will automatically come to him . for instance , once the student understand an idea he understans a concept so then when he understands the concept he can understand fact because because all fact have and idea and concept behind them . moreover , it would be hard fo the student jsut to understand the fact and not the concept and idea because everything in life ha concept and idea even fact . finally , the student will know what he/she is talking aout later on . say for example a student is trying to impres someone and she only know fact she will say all the fact but will not undersatnd what she is saying or even whats going on . however , beforhand if this student were to know here concpets and idea she could easiy know what she/he is talking about later on when she give a speach or want to impres someboady . in conculsion , ustudents will know what they are taliking about , once the student know concepst and idea fact will jsut come to them and , understanding idea and concept open more door to them later on in life . so all in all understanding concept and idea ha many mor advantage that just know fact .
