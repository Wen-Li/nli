i believe that it is not necessary that successful people try new thing and take risk rather than only doing what they already know to do well . for me , success is an absolute term . it can not be defined by some standard like having money or a high position in job . success is what you feel it is . for some people success may be to lead a peaceful life with family and friend while sharing whatever you have . so in that term a person may be successful by just doing whatever he know to do well . on the other hand , those who try new thing and take risk may not be successful . taking risk ha both pro and con . one may achieve a lot and at the same time there is a possibility that he may lose everything he ha , while a person who doe whatever he know well is sure to keep doing that part and be content . in taking risk and trying new thing , until you succeed you have the fear of losing . you put not only your happiness and well being at stake , but also of those who are dependent on you for their happiness . a person trying to do new thing ha to devote a lot of time researching the option , finding the best opportunity or creating one and then working on it . if he devotes the same time in doing what he already know , he can spare some time for pleasure and fun . there are no statistic to prove that conservative ( who do not take risk ) are le successful a compared to aggresives ( who take risk ) . risk averse and risk tolerant attitude are also reflective of a culture or background . again , there are no report that show that people who took risk and tried new thing were the only one to succeed . e.g. mother teresa is a successful personality . she did social work which she new well and kept doing it till the end of her life . similarly there are example of people who gamble with the view of taking risk and trying to be successful , but lose everything . in conclusion , i would say that if for me success is to be happy and satisfied in life and i am happy and satisfied while doing whatever i know to do well , then i am a successful person .
