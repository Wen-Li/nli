`` need is the mother of invention '' when need change the thing which are commonplace today change like a dream . alternative solution are found with invention . so though it may sound strange after looking into the ever increasing sale graph of the auto company , i feel there will be fewer car after twenty year than there are today . things are getting customized according to the need of the consumer . goods and food are delivered at the doorstep over a phone call . retail giant like walmart and food king like mcdonalds are accessible over short distance . this thing virtually eliminate the need to go out , drive and shop . with the advent of internet , it is very much possible to work from home . with the mean like video conferencing the memebers in a meeting can participate even if they are scattered across the globe . e-learning ha opened new horizon . classes and even archive are available online . these thing help the urge of a human being to stay secured and relaxed in his nest , reducing the need to go out everyday . population is a huge problem faced by many country a it is linked with the limited resource like land . it result into the heavy traffic seen on the road . most of the automobile today run on petrolium product which are getting extinct . also they depend on the political aspect like relation with some oil producing country . we can have alternate solution for that like renewable energy like solar power but the effectiveness of it is still a doubt . with the steadily increasing standard of living across the globe and government policy improving everywhere we will soon have a better and faster public transport which will reduce the need for having personal mode of transport . it may sound a distant dream now but we cant deny the possibility of everyone having a mini aircraft . it will make the car a history . it sound a fairy tale but so wa the case when people talked of mobile communication before the invention of cellphone . you never know , need can create magic . so expect fewer car on road in the coming year .
