nowadays young people do not give enough time to helping their community . i agree with this statement . i will argue my viewpoint by giving example and explained the importance of the community . it true that not all the young now dont give enough time for their community but other young have a particular devotion for their community . for my view , the a large number of young are individual . nowadays people in general and young particularly focus on individual success . for example life go fast and ha become very difficult that young have to work hard . there are only face to new individual challenge in order to satisfy their need and there familly . for example me , i know that i could help my community with my academic experience , but it more important for me to find a job , to work hard to keep my job , to be married , to have a child and to take care of them . it only after that , that i will think about how to help my community . therefore it very important to think about the community . the question is how to help my community ? by giving my viewpoint on some importante subject , contribute for school bulding , by undertaking research project in order to develop my community etc . so i would like to advise young to pay attention for the community , even if there not interested to participate for the development there are to take care by not destroying what the community ha built . i would also like old people to understand the young because now life if more difficult than before to focus on many think at the same time .
