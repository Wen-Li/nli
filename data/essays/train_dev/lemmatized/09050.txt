people are very different from each other . some people have desire and talent to learn and some have different ability on different subject . it is like , some can perceive thing better but some can not . or some people can jump higher while some can not . these are thing about genetics and come with u a we are born . if we look at it that way , we can not say that it is better to study many academic subject . we also can not say it is necessary to study an academic subject . it is just about people and how their interest and talent direct them . gaining broad knowledge is very important however university and academic are not the only path necessary reaching it . we can give artist a an example for this . some people still argues about that art can not be teached . some believe it come inside the artist a they are born . not all the greatest artist in the world are graduated from university . for example leonardo da vinci . he didnt go to any art scool in his life . but some thing inside him differenciated him from the rest of the people . we can not say he doesnt have a broad knowledge . example can be widened by athlete . maybe some of them just couldnt graduate from a single academic course but this is because he is not that type of human . he is living in this world to do different thing . i am not saying that it is bad or impossible to have broad knowledge on many academic ski . some people are capable of learning and filling their brain with a lot of information . some may say if is ineffective but i dont think so . one `` can '' know a lot . it is just a matter of choice . it doesnt matter which way we choose . the most important thing here is to choose the subject we like and we can . if we are not happy with what we are doing it is impossible for u to be effective in the world no matter how much we know .
