i think that is better to have broad knowlendge of many academic subject than to specialize in one specific subject . in my opinion when we have knowledge of many subject we , in the future , will work on the different kind of job . i actualy study marketing but not only this subject becouse i know that is important to know another type of subject ( for example math , italian exetera ) to will arrive at the top of the management . in fact for the total knowledge in my school teach a different kind of subject to prepare a future business manager , not only one subject but a lot of different subject . my friend , in the college , studyed only maccanical subject and actualy he doe n't find a good job for this preparation . however if you specialize in one specific subject you have not a possibility to choose a different kind of work but , if you is the better in your specialize , you will arrive quikly at the top of the your future job becouse you have the total knowledge of this specificaly job . in conclusion i can say that the very important in the future life of any student is not how much academic subject is know but how can we studyed it .
