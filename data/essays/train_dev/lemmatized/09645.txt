i agree with the idea that young people do n't give enough time to helping thier community . the young around me participate in the traditional ceremony and activity at least . however , the number of the young whe are involved with such kind of activity is not so many . my friend engaged in the protecting the traditional dance and ceremony even though they were not born in the city , and they build the good relationship with local people . i heard local people admire the attitude and pasion toward the event . i wa moved to hear hat , but most young do n't have time to engage in it because they have what they have to do before helping thier community . for example , they have to study and work a a part time job . therefore , they do n't have enough time to participating in it even though they are interested in activity . a friend of mine said that she wanted to take part in the activity that they can play with local school child , but she ca n't do that because of lack of time and large amount of homework . second , the adult are also negative for the social activity . for example , some parent do n't allow thier child to communicate with neighbor , and they grow up thier child in that way , a a result , they ca n't help growing without knowing the system of community . since i wa born in the community where the relationship among the community wa strong , so i could participated in many activity . however , the people who wa born in urban area have n't experienced activity . i guess if the young , who have n't experienced the activity and been taught the importance of relationship among the communitiys , grow up , the number of involvement with the activity would decrease more and more . we can learn a lot of thing from community activity , so we shoud take part in it and the adult shoud teach the importance .
