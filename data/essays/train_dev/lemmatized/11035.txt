i agree with this sentence . the most important thing for a student is to understand how and why event happened respect to the singular fact . in other word , i think that student have to learn a method of working to analyse fact and phenomenon . this is also the highest challenge for a teacher . for example , in molecular biology is more important to understand the sense of a step in a protocol respect to the concentration of each reagent in the same step . the concentration of the reagent is written , it more important to know why you have to use that reagent . when a student ha got a method ow work , presumibly he/she ha a clear view of his/her work . the idea and concept are something you will never forget . they give you style of work , in a logic manner . instead the fact are suitable to be forgotten . for example , i have forgotten a lot of specific date of civil war in italy during the century , but i know quite well the entire story . is not important the single fact , but the general structure of the subject . i 'm a biologist . when i do an experiment , i ask to myself : `` did i prepared the good condition to obtain somethig interesting ? '' little thing mean a lot : tempereture , sterility , comfortable position to handle my instrument . this is the first step of a method of working . then a scientist must have clear the reason of every step of the experiment . even though mistake are always possible , if one ha a good method of working , clear idea and concept in it mind , he/she could discover soon the error .
