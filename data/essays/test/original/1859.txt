The  best  way  to  travel  is  in  a  group  led  by  a tour  guide.I  agree  with  this.The reason  for  supporting  this  statement may  be  explained  in  the  following  manner.

Generally  a  tour  is  memorable  journey  to  an  unknown  place  along  with  family  or  friends.So,at  this  time  of  travel  a  guide  should  led  the  entire  group  of  tour  because  we  travel  to  the  place  which  we  haven't  seen  till  date.At  this  time  the  guide  id  the only  person  who helps  to  make  the  entire  place  known.

Basically  a  travel  in  group  led  by  a  guide  can  solve  a  number  of  problems.A  guide  helps  to make  understand  that  language.He  gives  the  right  information  of  the  food  available  in  that  area.In  this  way a  ot  of issues  can be resolved  with guide.Also  the  guide  keeps  on  posting  the  different information  regarding  the  places  which  we  travel and  he  makes  to  watch  the  people  in  the  group  each  and  everything  in the  area    visited without  any  failure.

   For  example,I  along  with  my  friends  had  a  small tour  to  Goa.Our group  was  led  by  an  efficient  tour  guide.And  we  had  a  good  time  by watching  each  and  every  place.The  guide  was  helpful  in  each  and  every aspect.There  was  a  continuous postings  of  the   information  regarding  the  place  and  we  came  to  know  a  lot  of  that  area.The  guide  was also  helpful  in solving  problems  like  food ,health etc if any.In  the  whole  way the  tour guide led  the  path  and  made  our  tour  succesful.  

    So,a  guide  is  the  necessary  person who  duly  takes  care  of  the  entire  group  in  the  tour.Thus  the  tour guide is  the person who  makes  the  constraints  satisfy  without  any  issues  and  makes  the tour  successful.If  the  group  doesn't  have  a  tour  guide  the  consequences  may  be in  danger.So,the  group  should  be  led  by  guide  when  we  travel.
