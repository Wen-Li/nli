I agree with the given statement that most advertisements make products seem better than they are.
Most products which are selled on TV for example are called the best in the world.
Cars ,for example. If you buy an Mercedes you will be happy,but if you buy an Golf you will be happier.
That what they want to tell us. But they only want to make us think that these products are the best. It is a kind of manipulation of the consumer.
But on the other Hand it is understandable to claim that something is really special if you want to sell it. When the producer of a product tells us that his product ,maybe chocolat, does not taste very well, nobody would buy it.
As a consumer you have to be able to look beneath the surface.
You should not be blind while buying a product. Being aware of the fact that advertisements make products seem better than they really are can help you to distinguish between a good and a bad product.
Especially our children have to lear it. The are very naive as far as Manipulation is concerned.
They see something colorfull with funny figures they want to get it immediately.
Without thinking about it they buy it, which behaviour is verz irrational it is an more instnctive behaviour
