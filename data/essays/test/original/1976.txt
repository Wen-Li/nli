 I do believe that a successful person tends to try new things and take risks rather than stick to what he/she is already knowledgable about.
 
A successful person always seeks to try new things, reach to new places and look for new opportunities. He/she has the courage and self-confidence to venture into unkown territories. This person indulges in new experiences, which ultimately enriches his/her self and makes that person gain more insight and exposure to the world around him/her. 

Advantages of a successfuly person's approach can be clearly depicted from the business world. A businessman who is doing well in providing a certain product to his customers may settle for that and won't care to expand his business. This person may operate profitably to some extent. However for him to be - and more importantly remain - successful, he must broaden his visions and constantly look for new ways to improve his offering and increase his customer base. For instance, he must try to come up with new versions or updates of his product or look for new components that'll lead to higher quality. He must be open for new trends, say in promotion and advertisement. Moverover, he must be continuously seeking new markets and segments to which he can introduce his product. 

Some may consider such pratice to be risky and would rather remain on the safe side, doing what they've always done. But the fact is, we're living in an increasingly competitve environment, where excellence, innovation, professionalism and exposure are but a few of the competencies that everone is struggling to achieve in order to be successful.
