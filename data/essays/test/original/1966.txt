Along the history of mankind innovation was very important to the human  civilization .
I agree on this because if we look at the history we will find that the makers of the history from philosophers, artists, scintests and leaders refused to be ordinary people,and refused to make the things the same way that every body makes it, they took the risk of making some thing new, althought the risk was some times very high and could affect their lives and families, but they refused to be only copies of ancissors and they took the advantage. 
There is many examples that demonstrates this fact along the history In the history of art for example we will find the expressionists who refused to make the classical style of drawing and painting and they tried new ways depending upon color theories, althought there was a complete refusal for what they are doing ,and was considerd completley unusual, we consider them now as the forerunners  of the modern art, in scinece also we can notice this Galilio for example had had a very diiferent prespective about the science and the earth however the people living in his time refused his ideas,but as the time goes he was considered as a very sucsessful person.
These people sacrifice with themselves in order to proof their ideas and also they become a part of the history.
Even on a smaller scale in copmpanies and busniess we will find  different examples of yong people who tried new ways in marketing, advertising, communicating with clients which led to a dramatec changes in the market.
This is a part of the nature of the human brain to find unusual ways to solve problems and this what we call creativitey when the idea is very new the pepole can refuse it in the begining but the future had always the final dessition.
