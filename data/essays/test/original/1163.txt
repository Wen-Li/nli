Im not agree I think that for students both ideas, to understand the ideas and concepts and to learn facts are important. 
first is important to understand ideas and concepts to know all about something, if one are interesting, of course. for example, when we are in the class and the professor are talking about some issues we must to take atention of his words and then we can have an idea about the issue. Despite of there are some issues that are not very easy to learn it, but we can ask to the professor and try to understand. sometimes we have a different idea of something, of course, is not necesary that all people have the same ideas, but there are some topics that all knows if it true or false (well, is difficult to speak about what is true or false in the life, i think that all is relative, I m really not sure about this question, is difficult to respond) and here is when the second part comes, when we have the experiences. for example, drugs. there are many young people who thing that the drugs is not bad for ower health and life, and although their parents had tolk with them about the problems of drugs but they didnt paid atention and they consumed. after the experiencies  or later they can see  the drugs problems.
there are some people that they dont need to learn the facts, they only understand ideas and no more is necessary. So both are important for students.
Another example, usually, when I m studyng chinese language and learning about the structures, I trying to right some sentences in my copybook, but only when I go to the house of some chinese friends I can understand ideas or conceps of chinese structures, because is better for me to learn facts than understand ideas and concepts in chinese language, but this is a problem in my country because hardly i can speak in chinese with some chilean people, only a few people can speak chinese, and the another problems is that the chinese people who lives here in Chile the most of them  speak dialect or canton languague..
