In this short essay I will discuss the statement " Young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities" giving my opinion and using specific reason and examples.

I disagree with this statement because my experience is the opposite.
I am 29 years old and when I was 19 years old I started to help persons with phisical handicaps going daily to the association named "XXIV Luglio".
Today, they are many young persons that give a lot of time to helping this persons going to the association daily and also going to the beach with handicaps in the summer.
Moreover, being the city where I live very small (L'Aquila), I also known other associations that now are formed by many young persons that spend a lot of time to helping their communities in different ways.
As an examples, Legambiente is a very usefull associations that in L'Aquila is formed by about 100 young persons. This young persons help their communities because they give time for keep the environment safe from pollution.
Also wolking in the streets of my town, I can observe that young people nowadays helps the communities being good citziens and good workers.
In the opposite, old people is more individualistic than young people and he do not give enough time to helping their communities.
As an example, in general old people is not worried for the pollution because it is a problem of the next generation. 
In conclusion, I disagree complitely with the statement and, in the opposite, I think that young people nowadays spends a lot of time to helping thei communities.
