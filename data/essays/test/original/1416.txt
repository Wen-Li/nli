I disagree with the statement that in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today. I can quote many reasons to support my statement. In a modern society, its not possible to restrict anyone from using car because of his busy schedule.

With population growing rapidly, the increasing need of modern society are increasing and hence the number of cars are growing, Also, because of growing population the unemployment problem is increasing and hence is demanding a busy schedule from the employees and thus forcing them to go for easy and safe means of travel. So, this search for a means of transport might end anyone with usage of car. 

Also, with growing technolgy the people are moving from old means of transport by buses to new and advanced means of transport. The youth are easily influenced by new technology cars and race cars and might force their parents to buy him one. 

Everyone in this society wants to improve their social status by saving something for their later needs. The social position is measured mostly by the person's wealth and this endures to the vehicle they are using. So, in general people want to go for a car discarding their old two wheelers, given a chance. In some cases they may be forced to take a car just because the family members are increased from two when they are married to four after having children. In some cases when someone gets married, though the dowry is prohibited, because people are not used to it, they give some presents, in general a vehicle so that their daughter doesn't suffer. If one gets an oppurtunity to buy a car this way, i don't think he will refuse to take one. 

In the current situation, I don't see any possibility of reduction in the usage of cars, if the population increases this way and people don't change their way of thinking.
