The question called is dealing with the fact to specialize or not in academic subjects. This issue is raised by a lot of students when they have to choose their orientation.
On one hand, I think that it is important not to specialize too early in your life for different reasons. The main reasons are that, first, it is really a good thing for your own knowledge. You will be able then to be interested in many subjects and conversation. So it is a way to be somebody open-minded and interesting. Then, I believe that only few young people know what they really want to do in their life. You cannot be totally sure when you are eighteen. Indeed, I think that to choose many academic subjects will help you to discover what you are really want to do for the rest of your life (even if now, it is easier to change your carrier). For instance, I have chosen for this academic year business subjects which are useful for all types of jobs in business, because I am not determined. It allows me to have a global vue of how function companies. It is a way to keep more opportunities for my carrier.
But on the other hand, you cannot stay generalist all your life. One day or another, you will have to specify in order to be more performing and more interesting for recruiters. Most of the jobs requires specificities. This specialization can occur when you are more mature, and more experimented in life. It permits to avoid from mistakes in your orientation, problems which are generally difficult to solve when you are fourty for instance.
As a conclusion, I think that both are necessary in the construction of your future. You need time to open your mind, in order to help you to specify in a better way, and to feel better in your life.
