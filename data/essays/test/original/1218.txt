To have a real discussion about this topic, we must remember the objective of an advertisement: it is one way to inform people, by the papers, the radio or the television, of the existence of a product and where it is available. Moreover, it has to show people why the object is necessary, and, in case, why it is better than the others.
But the law forbids advertisers to express false statements about the products: so they have to find some ways to sell it the most.
It is the reason why sometimes, we find products much better at the television or the radio than they are when we have it in hands. If we look at the example of a children game, the advertisers put it in a way that is more convenient for the product than the child bedroom: Barbie dolls are put together in an advertisement to make it more interactive for the children, but in other way, without the house, the car, the sister... I think the little girl will be disappointed with a girl alone without possibilities.
For adult products, the aim is different: there are several ways to make them buying a product. In car advertisements, for example, if some advertisers aim at attracting people with power and speed, others prevail design, or the spirit of the car maker. In our time of pollution and energy economy, the Smart brand always put forward in advertisements the consumption of the product, which is the lowest one. But without knowing the conditions in which the test was made, the argument doesn't have credibility anymore.
It is the same thing when you go to the movies or at television: in the trailers, the advertisers put together the best extracts of a program, in only one or two minutes, so, for actions movies for examples, it gives an impression of continuous action, which is not necessarily true in the whole program. People who like action may be again disappointed if there are too many slow moments in the whole movie.
To conclude, I would say that advertisements don't really make the products to seem better, but they give it the best in. And moreover, if it seems particularly attractive at the beginning, a lot of people are getting quickly bored, and the product losses its attractivity.
