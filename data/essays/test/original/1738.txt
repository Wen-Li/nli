- Hairspray that gives your hair the same great look all day, during all activities - something almost every woman wants. But is this realistic? If you see a commercial for example on television, have you ever ask yourself "Is it reasonable what the poducer is adverticing, is it true?" In the following essay I would like to discuss exactly this statement. Is the advertised product as great as producer say it is?
First of all we have to consider, that the main thought producer have in their mind is to sell their product, make profit of it. So I personally think that they few a little cheating not as a major problem but make the product look more likable.
Second, in an advertisment you can vary the conditions such as temperature and light, so the customer automatically sees the best part of the product and might not even consider possible risks.
Third, people are easy to influence. Seeing a product on a young, healthy and good looking woman or man in a breathtaking setting makes them want to be there, have the same look and the same experience. So that a uninfluenced perspective is given.
On the other hand there are regulations that control and narrow the range of the producers creativity. As a result there has to be a certain truth within an advertisement. 
Personally I have experienced that not all advertised products are better presented in a commerial than in reality. So for my own opinion I try not to get as much influenced by the media and there propaganda.
