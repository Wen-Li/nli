Some people think that nowadays young people do not give enough time to helping their communities.
People helping their communities are really important for the social system we live in considering our Western society. There are lots of tasks in communities that are expensive if an expert is engaged. So, communities very often cannot afford to hire skilled worker for every small task. As a consequence, they need volunteers who do the job.
On the one hand, these jobs are not always pleasent ones, like caring for elderly people who are very ill. Thus, there is no surplus in volunteers for such jobs. People sometimes do not see the necessarity that living in a social community they have to take part actively and care for the community. This might be because it is not always clearly communicated. So, some people do not understand that they have to participate in the social system not as maverick and egoist, but instead as a caring and understanding person. And it would not be satisfactory to force someone who is unwilling, to do a social job. The result could be disastrous. Furthermore, some people think they just do not have enough time for social work. But this is only depending on their way to distribute their time, especially it is a matter of priority.
On the other hand, there are people who are very engaged in their community because they think it makes sense to them. Otherwise our social system would fail. These people help to support minorities, for example by caring for disabled people. Doing such jobs for free or at least for only little money, volunteers support their community not only in a financial, but also in an ideological way. Nevertheless, these people are rare and these people are always the same ones.
Finally, it is important to publish the jobs in a community and to say how important these jobs are. It is necessary not to wait until any volunteer comes, but instead to actively find such persons. People being already engaged in their communities, could tell about their work and about how good they feel doing it, consequently helping the communities to find more participants for social work.
