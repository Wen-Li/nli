In our day to day world and our lifestyles we constantly require and aspire for many different and facinating things which would incure a sense of happiness and pleasure, and advertisements act as an assuage to these requirements. 
   
    Many a times these advertisements seem to be perfect for our requirements , but they may always belie the fact of perfection .
The products that they advertise have many competitors. The products may be good or can be rated as an average thing to be sold but usually they exaggerate them . For example an aidvertisement of shoes which shows that the person wearing them can carry as many as dozens of people and can still walk comfortably. This can only suggest two things about the product that it is really so or it just an attempt to lure the  customers.

     Sometimes advertisement makers play with the unconcious state of the the customers as it is scintifically proved that visual matters can be exploited to make best use of the unconcious state of the people. Also sometimes  the emotinal status of the people or of the society can endorse a product and can further enhance and broaden the scope of the advertisements.

    There is this fact that the owners of the products want thier advertisements to turn into big profits and also make them popular.
The advertisers have no choice but to acknowledge or give in to their demands. The market competetion and the profit margins many a times make the advertisers to  overlook  the fact of the quality of the products . 

    On the whole the advertisements are mere a fanatism and are not related to the actual being of the product. It is not so with every advertisement as they are sometimes phlegmatic and convincing.
