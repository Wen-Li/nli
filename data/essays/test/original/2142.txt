What is more important for studens?

Do you think that students prefer understand ideas and concepts than learn facts?  I think it is more important to understand ideas and concepts for several reasons.   One, a student has to learn concepts and learn important things like criterias, reasons about  the topic  is studying.  Second they will need to discover different examples or situations about a concept or matter because not all the examples are the same.
Third, a student has to have a good capacity to explain, why he think in that way, for example if he understant an idea about  why in United States are very common the tornados?  he most have to explain in detail why he is right and why this happen scientifically .
On the other hand, if a student just learn facts and not understand ideas and concepts the most important thing, it is not the same because every situation it is different ,and there are exceptions in everything.
For everything you must understand why it is, because at the end you can join the concepts with your knowled and then it would be more easy to express your ideas about whatever topic.
Summaring all this in life there are many types of people who think different, and most of them apply the best for theirselves, but if a student prefer learn more stadistics and examples, expiriences, than just facts, he should  be a very good professional, no matter the area he is interested.
