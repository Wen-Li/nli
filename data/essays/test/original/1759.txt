In this rapidly changing world of Science and technology we are witnessing  a tremendous technological advancement  and breakthroughs. These technologies have made our lives more eaiser and comfortable than ever before. Car is among one of the precious gifts that technology has offered to us. The Craze for cars  has increased with time so I feel in next twenty yeras to come the craze  and use of cars will continue increasing  as it has been increasing till date. 

Cars have turned out to be a successful mode of transportation. Cars are one of the best mode of tranportation for the road ways. We frequently see the new models of cars being introduced in the market as a result of  their increasing  demands. More people prefer to drive car than to choose public transpot systems. Car is also a symbol status and luxary. In my Country, only people with sound economic condotions can afford to keep a car., so keering a car is a symbol of wealth. With the increase in facilities and better economic conditions more and more people opt to have a car than any other convence.

For many people driving is a passion, for example many people go for long drives to spend their time. There are others who love car racing and enjoy the speed. Car in many ways  now  is an important part of our lives. One of the biggest advantages of cars over the other vehicles is  space factor, its neither too big like a bus or truck nor too small like bikes that permits a ride for two. Moreover, there are different models available for cars to suit the particular requirement needs. If I have a big family I will go for a long, spacious car and For a small family a economic model can be choosen.

Still today we find that lot of people are crazy and passionate about cars. The old and obsolete models of cars are sometimes seen in exibitions. This shows the interest of people in cars. I feel that future of car is very bright and promosing, we have lots more to see.
