 I totally agree with the statement because, to begin with, it is not useful to learn facts if you do not understand them. You would not be able to apply these concepts when you need them, for example, a theory or a mathematic formula stored in your head would not be useful if you do not understand how to use it. 
I believe that for applying a concept in a real life case, it a must to know how to develop that concept and get the most out of it.   

I will support my view the following

- Social environment. Talking about Ethics in school, if a student do not know completely understand the values and the content of the course he will not be able to respect and tolerate different points of view or ideas of people in the real world that can be joined with different backgrounds and experiences.  
  
- Professional environment. It is important for a professional that he applies all what he learnt in his career and practice every day to improve in those areas needed to success in whatever responsability that demands his full performance. 

For example, it is not useful to learn all the economy principles if you do not know how to apply them in both the business environment and the nations environment. 

    Furthermore, this comprehension of a whole subject or theory will give the student more confidence of what he is capable of doing; thus, improving his performance in every aspect of his life. 

    If a student wants to enrich his education in all aspects he must know how to use these concepts by understanding them. 
I think that the best way for an student to achieve this is not only learning the fundamentals of the theories, but also practicing them in in real life.
