Students should always concentrate on learning and understanding new ideas and concepts rather than learning facts, because this will help them in generating new ideas and help them to expand their abilities in writting, reading and listening to lectures,

Learning new ideas and concepts is the main key to be successful in the future as the job that the student will attend in the future will be based on the ideas and concepts rather than on facts, because students will learn the facts with the time and the experiance in life as the facts will be learned from historical books and also from political events.

Also the student will be in a powerfull position when understanding new ideas and concepts and that is in school, colleges and even in participation in lectures as the student will have an excellent background, for example, if a student is selected to represent the class in a general discusion about a certain play for a famous author, the student will be able to participitate effectivly in the discusion if his information is based on new ideas and concepts rather than facts because the facts will only be needed in speical lectures not in dramatical ones.

Learning facts will onle be needed when a student is going to study history or other majors which involves the use and the need of the facts. But I believe that learning new ideas and concepts will result in creativity as the student will be able to generate new ideas and thoughts based on what he had learned because the ideas and concepts will help in creation new thoughts and will help in developing new skills. But if a student concentrate more on facts, the student will not be successfull as the one who concentrates more on new ideas and concepts because the facts will only help in for example historical reasearches.

Finally, I believe that learning new ideas and concepts are more usefull for a student in many fields such as the colleges, schools and jobs in the future rather than learning facts as it will only be helpfull in certain fields like political sciences,
