I do not agree completely with this statement. In my experiences as a student and a professional business woman, I have continuously encountered situations where understanding concepts, ideas and facts is equally important. The importance of each element can sometimes increase or change depending mostly on the pragmatic perspective or end of these situations.
As a student, sometimes it was difficult to discern between the importance and precise difference between each of these elements. Then again, throughout my educational experience their differences and importance became clearer.
I strongly believe that the importance of each of these elements lies within their application throughout each student's educational programme. For instance, it is more important for students who major in  exact and/or natural sciences such as Chemistry and Mathematics to prioritize facts over concepts or ideas. 
On the other hand, for students who major in Philosophy or Psychology, understanding ideas or concepts is significantly relevant to their studies and the implementation of these in their work. However this comparison is not 100% accurate or true. What might be important to some students might not be important to other students, independet of their major, their interests and their academic abilities. Overall  I think  the importance of these elements depends mostly on each student and their academic and personal objectives.   
Nevertheless it is crucial to evaluate whether the prioritization of concepts, ideas or facts is indeed an issue. In my opinion it is more important for students to achieve good grades and obtain a diploma to continue with their careers. While some students might be in university to learn others are investing their money and their time in preparing themselves to become leaders, lawyers, doctors, teachers or whatever they want to become. What is most important is to become eduacted.
