I definitely agree the statement.
For almost all the people ,it is not true that use the spesific things that they leran in highschool or university is effective to their life,work,and usual matters.
Maybe spesific things are very important for the people who major in spetiallity learnings ,exanple medicine,scientist ,professer , and that kind of special jobs.They certainly need supecial education,so the have to know many facts.But  If we work as salaryman ,we do not need to know about sciense,history and anoter special  facts.
But the fact is important too, because ,that is indeed occur in my own country and the another country in the  world and give us  and tell us some important thing and give us a commonn topic of interest or conversation, and then we can make good relationship.
But,to preper  of think about  some fascinating or amasing idea ,we need a flexibility to every kind of things.We learn through the total education, how to make things better ,how to make good idea ,how to act when we are in difficult situation. From that kind of training ,we can learn  how to manage the difficult situation or how to produse newly developed ideas.And only such things  that we obtain from our experiense help us to act in the real life.
Fact is else important ,but If we learn only facts , it is no way to make a  significant progress .We have to go above the fact to make things more better, to make a good progress.
In conclusion, it is not  most important to learn fact but  make the fact to the another situation,so that  we can  complete  that matter. we need the base of the ideas and concept.To know concept means we can manage the another situation like what we had learned.
