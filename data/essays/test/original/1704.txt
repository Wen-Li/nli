There are two kinds of studies before highschool. You can go to the university or to specific higher institutions. These two solutions offer different ways of studying. Indeed at university you studie more specific academic subjects than in highschool but you still have many subjects. On the contrary in specific institutions you learn more about very specific subjects. In my mind university can appear to be better and I am going to explain why by explain the advantages and disadvantages to be specified or not.

First, I think that to have a broad knowledge of many academic subjects can help you more than study a specific subject. If you only study science you are not conscious of what happenig in the economic world and it can be useful to raise money. Besides when you are aware about a lot of subjects you are more open-minded in my opinion. Indeed you learn different cultures in history, different languages, differents theories in mathematics... 

Then when you are specialized on one specific subject you can be more precise about this. students are university know a lot of things about different academic subjects but they cannot describe with a lot of detail one point of one subject. For example an economic students studies mathematic but he does not know some mathematic points particularly because he also have to stuy history, law...In addition with the great changes in science or technologies subjects the working world seems to looking for more students who have studied specific subjects than students who have studied a lot of subjects.

To sum up I realize that both kinds of higher studies have different advantages and disadvantages. To study a specific subjet appear to be more useful if you zant to a work in a very precise kind of job such as researchers in science or chemistry. In the other part having a knowledge concerning a llot og subjects seems to be good if you want to have a job where you are going to use a lot knowledge such as marketing jobs or teachers in primary schools.
