The young age is the most active age in the humans life.most people now adays spichally the older people says that young people now adays  do not give enough time helping their communities, i think that because of the life style of the young people now. 

    I disagree with them because we can not say that all of them are helpless. everybody now can see alot of phiyical jobs most of the workers are from the young people, forexample i can see most of the policemen or the firemen are young also in the militry . in this examples we can see that they can help the government which is part of the community.

    They also going to universities and schools, after graduating of course they may take a place in helping the community forexample, i am 20 years old and I wish to study accounting and work in a bank or a big company to help my country grouing that is why I wish to pass the tofel test.

    In the fisteval time many people can see young boys and girs are working in the summer also in many diffrent places in stade of staying helpless, in the bookshops, supermarkets and also the boteeqs.

    the new generation of the young people have more knowlge of how to use the technology, internet computers and many things that older people do not know how to use, that's why we can take advantages of them.

    As a conclution, i do not think that all of the young people do not have time to help.
