I completely agree with the statement that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide , because it does three very basic things right . Firstly we will not get bored while travelling . secondly , we  will have enough experiences and option during a case 22 situation. and  finally the tour guide specially will help us to know the history of social , cultural and political importance of each place .

First, if we are travelling with a group of people, we will not get bored of  the long travelling hours. For a example when we are travelling from kolkata ( a city in India )  to Delhi ( capital of India) by a train in a group for excursion we have a lot of fun . Each one of us exhibits their natural talent and as we progress we sang and dace more vigorously . Finally the journey ( about 24 hours ) was completed and we even did not feel any sort of tiredness.

In the secoond place, It is always best to travel in a group because you never know when you will feel sick  or some accidents may happen. Let us take an example ,  recently when the Finance minister of India is travelling to attend an election campaign in Gujarat ( INDIA)  he suddenly felt unconscious because of the scorching heat  while travelling .  the other group members who are travelling with him, took him to the nearby Hospital and they stayed with him until he stabilizes.


Finally , it is very important to have a tour guide when we are travelling because a tour guide will provide immense knowledge about tthe history of social , political and cultural importance of the particular places . he will also provide important information on how to make the journey more comfortable in the shortest possible times  For example if you visit a place of historical importance the tour guide will enlighten us with the historical background of that particular place .

Considering , the above mentioned points it is justified to travel ina group with a guide.
