Yes, I agree that many companies that are producing their products  mostly likes to reach the customers through the advertisments. So that the customers attracts to the products that are shown in the Television . But when we get the product to the home we face many problems with the product, these problems are not even mentioned in the user manual. Many other products that are used in the common life also creates many problems. 
   For example when we consider the agriculture field we see many advertisments on the pesticides that are to be used in the agriculture inorder to protect the crop from the bacteria, but when we get the pesticide, after using it we face many problems that we never come into our notice previously. This may totally spoil the crop.
   when we take into account the advertisement of the any motor vehicle in that particular advertisement they shows that the vehicle is more efficient ans gives good milleage and the engine working is good. Ater getting it we face the problem in the milleage of the vehicle and the engine also does'nt work properly and gets damage within a few months.
    Usually every common man attracts to the advertisements that are shown on the health care medicines and the beauty cosmatics. when we watch the advertisement of the medicene that cures the common diseases like fever, headache and the body panes. We never take the suggetions of the doctor, but we just take the medicine that was shown in the advertisement , this may casue an serious illness. But these advertisisng companies never give an serious caution not to take the medicine with the doctors suggestion.
     When we see the advertisement of the spectakles that was telecasted on the television, they get to the showroom and purchases the glass, this causes the eye damage but we have to get tested by the eye specialist before using the glass so that he will suggest us to use the particular glasses that are not affecting our eye's but it protects.
      The advertisement on the fans also we face the same problem , the fan works for few days well and later it strukcs.
      These are the some examples I observed particularly in my life.
