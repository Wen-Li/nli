        I disagree that in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today. As if we see the figure of the past about the yearly consumption of cars, we can say that the figure is increasing continuously. As the population of the world is increasing day by day, so there would be more need of cars in coming year in order to satisfy the transportation need of people. Also government of countries is building new roads which are comfortable for driving cars and other motor vehicles. Better roads increase the efficiency of the cars. So transportation by cars would not be costly for people in coming years. They would prefer travelling by cars rather then taking the bus or hired motor vechiles. 
        The economy of the world is growing so as a affect, the wealth of individuial person is going high. So, in coming years more people would be rich as compare to present. So they will be more interested to buy cars as the cars are also mean of show off in the society. By having the car, person tries to impress others in the context of things which are meant for comfort. As person will be more economically stable, he will prefer to buy things of comfort which include cars as well.
         As the technology of making cars is improving day by day. So in coming years, because of technology advancement the cheaper way of producing might come in picture and that will surely decrease the cost of cars. As a result, in the future cars will in the buying range of more people as they can not buy car now due to lack of budget. Also because of technology advcancement, new models of cars will come in market. Those models will be more comfortable and would be more beautiful in looks. So new models might attract the more people as they will think that this model will solve the problem of transportation. 
         As the life style of people is becoming very fast with time. Now a days, person wants to do more and more work in short period of time. So he needs to reach at different places in order to for example attend important business meetings or presentations. By taking the public transport, he can reach at his distination but that will take more time and problem is that he is not having time. So he would surely prefer to have his own car. So there will be more cars in use than there are today. Also because of more consumption of the cars, the car industry would be booming, that will result in economic growth of the country. So the government will also enhance the sale of cars by allowing companies to set up new manufacturing units in the country and also by giving them some tax benefits. 
          Finally, I would stat that in twenty years there will be more cars in use than there are today. This statement is very much supported by facts which have been discussed above. All in coming years there would be more cars on the roads.
