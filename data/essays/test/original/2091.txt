Being successful in something has been a comman goal of human-being for centuries. Success has its criteria that should be possessed by any possible candidate. Some people has some certain kinds of personal chracteristics that make them successful people. I agree with the idea that successful people try new things and take risks to be able to see and reach what others cannot do. 
    First of all, being successful means having something in hand that others don't have. It can be a quality, a property, a skill etc. In order to have something that others don't have people are supposed to try things that were not tried before and they try to be the first. I mean if somebody follows the same way that others followed before he will arrive exactly the same location where others arrived. But instead of doing this if s/he takes the risk and decides to take another route, s/he might arrive there faster or s/he might arrive some new place that everything is much more better compared to other place. for instance. a business man cannot succeed in today's business world by using the traditional trade techniques. One who wants to be successful should come with a different idea and risky plan. Because all the others were tried before.  
    Secondly, people who are used to try new things are innovative people searching the ways to get higher. On the other hand, people who are doing the thing just how to do well are old-minded people and it's very difficult for an old mind to be successful in a new world. Even the sentence doing the thing that he knows well sounds strange. Because if somebody is not a risk taker and doesn't try new things how he might know that he is going to be much more successful in something else. By considering these I should say successful people are mostly from those of risk takers. 
    As a result, success is having or doing something that others doesn't have or cannot do at certain level that you do. I think that successful people are not afraid of taking new ideas into consoderation and applying them. They try.
