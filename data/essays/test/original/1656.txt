As the rapid development of society, competition among companies are becoming so pressing that the companies are trying their best to make more profit to survive. So advertisements, which are useful to sell products, attract more attention. Along with the advertisements, there is an increasing public concern about the real value of the products. Some people argue that the advertisements make products seem better than they really are. As far as I am concerned, I agree with this assertion.

Companies usually adopt psychological means to attract the customers and to make the customors feel the products are good for themselves. They carry out some researches and studies in the market and find out what the customors like, and then produce them. Also, to make their advertisements more appealing, companies usually hire some celebrities that are popular in the market and even respected by the customors to show in the advertisements. For example, companies hire famous people with good skins to tell customors that by buying their face-protecting products, people will become more beautiful just like the models in the advertisements. As we all know, everyone would like to be beautiful, affected by this desire, people seek to find something that could protect their faces and to make themselves more beautiful. So when people see some products shown in the advertisements which corresponds to their desire, they feel the products are what they want, which means that the products are made more better, at least seemingly, than what they really are by catering to people's needs. 

However, we should not lose our sight of the fact that advertisements just make the goods seem better, rather than actually better.The real value of the products is decided by the products themsevles, or more accurately, by how the companies make them. So to attact more customors, the companies should not focus all their attention on the advertisements, but on their products themselves and their services, which serve to the real quality of the products.

To sum up, advertisements do have a positive effect on the products, but the products' real value is not decided by the advertisements.
