Surely, most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are. But is not that the intension?

Advertisements are there to attract people and get their attention to a new product. If they were not exagerating they would just summarize the features of a product and everyone know what a washing powder, for example, is good for.

It is important that the product advertized has to appear to be something special compared to all the other products of the same type. How would you do that if they all look similar and have the same purpose? You can choose a specific feature of the product and say that in this feature it is better than all the other similar products. For example, an advertisement for a washing powder of brand X could say that it makes your clothes softer than any other brand's powder in addition to its power to clean and remove dirt.

But a product does not only need to appear special regarding competition in the same type of product. What about newer versions of an old product? Sometimes new products do not have a big improvement regarding the old products but in order to make people buy the new one instead of further using the old one, advertisements have to be exagerating.

Of course, that might not be the golden way to make people buy products but I must admit that it works with me and exagerated advertisement make me try something new and different and every now and then those convince me in their quality. 

People might complain that knowing that advertisements are overrating a product makes it hard to see which products are really the best. But you can figure that out by yourself. After trying the product you always have the choice to either stick with it because you like it or return to using your old or traditional product.
