In the middle of the last century it was an undiscussable fact, that everyone has to help with his special skills in his own community. 
Nowadays less and less people are going to help help their own communities. Some people agree with that development, others do not. Let us have a closer look to the advantages and disadvantages of helping in your own community.

A first advantage is, that you learn a lot about the people in your community, their special behaviour, their professions and their importance in town. That also means, that you are able to make friends or get important cantacts for your own business during the time you are helping.
You also get a psychological connection to your home town and you feel responsibity   for example,to keep yout town nice and clean.
Another good thing is, that you are informed about all the events which are in town. You can combine duty with pleasure when you help at special events in your home town.

The disadvantages are, that, if the connection is to strong to your town, due to giving too much energy in community events and problems,  you will perhaps not be able to leave your home town. Which makes it  more difficult for you to make a decent career.
If you never leave home town, you might stay narrow minded and you cannot enlarge your horizon. 

I disagree with the statement, that people do not help enough their communities.All the work that needs to be done is done by employers. In times with such a high unemployment rate, it is better to employ someone, than do the work vith volunteers.
 I think, nowadays it is more important to get a wide range of knowledge through a lot of different experiences from all over the world and not only from your own community. You cannot make these experiences, when you spend too much time with helping your own communitiy. I also think, that you learn the same what you would learn in your community, when you help organizations somewhere else. When you work in a foreign environment, you also have to show, that you are the best person for the job. Yoou will not get it due to relative connections or friends.
Another fact is, that the whole development leads us to globalisation. I believe that it is a waste of time to put our energy in small communitiy problems. We should see the WHOLE. When we support globalisation, small community problems will be solved by themselves.
