When someone wants to  teach, the proffessor wants  to give  students more advantage, so he want that they understand  the ideas and concepts these are the basis of a good knowledge.

Concepts many of times are easier of explain than the ideas. If you do not undertsand the idea you cannot understand the concepts or viceverse.

A Chemistry proffesor wants that the student understand the concept ot the three states of water solid liquid, gas. These concepts are very important because of wheter the student does not undestand this,  he is going to have big problems in his future. This features of water are easier to explain because students can see the liquid state in oceans, the solid state in iceberg, and gas state can feel when they bolied water. 

But sometimes, it is hardest undertand ideas. For example the idea that all materials have small units named atoms. This part of chemistry is difficult to teach, this is something that is not material, this is abstract idea due to the student cannot see the atoms. However if the student understand the atom, whith this knowledge is easier that he can understand why and how  the different chemical elements can combined such  as Na and Cl to form salt. 

Understanding the idea and concepts, people have a deepest knowledge and can figure out many thing only knowing the basis.  Because of that proffessor gives a major emphasis that the students understand the ideas and concepts.
