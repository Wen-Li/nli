First of all, we need to explain what an advertisement is. An advert is a manner to communicate about a product by using different types of medias to express what you want to tell about the product. When you create an advertisement you inform the people about your product, you show it and explain why it is better than the others. By doing all of these things you want to convince people and make them buy your product.
    
    I  agree with the statement because i think that an advert should give a product the best opportunities to be purchased , and in that way the advert should give only the good points and create a good atmosphere in order to make the people buy it.
    Firstly, an advertisement should highlight a product, by showing the good aspects of it [ and certainly not showing the bad sides]. It is made in a manner to bring people think that the product is the best.This is not  objective,so people only see the best sides and will sometimes forget the bad sides of the product and in that way see the product better than it really is.
    Secondly, an Advert creates a particular atmosphere around the product , this atmosphere should help the potential buyers to adhere to the image of the product and identify themselve to the product. If they adhere to this atmosphere they will think that they need to purchase the product, even if they don't need it all! In that sense the atmosphere makes the product better to the eyes of the buyer.
    Thirdly, I think that even if the product seems better than it really is due to the advert,an advert should never tell lies. Nowadays, people are getting more and more aware about the marketing techniques used to make people buy. In that way you should be very careful when making an advert on what particular aspect of the product you want to highlight and which atmosphere you choose. If you are too optimistic about your product, people can have information over the internet an that means that the more times goes on, the more the people have the impression that marketing people try to lie to them.

    So as a conclusion, I said that in lots of  advertisements, the products seem much better than they really are because of the techniques used to enlight the product.But it is important to contrast this statement with the fact that nowadays, people now how communication is working and in that way, advertisements should in my opinion become more objective ( that also depend of which product you are advertising about).
