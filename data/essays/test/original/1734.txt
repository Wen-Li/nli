The best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide rather than travel alone .I feel it is true because i would like to share one of my expereinces , when i went to chennai i was left all alone to go out with noone to tell me where to go .You have noone to guide you through the city ,you tend to get bored and without a companion and without a guide a person is definately getting himself in a funny and dumb situation.If you travel in groups you tend to  be more cheerful and sharing xperiences anmd talking happily .And if you  have a guide with you it would be more cheerful and enjoyable.The guide can help your way through the city and help your way out with the transportation etc.
                              One may feel that travelling alone will help him a  lot or it may be enjoyable but it is all wrong notion .The best way travel is in groups or with the person who knows the city  and is well acquantained with the town or so called city .
                                                                          I have another expereince this was when i went to mumbai,we were all in a group ,Ours was a group of 10 members .If you go out you enjoy the tour throughly and never have a dull moment in the tour .We had also taken a guide in the city who helped us in finding good hotels,good food,and good transporation .
                                                    A tour guide is a  person who will help you in all the physical amenties starting from the transport to the miscellenous activities .Also the group we are going through should be lively enough to have a fun time .Always a group led by a tour guide helps you in having a no problem tour .
