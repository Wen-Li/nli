In the world, there are successful people and unsuccessful people.  I  think that unsuccessful people is doing nothing, so it is not happened, change anything.  They to do as usual like already know things.  However, successful people is doing special things like to try new things but they take high dangerous risks.  I totally agree with that good successful people  try new things and take risks.
To try new things makes people excited because nobody knows that what happened is next.  For examople, when you try to eat new traditional food, aren't you excited?  Or when you travel foreign country, aren't you excited?  However, they does not know that the trasditional food is delicous or not, and what happened is at the foreign country.  Also, if a person is really excited, he effect to other people who will be excited too, and they will bet that they try to new things too.  
To try new things takes risks.  Nobody knows that the new thing is dangerous or safe becasue nobody has never tried that.  For example, a cake shop makes new cake and start to sell, and owner is worried about the cake is good cake for buyers.  In addition, the buyers do not know that the new cake is dalicious or not becasue it is a oroginal cake.  If the buyers try to eat the cake, they have to use money. It is risk beacsue if the cake is not tasty, the money is wested.  Nobody thinks that they doesn't care about that risks although the cake is not tasty,   However, pople who love cakes, try to new cake.  Also,I love cakes, and I always try to new cake becasue it is new.  If I eat same cake as usual, it not excited and sounds bored.  If I failed, I will decide to get a delicious cake next time.  
If people wants to become successful people, they should try new things and take risks.  And then, they should keep to try new things although they failed or something.  If they stop or to do same things, it not happed and change anything. To try new things makes something new one however; nobody knows that what happened is next.
