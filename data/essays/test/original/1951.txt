I strongly agree that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide. Some people may disagree this opinion but I regard this way to travel in a group led by a tour guide is more realistic and sensible than the others to travel alone.

  For example, when you plan to travel, you will search the new place where you have never been. You may gather the information about that place by the internet or by the books without the realistic experance. When I was young, I would like to travel alone. I found I could not really know the place that I visited because the information is second hand. In this case, I buttress the idea of the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide.

  Some of the people grewth less engage as the years passed and they need a professional tour guide to tackle the problem of the jounary. When I travel, I want to huddle up to my friends and talk about anything we interested. We can help each other and do not fear alone to tackle any problem or incident. 

  In my case, I have been in the other country to visit my friend. When I was there, I wanted to travel by meself but my friend did not agree my opinion. So did his family. We started a travel with a tour guide in a group. It was a fun and immense jounary and we had a lot of fun. Nonetheless, the incident came, I got a ailment. It's a local sick. When I was so bad that could not work and enjoyed the ambulatory of the lake, my friend found a medicine to cure me. I appriciated him and his family. When I leaved, I want to thanks for their assistance but they tought me one thing. 

  However, the best way to travel is in a group
