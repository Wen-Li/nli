Many people may agree with the statement that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide. However, I don't think so. In my view, I believe that the best way to travel is with your friends or family members without a tour guide.

To begin with, if one person travels with his friends without a tour guide, then he can choose where and when to visit according to what he really wants. In fact, when travelling in a group with a tour guide, the routine of the trip is always decided by the tour guide so that the travellers will be limited and lost freedom and rights to make decision in their travels.

Moreover,  one will feel more relaxed and free when he travels just with his friends or family without any strangers in the group or a tour guide. For example, last year when I was having a trip to Japan in a group led by a tour guide, I didn't feel perfect and free because most people of the group is strangers. Therefore, during this summer vacation, I travelled Korean just with my friends without a tour guide. This trip is totally different and wonderful.  Experience tells me that travel with friends without a guide can make me relaxed and relieve my pressures from the busy study.

Last but not least, it is also more economic and cost less if travelling without a tour guide. Facts infers us that  the expense of travelling in a group always cost a lot due to hiring a tour guide. For instance, a friend of mine has a trip to Shanghai in a group with a tour guide spent much more money than I travelled by myself. 

To sum up, I think that the best way to travel is with friends and family rather than in a group led by a tour guide. In my obersvation, it is more free, costs less and let travellers make tour decision by themselves.
