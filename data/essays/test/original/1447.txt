I believe the statement "Successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well" to be true for the following reasons.
    First of all, attempt to do new things can expand one's perception of things, and bring new idea to perform better at its task. For example, diesel engine powered train overtake the coal powered train for its better efficiency. Many stayed skeptical about the diesel as new energy carrier because it was new and human mind tend to stick to ones they are familiar with. Some companies suffered after domination of diesel take place, whereas ones that read the trends and took risks of going out of business suceeded and survived.
    Second of all, rate of the technology improvement and replacing the ones that becomes obsolete is not linear, but exponential. It means the world is continuously changing. In this fast changing world, to be able to be competetive, one has to step ahead of everyone else which requires taking one steps further than what is already out, that can be risky yet beneficial.
    Third of all, I, as a person who enjoys many form of arts, evaluate creativity highly as the primary goal of art. Human mind makes us feel comfortable to ones we are familiar with, but often boresome. However, different and new materials excites human brain which manipulates sense of happiness. Trying new, foreign material is though often risky in art world. Critics might see it as too different and not be satisfied. Without attempting something different, art would have not suceeded to spread, it might have died out as people seek for excitement. 
    To be successful, there are certain sacrifices that have to be made. Trying new things sometimes seems insane, and too risky. But as the history proves, it is better to take risks.
