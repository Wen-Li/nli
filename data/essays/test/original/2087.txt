     Recently, there are many tour companies. Each tour guid is very good and the quality become very high. If we have good choises, we can enjoy enogh. However, I disagree with the statement that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guids. The reasons why I desagree are it costs too much, it is not real enjoyment for me, and there is no free.
     First of all, a tour guid costs very expensive. Basicaly, if we use the tour company, we have to pay more for the company. However, I do not like that. If we have money to pay the company, we can use the money the other things. For example, we can eat more delicous food or we can buy more suivenires. I do not want to use money for empty things like company or tour or servise. It is not good way to use money.
     Second, it is not exciting because the trip already decides a plan where will we go and what will we do. It is a little boring for me. If we plan by ourselves, we can enjoy to decide where will we go, what will we do, and which hotels will we stay. I think it is really exciting to plan about that. If we use the guid, we do not have to do anything by ourselves, but it is just lazy. I want to organize by myself.
     Finally, the most important reason is free. If we ask guides, we can not move freely. If we go there and see various things, shops, or buildings, we may want to change our plan to go the places. Nobody knows the timing when our mind will change and I want to change my plan at that time. Therefore, I want freedom during the trip. 
     In conclusion, I do not think that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide because I have three reasons. For me, if I want to enjoy my travel really, I want to use the money by smart way, I want to make the trip by myself, and I want to have freedom during my trip. It is the best way to enjoy traveling  for me.
