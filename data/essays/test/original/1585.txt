My marketing professor at the university always told me that the main rule of the advertising is making promoted products more fashionable then they really are. I, therefore, belive that in the 90% of cases the advertisements make products useful and necessary even if they aren't, since the adversements always shows cute people use the promoted products and, most of all, because the message they give is able to persuade people that if they use the adversided product they can became cooler people.
First, one of the main advertising strategies is the use of famous actors to promote products. An advertising where a famous and gorgeous actor is involved makes automaticaly the promoted product desiderable since people start to belive that if they use the advertised product they will be as cool as the famous actor is.
For example in my coutry there are many U.S. actors that come in Italy in order to promote italian products, as, for instance Gorge Clooney that has been promoting the Martin, an alchoolic drink, since 2001. The conseguence is that many people belive that drinking martini is cool, since George cloney drinks it.
Second, there are no rules or regulations that impose to the advertisement makers to be honest with the public, no morality exists in the advertisement war. Therefore, doesn't matter if it is true, the message must be able to convince people to buy product. Few months ago, in my country a new advertisement started to circulete on TV, it regards a new car, the safest one in the world!. Two weeks ago an article on the main newspaper of my country informed us that, after some experiments, the factory stopped the production of the new car as it was unsafe. Nothing happened in respect of the advertisement, the only conseguence of the news was no more pictures around the cities of italy showing the "safest car in the world!"
Finally I belive that the main purpose of the advetisments is to tell the true but is persuade people to spent their money, therefore always products seems much better then they really are.
