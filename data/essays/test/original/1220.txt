I agree that the best way to travel to somewhere in the world is travelling with a tour guide. There are many advantages travelling with a tour guide.  A tour guide can summarize better the history, the culture and customs of a city or people. While travelling over one city they could also save you a lot of time and money . 

First, a diference from a book, you could get a better explanation of the history of a city from a tour guide. The guide book are in general short and with a brief description of a city, but a guide can explain you better the history, even you can ask him or her something that is not clear of a particular issue. 

Second a guide knows better the city customs. In general a guide is someone local or someone who is living there for a long time, so he or she knows very well the place. Guides also tell you myths and tales of the city dificult to get from books.  

Third guides are fun, interesting, and people who speak a lot. They know many people and they can share their experiences. 

Finally guides can advice you about many important topcis such as safety, place to eat, to stay,ect. Sometimes they can teach you how to save money. 

I remember my trip to Cape Town, South Africa. I couls sepak african, a language in this country, but a guide teach me some words useful to survive also, she gave me a lot of advice and wher to go and wher to buy and sleep. She also explain very weel about the apart dait, a social discriminitation, explain many thisn ababot Nelson Madela. 

The more funny and interesting trips that I ever had were allways with a tour guide so I definitelly could advice anyone who travel to new places to take tours leading by a guide.
