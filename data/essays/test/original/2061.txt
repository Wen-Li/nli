 I agree with that statement. The ozone layer is getting worse everyday and nobody is doing somthing important about it yet. The talk for solar power has been going around for so long now but still I don't see a difference in our ozone. Everyone knows that the main problem for the ozone layer being that way is because of air pollution. Air pollution mostly comes from automobiles and factories, especially chemical factoris, and to tell you the truth we haven't been doing a great job over the past years. If scientists found out an easier way for the people to use solar energy i would'nt even be writting this essay for you guys. Unfortunatly there isn't but that still dosen't mean i'm giving up hope. 
    So yes I believe there will be fewer cars in the future or in twenty years. Oil as a business has ruiend the world with greed, power, and selfishness. If our machines ran on solar power there would be no money envolved and in that case there will be no problem. People don't understand what kind of problems money brings to them, and when i say people i really mean the people who have alot of money and no problems and don't care about anything around them.
    I'm not saying that there will be no cars in twenty years, im just say that if solar power is a big success in years to come then it is true, there will be much fewer cars later then there are today. I'm guessing that in a good thirty to forty years the whole earth will consist of solar power, and i don't just mean cars i'm talking everything we use with patrol. So most likely I we all should go with this theory of mine.
