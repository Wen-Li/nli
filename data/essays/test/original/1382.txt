Sometimes young people nowadays do not give time to helping their communities because ours society do not learn to the young people to stay with the other.
Many yeards ago the family was very important in the young life of a boy, with all the norm and the responsability, but there was always a family to teach the trou and false of the life.
Today in the big city a young need to bild up him personality faster, when he is only a child, because the city have not time for him problem. 
Always there is not a meeting point, where the young can meet and do only the teenager.
The young people need more attencion, because ours society is more busy for many problem but nothing think to ours young people.
To contrast this phenomeno the young people take more distance from their communities.
For me is true that they have not time to take attencion to their communities, because there are many responsabilities and nothing who ask treir problem.
It is only a problem of organizzation, in my opinion, if a young people learn who can ask to the people, so he can take more time for them.
In my opinion there are two point of wiew, the young people who need more attencion to the people because are the future, and the other the people who think than the young people never can take time for them. If the two point of wiew stay in their corner, they can never resolve the problem. They need to spik abaut the proplem and take some decision for the common future.
Some possible soluction are the use of school time for learn to the young people who can help the other, or create a space in the community building for the young people, for speak to their problem.
In my opinion there is the soluction and only with the dialogue young and the other people can take a key to live together.
