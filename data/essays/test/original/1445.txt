I agree with the statement that it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts. Three reasons will be explained for this agreement.

Firstly, everything is changing at any time and any place. The facts that students learn at this time may be different after a certain time, or if the conditions are changed. A good example will be weighing an object. As we know, the mass of an object will not change, while the weight will be different at different places as the different effects of gravity. Assuming one weighs himself or herself in Egypt and Finland, the results can be surprised. If he or she knows the different effective factor of gravity, it will no longer be a surprise to "changing the weight so much at different places".

Moreover, the ideas and concepts are the basic principles that we can apply to many other systems or conditions. For instance, the copper-aluminum alloys with the same composition vary much from each other in their properties of hardness under different treatments, but the strengthen principle is the same. The hardness of one alloy can reach as high as 120 after annealing at 600K for 10 hours, which is taught by a teacher in the class. Then, what will be the situation if the temperature changes to 400K? obviously, it will not be 120. The student can only use the idea or concept of strengthen to solve this problem and get the right answer. 

Additionally, it is much easier for us to remember the knowledge by understanding their ideas and concepts than by just reciting the facts. As our brains can only stor limited contains, there will be too many things for us to remember. If we can tell how one thing works, we can also tell how other things work, which means we can remember a series of facts instead of one. 

For all these three reasons, I strongly recommand that every student need to understand the ideas and concepts that you learn from your professors or classmates or other resources, rather than just to repeat what you get.
