I completely agree with the fact that successful people try new things and take risks........... Once a person becomes succesful, a level of confidence develops in him. This self-confidence inspires him to go ahead and to try something innovative. The present success eliminates the fear of being failure in his innovation. I want to support my claim with one of the recent example happened in Indian Automobile Industry. 
    The name of TATA (a giant company in the field of automobile, service sector and metal industry in India) is well known. The credit of success gows to the CEO of the co. Mr. Ratan Tata. Being a successful person  in his field he thought to give a cheap but technically advance car to lower middle class people of India. He announced the price of car months back only $2500. Everybody in automobile industry amused him that it will not possible to launch a car in just $2500. He took it as a challange and stated working on his innovative idea with his selected team members. After one year of complete dedication, vision and self-confidence he finally launched the car named NANO. Whole world surprised to see the tecnical expertency and the cost of such a car. This this quite new and innovative thing can be done by a successful person only. A commonman struggling for his first success cannot think beyond his day to day doing well.
    Always the new things do not work. Sometime there is risk involved in innovation. Suppose the concept of the car, what Tata had created would not came true, then also the TATA company and Mr. Ratan Tata continued to survive. Only thing is that this risk can be taken by succesful person and they continue to take. 
    World is full of innovative things and materials. How they evolved? How they came into existance? At some or other point of time some person had taken risk to innovate quite new things and in my opinion they are successful persons. If at some stage people will satisfy with his achievement and stopped trying new things then inventions and development will stop. Example of "Thomas Alwa Edision" is with us. One after other inventions he made and did not stopped untill his body allowed him to work. If he had stopped after his first invention we would not getting the Electric bulb or gramophone today. If after discovery of "Photo-electric effect" Albert Einstein had stopped thinking on new ideas, the world of physics would not be heard about the "Theory of Relativity" even till today.
    These are only some examples from the lots all over wold, when a successful person tried new thing and he/she gave something new to this world.
