 Nowadays, some people may hold the opinion that" it is more important for students to learn facts" ,but others deem that "it is more important for student to understand ideas and fact" . As far as I am concerned I agree  that its more important for student to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts. There many subtle point that suppert my opinion.

    One reason for my inclination for this opinion is that the student can develobe his knowledg based on his own ideas and concepts. 

    Another reason for my peopensity for this opinion is that the student will be more flexable in the way he is thinking and this is very important for him to have an open mind and to be creative, so he can face deferent subjects with one strategy

    Third reason that i think i must give it a few words is that facts may be a result of understanding ideas and concepts. So, The student may reach fact based on his understandung the ideas and concepts.

    In a word, taking into account all these factors, we may reach to the conclusion that it is ipmortant for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts because of they can develop there own ideas, forthermore,  they can be flexable facing deferent type of supjects. also fact can be result of ideas and concepts.
