Some people agree that the travel  led by a tour guide is  more effective than self-palnned tour. However,I firmly believe that if you study yourselves a lot of information about the touring sites, you can enjoy a joyful trip, . Besides, if you travel with a guide, it can be harmful for your joy and he/she can intervene in your trip. 

First of all ,  travelling is the optimal  opporttunity  to think myself and  develop myself by learning a lot of things such as indepence. That is, if you can prepare for the trip sufficiently, you don't need a tour guide. For example, when I have traveled in europe last year, I had to prepare thoroughly and study a lage amount of the sites where I would visit. It was very impressive experience me because I can go through a lot of hardships such as a miss of road. If I had travel in a group led by guide,I could not learn a living knowledges and improve my indepence. 

In addition, if I can go om a trip with familiar friends without a guide, wh can enjoy whatever we want, It means  that tour guides can interrupt our liberty of the tour schedule. In my  experience, when  I was traveling in a Thiwan with my friends, I had to follow the guided schedule, It was very exhausted and I could nor enjoy my trip as weel as concontrate on any beautiful scenes since we have to move all over the sites planned by schedule. Therefore, my familiy came dome with a sickness after the trip. If it had not bene for the tour guide we can enjoy more leisurely and comfortably ,

Consequently, I sincerely believe that a group led by a tour guide cannot be a best way to travel. Not only people cannot have a opportunity to develop their indepence and their own time, but they can also interrupted their comfortable trip by a guide. Therefore, the best way to travel is studying  yourselves a lot of things about your touring areas and planning on your own. Then, it can be a more fruitful and comfortable trip.
