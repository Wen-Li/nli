I strongly aggree with the idea that successful people try new things and take risks instead of doing just what they have already know.

Success can not be gained just by repeating the same procedures that have been already known. For instance, scientistists would never find new techniques just by repeating the same procedures.The more one scientist try, the more he or she has the chance of finding new techniques or better treatments for diseases. Nobel Prize is also given to scientists who find a new method that contributes to human health.

Success of course is not limited with science or research, if a person just wants to be successful at kitchen, he or she should try new things, like creating his or her own meals.Otherwise, everyone can prepare the foods with known procedures, however to make a delicious, unknown meal, one should try new combinations of vegetables,new combinations of sousages and just should try to be creative.You may have the risk of obtaining a terrible meal however, without takig this risk, it is impossible to create your own kitchen.

If you want to define a common characteristic for all successful people, you will certainly see that these people tried new things, these people tried to be creative.Actually this is the only way of being successful, you may be doing your work well, you may be hardworking enough, however this doesn't contribute the real success. I strongly belive that real success is the one that contribute to humanity as a whole and so it is appreciated by all others.Like invention of electiricty which is certainly an important success and everyone knows how much risk Edison had taken to find it, and how different ways he tried to accomplish this. 
To sum up, a successful person is the one who has the ability of trying new things and the one who is brave enough to take responsibility of all possible outcomes of the risks.
