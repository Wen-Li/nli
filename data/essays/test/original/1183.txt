Yes. i completely agree with the statement and it is a fact that young people do not have enough time and support for their communities.There are lot of reasons for their avoidence.
Firstly,the work life of the people now a days,there has been a drastic change in the style of working compared to the older times.

For instance,the young people who are now working in the call centres in india are hardly able to find some time towards their social life.Since this people are work during the night times and get back from the work in day time and go to sleep.This is process of working in the working in the nights has been a major reason why this young people are not able to help their respective communities.

Secondly,most of the young people now a days are involved in various activities.Such as going  to the parties,movies and lot of activites that is keeping them away from their communities.The carefree attitude of the young people is one of the reason why there is not enough support is given to their communities.
Most of the young people now a days are very less worried  about their religions and all the ideals and principles taught by it.

Most the of the young people which also includes the students are also not able to find time to help their communities.It is not that they are being taught in the schools about the morals and values but the
way the teaching techniques have been modified and the assignments given to them by their respective schools,would keep them busy even on their weekends.

In earlier times people where were very much concerened about eachother and their lives.They use to extend all possible help to their communities that they could.But in modern day society and life had become so fast and things are changing so rapidly ,where, people would get a hardly get time for their social life and from where they would find out to help their communities.

I would like to conclude that it can be fairly understand by the above mentioned reasons,why,young people are getting time to help their communities.
