I disagrees that staement is the best way to travel is a group led by a tour guide for several reasons.

First of all, I think the best way to travel is alone. This way can go to want places in your mind for free. However the way to travel is a group led by a tour guide can not yourself to place for you mind.
If you want to go a see, but group travel plan does not include a see. You can not go a see. However alone travel can go to want many place without a plan of guide. 

Secondly, The alone travel can take more time better than the group travel. If you are without a tour guide, you would have more specific role of travel so you can get outside of night and a long period of trevel. You can walk in middle night or early morning. The situation in night or morning give you a special mood and condition.

Third, the way to travel is alone without a tourguide can meet a lot of people in local. You can talk to people and close them. You would be invest their home. Therefore you learn their culture and life. Maybe you would have relationship and make friends. So if you are a single,so lucky, you make couples.
