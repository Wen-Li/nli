 Why do people agree with students to understand than to learn fact?
If these students learn facts instead of to under stand the lectures in class, they will get bad grades and fail. For example when a student studies the word of the lecture by fact it wont help him or her with their tests.
    First students who are listenning to the lecture and understanding the concept they will be succesfull with their grade and make their parents proud. When a student really wants to make their parents proud of them they should study well and understand the notes that they wrote in class.
    On the other hand, if student just want to learn facts they will get lower grades than the students who under stand the idea of the subject. Students whom doo this instead of taking facts in stead of understanding they will be weak in their subjects, in their school subjects, and in the whole school year.
    To sum up what i have just said is that students should listen and at the same time to understand the concept of the subjects in school or in university.
