With the spread of new ways of communicating the media let us become like targets bombed by advertisements. With the increasing number of people that watch television, read newspapers or go into the internet making commercials became a real ( and well paid ) work. People that do this work often let us know that their product is useful, also if this is false.

There are lot of advertisement that let us think that changing our breackfast made of milk and cereals with one made of bread and nut paste will let become us happier for all the day. But they don't tell us that we may have problems with our diet because the content of fat in these product is higher than the normal. For example when I started eating nutella for my breackfast I took three kilos in two months : that wasn't writed in the label!

Another example of erroneus message provided by advertisement is the one that if we use product of beauty we will seem beautifuller than the sun. This is very common with the creams used by women, they use lots of these product convinced that they will seem 20 years old younger in few time. But a recent experiment made by an English laboratory demonstrated that a woman wich stopped to use these chemical and very expensive products for some month had the: she had to spend lot of money and lot of time is using these products with the only effect that her wallet now is thinner.

So, I can say that I completely agree with the statement, but I also believe that the work of producing advertisements is one of the worst in the word : they have to make us believe that the product they are selling is the best on the market also if this is not true ( and if they don't do this they get fired).
