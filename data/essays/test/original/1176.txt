People can go to the trip with a guide or go alone.  In my case I would like to travel with guide.  Becasue we can get lost and can not comunicate with other people if we travel to the forgine place.
     Most of all, we could get lost in the unfamiller place.  We can get lost easily without guide.  Thus we could not goes to the place that we planed before. For example lets say that a group of girds goes trip to the America. They planed to go to the statue of liberty.  But they had trouble getting a right bus.  They miss the right bus so they had to spend time and money for that.  And another problem was that they do not know way to back.  So, they had to spend whole day walking the streets.
     In addition we could have comunication problem with others without of the guide when we travel to the forgine contries.  Furthermore, since we have different costums and cultures, both us and natives could misunderstand. For example with comunication problems,  we can not even buy the thing. Buying a small drink of can would make us cost lot of energy.  The guide who is able to speek their language will help us processing some work such as buying stuff, hotel check in.  And hitting softly between friends is no big deal in Korea, but in Japen, police might get you because of your violence.  Guide can give advice to us what to do and warn to us the thing we should not to do.  
     To sum up I strongly support that it is better to travel with the guide, because we could get lost, and reduce comunication problems.
