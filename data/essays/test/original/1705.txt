In this modern world where business is given much importance , new and improvised items are been produced  to cater the needs of the mankind. And this is the advantage taken by most of the firms to draw attention of most of the customers to buy products and make their  sales growing. 
 The advertisments in marketing especially  to improve the purchases , would definetely opt for choosing some clever ideas of highlighting their products more when compared to the other sales.

For instance, the soap makin companies try to spend more money on the advertisements to show the composition of the soap saying that its been made of essential oils which are medicative and improve the skin beauty.

I srictly oppose to such kind of advertisements saying that watever its shown definetely wudn't be their outcome or result when used.

The major goal of any marketing company is to get more profits and this would be possible only by advertising their produts to a larger extent with lot of attraction to the customers .
Their major idea is to make the customers somehow get interested in their product.  

Similarly the discount offers are put up with lot of reduced costs which are the part of the commercial business. As various companies in a sountry would go for producing the same kid of product , ADVERTISEMENT has been the preference to many to gain the interests of  many customers at a time.

Similarly the usage of various shampoos . One company advertises saying that its product would be more usefull for the people with dandruff.Whereas the other states that its product is worth using because of the various natural herbs used in it.

Truly speaking none of the companies might have used such valuable items to prepare their products because the key ingredients used might be much costlier than the actualt shampoo.
So they try to high light their products to be the best. 

However , their idea is to get enough profits by gaining attention but not to really work for what they have publically put up regarding their products.

hence its worth saying that the' advertisements make products seem much better than what they really are'.
