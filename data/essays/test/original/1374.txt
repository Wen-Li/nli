Different people have different opinions about whether traveling in a group is better or not. In my opinion, traveling alone is better because I think the flexibility is one of the most important factors in travel, and we can remember the travel longer if we travel alone.

First, traveling alone gives you flexibility. When you travel in a group, you have to keep up with a schedule and keep the pace of the group. However, if you travel alone, you can plan your own schedule and go to every places where you want to go. When I traveled Europe, I was in a tour group. I had to move on the fixed schedule, and the tour guide forced me not to escape the group because of safety. I was very uncomfortable because I wanted to go to ordinary areas in the foreign countries, and watch their daily life. However, I had to visit only familier places due to the fixed schedule. If I can travel Europe again, I will not join a tour group because I want to visit whereever I want to travel without any interference.

Also, traveling alone provides us with longer-lasting memories. Traveling in a group gives you only passive knowledges. If you go on a trip with a tour guide, the tour guide always say what the artifacts means and why it is valuable historically during the travel. Nevertheless, when you come back home country, you will recognize that you can not remember some parts or even whole of the tour guide's explainations because you do not make any effort on the travel. In contrast to this case, if you prepare for the travel by only yourself, you should choose the artifacts or relics that you want to watch, and find the way to get to the destinations before you begin traveling. Of course, this preparation is hard due to lack of expertises, but you will not forget your efforts even in the future. Thus, I believe that longer-lasting memories can be gained only through such personal efforts.

Taking all those into consideration, I think that traveling alone is a better way in terms of flexibility and long-lasting memories.
