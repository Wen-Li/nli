The word advertisement can be considered as the key to the success and the enormous growth of many businessmen.Advertisement  is not only the best media publication but also the life of any brand name to prevail in the market.
                                                                                                   There are many ways of media advertising like television,news papers,magazines,radio and few more.
                                                                    A human eye sometimes gets cheated in identifying an object in reality which is at an optimum distance.In that case how can a product which is being compressed and altered by advanced technologies using the latest equipment be clear and accurate to a person who would just have a glance in a news paper or on the television set.
                                                            A product having multiple functions and complications cannot be properly explained to the viewer in one or two minute commercial advertisement.Hence the major qualities and advantages must be highlighted and telecasted or printed which will have only a half impact.
                                                                          For example lets take a latest version of a brand new car.The car would be shown in all best possible colors on the television screen. The shape and size will be telecasted in an elegant  manner  in a very pleasant atmosphere with attractive models around.The advertisement seems so real and outstanding, the viewer  would not even give a second thought in judging the vehicle.When the shoot is being done the video cameras used and the professionals make it an eye catcher.But the reality will be different as we know the color shape and the performace might not be the same.
                      At the same time one cannot  point out the advertising team"s point of view.The idea behind spending lots of money and effort in creating an advertisement is just to attract the customers to flow into the show room and make money.
                                                                                 If one desires to have the right product with him at the right price and not being betrayed with the demo's on the screen,the best possible way of advertising is by having a demonstration in front of the customer.In the case of the car may be a test drive oppurtunity to the customer will be a much better option.
           Here by we can conclude that a small time demo cannot really show everything about a product.They look much more attractive and better on the advertisement.Hence one must definetely touch and see the reality.
