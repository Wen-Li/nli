As the world changes and time becomes an ever-important resource, the value of such time increases as a consequence.
I believe that there is a shifting equilibrium point between the time one can dedicate to work, to himself and to others. Employment data shows that the marketplace is always more competitive. Young people, who typically lack professional experience, have a hard time entering and remaining in the job market. Obtaining a job position in line with one's personal education and commitment is essential in conducting a good life, so it remains a primary goal. The increasing level of competition means that reaching this goal requires more and more time.
The consequence of this increase in effort is the fact that the time left for oneself or for others (such as communities) is on a steady decline. I do not support the idea, though, that this time is "not enough" unless the (rather poor) general idea that it is "never enough" is given for granted.
As the value of personal free time increases, so does the value of such time when it is spent helping others, such as communities or anyone in need. If our grandparents, working 40 hours per week, used to do, say, 4 hours per week of community work, I believe that young people nowadays working 60 hours per week (in order to keep a good job) doing 2 hours per week of community work are actually doing even more than our grandparents used to!
I believe the original statement might be more reasonable if it was changed into something like this: young people nowadays do not have enough time to help their communities as it once was possible. The issue on whether this reduction in personal free time is socially  appropriate or acceptable is not an issue to be discussed in this essay, but I believe that it is the central point around which the underlying issue of the original statement revolves.
