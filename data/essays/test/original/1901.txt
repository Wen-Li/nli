Yes, I strongly agree with this statement. Most of the companies which aim for huge profits rely on the advertisements of their products. Advertisement is one of the means of media for promoting a product into the public. Inorder to withstand the tough market competition many companies try to display their products entirely different from the original. The ultimate goal of these companies is to attract the common man by alluring them with these type of fancy and false advertisements. 
                                    Advertisements in the previous years used to be simple and were only through news papers and TV commercials. But due to the increase in market and competition among companies, products are now advertised through large banners and hoards. They display the product in such a way that it draws the public attention. Though the product is not so effective and reliable, they are presented in a such a way that every customer gets tempted to buy them. I would like to cite one example that a close friend of mine experienced. He bought a new car by seeing an advertisement in the TV and also came to know about it by the large hoardings and pictures posted through out the city junctions. He was satisfied by seeing the configurations and other specifications mentioned and shown in the advertisement. Only after buying the car he came to know that everything that was shown was false and misleading. The car was found to be a little bit smaller and of less comfort than expected. Though he complained to the company regarding this everything went into vain. The reason for giving this example is never mislead or get away with the commercial advertisements. There is an old saying whose essence is that "Never believe a thing by seeing it from outside, trust only when you knew  it from inside". 
                                       This indicates the disadvantages of having advertisements. This can be avoided by buying a product only after you talked about it with your friends or people from the industry. Another means is to avoid this false tactic by the advetising companies. Government should impose severe regulations and charge penalty from companies for following these tactics. Advertisements should be meant only for presenting the actual product but  not the modifed one which misleads bthe public. Every company should keep this in mind and serve for the society.
