Transportations have been taking different forms since the apparition of man on earth,the mean that people use to move to different place have been modified by needs and technologies avalaible,In the next sentences I will argument the statement that cars in use will be fewer in twenty years than there are today, i will provide some examples of similar evolution in transportations.
Some objectifs facts let guess that cars in use will be fewer 
1-the developement of concurent type of transportation
As ships and plane made it optinnal to have a car,contrary to few decades ago were these means were not so develloped,some old transportations methods are now in great valor as horse transportation,bycycle and motor cycle
2-the cost of cars and the difficulties to repair them 
Makes that car becames too expensives and people tend to uses alternatives way of transportations
3-the predictable rarety of petrols
Most of cars are using petrols derivates,the permanent conflicts on petrol and the facts that petrol could be soon a rare goods may decidate engeneer and car maker to design new means of transportations
4-the pollution problems 
It is the main fact that will precipitate the disparition of thousands of cars,it is well prouved that cars are principal sources of pollution,by the co2 production and by the oil that they uses,this fact is very important and group of activist in nothern country are fighting to have laws that reduce cars circulation and they have plenty of methods that they use to discourage cars devellopement

In my view point cars uses have reached their culminant point and as the previous means of transportation in the history it will decline sooner,but the news mean of transportations will be probably based on public transportation rathers than personnal and train,plane ship even shuttle will be more considered.
