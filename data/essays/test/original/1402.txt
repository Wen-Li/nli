In its first periods advertisement was about introducing the product or giving the needed information on the product. With the competition in the business and the recently developed ways of communication and the information that scientists gathered on how the brain works and how to affect the brain; advertisement became the art of influencing the buyers. 

In 1930', the idea that the "need is created" has been introduced by Frankfurt school-a neo-marxist school in Germany-. It meant that not only the product was misrepresented (in a better way of course),  but altough people did not need that particular product, marketers made them believe that they needed to buy it. For these purposes, psychology and neuro-sciences is used to get to know people' buying habits. 

These days, marketers are writing books on how to deceive buyers, how to create an "image" of the product, so that the emotional reflections of the product will be similar to the emotional reflections of the buyers. In this context, there is no meaning of saying that advertisements show the products as they are just like that it is a fair observation. 

As an example, we can use important brands such as McDonalds or Coca-Cola Company. McDonalds empasises in their advertisements the healty food, the friendlyness in their restaurants and the delicous taste of their burgers. Taste is personal, but just a few years ago a documentary movie proved that their food was not healty, contrarily it was really noxious. Let's take Coica-Cola Company, their product is also noxious, but  they emphasise the feelings like liberty or freshness during their advertisemnets. This stress on feelings is the result of another thesis in neuro-science: it is believed that remidnng  feelings is important in order to draw attention to the product. 

This examles show that even recent developments in the science is used by the advertisers (marketers vagualy) in order to create a false concept about the product and to disguise it' negative sides.
