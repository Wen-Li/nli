To have broad knowledge about many academic subjects is amazing and people will apretheate your information.

To specialize on one subject in my opinion is better because you will go deep to the subject and if you work you will work in one satisfaying position as well as a satisfaying payment, But if you havce information about alot oif subjects you will only kno the basics of all the subjects, so when it comes to work you will not be excelant in your job because you will only know the basics of it.

specializationj in one subject will give you consentreation as well as fokising inm one way and one direction.

My opinion is to specialize in one subject put a goal in ur life and work hard as well as doing what ever it takes to acheave this goal of yours.
