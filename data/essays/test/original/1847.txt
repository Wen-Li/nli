In my opinion, advertisements should be used to explain which are the real product qualities. Nowadays advertisements are mainly used to "confuse" people that have to buy them, so they are not able to estabilish which product is really the best one, because they are blinded by a lot of advertisements that seem to indicate that the product which they are referred to is better than the others.
The question is: there is something true in those advertisements? How can we choose a product starting to his adverisements if we are not sure about their effective qualities? This is the point! We can't...We can only try it, and off course, we have to buy it.. 
There are a lot of examples, like products related to the fitness. In television, during a spot, somebody show something that could help us to loose kylos in few days. Is that true? Just try it, and it could happen that this isn' t a real and possible goal.
In my personal experience, I bought a flat television and the seller told me that there wasn't the possibility of dead pixels, in agree with the product advertisements. After few days, I find three dead pixels on my monitor.
I agree with that statement, it is true that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are. This is because nowadays there is the necessity to sell as many products as they are produced, but, in sellers opinion, the only way to do this is to manipulate the real product qualities using false advertisements. I don think this is a good thing..
It is a kind of trick that can be dangerous for people who belive in advertisements, and who buy something hoping that it can help them.
