In todays media the consumer is exposed to a lots of advertisement, of different kinds, like in television or newpapers. Usually advertisement is a way to communicate some kind of aspects of the product to a consumer. So the companies intension is clearly to sell something. This should be kept in mind mind when discussion the question.

In my opinion, a lots of companies are trying to make their products to look as good as possible, but they are not making this seem better that it actually is. Lets take an car advertisement for an example: On television a company shows their cars driving through a beautiful landscape with a happy familty. Of course this makes the car look good and adresses some feelings the consumer associates with these landscape. But it is not adding any features to the product it self, nor does it make the product seem better. It is presented in a nice way, and nothing more.

Since by law, companies are not allowed to promise more than their products can hold, they will have a hard time making the product look good. Like stated in the previous paragraph, the only legal way of doing so is, to make people associate some form of positiv emotions to it.

Another point about making products seem better that they are, is economically motivated. If a company makes customer buying a product which has less function than they promised. They are very likely to loose this customer for ever. Es specially if you are having a specific brandt, it is important to give customers what they expect. Let say a car company like AUDI tricks a customer into buying a car, by proposing features it doesn't have. On the next car, the customer buys, he'll for sure not buy a car of the same brandt again. Due to the high competition in this industry this is a very problematic issue, and thinking longterm, very foolish. Because, like recent studies have shown, such tricked customers, are communication their issues three time more than satisfied customers.

As shown, in the previous paragraphs, advertisements are not making products seem better than they actually are. It is rather a nice form of presenting facts of the product.
