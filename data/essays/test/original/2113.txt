People in the advertisement industry and in marketing claim that publicity is a means to correctly inform consumers about the quality of a product. But personally I believe that in fact advertisement twists the presentation so as to make a product seem better.

Advertisement is one of the means used in marketing, together with pricing, distribution, etc. The whole goal of marketing is to convince consumers to buy a product, so that a company makes revenues. As a consequence, advertisement tends to be partial in its description of a product, often highlighting just the positive qualities without mentioning the drawbacks.

For example, last month I gave a try to a new isolating glue for showers being advertised on the press. They were emphasizing its superior resistance to water and its ease of deployment. However, after the first use the remaining glue becomes very sticky and dries up very quickly if one does not close it carefully - something I realized only last week when I tried to use it, invain, for a second time!

Hiding the negative characteristics is not the only aspect in which advertisement alters our perception of a product. When shown in pictures or at television, the outlook of products is maximized through the sapient use of lighting, computer graphics, and is often accompanied by nice sound effects. All of these factors are aimed to increase the impact an object has on our imagination, so that our desire to possess it, i.e. to buy it, is stimulated.

The impact on imagination is  frequently augmented also by the coupling of feelings to the presentation of a product. I remember a very funny advertisement campaign made by Tenent's, the Scottish beer, on BBC a few years ago. There were two series of spots, one for male consumers, and one for females. On the first, a man was sitting on a couch enjoying a soccer match, while a woman was standing aside holding a tray with a glass of Tenent's. The man was tasting the beer and then would press a button to open a panel beneath the woman to make her fall below..."Not fresh enough", he was saying. Fun, sense of domination, and sense of perfectness all appeal to men.

On the women's version, the woman was standing in front of a fridge at the end of a long corridor waving a glass of beer and saying "T is ready!" (a smart play on words for a British audience, by the way). The man would run to the beer, only to crash against an invisible barrier at the entrance of the room... and the woman would enjoy the beer. Here, the sense of a smart revenge was the main point to appeal the ladies.

Both versions were appealing to the sense of enjoyment, and not purely to the product "beer", thus making it appear for what it communicates rather than for what it is.
