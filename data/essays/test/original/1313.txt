The discussion of most advertisements make products seem much better than tey really are is a controversial one. One one hand, some says that advertising is an illusion of showing products much better than they really are. On the other hand, some says that advertising is art of introducing a product or service and make consumers aware of it. I disagree with the statement given because the regulations on the advertising, penalties that companies paid, and consumers getting more involved and demanding make this argument invalid in today's media environment.

It is not pretty unfair to say that advertisements make products seem much better than they really are. We have seen many example in the past, however the current regulations do not let such misguidance of advertisings. When we look at the advertising world, we see that it developes without any regulations and regulations were made usually after a problem occured. When the consumers complain about that problem, then the industry needs to solve it via regulations in order to protect the industry and consumers. It is not allowed to give false information in current regulations and the penalty is pretty heavy.

You may argue that regulations may not enough. However, we see big companies paying astronomical penalties when they make false claims. Therefore, they have internal mechanism to control every single advertising they show to the consumers. In this way, they do not only protect themselves from huge penalties, they also protect their reputaions.

I think another important reason why this statement can not be true is about the consumers gett'ng more involved, demanding, and smart about their chices. In todays competitive environment, consumers have the power of changing their choices very easily. Therefore, if a company makes an advertising that makes its product much better than it is, consumers simply do not buy it next time as their expectations can not be met. So, companies know this very well and they do not make such advertisements. 

As a conclusion, I believe that the argument of most adverisements make products seem much more better than they really are 's not true. In media history, we may see soem examples supporting this argument. However, the current regulations, penalties that companies should pay in such cases, and today's more demanding and powerfull consumers make this argument invalid.
