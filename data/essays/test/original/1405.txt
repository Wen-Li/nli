In order to assess the statement above it is necessary to clarify the purpose of advertisements in general and the way that the advertised products are presented as being 'better'.

First, the general purpose of advertisements is to enhance sales by making the product recognizable and differenciatable from others. A way that this goal can be reached is by claiming that the product is 'better' than all other comparable products on the market - or even better than itself actually is.

Second, the term 'better' allows many interpretations: A product can be better by being cheaper, more convenient, of more use for health and so on. The question is why these exaggerations are used on purpose when it comes to advertisements.

Take the example of BP. While the abbreviation formerly stood for "British Petrolium" it now stands for "Beyond Petrolium". With this change in corporate language BP tries to get rid of the rather bad reputation that oil companies have in the age of environmental awareness. For this reason, BP claims to be a 'green company' in its advertisements while in fact the percentage of alternative energy within the company's portfolio adds up to only 3 percent. This exceeds by large the amount of damage that is done by BP's classical oil business.  

Another example is the trend in nutrition, when for instance Nestle uses extra ingredients in order to enhance a product's effects on e.g. the immune system. While it's been proven that they have some effects, it's also true that these products usually contain lots of sugar - therefore undermining the positive effects the added ingredients promise.

So, why do BP or Nestle try to enhance their reputation by appearing to contribute more to the environment or health than they  actually do? Because the buyers or investors can usually be convinced easily by advertisements. Only few people actually make the effort to check the statement made in the advertisements by looking into the balance sheets or the nutrition facts.

Therefore, in the eye of most buyers or investors, advertisements make the product (or company) appear in a much better light than they are worth it. Since this contributes to the enhancement in sales and in turn fits the general purpose of advertisements, I have to agree with the given statement that most advertisements make produkts seem better than they are.
