There is a general debate over students' learning methods throughout the whole society, especially among those parents and educational experts.one important question under debate is that whether the study of ideas and concepts is more important than facts. from my perspectvie , it may be a little too hasty to draw an extreme conclusion without regarding the different stage the learning process contains.

The first truth , we have admitted ,is the fact that ideas and concepts is much more obstract that facts. so at the beginning of study , learning from facts might be a better choice. besides , learning fact will stimulate students' interests easily, which will paly a far-reaching role in their further study.to illustrate the above point , i would take my study about physical as an persuasive example. at the first few classes , our teacher are forever demonstrating some intersting experiments to us. we just find  lessons are so attractive that our interests are acumulated day by day. we would even be allowed  to do some of experiments by ourselves.from some magical phenomena and vivid experiences , we began to dig out  some knowledge by ourselves. gradually , these  discovers accumulate to a big one ,the knowledge we should learn in this class.

on the other hand, along with the development of our knowledge based on obsevering fact, we need to summarize the ideas and concepts involved in these knowledge, which will help us to have a solid foundation of what we've  learned.in fact , concepts indeed  produce more important effects on the construction of our knowledge system. still take physical as an example, the majority of people will not to use an experimental facts to build his knowledge. instead , we tend to use some unique  concept such as ideal state to explain our knowledge, which is more efficient and of extremely importance.

in retrospect , it is reasonable to confirm that we should apply different learning methods to different situations .only in this way can we learn happier and more efficient.
