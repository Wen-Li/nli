As we live in the era of information, the chance of learning things became easy. Because of this, we have to choose between just memorizing or to understand from the basic,
In my opinion, it's more important for studnets to understand basic ideas and concepts than just listening and memorizing the facts. Because we can forget easily, and can't develop facts in the reality, 

    First, I think learning is not just memorizing facts. Because facts are results came from a variety of experiments and tests. So it's really important for students to redo that process once again to learn the basic ways how the facts were find out. As a result, they can truly understand and  memorize more effectively. In my opionion, I failed my test because I just learned and memorized facts. So I tried to understand how the facts were find out, Then I could memorize more effectively and get higher grades,

    Second, if we just learn the facts, we can't actually use them in the society. For example, if we just learn the fact,"two plus two is four" we can't develop anymore like multiplication or divination. which means we can't use the facts effectively. In my experience, when I was in the elementry, I was only memorizing the answers from the book. I always got perfect. But when I get tests given by the school I go, I always gets 0%. So I thought that I need to understand ideas and concepts by learning how to solve the problems that was given throughout the tests. 

    In conclusion, I think that understanding ideas is the most important than just learning and memorizing basic facts. If we have learning minds to understand ideas not just memorizing facts, we will able to memorize more effectively and can develop the basic facts to make it more logical and complicated.
