 Advertisements usually look for ways to sell their products without concerning if what the are using is a true fact or not.  In real life, it is true that people often use any mechanism they can find just to get what they want, without usually caring about the consecuences behind their actions. I do agree with the statement that says that advertisments make products seem much better than they really are.     When it comes to selling a product, advertisers look for the best ways to make that product look.  Even if the product has a defect on it, they always try to find something good of it.  Obviously, adverstisers will not accept that a product has a defect on it, because people will not buy it, so they will always sell their products as the best thing people have created.  For example,  commercials present the product that is trying to sell as to be better than other products.  People watching the commercials always think the best about the product presented and buys it without having in mind that what is said in the commercial may not be 100% true.  It has happened that after the person buys the product, he realizes it is not "the best thing created" but unfortunetely, they can not do anything about it.  Practically, advertisers tricked the person into buying a fake product.  Although advertisers make products seem much better than they really are, however, if advertisers do not present their products this way, people will not buy them, and advertisers will not acheive success in their work.  
    In these days, there exits a lot of competition among workers from similar areas.  People have to make radical decision and do whatever they can to gain success.  Anyone who does not make an effort in his work, will not be prosperous in it.  What needs to be done, needs to be done, but it should be done right: finding the best way without leaving behind one's moral values.  The best way to do this is making a product right, if a product comes with a defect, is best if it is not selled.  Advertisers should present their products in a good way so that people buy them.  They should look for the best things in it, without lying and making them seem better than they really are.
