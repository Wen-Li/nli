Nowadays, with even more people deciding to study instead of working, it is essential to know how your studies should look like. Is it better to gain a broad knowledge of various subjects or should one specialize in one specific subject?

In my opinion, it depends on your status of your studies. If you are still an undergraduate student I would agree with the statement above. At the beginning you should get a broad impression of the possibilities the university offers. You should  take as much classes, from very different subjects, as you can to find out which is the best for you. This broadens your experience, basic knowledge and makes you maybe more mature.
I am studying business in the 4th semester and during my basic studies I can choose between 14 subjects, like accounting, data processing or marketing. You have to pass all of them to further your studies. 

But after finishing your basic studies you reach the point to focus on one specific subject out of these 14. Now I do not agree any longer with the statement above because you have to deepen your knowledge of your favourite single subject. This makes sense because this is the point when you have t decide about your future profession. It is quite obvious that if you want to work in a bank you should choose a subject like accounting or finance instead of marketing or tourism. You certainly will not benefit from your knowledge about the clima in Italy or how to improve your sales of trousers. Therfore you will need your specific knowledge. 

To sum up, there are probably some examples that do not support my opinion, but I am sure that a mixture between the knowledge of many subjects and specializing in one subject is the best way to be prepared for your career after university.
