Youth is the time of life when a person is full of strength, when he/she stops being a child who needs care and could start being a more active member of the community he's living in. The more the community evolves and growths, the more personal involvement and participation are required by young people. At the same time, as much as the community has to provide the young person with good living conditions, it's the duty and the responsibility of this person to contribute towards the well-being of the social group itself. What about nowadays relationship between the young and their communities? Do the young contribute enough of their time  and energy to helping the community they belong to?

Since I was sixteen, I started getting involves in all kind of activities carried out in my small social context, small as I live in quite a tiny town. At the beginning, it was just I and a group of friends, fond of looking for something able to help us use wisely our spare time: I mean having fun, but pursueing at the same time good aims. With that idea in mind, we decided to set up a formal non-governmental organization, quite poor of financial resources to tell the truth, but full of ambitious purposes. Since then, there's no one single week we miss the meeting with old people or children with disabilities; nor do we avoid organizing parties all the citizens can take part in. We understood we just need to do all this: it's a must, not to say the only way that give us a hand to feel better, to be motivated, happy and satisfied with our own lives.

After I started the University studies, I got in touch with students coming from bigger cities than mine, and I got the chance to talk to them on the social activities carried out in their communities. I was quite surprised while discovering also the biggest cities (as Milan or Pavia) were made up of many parts, which acted as if they were small town in the larger city. I was interested to know each of these parts had a sort of its own non-governmental organizations that carried out tasks similar to mine.

Overall, I can say not only young people are involved in the life of the social groups they were born in, but the number of people committed to towards the goodness of those groups is definitely increasing, more and more, as well as spreading.
