There is no doubt that I support the idea that peaple will succeed when they try new things, rather than only taking advantage of their current knowledge. I point out  two reasons below.
 First of all, if peaple do not challenge new things, they cannnot widen their knowledge. I would like to say that successful peaple try new things by using their current knowledge and obtain new knowledge and experiences. In my experience, I was in charge of a new project, which nobody in our company did. Honestly, I thought that the project is not my current business directly. But undertaking the new project, I obtained many knowledge and connections between the project members,who I had not talked with. Even after I finished the project, the knowledge and the coneection I have gotten  from the experience is very useful for my current role.  
 Second of oll, people not trying to challenge new things may tend to narrow their perspective, the way of thinking.  In my office, there is a professonal person who is in charge of same task for about ten years. He can do undertake only his task perfectlly. But it is the problem. He in confident to his skill of his task and tend to be obstacle. And then he does not want to change his way, or improve it. It means that progress would stop in that area, that would lead to declining. 
 So I definitelly mention that people should try to do something new to make a progress of their skill. And That lead to big successes.
