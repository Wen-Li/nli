I agree with the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide.
Because, it is help to create think and leadership. Even though it's not successful for tirp, it can be given good experience, and also this way can give a social influence such as a relationship.  Person to person's relationship isn't simple. But if you are plan that which place is prefered , which route is high advanced for travel places before begin to trip. So, leader should think about these thingsm, meanwhile, he can develop more than before being plan. 
A leader also have to concern about how much spend for having a food, transportation fee, using facilities rate and so on. Therefore the leader is able to have a evaluate and calculate capability. 
Besides during the travel, they can meet a risk situation such as a car accident or someone got a sick . In this case, also a leader should have a obligation, should effort that how to overcome this situation. These things can grow leader's responsebility.
There are several reasons, that's why i always try to lead for travel plan and everythings.
