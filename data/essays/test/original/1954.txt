To tell my opinion, I agree. When you see a commercial in the television, you will be able to feel that some advertisements require a function that the product don't have. For example, when I was young, I watched many advertisements about dolls since I'm a girl. One of the advertisement which was very impressive for me, was an advertisement about mimi (The doll's name). The advertisement was saying that mimi's house is departed into seven rooms. One of the room was a bathroom and they said mimi can take shower or a bath in the bathroom. And they showed us an image describing the water falling out from the sink. I was so young at that age I believed all of the words they're saying and told my mum to buy it for me. It was very expensive dollhouse. But I was very happy until I noticed that the sink was not a real sink. I mean, the water don't falls out of the sink! The advertisement was a stinking lie!
 I think most advertisements requires some kind of a lie to make their product look better. I can't blame them for making such an advertisement. They just want to sell their product as many as possible. And that means that some of the faults are ours.  Most of us likes to use much better, high qualitied product rather than cheap products if we can afford the prize. We don't realize some cheap products are as good as the expensive one.  Kind of like this : if we tell the people , "I saw a very beautiful blue house." they don' t understand about the house. But if we say, "I saw a million dollar house." most of the people understands it.  The point of what I'm saying is that, most advertisements make products seem much better than they are because we want expensive, high quallitied products if we're not very poor. So, the makers must make the product look fantastic and high quallitied by putting some lies in the advertisement. We should know that the prize is not it. We should judge the product by our clever brains and eyes. Forget about the prize.  Just think if you can afford the prize, and buy the most high quallified product you can buy with your wage. That way, it'll make the makers to provide high quallified, average prize in the market.
