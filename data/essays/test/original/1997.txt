In my opinion, ideas and concepts do not exist on their own, but are based on fundamental facts that we all agree on. However, if one must choose between them, I believe that understanding ideaa and concepts is more important than merely remember facts.
    First of all, merely learning facts rarely gives you general ideas or concepts, but if you have a good understanding of ideas and concepts, then facts naturally follow in many cases. For example, in an introductory economics class, if a professor just tells students that the "goverment regulation of maximum prices on certain goods results in a shortage of and the subsequent illegal trading of those goods," students may try to understand it intuitively, or more likely, just try to memorize it. However, if studenst are first taught to understand the concept of supply and demand, the specific fact naturally follows, together with numerous other pieces of information. By drawing a simple graph of supply versus demand, students realize that fixing the maximum price of a good means that more demand occurs than supply at a particular price, and therefore a shortage would naturally follow.
    Understanding concepts and ideas is also generally more beneficial than learning facts, because facts, especially complicated ones, are easily forgotten. However, properly understood ideas and concepts are rarely forgotten. Actually, forgotten facts may even be reconstructed from those ideas and concepts. Typical examples arise in mathematics: Many students forget exact equations after some time has passed, but the ideas used in deriving those equations are not so easilly forgotten-the ideas that help us form logical thoughts and inductions. By carefully learning those ideas and concepts by heart and examining them, some students may even be able to reconstruct those equations. In this regard, students will have a better chance of remembering what they have learned over the long term, if they concentrate more on learning how various theories and equations are formed.
    In summary, understanding ideas and concepts is preferred over learning facts, in two respects. It removes the necessity to memorize mere facts, because facts naturally follow from a good understanding. It is also an inarguably efficient and effective way of learning, because ideas and concepts remain with us longer than just facts.
