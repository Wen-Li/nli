     Everybody has different preferences on whether traveling in a group escorted by a tour guide or traveling by themselves.  However, I disagree with the opinion that traveling in a group is the best way to travel.  I have two specific reasons to support my position.  By traveling by myself instead of being led by a tour guide, it'll be much more convenient to move back and forth and and I don't have to waste my time for other people.
     Firstly, when I travel by myself instead of being participated in a tour group, it'll be much more casual and convenient to move somewhere because I can creat my own travel schedule so I can go wherever and whenever I want to go.  
     Secondly, by traveling by myself, I don't have to wait for the other people's coming so I can save my time and also I can get plenty of extra time.  Thus, I can use my extra time for making my future plan and thinking of my life etc.
     Although people have different opinions on this given issue, I would prefer to travel by myself instead of traveling in a group by a tour guide.  This is because it will be more convenient and I don't have to waste my time.  These are the reason I disagree with the given statement.
