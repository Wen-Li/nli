   Publicity has a huge impact on humanity, yet it works for many companies that work on ti and create it. A lot of things are offered thoughout advertisements and sometimes they are not what they seem. Those "ads" often manipulate millions of people and persuade them into spending money into generally, useless stuff.
  Most products, such as "weight-loss pills" or a "multi-functional-frying-life makeover-pan", are really expensive and their "ads" often show effects that may not be real or the functions that, later on, may vary or fail. So it is somehow unfair and scaming for the recievers, or the ones that get and absorb the advertisement.
   Maybe those pills have side effects, and as the ad does not mention them, someone can be severely affected or sick by just consuming them. Or maybe the innovating pan doesn't expose the risks or warnings on the reciept, and someone decides to leave it, or to exposed to innapropiate heat -because they forgot or something- and that thing expotes... what happens then] The advertisors will NOT respond for what happens to you nor will they give your money back. So that is why the published products can result very risky or dangerous without us knowing about it. 
   If someone likes to consume the products as much as the "ads" then that person will be probably satisfied with the results -if the product actually works-. If not, then that someone would probably like to think about what he\she actually needs, instead of throwing money away for a long time -if payed with credit- or suffering possible harming consequences.
  Advertisements simply do their job, because for me, it all depends on the level of cosumism we may have. So I believe that most of those companies should not sell and offer all of those lousy things that may be broke in a couple of weeks after-purchase, or that cost a lot but have technically low quality results. Nothing is what it seems and neither is something that we don't know and just get because we want to. So lets not face the risk, neither waste our money or time.
