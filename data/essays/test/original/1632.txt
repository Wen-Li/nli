I disagree with the statements as the advertisments make the products seem much better than they really are. because their is number of reason to support my opinion these are the following.
  
 first the main aim of the advertisements(advs) to acknowledge the consumer regarding the particular products. As the sole aim to produce an item or the product is to earn the revenue from that, for this purpose the product should be sale and for this the consumer will be aware thus the advs will be done.
 
 Second their is the norms or law or guidlines  that should be followed when the process of manufacturing was going on. So the quality will be depends upon the norms made by the regularity authorities not by the particular manufacturer although their is the minimum limits to check the qualities and hence all the product from the different manufacture should have that charcteristics as written in the norms.
 
 Third the purpose of the advs is to accelerate the sale of the product and compete with the same products produce by the different manufacturer, for this reason the advs mainly done as to show how superior their products w.r.t. another.

 Fourth the advs sometimes shows the effect of the product after using the same to stimulate the consumer but all the consumer may not get the same effect, it does'nt mean that the products having the inferior qualities. for example it may be possible that the products does'nt suit your skin in case of skin preparation while shows a good effect on the others.

 In all I say that the advertisements  is the mode of communication between the manufacturer and the consumer, It is neccessary for the company to sustain or compete with the market contenders. So it is not meant for the make products seem much better than they realy are.
