I am not agree at all with the statement! Only a person who had never visited big cities such as Milan or Rome -staying simply in Italy for the example- could say these things!
In twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today?! Is crazy..and what solutions will be suggested? What radical changes will take place?
Maybe to travel in the space or at least in the sky..I don't think so at all i'm afraid. For absurd, the only way to don't see a growth in the number of cars of our cities is to impose extremely hard taxes for the owners of vehicles,but i really hope that the governement won't take this decision in the future! 
I am a positive person and i think that we are in a period of wellness in almost every fields of life! Every year,more and more people will be able to buy a car if they haven't before or to change their own buying a new one.
Moreover, many other strategical markets will be avaiable and the number of places where sell cars will be increase not decrease!
The example of Cina i'm sure that is a clear one; the most popolous state in the world is forgetting bycicles in order to travel by car and to get the change of a new and powerful economic boom.
