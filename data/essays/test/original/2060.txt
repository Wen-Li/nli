In the 20 th centuary. advertisements drive the consumers selection. All the international company believe that good advertisement mean good sales. So they try to prepare efficient and exiting advertisements for the consumers. Most of the company use the effects and also famous person for excellent advertisement. Briefly they use all the ways to show products much better than they really are. Before 10 years the customer select the products after the advertisement and most of them dont change their first product. So thats why the advertisements were most important way for the companies.

But todays all of the world know the advertisements lies. The customer dont select the products according to the advertisements. So in this point companies advertise not only products but also companies and plants of the firms. Because today most of the consumer select the products according to the companies name. Today all of us know the danone, phlip morris, kraft, coca cola...etc.
So this technique is also wrong for the selection to buy something.

For example, I dont want to wacth any advertisement but sometimes I am waiting the advertisement. Because company use the ferrari in the advertisement. And when I buy gas I am going to the SHELL because I think that ferrari never use bad oil so this means that shells oil is the best , it is more appropriate my car. Actually shells' oil is not good than BP and also oil is more expensive in the shell but they use the ferrari in the advertisement. But last month I used the BPs oil that incraese my car performance and I reduced the my monthly oil cost. So i agree that mot adevertisements make products seem much better than they really are.
