Abundant things in our lives are worth analyzing and judging.When it comes to whether has a tour guide is the best way to travel in a group.Some maintain that it is rational while others advocate that the reverse is true.Adittedly, there can be some notable truths in both arguments.Yet my experience accounts my preference that it will be better if having a tour guide in a group.Now I will list some points to support my preference.
First of all,one strong argument is that it will be very safe if having a tour guide.When we have a tour to go to a place,it maybe unfamiliar with this place.Having a tour guide can tell us where is danger to travel,however it can make us de safety and prevent dangerous things to happen.
Beside,it can be reasonable to say that we can learn a lot of interesting things from a tour guide.Be a tour guide,he must be well-known about this place,so he can introduce many historical or amazing things about that place.So we can know some knowledges from the tour guide. 
What is more,there is a good evident that having a tour guide can make me friends with the tour guide.For example,I travelled Tokyo in the last summer vocation,my parents and friends did not accompany with me.I made friends with the tour guide,he told many things about Tokyo,I was very happy during the vocation.So that was why I think having a tour guide is a good way. 
Taking all the factors into consideration,I think it is the best way in the group led by a tour guide.Of course,Carl Marx teaches us to take a dialectic view,it will have some good aspects touring alone,such as more cheaper.It can prove there are merits in both attitudes.Well,depending on my personal ideas and experiences,I think it can be better to have a tour guide rather than travel alone.
