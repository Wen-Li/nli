There are too many advertisements that show the product or service in a better way rather than it's when you are going to use it.
If you are going to buy something and the reason is a specific skill that an advertisement  shows about that product ,with a strong probability you'll be not satisfay after the purchase, and you would like to be refund of your money.
When you are looking a spot you always have to think if the product/service that is show will be able to attend your aspectation and before  buying something, when is possible, you have to try it in.
In my opinion we can solve this problem, and it's not difficoult, with a strong regolamentation that fix what a company can show during an advertisemant and expecially that fix the admitted differences between what is show and the real use of the object/service.
This is the way to figure out  a problem taht exist since the advertisements has been created and that cause not real axpetation expecially in young people.
We have too many spot on the Tv, Radio, Newspaper if we don't want reduce the amount of this we have increase the quality of what everyday we see, listen or read and this, for sure, will increase the imagine of a company becuse what did you see is exactly the same of what did you buy or what you are going to buy.
