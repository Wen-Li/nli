There is a controversy wheher students agree that it is more significant for them to understand ideas and concepts that it is for them to learn facts. The majority of students agree the idea. They think that understanding ideas and concepts will make them understand better in the text. But  opposit people think that learning facts is more important. And they claim that if they learning a lot of the facts can make them know a lot of details in the text, Also it can make them easier confer the ideas when they know the facts. In my opinion,  i agree the both two students ' ideas. I think we can not separat the idea above.
Firsty, i think that if we only know the ideas and the concepts, we will be nervous and confusing in many question. For instance, we learn computers, the teachers will tell us that the keyboard is using to input the imformation to computer. Just imagine, if we only know the ideas above, can we use the computer quickly or effieciently? The answer may be impossible. So the importance of the facts and detains can not be deniable.
secondly,  the importance of the concept is also exsitance in many field. Many people will say that the detains and facts can  confer the ideas and concept. In many places, it may not work. So we must try our best to learn the concepts. As the old saying"  concept is the soul of  text!" we know that there are no people can live without the soul. From this, we can totally know that the ideas and concepts in the text are very very significant.
Finally, we can not deny that the combination of  concept and facts can work efficiently and quickly to solve academic problem. Consequently, i totaly hold the opinon that the combination of the two things which is mentioned above.
