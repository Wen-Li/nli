I absouletly agree with this statement, as its discussed over and over , but fortinally no body listen to.  Most  or all the advertisers seems better or much better than they really are, for example , for food they make the sandiwish bigger or looks taster. For toys, they make they make the toy as it is the best toy ever and it 'll make your  child happy for the rest of his life. And for furnture , they will draw an image and makes you believe that if you did not buy this furnutre your home will be very sad and can not be lived in.

Adivertisments main aim is profit, which means money,  they do all of these advertisment on the televsion, radio, newspapers, magazins, bus stops and even on the streets, taxi's car roof and on the bus just to let you buy there product. 
They let you like the product as you live happy with it , as they brian wash you , alought may I add the way they attract children, with toys and children food for example biscuts , chipts exl.

Many of you looked throught the newspaper and saw a tasty sandwish and decided you going to buy it. And many of you seprized buy its size or its look .  !

I ask the government to STOP that brian washing or atleast control it by making or giving the real picture or the real image of the product cause at it seems that not body like to be lied to or acually no body likes to be roubbed.
May I add that lieing in the advertisment is forbedden in every reliogin and its not a good thing to do to atract customers or clints.

In the end I would like to ask the advertisers one question, is every product you put advertise is on your home, or your firge,, why not ?
