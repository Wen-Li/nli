I really agree with this statement. Nowadays young people are mostly tended to care about themselves. The development of the technology has a critical role for that.
  Teenagers are mostly spend time by playing video games and watching tv and they are isolated when they spend time on these things. Because of that they lose their social abilities. Therefor they do not have feelings like helping their communities. They mostly live in their isolated world and think about their problems. 
  Another big reason for that is the competition atmosphere in all areas. For example university acceptance exams in Turkey : Every student tries to do better than other students. And meanwhile they don't care about other people. Another good example would be the jobs. Everybody is trying to get in a higher position at work. Young people are so ambitious that they can do everything to get a better position. They don't wish anything good for others.
  Of course there are always exceptions. There are some people, who are being happy and satisfied when they help their communities. But i do not get to know people like that very often. 
  Another simple daily-life example can be seen in public transportation vehicles. It is an ethical rule that you should give your seat to an older man/woman if he/she can not finds a seat to sit. But most of the young people pretend to being asleep when they see elderly people or they pretend as if they didn't see them. Even once my friend pretended to be a foreigner when an old man asked, if he could sit on my friend's seat. And my friend did as if he was not understanding him. Shame on him..
  I hope we try to teach the new generation that they should help and respect their communities. This is a big problem for the future. We live on the world together. We share the world. We should try to help each other. I think young people would see their mistakes if they taste the satisfaction they get, when you help others.
