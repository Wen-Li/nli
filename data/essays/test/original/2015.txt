Now-a-days advertisements have become, intentionally or not, a main part of public life. Even if one is aware of it, advertisements follow us all the time and to any location. They want to give us an impression that the product that is advertised absolutely needed in one's life and that one particular company has the right and best product for one. Undestanding this mechanism, I believe that most advertisement make products seem much better than they really are.

One key point is that advertisements report only about positive sides of products. Of course, this is supposed to be the usage of an  adevertisement in the common opinion. However, having seen many advertisements of products in the same category, in which one company claims advantages of its product while another company degrades it pointing out some disadvantages, one gets the feeling that those products cannot be such good as one or another company claims.

Another aspect is the lacking obejectivity in advertisements. Mostly, they have not undergone an independent test. So, what consumers gets told is quite subjective.

In conclusion, I am convinced that the real performance of products is issue of advertisements but praising advantages of them. I think, defining some test benches for products which are published also in advertisements and avoding exaggerations would help people get trust in advertisements.
