I totally agree with the statement that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are. 
That is because advertisement has a unique goal: to sell the products it is showing. 

In a very competitive world, with hundreds of similar products it is not enough to say that your product is good. So, advertisers has to show their products as indipensable. The strategies for doing this is to present products with a lot of things and persons that do not have a direct connection with them. For instance, in the case or beer: the beer is presented with beautiful women drinking it, with peaceful beaches, very amusing meetings, etc. When the truth is that beer has a lot of calories, that make you fat, and that you can perfectly drink a beer alone at home watching tv. 

Another noticeable example are cars. Car's advertisements show us non traffic highways, where you can use a modern engine and reach high levels of speed. Well, you can, sometimes, drive in a large highway, but most of the time you will be in the city, going out from work, finding a crowded way to home. Even with the most excellent and expensive car you can't avoid this daily stress. 

Maybe, the most logic proof that products are presented much better than they are is cigarrettes. In cigarrttes 's advertisement, you watch great natural landscapes, such as a blue seas or vast mountains. Also, you appreciatte healthy people talking around and laughing. Nothing is far away from truth, tobacco produced breathing diseases such as lung cancer, vocal chrords burning, etc. If advertisment woud show is the truth, we would be seeing yellow people confined to hospitald with all kinds of instruments to help the breathing.

In conclusion, in advertisement products look much better than they are because of competition beteween similar products. Companies achieve this by connecting their products with very attractive people and situations.
