Everyone dreams to be successful, but only few people can make this dream come true. Those who could face their fears, worked to reach their dreams and learnt from their mistakes.Therefore they deserve to be an example for children, young people and  adults

Successful people don't stop learning and taking the risks. They always try new methods and things  because they believe that they can produce effectively useful things for their societies.

Without the scientists' experiments we wouldn't developed. They are examples of successful people who benefited the humanity in many ways such as medicine,new inventions and many useful things. They always keep searching for methods to develop our lives and they have many achievements in this fields.

scientists are not the only example of successful people because any one can succeed in his/her own field and by his/her own way if s/he worked to reach his/ her goal.

I hope to be one of those successful people and  leave a big effect in people's life. I will start  planning from now to become a famous scientist or inventor. I wish I'll be able to discover new treatments for many killing diseases that no one find any treatments for them untill now.I will also write my own books and share my experience with anyone who dare to dream and make his/her dream come true.
