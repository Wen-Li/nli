We live in a time where values change or even get lost. The young generation is more focused on entertainment and other selfish wishes. Therefore it would not be unusual that young people do not give enough time to help their communities. But indeed, this is not the case. We just believe this because we do not realize how many yought attempt to help their community. Certainly, there are young people who are not interested in helping their community as well, but those youghts are exceptions. Now I am going to explain why we have the feeling that young people are not social enough.
In fact, many people do not like that the common values change in their society, me too. Most of the elder people think that the young generation causes these changes. Thus it is absolutely understandable that the young population is associated with the new values, which accure instead of the common values. 
In fact the new generations get more individual. They even are supposed to get individual. The problem is thaht many people do not know what getting individual accuretly means. In fac, it does not mean that everybody thinks selfish. Getting individual means that everybody has to choose his or her own way of life. And that is where the misunderstanding starts. 
Many elder people get more distant to the youth and thus do not see that new values mostly refer to the way of life but not to the relation between an individual and the society. Indeed, a person can like heavy metal and be social in the same time. The relationship between an individual person and the community does depend on the socialisation, but the way of life depends on education and on the decision the young person takes.
Therefore it can not be said that the youth generally does not help the society, but it varies from person to person.
