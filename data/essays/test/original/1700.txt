I agree with this statement because we all should know some of the academic subjects even if it is a little knowing.
From there we can be a broad-minded person with a knowing of differents type academics(from mathematics through history).
In my case, i don t like at all sciences but i am always looking for scientific magazines about the new technologies whose coming out or look at he surveys about differents diseases whose inceasing or decreasing each year. It helps me to get inform of what is going on around me,how it is evoluating.
I n general i am a diverse person, i mean that i don t have a specific subject that i like most but in contrary i am trying the best that i can to learnn a lot a things, because everything is interesting.That s why maybe i am still undecided in major for the university because i am split with the communication field and the acing program but i also wants to study spanish and italian and i want to have a knowledge in the american history which i have never studied.As you can see i am in a dilemma.But it don t restrain me at all to study through books or through people by traveling.
 
I n my opinion specializing in one specific subject is like withdrawing oneself. It is not interesting to have a talk with a person who is always talking of the same topic isnt it? In fact to specialize in only one subject means to me that the person is confining himself in some area and might to get any acquaintance with other person.

Finally to  have broad knowledge means also to have more inteligence and guetting more knowledge helps me to talk to different type of person.I can debate about a burning issue because i have inform myself of the actualties.
In fact knowing a lot of things is really enriching for me and i can fulfill in life.
