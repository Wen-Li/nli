In my country , the number of cars progress and many kinds appear each year, for this reason, I dont think that in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today.

In my opinion , i think that a car is one of the amazing main of transport, because it very useful and important 


Many persons prefer using cars than other main of transport because the car is more confortable and if its modern it will be more safe


Personnaly , i would like to see more cars in twenty years with different models, because i am a fun of cars, i spend more time on drawing cars, in addition , i begun driving a car when i was 12 years old.

 To conclude, i think that the number of cars will be more improved in next years because they are chip and more facility of paiment are allowed
