With the development of Chinese Economy and the exploitations of more and more natural and historical sites,it has become an irriversible trend for people to traval across the country.Traditional travelling only involves group actions led by a tour guide,while in recent years it is more and more popular to travel by oneself.From my perspective,I regard it a best way to travel by my own rather than being led by a tour guide,since I have experience concerning both methods of travelling,I have summerized the advantages of travelling by my own as follows.

First of all,travelling by my own rather than being led by a tour guide makes the tour more flexible and convinient.Guide in some cases, did nothing  but confined my freedom.When I went to Yellow Mountain led by a guide in a travel group, I was eager to spend a night at the summit of one peak since it was said that the sunrise view was so magnificent that anyone who visited Yellow Mountain should charish the hope of witnessing it.However, the guide simply told me that we couldn't make it because the schedule was tight and we had to leave Yellow Mountain that evening for Qiandao Lake.I was too disappointed to say anything in that case.By contrast,when I travelled alone in Chendu,the capital city of Sichuan Province,China.I could just enjoy the lovely and delicious snacks  anytime and anyplace as I liked ,which made it a fairly memorable tour.

Apart from making the trip more convinient and flexible,travalling alone could also lights up the whole trip,turning it from a long and arduous journey to an thrilling adventure and insight into a specific culture.By forming my own travelling team,recruiting my acquntances who shared the same passion with me,we can design the routine by our own to visit some distant places where ordinary tourists' groups barely go to.Imaging travelling to the jungle and shaking hands with the tribe members,will a guide grant this sort of interesting experience?

The last but not the least,travelling without a guide is also cheaper.The money could be well-spent on articles and better accommodations.

From above it is apparent to draw the conclusion that travelling alone is much more superior to travelling with a guide.Ready to join me to go on DIY trip?Come on!
