Joanne Smith, who is thirteen years old in Winfield, Kansas, is a star in her town because of her astounding intelligence. She received a countless number of award from many state competition like spelling bee, junior invetion festival, and so on. According to her mother, Heather Smith, her daughter went to school and learn based on understanding the ideas and concocepts in science, math, and even Language arts. I agree with the idea that it is more essential for students to comprehend ideas and concepts of the fields that they are learning because it helps them correct misunderstanding problems and apply to other subjects.
     First of all, understanding ideas and concepts helps students prevent mistakes. To be specific, if students understand simple ideas and concepts of mathematic, they will not repeatedly make mistakes. One of the reasons why they get incorrect answer is that they only try to solve the given problems rather than understanding them. To illustrate, when I took geometry in my 9th grade year, it was hard for me to understand square root because I did not know the meaning of the symbol at all. I just guessed how it was working by looking at what my friends' doing. However, everytime I try to solve the problems that are related to square root myself, I alwasy got it wrong. After continuous direction from my teacher, I was able to understand the concept of square root and never repeat the same mistake again.
    Moreover, if students fully comprehend ideas and concepts of certain fields, they are able to apply the ideas to other subject. Since all fields are carefully related to each other, it is crucial to understand what people are learning. Knowing one idea can be meant that they possibly know millions of ideas. For example, if you know the idea of graph, it can be used in many fields such as business, biology, and even music. To elaborate, in business industry, graph is used to research consumers' preference in current market. In biology, it is used to compare one experiment to another. Also it is used to analyze the opinions of audiences in musical field which helps them pick songs to bring in more people.
    Just learning facts does not improve, it maintains. Therefore I believe that it is extremely important for students to understand concepts and idea because it corrects mistakes and applies to other fields.
