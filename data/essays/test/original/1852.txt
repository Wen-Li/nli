 The world we live in is constantly changing, and everyone in it is changing at the same time. The prducts that we are offered have to totally satisfy our needs and wants. This along with globalization has created a lot of competition in most of the markets. Therefore companies have to relay on advertisements in order to acquire more customers. A lot of times they put more effort on advertisment campaigns than on the real product; therefore, this creates that the product we consume is not what we expected. 
    Most of the comsumers expect a lot from certain products because of the way they advertise it, and at the moment they received the product they will be very dissapointed. Big companies such as Mcdonalds do this. They focuse more on the image of being a happy place for all the children, and having hambuergers that hey appear to be really tasty, but they actually sell food that is unhealthy and does not taste good. A good example of this will be the BigMac, this hamburger is very advertised as being huge and tasty, but when you buy it, you will see that is not that big and it does not taste that good. Other companies such as nike, where they advertise their shoes as the best running shoes on the market, and there are actually other brands that produce more lasting shoes than they do. The problem when companies focuse more on advertising their product than actually offer a high quality product, is that when their customers consume their product and realize that it is no good, they will not consume it again. Therefore; this lack of offering a good product will cause them the loss of their clients. In a near future they will be forced to run out of business because they will not have anyone to sell their product to. 
    Adverstisement can be a great tool in order to acquire a lot of customers, but the person using it should be carefull when doing so. The key is not to sell a lot, but to sell constantly. When adverstising a product they should offer exactly what they are advertising, becasue if they do not do that, their customers will be highly dissapointed and they will lose them in a short period of time.
