One way of learning is to understand ideas and concepts that is to learn the basic ideas and concepts that are derived from the various facts. The other way of learning is to learn facts and it is learning the facts that make up the various ideas and concepts. Among these ways of learning, I believe that learning ideas and concepts should be learned with priority.
     First of all, understanding ideas and concepts make it easier to learn facts afterwards. Ideas and concepts are derived from the similarities between various facts. Therefore, learning those basic ideas and concepts will be a lot helpful when learning new facts. For example, when I was preparing for my science test, I was trying to memorize all the chemical terms as a whole and it was really difficult. Then, my sister saw me struggling with those terms and she let me know the ideas beyond those terms and it became much easier for me to memorize. Likewise, learning fundamental ideas and concepts would be helpful when learning facts.
     Next, learning facts only does not have any value. Although we learn a lot of facts, those facts cannot be utilized as facts. In turn, to be utilized and improved, understanding the ideas and concepts beyond the facts is much more important. New techniques or new theories are based on the ideas and concepts not just the acuumulation of facts. For example, if Newton could not find the concepts beyound the falling of apples, it would be nothing. Learning that apples fall is nothing, finding the concepts of gravities from that facts is important and it's the concept that is utilized afterwards. 
     For the follwing reasons, I believe understanding ideas and concepts is far more important than learning just facts. Through learning ideas and concepts, it would be easier to learn facts. Also, it is the ideas and concepts that matters not just hundreds of facts. Therefore I strongly agree with the statement that it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts that it is for them to learn facts.
