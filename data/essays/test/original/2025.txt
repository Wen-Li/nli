In substantial number of  people mentioned that successful people try new thing and take risks instead of only doing what they already know how to do well. But i strong disagree that successful people try new things and take risks. Because someone who is accustomed to their job can upgrage and anyone who is trying new things has lots of possibilites to fail. 

    First of all, it is very important to improve the things are already knew. Because if you keep doing your job, you could be a best in your field. It is often say that in my conuntry there is a famous quote, that is "once you dig only on spot. do it until you find water fountain". which indicates that the importance of advancing. For example, one my dad's close friends called YOON, he started the study about computers when it just introduced, He make an effort on computer, Now he is an well-known person in his field.

    Moreover, if you trying to do newthings, there are numerous percentages of failing. Because,sometimes trying new things means you began the things without specific information. For instance, i have a friend who quit his job and started Bar Be Que restaurant, his original job was teacher, but he quit teaching in the school, and began to a restaurant with his own money. When he starts the restaurant, he even does not know about what is going on the restaurant. finally his restaurant closed and my friends got much money to pay. 

    In conclusion, it is not true that successful people try newthings instead of doing what they knew. As i said above, if you keep doing about what you used to do you can improve the things you used to do also when you try newtings you might loose not only your money but also social relationships.
