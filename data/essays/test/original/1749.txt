Not just in case of students, ideas are a good thing to consider, however the facts is what give us the true knowledge about things.
 
Like the idea of global warming, many perfessors and scientests say that the increas of CO2 levels and green house gasses are causing what seems to be the rise in temprature of the climate. 
But when you look at the facts, the temprature of the climate has been rising for several years now wither the CO2 levels and green houes gasses have been increasing or not.

So, if you ask the question wither it's important just learn ideasand concepts, I think the answer should be "No, you should understand the facts before you learn anything else".
