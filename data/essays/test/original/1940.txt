The issue at hand is wheather or not advertisements make products seem better than they really are. This issue is important because advertisments have great influence on the consumer. I agree with the statement because I think that advertisement make promisses that the products can't fullfill.

The first reason why I think my choice is right is that especially young people don't realize how they are influenced. For example a ten year old boy or girls are not able to recognize that the products in the commercial seem much better than they really are. They see only really fantastic and cute things and want to bay this stuff right know. But when they have for example the toy they saw in the commercial children are often unhappy because the toy is smaller or broke up really fast. So I think kids need parents who understand what advertisement do to products. 
Another reason why I believe that advertisement make products better than they are is that food seemt often better in the advertisement or commercial than they are. I tried a lot of food which looked delicious but when I bay it or taste it it wasn't really good. For this reason I think that people need a lot of competence to be not influenced by advertisements. 
The last reason why I think that advertisements make products look better than they are is my use of cosmetics in the past, influenced by advertisements. A lot of cosmetics, especially make up seemed much better than they really are. So for example women in the commercial looking absolutely fantastic, have great eyes, lips and skin. But the products don't fullfill what people expect when they bay this stuff.

In conclusion, this are the reasons why I think that the statement above is truth.
