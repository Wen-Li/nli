Should young people give enough time to helping their communities. Nowdays, more and more people needs to be helped. People should spend more time to helping their communities by two main reasons. (1) bulit up good relationship with other people. (2) gain more experience and knowology.(3) Young people would have free time. I will surport those reasons in the following.
    First, there are a lot of people were being alone by not to talk with other people. For example, people were on the street were not say "hi" to  other people. No one cand adop the fact that the better relationship you get the more friends you get. Would people spend more time with orhter people and they would forming more relationship with everybody. The relationship will help you a lot on every thing not only on the bussiness but also could help on the problem. 
    Second, the friends your meet were different. Some of people were good on communicate whith other people because they know how to talk flowly and knowologable. The knowology that you can't get from the book, the friend would give to you.The other were have other profactional subject. There are many chance give to you to learn and you could be better and better. People could learn every thing from their relationship.
    Third. the young people should have a lots of free time, because they don't have to work all day. They get out of school in the afternoon. The young people should have free time only less they have other excauses.
    Finally,does the young people give enough time to helping their friends.  I would prefer to helping my communities becasue I could meet a lot friends and I could get the thing that by my friends would help me a lot. I am still young and I have a lot of time right now. If I getting older, do I still have enough time to hepe my communities. The young people nowadays should give enough time to helping their communities.
