I strongly agree and recommend the statement that it is significant for the students to recognize basic concepts and ideas than to learn brutal facts. Accordingly it is found that concept is important more than the facts, because the students have to first grasp the meaning of the basis and better learning step by step. 

If a kid in a neighbor of yours has a vast knowledge of univeral system and you give him a task of how to make the universal system different from what he already knows, he will be relutant to do so. Because it is hard to break someone's knowledge, facts. that has already proven true and letting him to go beyond the facts and seek for imagination. If facts are important, it is only important when they have to take examinations to enter a certain school. 

However, it is misleading since it is rarely associating with the student's life. If a student has a great imagination toward everything when he was young, he will have positive minds and he will get to design a better world. If there are facts that the students learn, the students will not try to give a defect to the truth since they will feel no obligation toward of eliminating the truth.

Sometimes our world, can be imrpoved directly not only by the facts and how it works, but risks of ideas of what will occur according to what we deed. Usually, the facts tell the students of blocking their dreams and developing himself or herself. It reduces the chance of the child of ability to perform a certain action. 

With concepts, the student knows how to organize but the concepts does not eradicate the thingkings of a student but requires a further thought of the student. By learning facts a student can be known to the world and can be known for the best person. On the other hand, we can simply interpret this person as a person who has good memorizing skills.

With ideas, it is more valued since it is not emulated from someonelse, it is from his or her own identification of thingking. Ideas give confidence to the students that there are infinte possibilites of doing a particular activity. 

As a conclusion, to summarize my opinion, I repeat that the better ideas the better to be suitable to be socialized. If the facts are first than the ideas or concepts to a child, it is inept for a child to be globalized or socialized. As a result to grasp the ideas and concepts are more essential than to value the facts.
