 Within the past decade, I have had the privilage of being able to travel to a wide variety of places.  Some of my travels have been in a group with a tour guide, while others have been just my family and I.  The decission rest solely on the purpose of the trip and, of course, on what you expect to take with you from the experience. 
    I have found that when traveling in a group with a tour guide, one is constrained by a specific schedule already planned out and by the speed the group is willing to move.  Although this might be a little anoying and exhausting at times, it is suitable if one is looking forward to being enriched by the information the tour guide priovides from the points of interest.  Usually, the tour guide is vastly learned in the different cultures, languages and customs of the places one is to visit.  This will defenitly be an advantage, not just for the learnig aspects of it, but because it will enable the group to comunicate much more acurately in a foreing country. 
    Yet, if the reason for travel is just visiting a place to experience it as the days go by, then having a tour guide would not make much sense.  But, I have found that combining both ways of traveling can be as gratifying.  This could be done in a cruise ship.  In my honeymoon, I whent to different countries in the mediteranean including Italy, Spain, France, and Greece.  In the cruise, there are several choices to explore these countries which include different guided tours to points of interest or just getting off the ship and exploring what the country has to give.  My wife and I decided that we would go on tours in the countries which we had not already visited and get off the ship and explore in the ones we already knew our way around.  In some cases, after the tours were over, we still had time to roam around the foreing cities and villages.  So, this way, we got to experience the best of both worlds.  
    The ideal way to travel is by having in mind what one is looking for in a specific trip and then decide if having a tour is worth it or not.
