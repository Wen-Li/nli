I agree with the following statement that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are.Now a days with increasing industrialisation and the growth of the market economy there is a cut throat competition among the industries as to which industry sells most of its products.So, in order to increase the marketing of their products large scale as well as small scale firms are using advertisement campaigns.These industires often hire the well known television stars and actors to launch their product.and the one that can hire the most reputed actor wins the race and its marketing increases manyfold.But in reality these advertisements overrate the product than they actually are and hence cheat the consumers.

People also prefer to buy those products that are campaigned by the big actors because these campaigns develop a sort of relationship between the product and the consumer.A small firm cannot hire a renowned advertising company to launch their products so even if they are producing much better quality than the large firms are producing , marketing of their products remains low.
Advertisement companies aim at developing a sort of relationship with the consumers.For example, if they are advertising for a newly engineered car that looks very attractive, they try to attract the younger generation through their campaign and often hire a younger actor to do their campaign.As a result younger generation is grealtly influenced by the advertisement and is tempted to buy the product even if the product is not very well engineered on grounds of strength and other capabilities such as mileage etc. hence they make the product appear much better than they really are.

Hence, consumers are often mistaken of the type of the product they should choose and hence they often make mistake while making choices.Moreover, the number of industries are increasing day by day and are coming up with their more recent technologies and products which serves to worsen the situation further.Hence,in my opinion this problem of being falsified by the flamboyant advertisements can be reduced only through the awareness of consumers.By giving more importance to the qualities of the product than on the advertisement a consumer can make an effective choice between the various products.
