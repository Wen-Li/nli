 Are most of the people living nowadays successful? Are they struggling to successed? People, nowadays, are help not only themselves but also other people they, actually, do not know. Therefore, successful people usually try new things and take a risk. To my mind, people, whom are successful should try to do new things even though sometimes it is a risk. Thus, I agree with the statement above. 
    Successful people will feel bored sometimes if they continued as the same routine they do daily, why? With trying new things he or she might get an advantage by doing it. What are those advantage? First, intelleignce students, for instance, will always study the same way they usually do; however, if they change the way they study, they will, for sure, an advantage for this change. For example, I talked once with a smart student and asked him, "Do you study the same way all the time?" he replied, "No! I usually change my studying style for enetertainment." I asked, "Is studying have an entertainment?" he answered, "Yes, because without enetertainement you will not study will. In other wards, changing the studying style helps you concentrate on your study." For that reason, we may say that having a risk in studying gives people an advantages.
    Second, having a risk in the stock market, which is very serious. If a person always profit money from the stock market that means having a risk once will not affect him or her. For instance, I was talking with a bank manager once, and I asked him, "About people, whom have a lot of money in their accounts? And the money they use for the stock market?" he answered, "Those people are having a high thinking; in other wards, they think about which stock are they going to buy; even though they have a lot of money." I asked, "But do not they have some risk with their money?" he replied, "Yes they do. We have once a man had a risk and bought stocks with all his money; after that, he got an advantage by doubling the amount of money he have.
    Finally, businessmen always do the same thing daily. If businessmen change the way they speak or deal with people by having his employee as a friend of him. This could be dangerous because he might give them some of the company secrets. But they could help him by not only new ideas, but new projects. Therefore, businessmen could get an advantage from his employees.
    People most of the time successed in things they usually do, but in things they do not usually do they think they will fail. Without risk in people life they will not learn new things. To sum up, people have to have risk in their life to go for the better.
