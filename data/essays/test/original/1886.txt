If a person is travelling to a certain country around the world. The person can be led by a group of a tour guide. As this can be a benefital or unuseful way.
The benefical veiw, is the opportunity to meet new people and exchanging knowledge and intrests. By having a tour guide to lead the way that he or she takes you to the places that are worth to seek it can be a historical or modern area. The person would be handling the pressure of making difficult descions because it relys on one person which is the tour guide. He or she will be handling and planning the trip for the day. And the person main conern is enjoying their time in that country.
The unuseful idea, which is not coopertating with the group or with the tour guide having arguments and disagreements. The other fact, would be disliking the tour guide that the person feels that the tour guide is not planning the tour correctly. Having a group which means that the lost of time needed to make sure that each person is on the bus or that maybe meeting on a particular area, waiting for all the memeber in the groups to be there on time. Some people prefare travelling with the member of a family, friends or by themselves. It is because it enjoybe moments to be with somebody your know and relate to. Travelling without a group and a tour guide which means nobody is planning the day and by just planning thier day as they move along. 
I usually travell by a memebr of a family because i feel much comfortuble. Some people who feels that travelling with a group and a tour guide it can be sutable also. From my point of view, travelling either way it is up to the person to decide.
