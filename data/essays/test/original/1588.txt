I would realy love if it was true. But unfortunatly, i don't think that in twenty years of time people will actualy give up on their cars and find a better way for travelling. It just can't happen, because of the way things are now.And by experience, i believe that things just don't change that fast. Except maybe if there was a major invention for travelling...but i don't see it coming. Let me explain to you why I think the number of cars won't decrease, but more likely, it will increase.

Cars have been invented in the arly XXth century. It's been a major invention at that time. Everybody wanted to travel without getting tired and just let this machine do the hard part. Well, things haven't changed at all. A car is fast, easy to drive, and it allows many travels that we couldn't do without it.Our society became addicted to the car, almost everybody must have one, for  the social life life as much as for the working life,it is required. Some people even have a few cars now,one for going around,and one for their job! I find it crazy, what's the use of that?what's the point?
The numbers of cars in the world hasn't stopped increasing over the last century, why should it change now?

The reason why cars will still be there,poluting our atmosphere, making the walls go dark,and increasing the greenhouse effects in twenty years is just because people don't care! We are a very individualist society, everybody think for themself and don't care about what's happening around them. Only their own happiness counts, and they don't think about the consequences of their acts. Our planet is burning underneath our feet, people see it, fell it, talk about it, but they don't do anything to get things to change. They always think that someone else will do it for them...but it isn't the case.

So, that's why,for all these reasons, i think there will still be more cars, as there are more people.As long as people find it usefull and in spite of the danger it represents for them and their community.People should start acting for the future, but  i don't see any change.
