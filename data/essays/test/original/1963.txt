       From primary school to highschool pupils have to work on many  different subjects such as Mathematics, Biology, litterature. But when those pupils become students, they generally have to specialize in one or several subjects. 
Thus, it seems to me that knowing lots of things about  lots of subjects is necessary to obtain a good generall knowledge and to chose what to study at university.


    First,   When somebody goes to college, he has to think about what his professional future will look like and about what it would be better for him to study.

On the one hand, I tend to think that to concentrate on one subject is not enough to acquire a good competence in the working market but on the other hand it seems hard to have an extremely good knowledge of many subjects. 
For instance, if one wants to be a manager and if he just studies management he will not know why he has this fuction and why he needs to do this.he will not have a good knowledge of his job. Furthermore, though one is a very good manager and does not have a good knowledge of foreign language it will be very hard for him to adapt in business.
Moreover, nowadays more thant few decades ago the master of few subjects is required to obtain a good chance to have a job. Some people thing that if they know things about lots of subjets they will be prefered to people who have been specialized in their whole scholar education.
It is not always true. The student's personnality is very important but,
of course if a student is very good in few subjects and that he has an interesting personnality it will help him to find a job

    That's why to specialize in two or three subjects is essential for me.
