 Life is full of experiences and adventures. Some people rely on their main knowledge and try to improve it. On the other hand, some people try to take risks and prefer adventures. I think the first group, who do what they already know, are better for several reasons such as the accuracy, the chance and the ability to expect the result.
    When someone is spontonous and does everything without deep thinking or try to take a risk in a feild he or she knows nothing about. Sometimes, they acheive succeed, get lots of money and be famous without lots of work or even with it. It happens by chance, however it is infrequent. The probability of succeeding is very low. In addition, if they failed after a long working, hoping and trying, the damage might be severe both finicially and emotionally. 
    On the other hand, there is a group of people who like to keep doing what they are used to do. In this case, these people try to improve and build on their previous knowledge. They invent, enhance inventions and make innovations. For example, Thomas Edison, he tried more than a hundered of times before inventing the electric light bulb. It was not a chance, it was the harvest of hard continious working about something he already knew. Another example is the mobile phone, it is an innovation that have come after the home phone and sattlelite. The people who invented it were not taking a risk. They had an idea and tried to improve it until they invented the mobile phone. Moreover, what have come from the hard working and doing what they know to do is most of the time expected, accurate and well-done. Finally, improving and enhancing the previous knowledge and doing what you like gives you a better chance to do something more successful.
    In conclusion, I prefer to do what I already know how to do well, because the failing chance is much less. Also, most of the time the results are more satisfying. In additon, at least you can expect the results and you know what are you doing.
