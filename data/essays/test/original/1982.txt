When it comes to how to be a successful person, different poeple have unique opinions. Some think that trying new things but others hold that only do what they know and finish effectively. Although both of them have advantages, I prefer to choose the secon doption. 
The first reason is the efficiency of finishing a work. Ones we know how to complete it fluently, careless mistake or accidents are easily prevented. Their customers or clients will admit they have a professional skill. These elements can provide people the confidence and is worth to trust them. For example, if you are an engineer, people pay you to fix a car as they trust you have the knowledge to solve the problem. Once, you make mistake or cause the problem even worse, no one will pay you anymore. 
The second one is the timemanagement. When we alrady know how to complite the work in a proper way, we save a lot of time instead of wasting time to ask people or look in reference books. For example, when you look for a job, you might find the occations that you know them already becaues you don't need to spend extra time on learning new skills. You think you can handle it in a peroid of time. For sure, most employers prefer to employ an experenced worker. 
In conclusion, I suggest that only do the job what they have the skills on it. These elements can lead a person become successful.
