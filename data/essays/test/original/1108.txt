Deceiving advertisement?

There are a number of different types of advertising. Some advertisements make us believe that a product will make us look gorgeous or some try to make us believe that a certain product is simply the best available solution on the market. On the other hand there are some advertisments that simply tell us facts and figures. 

There are products such as lipstick or clothing where advertisments tend to overstate the quality of a certain product. When somebody looks at the current H&M advertising for their new jacket he or she is usually overwhelmed. This is not because the jacket itself is of incredible quality but because of the beautiful girl who wears  that jacket. This is an example of advertising which tries to make a product seem better than it actually might be. And it is easy to find a lot of other examples.

On the other hand there are some advertisements which consist of sober information to an large extent. For example when somebody reads the brochure for a certain type of expensive machinery or a car he or she will find quite a few pages which simply state technical specifications. 

I think that most advertisments try to make products seem better than they are. Are the companies actually abled to make people believe their advertisements though? In case of consumer goods such as clothing or cars it has proven to be very important to advertise heavily and in very emotional ways. 

I personally don't like advertisments filled with beautiful people and shiny products though. I usually care more about things like price and objective quality. And if the advertisers don't give me information on these issues I simply won't buy their products. The bottom line is probably that advertising has to provide what customers care about.
