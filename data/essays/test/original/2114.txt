I disagree with the opinion that the best way to travel is in a proup led by a tour guide for the three reason.
 First, traveling in a group with the guide does'nt provide us much looks. My family often travel during the vacation. We visited East Europe last summer vacation, and we went in a group led by a tour guide. My parents and I wanted to see more things than just going around well knowned place. We wanted to feel the culture of the other country. We wanted to do shopping in the market which was located in the side of the road, and we also wanted to take a look of small shops and peoples' life, but we had to move quickly  to the next place where guide ask to us to go.  It would be the better trip if we could walk around the alien country street, I think.
 Second, you cannot get enough time when you move in a group. Looking all the things that you want need planty of time. Each person's interest is different, and there is a situation that someone wants to spend more time in particular place, but the other one doesn't. When you travel alone, you don't have to worry with this kind of problem. You can take time enjoying the travel in the place where you want to be.
 Finally, you can't feel the real life of the place by just looking the great sight of the important building of something. Sometimes  you can see more fantastic things without the map. But with the tour guide? You can just visit famous place and buildings or sights, not the life of the country or city or whatever. 
 If you are scared to go trip alone, and that's the reason why you went it in a group led by a tour guide, just bring it on. You surely can enjoy your trip feeling the alien culture with more time and look.
