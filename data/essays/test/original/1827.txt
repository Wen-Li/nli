Basically I am not in accord with the opinion. Such kind of generalisation is not possible. Because there are lot of evidences which prove that  young people are still seriously aware of their communities. There are lot of clubs which are really very helpful.And also there are charitable group and ofcourse still there are lot of blood donation camp. And  in those camp most of the donars are young boys and girls.Still we see that yong people show their respect by offering their own seat to aged and weak person.  Lot of cultural programmes are still held in localities to entertain the common people by young people which difute the opinion stated by the speaker.

    But  it is really true that people now a days are much more busy thn earlier. Due to the increasing competition people are engaging more in their personal life. But it is not their own fault. 
   If we compare the activities of young people of nowadays with the past then we see that  now people are more con cerned to their  career and their studies. But it is not true that they are not concern of thair communities atall. Still now if there any flaw arises in our societies young people are those who come first to solve the problem. Few days ago I heard about a club of young people who took the all responsibilities when a small boy just fall down from a  building . And the most amazing fact is that there were a lot of people who were aged  but they did not take the responsibilities of the boy to carry him to the near by hospital. But the club member when came to know about the incidend they just rushed to the spot and carried the boy to the hospital without caring about the police and all other risks.Actually there are a lot of incident which prove that the statement is a really  flawed and baseless.
    So from yhe stated explanation we can simply  conclude that young people are still  as much active as past regarding the time they spend for their communitie
