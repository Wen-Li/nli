Yes i do agree with the statement given. The products that are shown up in the advertisements need not not be real or they can be virtual.Which can cause people to get tempted to buy them but afer that they come to know that the things that are shown in the advertisements are just virtual to attract the customers.
                                 For instance if we take up an example of a very famous chewing gum called BOOMER. In that particular advertisement there is a person so  called BOOMER MAN. When a group of children are in trouble,they chew this particular gum and call BOOMER MAN for help.And this BOOMER MAN appears all of a sudden and starts helping the people. Most of the children by watching this particular advertisement think that if they eat this chewing gum they can call boomer man so they turn up to buy this gum.This example illustrates how virtual  advertisements can be.

                                  As we all know that in advertisements the products are given more care and are brushed up with all the possible extra arrangements to make them appear as good as possible.If we consider the example of a car advertisement the car is shown with the best interior design available in the advertisement which may not be possible if we wanted to buy a car in real. Or else we might be charged more than it is shown in the advertisement.
                                       
                                          The most common thing we overlook or donot notice in the advertisements which make us tempt to the product shown in the advertisement and make us feel very bad when we go and plan to buy that particular product is the pharse "*contions apply".This phrase makes many customers confuse about the product. As the conditions are not given in the advertisements the products shown in the advertisement seems to be more attractive.But wen the conditions are on then the real product can be noticed.
