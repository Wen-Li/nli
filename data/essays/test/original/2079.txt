Life gives us a lot of choices in order to do our target and to be a successful person in the community.A lot of things we have to make it so, we can convens our selves that we are some thing very importanat not less important .Are you sure that every thing that you had do it in your life is correct? Being asuccessful person is a target that we should carry on to reach it. In this essay, i am going to talk about my opinion in this issue.

In the begining, a successuful poeple are having a lot of advantages in their actions in the life. First of all, taking experinces from others in order to not make same mistakes.The good person will not say that i am already young and i can do what i want unless he or she sure from the trhing that he or she is doing. Second point, being smart and clever in each action that you are going to do. Alot of us imitating what others doing without thinking about the result of it.For example, I am staff nurse. I was working in ntesive care unit. I had seen a lot of people dying in front f my eyes becouse of thier bad thinking. They were very young and beutiful but the problem as they drive in a high speed. It was disaster to their families.At this point, I want to illustrate that I  know the problem and the solution. I have to not drive fast so I will be safe and free from dangerous.

Moreover to be a successful person that we have to update our information in order to take care previosly from the bad accidents that may happen to us.

In conclusion, In my opinion I advice all people to be more successful as mush as they can so, their actions will be good enough for the commmunity.
