The given statement implies success would be rather based on creativity and audacity instead of conservativity and stagnation.
This is a tempting statement, since it appeals to the deep human longing for exploration of the new and unknown and implicitly links success to any adventurous idea.
Leaving old paths is indeed not only highly thrilling but also necessary in order to evolve as a single human and as society.
Stagnation would mean, formulated in a very extreme way, that people would still live in simple sheds instead of well constructed buildings and would be deprived of luxurious goods such as warm water, heating, any means of fast transport and so on. The impact of invention in general on daily life goes beyond the visible, none of the now well established ideas, goods and inventions would have been possible without creativity of the mind. 
But not everything new and good was successful right away, how many stories of people who invented and imagined goods that we became used to and consider normal and necessary but who died poor and never saw the payoff of their work and contribution to all our lives exist out there?
Artists are a common example, another may be scientists such as galilei who even got burned for his brilliant way of thinking.
Would he have sticked to common and accepted ways and ideas, nothing would have happend, both to him and scientific progress, because once an idea is out there and it is supported by something such as data or simply a vision shared by more people it will be explored until it reached a dead end or success.
Therefore, success may not neccessarily be linked to risks, because most people like to stick to one way and changes need some time, even more in proportion to the radicality of an idea.
This leads to the conclusion, that small new ideas which to not affect and cut into people's daily lives strongly, may indeed be very successful after some time whereas others may need more than a lifetime to sink in and blossom.
