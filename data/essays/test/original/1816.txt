     Having a broad knowledge from many academic subjects might not be as effictive as specializing in specific subject for many reasons. First of all, Specializations is to consintrat all of the specialists energies to make a development, step forward in their field, for example, studing medecie for five to six years resaulting in graduated students who are not effecient in work as someone who has ph.d in medicine.On the other hand the varity knowledge means learning alittle about many things witch means not making any improvement in life and learning the same materials of information over and over again, for instance , high-school students (who are being learned about several subjects) need to study in university to be specialist in some subject.
   Frome that we can see, broad knowledge is just a step to the specialization.
     In conclusion, I believe that the humanity civilizaion is completely based on getting improved in each field of life which is the specialization its only road.
