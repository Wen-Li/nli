I`m surely agree with the statment. I think that very often advertisements lead our perception of reality in the wrong path.
And there are different way, I think, that buisness, or company in general, use in order to convince us that something is really good.

I think that one mean they use is the amount of advertisments. In fact we you can find everywhere a picture of a product, or you can listen to a person who speaks about another product, and so on. 
For examle when you wacth the televison or you read newspaper you will surely find at least half of the information about something that someone wants you to buy. 
Thank to this tecnique you are led to buy something.
However, very often, if you buy it, you will be disappointed just because the good or the service you have bought doesn`t correspond with the thing you had seen before.

Moreover, in my opinion, it would be interesting understand also the reason thanks to someone lead us to buy something even if we know that very often they don`t correspond with the reality. However i think that this is one difficoult problem because it`s related with our faculty to choose freely and it should be explained with some psychologiacl aspects. I don`t think it would be appropriate to speak about them. 

I want rather exaplain an example that happend to me just three days ago. I needed a new brush for my hair. I was wathcing tv in the evening and suddently an adertisement occurres on televison. It described a vary multi functional brush with battery included (there was a beautiful girl in the spot!). Of course I`ve bought it but I`ve soon realized that it was very different from televison. It was very small and above all it was everything except useful!
