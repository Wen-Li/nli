I prefer the travel by myself to the one in a group led by a tour guide. I have three reasons to suport my opinion.
  Firstly, I can visit the places in a city that match more to my taste in a travel by myself. If I travel in a group, I may not be able to visit all the sites I want to see. Since I  am especially inerested in art and music, I would choose to visit museums and go to live houses rather than to see historical buildings like old churches. Of cource I understand the importance of such buildings and there are many people who want to see them, but if I go to a foreign country, I want to go the places which attract me more.
  Secondly, I can make my scheules more flexible. If I feel comfortable to be in a museum and want to spend a day there, I can do this. It happened when I visited New York city. I first scheduled to see MoMA for a half of the day. But after I started to look the fantastic pictures in the museum, I was fascinated by them. I quitted the afternoon schedule and spent a whole day there. It became the best day in that trip.
  Lastly, travel by alone offers many chance to communicate with the people who live in the city. I often asked how to get the destination where I wanted to go, and many of them friendly taught me the way. When I visited Thailand, I asked the woman the delicious restaurant around there. She not only nicely told me the name of the restaurant, but also took me there and had dinner together. She said she is also had interested in Japan, where I live. We had very nice time in that restaurant with nice foods and valuable conversaions. I think it is not so often the case with the group tour with a tour guide.
