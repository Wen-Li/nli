Typically, it is more important for students to learn about ideas that help them with up coming events in their life, however, if students learn about the ideas without understanding them, there will be diffculties that will face them.

Being a student, i believe that understanding the ideas and concept of things is more preferrable that just learning them. Less mistakes occur if the understanding of the issue is there. Although, if the understanding is not present, mistakes will occur. For that, student will only know the little details behind the action but will not know from right or wrong.

Learning facts is like having a world where anything is possible. Nothing will seem wrong to people because the reasons behind the fact without understanding, will lead to people doing wrong from good. Furthermore, understanding the concept teaches the student to choose the right decision without think about the facts behind it.

Understanding the facts will lead to an understand with people that have different issues that can't be solved. For example, war is the wrong thing to do, but they are still happening. If an American solider were to kill an unarmed man from Palastine, for the fact that he did nothing but protect his family, that solider is considered to be stupid and heartless. The fact that this unarmed man is the soliders enemy, where he is in a helpless position, without understanding the concept that killing is wrong, that man is dead for just that fact.

To conclude, i believe that understanding the issue or concept of things is better than just learning the facts. It gives the student a chance to learn from right and wrong without hesitating. They will also have the chance to know the reasons behind the choice made because without that understanding the concept, wrong will be right.
