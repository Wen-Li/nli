I agree to the given statement that "The best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide."Traveeling in a group has many advantages when compared to travelling independently.If we are travelling as a group there is a tour guide who explains all the places history and significance of the places better than any one.A tour guide knows each and every thing about the places which we are visiting and he explains the significance and history about the places.
                                  The problem of language is also avoided by travelling in a group led by tour guide because guide explains those things in a language known to many people.Generally guide knows many languages because he should have to handle with different nations of people.The chance of missing of people is also avoided because guide takes care of the people he is leading.
                                    If we prefer travelling independently there is a chance of missing some significant places because we do not all the significant places in a place where we are travelling.A tour guide helps us in making arrangements for accommodation and food facilities.A tour guide naturally do not miss any significant place.He knows how to arrange the travelling plans such as when and where should we go, on what criteria should we choose to see places.
                                       A tour guide leads the group and controls all the people in the group efficiently.If we are visting any foreign country, hiring a tour guide and travelling as a group helps in many ways that there is no chance of dealing with individual tensions.We can enjoy the tour with no tensions because all facilities will be provided by tour guide by making arrangements for accommodation and food facilities.Inspite of these benefits the major advantage is that we get to know the history of the places we are visiting, in an interesting manner told by a tour guide.For all these reasons I agree to the statement that "The best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide."
