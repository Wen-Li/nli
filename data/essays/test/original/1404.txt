Some people think go to have a trip with  a group and a tour guide is a good choice while others hold the opposite idea.As far as I am concerned,I believe it is a good choice to travel with a group with a tour guide.There are may be one or two disadvantages to having a trip with group and tour guide ,however I think the advantages are far more.

First of all,one of minor disadvantages to having a trip with a group is that you will lose your freedom partly.For example,you can not go wherever you want to during the trip such as you want to go to visit somewhere is not included in this trip schedule but you just begin to be interested in.

Another drawback is you can not arrange your time freely.For instance,you need be on time and make sure not be late for the arrangements during the trip.such as having breakfasts in time, leaving time ,gathering time.

Though there are one or two disadvantages to joining the travel group with a tour guide I do believe the advantages far outweigh them.

By taking the group trip with a tour guide,you can enjoy your trip as much as possible and do not need always check  your arrangement.For example,you do not need check the information about the trip arrangement such as hotel booking,reastaurant booking or bus arrangement.Also by joining the group trip you do not need prepare a lot for the trip.For example it is not nessary for you to prepare the knowledge details about  cities or countries you will go such as history,culture,eating habits,climate infornation.All those you will be told by the tour guide before or during your trip and by taking group trip you can help or be helped during the trip.For example  you lose you way during the trip.You will be helped by others to find you back to the group.

Another advantage to taking the group trip with a tour guide is that you can make friends and have a very wonderful atmosphere.For example you will feel more enjoyfui to travel with lots of people with the same interest as you.So you can share the memorable moment with them and each of you is able to have unfotgetable memory such as your good pictures which were taken by others  .You may become friends later through the trip.

Although I agree there are one or two disadvantages to taking a group trip with a tour guide I believe the advantages are more obvious.Considerable  though the benifits spending  the trip time freely alone enjoys are,they can not compete with the advantages that taking your trip with others brings out when sharing the joyful moment and making friends are taken into account.So taking a group with a tour guide is nothing but a wise choice for  me.
