I agree that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are. The function of advertisement is selling products. Since every one what to buy things with high valuse but low prise, the advertisements usually enlarge the quality or ability of the products. 
     Some advertisements only focus on the advantages of the products. For example, a advertisement about selling computer may recommend the powerful calculating speed and the big storage space of harddisk in the computer. Then the customers will belive that the computer is very powerful. However, the advertisement may not mention the noisy of the computer when it is running, or the heat of the motherboard will make the computer easily shout down. All of these faults are not listed on the advertisements, so the customers will find this faults after they buy the computer and use it. This is why mose people will feel the products is not as good as the advertisemsnt says. 
     Sometime the function of the products is all listed in the advertisements. However, the limit of funcitons are not shown. Such advertisements seem tell the truth, so the customers will believe them easily. After the customers buy the products, they will find the function of the products is not powerful as they except. For example, the advertisements may sell a car that can saving oil, then people can save money. Even the prise of car is more expensive, the customer will still buy it in order to save the money for buying oil. However, the amount of oil saving by this car is few. The customer will feel not worthy to buy this car, comparing the prise of this car.
     Besides, some advertisements has some super starts to recommend the products. The customes who like the starts very much will wnat to have the same staff of the starts. The function of the product is neglectd by costumers because the choise of super starts  will not be wrong. In fact, the super starts usually do not really use the products they recommend. The productors just sell the products by using the affection of fans to the stars. The quality of the products is hided by the stars.
    The advertisements not always tell lies. But hinding the disadvantages and limits of functions is also some kind of lies. The customers always buy products with limit understanding of the products, so they will feel the products is not as good as they think. This is because what they think about the products are coming from the advertisements which is not worthy to trust.
