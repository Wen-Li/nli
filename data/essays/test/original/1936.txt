Many teachers generally teach their students by only remember the fact in the content books because of its ease. However, I think that it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts. There are several reasons why I think so. 
  First of all, fundamentally, understanding ideas and concepts improves humans brain's nature ability. As people understand ideas and concepts, they can do many applications of their thinkings and develop these ideas. In Chosun dynasty, intelligent scholars didn't think ideas or concepts, and they just learn about the fact of books repeatedly. So the society could not developed, therefore the dynasty was destroyed by mighty of Japan. 
  Second, people who try to understand ideas and concepts have more ability of solving certain problem rather than ones who learn facts. People who just learning fact cannot view entire story or meaning of their problem, because simple fact makes people so simple. They cannot solve any complicated problems or works. For example, when Korean people are elementary school students, they learn about the method of multiplication, nine-nine rule. Many students learn and just remember this rule, not expand more application or its origin that it is derived from many set of addition the numbers.  When they become the high school students or university students, if they meet some complex mathematical problem or other profound problems, it is sure that they cannot overcome the difficult stage. 
  To sum up, understanding fundamental ideas or concepts makes the people more intelligent. Through people try to understand profound meanings, they can solve more complicated problems in their lifes. Consquently, I firmly believe that it is more significant for young students to understand and consider main ideas and original concepts than it is for them to learn and remember just facts.
