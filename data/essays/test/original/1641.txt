specializing in one academic subject ensures that you have excelled in a specific area in life. -  something that distinguishes you and makes you stand out in one area. 

in today's world, everything has become so interconnected and everythings is intertwined- we are inevitably exposed to new ideas and we therefore do have an extensive understanding of the world to some extent

I disagree with this statement as i believe that it is better to specialize in one specific subject. my reasoning for this argument, is that in today's world, we are inevitably exposed to broader subjects. for example, with the television and the internet, and we are therefore no longer restricted to consuming information on a specific subject and we come out with a more extensive understanding of the world, that may not necessarily be presented in an academic institution. secondly, i believe that as a person excells in a specific academic subject, he or she is has excelled in a specific area in life. for example, whether it is science and learning about the characteristics of what makes up the world we live in, or whether it is history and learning about our past, what distiguishes us as a human being, and how our world has evolved throughout time, they are two subjects that are complimentary in some manner. 
    when specializing in a specific subject, a person is able to distinguish him or herself in comparison to another individual by having excelled in a specific subject. by excelling in a subject such as science, this individual has an extensive understanding of how our world works and what characterizes it. they understand the distinct characteristics and facts, and therefore become proffessionals that are educated about a specific subject. same goes to an individual studying a subject like history. he or she is able to become a proffessional in a subject where it is absolutely essential to know the details and the characteristics of. furthermore, by having a broad knowledge of subjects, a person loses his or her individuality and to some extent, are no longer distinguishable. 
    more importantly, in today's world, we are exposed to the broader knowlege of the world. we are living in a globalized world, and therefore, we are exposed to such things such as the internet and television, and travelling, that we are inevitably educated about subjects in a broader sense. we are no longer constrained to a certain subject and we are therefore inevitably exposed to new information. 
    specializing in a specific subject is very important as it is a way of distinguishing an individual in comparison to another. furthermore, as we are living in an extensively globalized world today, there is no need for specialization.
