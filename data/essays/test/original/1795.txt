I disagree with the idea that it is more important for students to understabnd ideas and consepts than it is for them to learn facts. There are three major reasons for this.
     First, learning facts is the first step of study and ideas or consepts are based on these facts. Thus, if students did not learn facts well, they can not develop theoir thoughts.  For example, we cannot understand historical context without historical facts.  After studying historical facts and memorizing them, students barely start to notice the significance of historical events. Basically important concepts are based on facts discovered by early scholars. After learning facts well, it makes easier for students to understand ideas and consepts.
     Second, students are in the process of learning, so it is difficult for most of them to understand ideas and concepts. Even if they can, they tend to go wrong directions. Facts are easy to teach and learn for both teachers and students. As a matter of fact, teaching ideas by low-level educator is a harm because students believe wrong thing. Although understanding ideas and consepts are significant, facts are more important in terms of levels of education.
     Third, the present education system works well teachin facts for students in the first place. According to the psychological study conducted by the UNESCO, the most important thing for children to develop their ability to study facts by reaching the level of memorization. It is natural step to develop each students ability, so current educational system consider it important for them to teach facts. We do not change this system and jump onto abstract ideas. 
     To sum up, I consider learning facts to be more important than understanding ideas. Learning facts are beneficial for students to.
