I agree with the the saying that successful people try new things rather than doing what they already know .Becoue in my opinion doing usual things is quit boring and no fun on that , also by doing the same thing again and again I cant learn so many things in my life also I cant get  alot of experiances in ather things .

    First of all lets talk about getting bored from things that we used to do it without trying to take  risks and try new things . when I do the same thing so many times I get bored from it , Its true that I get the experiance from that but when you get bored from s,me thing you try to get runed from it . Why dont I try to take risks and try doing some thing new, like adding some fun in the same thing that I used to do it ,or try ti do it in a different ways , or also I can try doing it with my friends or my family.

    Seconed , haveing experiances in so many things in life . How could I get the good and the resenable amuont of experiances if I didnt try alot of thinga in my life ?? .I should take risks and gat ready for the changes in my life and try to collect as much as experiances that I could in my hole life ." The more things you do the more experiances you get " , this what my teacher used to tell us about the life style .

   Finally , in my opinion I should try tafing risks in life and never stop  practising in the things that I used to do but in a new and model ways, becuose if I used to do it in the sane way I might get bored from that and never do it again, so its better to things in differant ways from not doing it at all.
