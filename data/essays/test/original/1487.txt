Referring to the statement that it is of more importance for students to understand the idea and reason behind a certain topic than it is for them to learn the facts I can agree in a way but not absolutely.
There are two sides of the coin and to me this statement is not very well developed and considered. We have different topics and subjects with different requirements of knowledge for each single one of them. To me the mixure of both, understanding the idea/concepts and the facts, is what makes your knowlegde about a topic absolutely reliable.
If someone asks the student to explain a certain issue the student needs to know all the background information and then try to show practical evidence to underline that it is totally right what was said.
In History class for example you need to explore the circumstances and reasons why a certain event took place or why it was time for a new era-I would consider those questions as facts but also in a way as an idea how to solve a problem. Then a student can learn about plans which help trying to realize certain things. Therefore you need to know about both to be well informed .
In Chemistry you first need to know about the appearance and 'character' of an element before you can experiment with it. Here it is absolutely neccessary to do those experiments to increase the understanding of the topic. In Maths a student also need to know a definition of a problem and how to come to a solution before it will be solved.
Ideas and concepts are in advantage when it comes to learning because students are stimulated not only by learning it theoretically but by using different senses such as touching,hearing and speaking.They get the chance to experience something in a practical way. But if you see, hear things or learn about something you should also know why you hear or see it-here we come to the point of learning facts. 
To come to a conclusion both aspects are important to study a topic in a serious way and then consequently you will get the ultimate result of reliable knowledge which you can pass on to others.
