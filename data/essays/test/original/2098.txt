i agree with the given statement.Every student must able to know  the concepts of lecture.if the student got the  basic idea,he will able to get the whole concept perfectly.
The main reason is if the student able to got the concept, then he will be in a position to explain to anyone.With half knowledge he will not get anything.
Some times one application may use in another application.By knowing the concept only we will apply and solve the problem of other application.In physics,it will came across rapidly.In physics,we will apply one application for the other.By getting whole concept only we can able to solve the problem.
Another reason is that,if students learn about concepts in his academic year,he would  have easy in higher education also.The terms all are  familier in his academic.So,he could not worry about the subject.
Another reason is that,by learning facts,the student would not get full subject.He will not perfect in the subject.So,he must have to learn about concepts.
If we take an  civil engineer as example,if he do not know the knowledge of concepts about the construction of buildings and bridges,it will fell down and lot of money will be wasted.So,in student age only he must able to get the whole idea and concept of subject.
So,it is importent for students to understand idea
