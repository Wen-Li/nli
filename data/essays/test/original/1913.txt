I think that most advertisements make products much better than they really are is a very true statement.

On the one hand, i understand those who make advertisements. They are paid by a society to promote  their products, so they obviously focus on their best charateristics and maybe do not talk about possible problems. Probably the society itself give them such directives. And if most societies do this, the remaining ones must do the same if they will not want to go outside the market in the near future.

On the other hand, i put myself to the side of the consumers. If I have buyed something, because I was impressed by a very well made advertisement, i will be very deluded  if when i tried it out, it does not work as well as in the spot. And if this happens again and again, the consumer will doubt of every spot he will see.

In conclusion, we understand the policy of sellers, always making their best efforts to make their product seem better than they really are, but if they will continue this way, I am sure that consumers will be tired of all these "false" advertisements and then will not believe to any of them, nope the realistic ones.
