Ideas and concepts are very important for students than just to learn facts. Ideas and concepts are pracitcal in real life than just learning the facts. I totally agree with the statement that, it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn fact. Few reasons and examples are illustrated below to hold my opinion.

Fistly, understanding ideas and concepts makes the student more practical and applicable in respective fields or subjects. For incidence, take Medical surgeon student, if the student surgeon knows the ideas and concepts how to do the surgery, when the student become a surgeon, he or she  can perform surgery very easily than learning the facts about how to do the surgery. Another incidence computer programme students, by learning ideas, and concepts it is easy  to develop new computer programmes when they become the programmers.

Secondly, understanding the ideas, and concepts makes students more innovative. For incidence, if the student is a chemistry student and the student learns the ideas and concepts regarding the chemical compound than learning just the facts, student can experment the ideas and concepts that she or he learned and innovate new compounds that would be useful for mankind. For example Medical compounds etc.

Finally, understanding the ideas and concepts makes students understand the subject. No matter how the questions are framed regarding the subject, students are able to answer the question and attain good grades in class. For incidence, if the  student is math student, by understanding the ideas and concepts of maths, it is easy to resolve any type of math questions on exam and can get very good score. But learning just the facts of maths don't help the student much in solving maths. 

To summerise, understanding ideas and concepts is important not only to improove the grades in class but to practice and apply in real life, and also to make students future Innovators, Reaserchers and Scientists.
