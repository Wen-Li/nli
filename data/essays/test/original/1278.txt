I agree that the products appear much better than they really appear when advertised. The business companies who manufacture the products make the value of it equal to a diamond in the hands of the Brand Ambassador as man is the creater of god and early superstitions, by which the stone has improved its value to gold. 

The telivision channels are profited by advertising and exclusive interviews of great film actors, industrialists and telecasting live programms of incidents that are not useful to the common man. The business tycoons are largly dependent on the film stars to help them telecast their products and the influencial citizens are attracted by seeing their most liked cenema actor and without any suggestions of their suppurters they just buy those products that are promoted by these telecasts.

The item for example we consider Coke bottles which are advertised by the celebrities can be produced by just 50paise per 200ml of coke but the available cost in the market is for 10rupees for each bottle, which means after all the 50 paise drink we are just spending 20 times the value of the item . This shows that the present market is totally dependent on the advertising market and the celebrities are paid an amount of crores without any estimation for every short on the screen.

The other side of the coin is the effective development of companies atr the expense of the people
