People are not also behind the current generation if they invent some new products and progress their jobs.Because time is running time not walking.Everyday we face surprising adn attractive products from technology to our cars.If you are a businessman you should take a risk to enhance your skills otherwise you will be behind of your generation.For instance;a techonology company does not try to make new products and doesn't take a risk to spend many to produce this product,consumers will be prefer their component ompanies to buy a new product.
Taking risk and trying new things are also good way to be a leader who the other people folow their trace.These people will be good example for the others who want to go ahead in their life.For example;let's imagine that you take a risk rather than being lazy or fearing being unsuccessful so you find new thing that is useful for humanity.After that you are a leader because you try and achieve.
