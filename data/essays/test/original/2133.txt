Some people tend to emphsis the importance of learning ideas and concepts whereas the others like to appreciate facts better.In my opinion, I disagree with the statement that it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts.Several reasons can be seen vividly below.

The most important propensity of my opinion is that any ideas or concepts all around the globe comes from reality and facts in people's daily life.Only after fter a long and hard period of researching and discovering time could the human race gain the essential ideas from what they are really exprinced.For instance,all of math fomulas people use today comes from millions of researchers' constancially hardworking and continuously proving.Without the close attention and appreciation of facts, may no one of us can learn the mystery of any apartement of science.So,facts are the main source of people's ideas and concepts.

In addition,we can say ideas is a mirror before the real world.The meaning of what I say is that ideas and concepts accuratly reflect the appearance of the facts.If people also only addictate in learning ideas and concepts, they may lose the chace to appreciate the right way to make a sence on the natural reality.In other word, people may regard the right situation of the facts in a wrong way only affect by the negative of the limitation of made-ideas and concepts.For example,a great modern Chinese physics resaercher Wang-Chufei,which addictated in many ideas of solving space gravity problems,states sevral wrong and rediculous solution to people's viewpoint towards science.That was a serious situation!

Of course, a close appreciation about people's ideas and concepts is usually helpful to our understanding towards living and learning,in my tend of propensity,it is more important and advantages to purchase a careful apprecistion about the facts.

In conclusion,although both understanding ideas and concepts and to learn facts are the way to guide people's living and learning,I tend to agree that to learn facts is more important and meaningful.
