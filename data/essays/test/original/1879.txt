In my prespective, I agree that broad knolwedge of many academic subjects is better than specialiazing in one specfic subject but to a certain extent. And I quote here "Knowledge is power", so wider knowledge of many academic subjects gives more insight to a general theme and allows to explore and relate a different aspects of one issue. For example studing econmics as a major subject alone will not be rewarding in comparison to studing it with other related academic subjects such as politics and human science. We know that these other subjects do have an influence on economics. So it is more of having a hollistic knowledge rather than seeing one face of a coin.

Knowing different academic subjects also gives the opprtunity to explore personal preferences on studing a certain topic and help making choices.  

So on the other hand, specializing after a certain extent is needed to increase effeciency and quality of knolwedge or work.
