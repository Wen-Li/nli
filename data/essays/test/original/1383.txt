I agree the fact that Successful people try new things. These people start a thing with high goals and will proceed with the work for success never thinking of the failure. As they could succeed in their works they do even take risks rather than doing the same thing as they feel it as joy to do the things and if even one thing fails, they will not even consider it as they were successful before.

    But some people who received failures frequently or at the beginning feel afraid of implementing the new things. They most probably keep in mind about the failure they received before. And most probably the final result is failure.

    All the new technologies and the things now present are the results of the successful people and the risks taken by them. If in the olden days the peole and the scientists satisfied  with the old achievements, we may not have the new things we have now. If the people and the Grahambell (who invented bicycle) satisfied with the bicycle, we probably might not have all the bikes and the cars we have now.

    In the olden days all the theories were discovered over centuries, i.e. one theory is discovered by two or three generations of scientists. When fire broke into Einstein, the father fo nation's research laboratory, he felt happy and enjoyed looking at the flames that he can develop new things again by leaving the old things. He is happy that the things might have gone, but it gave many new ideas and experiences to him.

    It is dependent on us to see whether we are a succesful peole are not. Because it is we who had taken the decisions and implemente the things. The success for one depends on how he manage the things and and how he organise the events or tasks. It's the secret fo the success for most of the present day enterprenuers. It is not sure that successful people always achieve successes.

    We can say that the the risks or the new ideas implemented be the successful people is running this world. But this success does not belong to one category. Because the development has got many ways such as in medical field, electrical field, computer field, mechanical field, etc.. The leading development in the world now is in the computer field. The invention of computers changed the way teh world has got before. Modern robots along with computer sensors can perform heart surgery which is a typical one with out cutting the skin. These are the new things implementes by the scientists and teh successful people
