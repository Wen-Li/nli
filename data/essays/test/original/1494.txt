I agree that is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn fact. If a teacher gives you ideas and concepts and say to you to talk about the fact of this and if you do not know the fact what will you lern about that, means that you did not understand the class or the homework that the teacher gave it to you. You will have trouble because living the life is one of the ideas and concepts and if you do not know this how will you do in school, at home, at church, when you travel, when you discuss, when you do a speech, when you teach to people or student or anybody that needs help and ask and everywhere you are. For example many people suicide because they don't know the facts why they are living, they have ideas and concepts but they don't know the facts so what will mean to them. In my case sometimes I understand ideas and concepts of life and I learn some facts of them but not all of them so for me I don't have many problem of this at school when the teacher give me a homework or everywhere that I go, but sometimes I have difficulty about this. I think that small childrens that start school they have to learn clearly and well and to understand and have ideas and concepts to learn the facts about all the things that they have or they learn so this things will help to this students to study and to live the life of the world and to comunicate where ever they go.
For this reason I agree that is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn the fact.
