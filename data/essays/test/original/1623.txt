I agree with the statement which is that "successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well". For example, people who usually showed on TV, actors, and company president. I will write some example of these in this essay.
     First, people who usually showed on TV especially comedians will be a politician. At first, they will use their face to be a politician and talk about problems that own country had. However at the last, they will never success in the government, and will never get back to TV.
     Second, I will write about actors. Many actors will be the director to make the film when they are succeed. Usually it does not get good result.
