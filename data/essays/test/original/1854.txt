When asked about if it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts.The majority of people consider that understand ideas and concepts is much better, but other people think differently.I think learn facts is the better one.There two reasons for why I prefer to consider that learn facts is much better.
   One of the best factors is that students can learn facts from every parts of the surrounding things. We may take a common example of good quality. Everyone konws Lin is a brave successful man. He use his whole life to read and write books. He always said that money and power were not the most important in life.Friends and family were the most important to him. He learn facts from his friends and family. He was a good-tempered man, so he has a lot of good friends who mean most to him. From this instance we can see learn facts is very important.
   Sencond, learn facts can help us solve the problem.We may use what we have learn to do it. We always encounter some problems in our lives.But do not worry about it, we could learn from other people and insolve the problem which we encounter.
   Different people have different opinions towards the controversy. Understand ideas and concepts also has some advantages, but it can not compete with the learn facts.So, I think learn facts is the better one.
    From what has discussed above, I think most people will consider that learn facts is much better.
