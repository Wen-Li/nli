Not only government but also all human beings should give much effords to improve the their community. Especially, young people because they have much more energy and oppurtinity than the others. I believe that  the young people do not much time to helping their communities.
    I would like to give some specific examples to illustrate the why i agree this idea. I wanted to begin a program in my collage two years ago. There is no ricyle system in my community, therefore i set up a group with my friends. we prepared a progran that would apply. However, our number not enough to achive our goal. Everywhere was full of young people, in sport center, park, game field and internet cafe and so on, but we did not find assistant for our aim. 
    Another example that come in mind writh know is about social works. Some foods and clothes are sent from city to my country for poor people by government. I had to find people to distrubut them to the homeness peole but any of the yong people around me did not accept helping me. Nowadays i hear some good news about young people who participate in social works. However, it is not enough to be able to change some advers occurancy.
    To sum up, nowadays, though they have too much time to interest in comminity problem, youth interest in entertaintment, watching sports competition and so on.     I hope it will change as soon as possible.
