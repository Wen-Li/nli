The issue whether it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts, is controversial. On the one hand, ideas and concepts are built upon facts, therefore it is important to learn facts not only for the sake of learning facts, but also for having the ability to better understand ideas and concepts. On the other hand, that is ideas and concepts that matters. Therefore, I agree with the statement; it is more important for the students to understand ideas and concepts for the following reasons.

First, if a student just learns raw facts without understanding what lies beneath or without constructing any ideas on the fact to discuss or even better understand the fact, it does not mean anything but numbers or words. For example, if a student just knows that there occurred an economic crisis in Europe after the Second World War without understanding the economic, social and political reasons  behind the crisis, she will lack important understanding about how and why economic crisis occur.

Second, students should not just tought of facts but also be equipped with the pertinent methodology to acquire facts when it is needed. If the students are just tought some facts without understanding how to interpret those facts, they could just answer the simple questions on the facts and it is all, education will be inadequate and student will lack ways to survive on their feet. 

Third, the technology is improving so fast that the major facts of today may be obsolete tomorrow. So even if a student knows all of the facts of today, he might end up knowing nothing but obsolete data if he does not understand the idea that is built upon the facts. But if the student understands the ideas and concepts, he is well aware of the overall picture and he knows how to interpret the facts even if the facts change.    

In a nutshell, I believe to understand ideas and concepts is more important than to learn facts.
