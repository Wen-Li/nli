i agree with the statement, but still think that it varies in its importance from different subjects. of course it is always better to have a holistic perspective on a subject that a student is studying. in subjects like social sciences, humanities, history or law it is important to have a certain degree of an overview of that subject. so it is important to understand ideas, certain time periods or theoretical concepts in order to be able to think in the context and language of that subeject. in more technical subjects and maybe natural sciences their is huge importance on knowing certain facts and figures. an engineer for example has to be able to reproduce certain formulas or data whenever he is asked or a biologist should know certain facts about for example animal populations. but still, all facts fit into ideas, theories and concepts that important people have developed in the evolution of the different academic subjects. 

i think the problem with facts is that they  may turn into a kind of  weight for studying. they can also lead away from the research aim if concentrated to strong on them. a lot of researchers start with an idea and do experiments as long as they have a proof for it. this can be a supporting proof or one that eliminates the idea. theoretical thinking and theoretical concepts can be brought to students via professors in lectures. that is the important function that universities have to fulfill. but the learning of facts should be the responsibilitiy of the student, whether he or she is interested or not.

even if you compare universities to universities of applied sciences it is still important to set a focus on giving students the opportunities to understand ideas and concepts if they shall be able to work with them in a scientific, but also in a productive way  someday. altogether i think that facts can always be changed, but ideas and theories have a much longer lifetime. even if nowadays an idea has turned out to be wrong, students should still be informed about it in order to understand why it was wrong. such a mode of education is not possible by simply learning facts.
