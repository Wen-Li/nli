I agree with the statement that 'Successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well'.

Success is often achieved with hardwork,persistance and by being dynamic.Rather than doing things which we already know, its good to experiment once in a while depending on the economic,polotical and social conditions that might affect the business/career etc. 

Taking an example of a chain of Icecream stores in a particular state. They could just record the average temperatures at different parts of the State every year and further decide upon opening a few temporary stores at different parts of the city depending on the environmental conditions. This would increase the mobility of the business and at the same time could prove to be more profitable than the strategies that they were previously employing on. 

So its okay to try new things as long as the decisions made are sensible enough.  The person should'nt be too fickle-minded to trying new things abruptly without any base. The changes should be done by taking both the positive and negative aspects into consideration ,that these changes might bring into the business/career ,he should look in and out of various options and then take the right decision about making changes or no and if yes what kind of changes.

Being rigid and getting stick to only one kind of strategy might not help in achieving Success. Taking an example of a milk product in the market, in order to compete against the different other products in market it should be able to make suitable changes so the product stays very much in the market yielding better profits than yester years. 

So, I would conclude by saying that its better to try new things in business/career as long as the changes made are sensible.
