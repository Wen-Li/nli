Is it more important to understand ideas or concepts or learn by facts?. More people often do both, but how can we know what is more important. I definetely agree that students get more understanding by real facts. 
As a matter of fact, we have been realized that the experince comes from real facts that have been happen to us. Student are getting knowledge based on their experiences and assigments that proffesor assign them in order to get the knowledge they can get from their brains and then succed. Students get more  by learning with real facts.
Another reason, is that theories about life nowadays do not get that importance in teenagers,   because time  consequently has  been changed and goes over and over again in order to change methods as a form of study. As  technology goes, the student wants to get the convenient way to to get their chores easy.
In addittion, students that most of them are teenagers that are in the middle of adulthood and childhood, get more confusing and they want to learn real facts for themselves. Only few of them want to follow that rule of ancient methods that are ideas and concepts.
 Nobody wants to follow an idea or concept that has been implied by other person, at the end the student is who really learn that those facts are experieces they have been trought and have lead to some personal problems that in future can help them to grow as a person or whatever would be that specific goal. 
Thus, I think that understanding by learning facts is more interensting and fun for student to learn rather than ideas and concepts.
