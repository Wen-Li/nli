I do agree with the given statement due to the following reasons.
                       The word  'Advertisement' has become self-explanatory.It basically stands for promoting a product or a service by emphasizing or in this case over-emphasizing on its good characteristics. The advertisements are primarily to help to attract the comsumers and to increase the sale of the product or service.
For this the people usually happen to exaggerate a lot and try to manipulate the comsumers' thought process.
                      The main motive is to show the product in a good light and to make it woo the comsumer into buying it. Many a times this may work but it may also make the product look unattractive at times. For example considering the current advertisements for the beauty and fairness creams. You are shown a girl who is very dark and soon as she applies this particular cream,she becomes as fair as milk in a week.These are not acceptable to the consumer as they claim to totally change the skin tone of a person.How is it possible for a girl to become fair in a weeks time if she happens to be wheatish for the last twenty years? A sensible person would always know what the truth is.
          At times these advertisements happen to exaggerate to such an extent that they feel unrealistic.Take the case of the advertisements for slimming products.One day you are this fat,obese individual weighing around 200 pounds, and as soon as you start using one of these products,you will be around 130 pounds in a fortnight.Considering that these products may be effective but how do you explain their claim of helping a person slim down so soon. Still many desperate people do buy such products and later realise that they made a faux pas.
        These advertisements should instead be more real and show the products as they are meant to be. The feel good factor should always be there but it should not be blown out of proportion.
