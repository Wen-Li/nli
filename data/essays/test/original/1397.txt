I partly agree with the statement, that young people do not spend enough time to helping their communities.

From my personal experience I know, that there are lot of young people engaged in working in their communities.
I grew up in a Catholic community where I spent a few years on voluntarily looking after children in weekly group meetings or even multiweek holidays.

I think there would be even more people getting involved into community life, but there are just too many other activites you could take part in. 
Many parents try to push their children too hard to achieve rewards or to get trained in certain areas; this might range from sports club to music lessons. Therefore they might have little time or little interest of spending even more time on extracurricular activities.
Apart from that, there is an increasing number of children who spend most of their time with playing video games, surfing the internet or watching TV.
Additionally, there are those people you who do not see the point of getting involved in community life: Firstly, your are not rewarded with money or marks to do so. Secondly, working with people from all walks of life can be difficult and sometimes even hard work.
At last, there are people who work after school or work to maintain a better income or an income at all.
So choosing to work voluntarily in your community might not give you a direct benefit.

Therefore I agree with the statement above, but it needs to be mentioned, that it got a lot harder nowadays to choose from the variety of activites on offer.

I think it is benefically to your personality and even your cv, because spending time in your community might reward yuou with so called "soft skill|, you might need in later life.
