The memory can be a strong and usefull instrument if you use it correctly, although if a student only memorize facts his knwoledgement would never be as strong, as if it would be if he understood the main idea of what he is learning.

    I one hundred per cent agree with the statement that not only a student, but every person that wants to learn something, should understand the ideas and concepts that he is being thought, because when you learn and actually get to know the main idea of what you are learning it does not matter if the caractheristics around it changes, you would be able to understand the idea or the concept. An example probably would help us to understand this: if you learn the main idea of what a table is, it would not be a problem if a different colored, or shaped table is presented to you, you always would be able to recognize what a table is.

    On these days, we are attacked for lots of information, that in most cases we want to keep them in mind, but while we are just receiveng information and not going beyond it, we are not having a strong knowledment, instead we are only recieving facts. This sometimes could be usefull to fake that we know about anything that we are asked about, but this can be dangerous, because if a conversation of a particular toppic beggins, and it goes a little profound, our lack of knowledge, would appear.

    Considering this statements, I prefer to know less, but in a complete way, than just know a bunch of unsusfull facts.
