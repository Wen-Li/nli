It is true that advertising makes products seem better. In fact, I believe that this has become one of the main purposes of modern advertising.
While it is true that the original goal of advertising was to spread the knowledge of a particular product, it has now lost this function.
Food products, for example, are difficult to promote on television because the medium cannot convey how they smell. The fact that producers are forced to rely on images only has caused the birth of a whole business dedicated only to producing fake good-looking foods. It is well known, in fact, that the hamburgers shown in advertisements are made of plastic materials. The human mind can be easily influenced by the eyes if what is seen conforms to the expectations of a person. As an example, the cheese in real cheeseburgers is not so yellow, tidy and perfectly square as what can be seen in promotional pictures, but the mind associates good looks with good taste and a person can then feel attracted by plastic cheese and repelled by the picture of real cheese.
Another reason for this new trend in advertising can be found in the excessive competion. There are many products on the market that are essentially the same. When different companies copy each other, they can only rely on advertising to make the general public believe that their product is superior. This is what happens, for example, with buiscuits. There are certain types of buiscuits that are undistinguishably produced by many competitors. Statistics show that the average customer prefers to buy buiscuits produced by famous firms, attribuing the differnce in price from other, cheaper buiscuits to a difference in quality. This reasoning is actually influenced by the sheer amount of advertising he has been subjected to about famous products.
Although genuine adversting can still be seen, the very nature of the market has changed the business and promotional images and videos are almost always an exageration of the quality of the product.
