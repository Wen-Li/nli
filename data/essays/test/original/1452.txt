I don't think that students should learn more about the ideas and the concepts than the facts. For example, little childrens that are studying the importance of a healthy way of living including eating habits and exercising should know the fact that eating too much sugar and lack of exercice increase the risk of obesity. The facts will support the ideas and the concepts and will gave them a complete view of the problem or the situation. Secondly, they are many ideas about the way we suppose to eat, but if they are studies who state that eating less salt can help to control or lower the blood pressure people will be in favor to follow this rule. Facts helps people to understand and to rely on something, for example if they don't exercise they know the fact that they can increase there chances of having health problems as well as others problems like gain weight, lack of energy or cholesterol problems. I think that if students knows the facts of good nutritional habits they are less likely to make mistake and they will eat more right and make more exercice.

However, even if students understand the facts that doesn't mean that they will be more responsible about their food comsuption or their exercice habits, so that why I believed that students should learn everything in general that include facts, ideas and concept but not one more that they others. The importance of this is for the students to have a global understanding of a problem or a history event.
