'' FAILURE IS THE THE STEPPING STONE TO SUCCESS''

This is a very practical and a beautiful anecdote.  Many great  scientists , industrials, politicians and bussiness men, have proved this fact over and over again.

New inventions and creativity definetly brings success in one's life over a period of time. Innovative ideas will definetly help a person to be more creative and it also helps to build one's personality.

Successful people definetly try new things and take risks rather than doing the things they are familiar with.  Such type of people have more creativity, tenacity, a tremendous positive attitude towards life,and they are very much sincere in their efforts.

Great people like, Abraham Lincoln, Thomas Edison, Albert Einstein are the biggest examples of success.

Abraham Lincoln, has been trying to become a president since he was 21 years old and has finally achieved at the age of 52. this shows the tenacity of the man.
Thomas Edison did not have any formal schooling, he attended school only till the 2nd standard, later he was educated by his mother.   Just imagine a person under going schooling , has been able to achieve and invent new things, to such an extant that his name in history stood out as an outstanding achievment.

Therefore all these examples show us how successful people are. There main motto in life is: ''try and try till you succed''. such great scientists generally leave no stone unturned in their way of inventions or research.

''Practice makes a man perfect''  is very well demonstrated by such versatile achievers in life.
