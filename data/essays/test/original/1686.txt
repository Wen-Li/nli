Nowadays, young people don't spend much time for their communities. Some people would say it is not enough time, others would say you don't need to spend much time. As the callenges of  young people's life has changed, there is a reason for this change. We may not say that young people do a mistake, if they plan their time in a new way. 
The reasons for not spending time to helping their communities are many. One can be the lack of time, that arises from new challenges. Young people are faced to more competiton in education and worklife, and this forces them to cut off their spare time. If you do not have time, how should you help your community? Another fact is the bigger global movement of young people. They are not willing to spend much time for a local things like a community. If they arrive somewhere, they know that they will probably move to another place in a couple of years. Reasons can be their job, or an educational program abroad. This leads to a lack of motivation to spend a lot of time for your community, so you concentrate on studies or work and keep in contact with old friends. Keeping in contact can be e-mailing and travelling. How should you spend time in helping your community when you are not even physically available?
Young poeple who spend much time to help their community might know, that they do not want to move to other places. They may also have less other activities in their spare time or are not doing so hard studies or work. They may focus to the place where they live, and search for social contacts there. 
I think that people, who do not spend a lot of time by helping their community are not doing anything wrong. But if you are available, it would be nice, if you help your community.
