Advertisements are the crucial ways of an industry to earn profits by attracting the coustmers.I agree with the statement that most advertisements make products look better than they really are because the industry wants to atrract many coustmers by the adds and improve the product sales. so obviuosly the products should be shown better.
       Advertisements make the product look better by many means like covering with nice designs so that the coustmer feels to buy it.Also,adds don't tell the bad effects of the product so people are lightened with only the positive effects.
       As the advrtisements are the only means by which coustmers get to know about the product  products must be better shown than they really are.
       Every individual accepts the product if it is good so if the adds show them in real they may be dissatisfied with product and they refuse to buy.Although the process may decive the people but  i think it is a business trick to gain profits,afterall the object of any business firm is to gain profits.
       Some advertisements show the real picture of the product but may fail, like one of my friends car was put for a resale.He actually showed the real condition of the car with cracks on the body and dim colour,no one dared to buy it for the cost he expected.Then he realised the situation and improvised the texture of car in the add and then many coustmers flooded inn.Finally he sold the car for the cost he expected.
     Thus,most of the advertisements show the product better then it is.After advertising when coustmer coms for the buying of product the actual product must be showen and we have to tell him the bad effects of the product.And we have to convince him by decreasing the amount to that stated in the add.
        So,i agree to the policy that advertisements show the products better than they really are for the reasons i stated above like it is a business trick to attract the coustemers and thus the product sales would go up.
