However, being a princepal of  a company or enterprizing your own company, you could gain chance to be rich. In that sense, people does not follow tha same way as someone walked.

 Secand of all, from the social syclogy opinion, people has curiosty and need changing their life. If producting somethig fascisnating people, you can get opptunities to be rich. However, the products you believe intersting are always interestig for others. Spendig expensive money to produce new thing sometiomes means risking. There is no insurence. Yet you have to try everything need to make newthigs in advance. You make chance by yourself. Knowing that people need stimulanious one, it helps you.

 In our life, the world changed again and again, and the person who contributed to the these changes could successed. It is not easy to establish new things, however
