In my opinion the statement "Most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are" can in some cases be true, in others not. It always depents on the kind of product the advirtisement is referrring to.
One problem with advertisements nowadays is, that many things can easily be changed and improved with computersoftwares. 
If you look at an advertisemnt of a cosmetic product, like an anti aging cream on tv for example, you will always see a pretty woman with a perfect skin, which should be caused by that certain cream. So somebody who really has a problem like that might think, that if he  uses this cream, he will look like that as well, which is probably not true. This case shows that the advertisement definitly makes the product better than it actually is by using visual things like a pretty woman to convince customers. The same counts for example for washing powders etc., where washing results can easily be faked by using a computer programme or just using a clean piece of cloth instead of the cleaned dirty one, which they could never get that clean.
Another kind of product may be services. Companies can always tell a lot about which advantages they might bring you, but in reality everything might be different, like it happened to me when I went to Australia with a well known work and travel company. They promised help with jobsearch for example, but in reality they did not help me to find one job, they just had a very convincing advertisement.
Apart from the groups of products mentioned above, there are also products like electronics, cars etc. If there is an advertisement about a product like that, there will not be much to fake about it. You can get technical facts about the product, which can not be faked, otherwise it would be against the law, and if you  buy a product like that and it is does not work like it was supposed to be, you can easily complain about it and ask your money back.
So if you look at all the metioned points, you can finally say that it always depents on the product the advertisement is about and if it is possible to make it appear better than it actually is by visual effects.
