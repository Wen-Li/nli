Nowdays many people think young people don't spend enough time to help their communities. I don't find my self compleatly agree with this statement. I am 26 years old and I have many friends of my same age that work in their free time in carities association and I did too in the past. Anyway I can see that more  and more people just take care of their self, specially young people.
I worked as volonteed for caritas in my own town for a few years. I was spending there 2 hours per week each week, but then when I started the university, I moved in Bologna,  I couldn't save any time to work as volonteer and I stopped.  At this point, me and my family decided to adopt a child in Bangladesh, in this way I feel less guilty when I think to how many pooor people there are in world. 
Some people can object that I choose the easiest way. I could find something more close to me, and I think this is quite true. There are may old people in my little country that need help: as for example keeping their company, going to the supermarket, or going to the porst office, but I can't handle it. I don't have time enough for that.
Anyway adopt a child is better that nothing.
I have a few friends that help old people in their own city, or their grandparents at home. I think young people are sensible to the problems of their comunities, just if their own family let them be sensible to them, because the society doesn't give you any input about that kind problems, the society nowdays is too caotic and led you this just to money, and power.
I think young people would spend more time helping their comunities if they will be sensiblized to that kind of problems.
