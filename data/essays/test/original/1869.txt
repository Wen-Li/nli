Nowadays we live in a globalization world. We produce a lot  of things. We live in a world where quality it's not important, the most important thing is buying. The most we buy the most our economy grow up. In every moment of our life we see spots. When we are wathcing television we see a lot of spots of new mobile, new television, some new computers etc. We live in the consumism era. We always need the best moble, car or somethings like that. We need it because our society (economy), want that we spend our money. We usually spend our moneys for something that are unusefull for our life.
So if we want to buy a  mobile, we have to choose between 100 of it. There are many productores of the main produtc. We have samsung, lg, nokia, motorola, and probably they are all the same. 
I agree with this statement because it' real. When i buy somethings in its advertisements its seems the best one, but sometimes it break  up in a few months. I think, also that in our society advertisements have to tell lies. There are a lot of competition between the same product, because we have a lot of these, and sometimes they are all the same. At the end i buy somethings not for its qualities but for its aspect, and also for its spot.
I can "follow in love" for a mobile, if its spot is incredibly strange or amazing. We live in a society based on aspecs and images. I think that we are attract of what it is new and beautiful. For this reason we buy something that in its advertisament seem the best one, but we know that isn't true.
