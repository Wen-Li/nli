Some people say that young people, nowadays, do not give enough time to helping their communities. I think that nobody, actually, can do generalization about this question for the following reasons. 
It is impossible, for me, to measures the interest of young people in helping their communities. The second point I consider important to undeline is the tendency to criticate young people and to consider the people who lived in the past (especially young people) better than the people living in the present time.
I think that there are a lot of young people who give their time partecipating actively for the wellness of their communities. There are also boys and girls that are enthusiastic about this idea, but they don't have enough time because they spend most of their days studying or working. I think also that the quality of the time dedicated to these activities is more important that the strenght of the time spent on them.
Moreover, there are certainly young people that don't have much interest in helping their communieties. 
For me is important to underline that the problem is not the age; yes, I agree that it is a very good thing that youg people could give their time to helping their communities, but also all the component of the society (adult people and old people, men and women) have to be involved in this good project.
Finally I think that nowadays young people have more opportunities to become protagonists of the community they belong; thanks to the school and the spread of the media they can know better the main problems, and to feel better involved than in the past time in solving them.
