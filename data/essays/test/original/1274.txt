young people is a very important and useful in their society and their communities,they are the present and the future,big people had is building society ,and youth will take care about it and improve it by working in it ,

young people give a big part of their time and work for their communities  and their countries,they are a main part of it 

in my openion young people ,almost of them,do all the best they have to help their societies and improve it 

i will give you an examble for this,before two months their was I voted in kuwait,it was like a big party ,but their is some distroyers tried to cheat and buy people votes by many ways like paying money and give  a gifts, kuwaities young people maybe a thousand from them,worked hard to distroy them and help their country and their society from those cheaters,do you now why;because they love their community and take care of it 

so im not with any body who say that yuong people not  giving enough time to their society,they are warking hard to get best thing for thier
