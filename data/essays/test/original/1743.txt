I completely agree with the statement that most advertisements make product seem much better than they really are. This is very obvious because the major intention behind the advertisement is to promote a specific product among the public. So definitely the product will be projected with high values rather than displaying what actually exist. 

Firstly let us consider advertisement for a company X which deals with mutual funds.  They highlight only the attractive benifits that can be obtained from the investments in their company. They do not portray the complete details in the advertisement. So when a person see this kind of a attractive advertisement he is tempted to invest in such a company. Let us consider the company X as a new comer and so he goes bankrupt in few months. Ultimately the person who invested in the company will loose his money. Thus the advertisement misleads a person to invest in a wrong place  

The food products are yet another example where people get fooled easily by the looks and the appearance of products shown in the advertisement. When a advertisement for any food stuff is displayed the product is shown with great style and attractive colors. This misleads the people to buy such products and ultimately they get disappointed when they find it does not have such good taste as shown in the advertisement.

Finally let us discuss regarding the advertisements for garments. It is well known that when a new brand of clothes are released in the market, people easily get attracted to the newly released products. They take advantage of this common nature of people to attract them towards their product. Thus they end up creating really fascinating advertisement with all attractive offers and display garments which are really attractive in their advertisement . But does the company actually sell product with the same quality that is shown in the advertisement. No, they certainly aim at higher profit and so fool people with attractive advertisements.  

To conclude the advertisements definitely make product seen much better that they really are. Why do business people spend so much on advertisements? It is to show the cheap product with higher value. And surely advertisement is the most effective tool that is used to inplement this strategy.
