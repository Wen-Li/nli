In my opinion there are no signs why the number of cars should decrease in the next twenty years.
At first there is a common growth in world population even the number is declining in the industrial states.
As this is no sign for more cars of course you have to regard
the development of China for exemple. Its cross domestic product
is increasing with seven per cent a year what means they are able to buy more consumption products involving cars. Even local car  producer see China as the futur market and build facilities there.
What counts for China is also considerable for India and other Asian countries.
Moreover there are no alternatives for mid ranging destinations.
The bus support in bigger cities is well developped and to reach other cities you can go by train or airplane but the ones living in the wide spread suburbs are forced to take the car.
But in fact they are not only forced to do so, they want to because
it is much more convinient. You do not have to wait for the bus and you can go everywhere because the streets allow you to.
Another aspect that prevents the car from vanishing is more in people's head. Cars are symbols for the wealth and the social status of their owners which affects especially men and can not be denied.
This leads to buying behaviour that no bike will ever cause.
As a summary you can say that there are many good reasons why
cars will remain part of our society for at least the next few decades,
even if oil is running out soon engeneers are searching for methods
(like hydrogen) to keep the cars running.
