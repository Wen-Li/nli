I agree with the previous statement since during my High School years I have noticed that it is extremely important to understand certain ideas and concepts, but mostly understanding how to apply them to our life. Once you understand a concept, it is easier to get an entire picture of what you are being taught and it is also faster and easier to understand any following explanations on these same concept. When it comes to an exam, it is easier to discuss an idea and agree or disagree with it by using a reasonable argument. 

    On the other hand, it is also important for students to learn some facts because some academic aspects of subjects such as history and science can only be absorbed with our memory, and this is done by just remembering dates, names or numbers. There is no understanding involved in this process, which means that to a certain extent I also disagree with this statement. 
    
Some areas such as economics require that students really get to understand some theories and ideas, an example of this could be the understanding of the keynesian or monetarist theories, but at the same time it is important that in this same subject some fact learning is also implemented; an example of this could be the learning of economic definitions such as "Ceteris Paribus" or "Mutatis Mutandis". 
I decided to bring up this scenario due to the complexity of some areas within a student's studies, but most importantly to the fact that sometimes it is important to combine both reason and memory in our daily learning tasks.

    I actually believe that the most important of these two concepts being brought up in the passage is to understand ideas and concepts. Some of the most capable and inteligent beings in the world have reached their social, economical and it can be also argued that spiritual positions by understanding life and it's processes, but also by learning to listen to others and understand the human behaviour. Based on these thoughts, I would argue that understanding ideas and concepts is most important than learning facts.
