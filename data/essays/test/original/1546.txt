In my opinion, it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects. I think it essential to understand and evolve in our current society. Actually, it appears to me that it could help them to feel better with themselves and the others.
Firtstly, the best schools all over the world provide knowledge of many different academic subjects to their students. It shows that it is the best way to find a good job.
Secondly, studies are more interesting. By doing always the same things, you get bored very quickly.
And by the way, you could discover news passions and unexpected skills. For instance, I realize how important it was for me to write by learning literature. If I had only study mathematics, I would never be able to express myself and to write such good novels.
Moreover, people consider that it could be hard a jod without a specialization in one specific area. But, I totally desagree with them. I do believe that the best way to learn and to understand all the topics of a subject is to be able to have a broader view. You can learn the details by the practice of the subject. 
Furthermore, a large knowledge help people to be more open minded. For example, you understand the different behaviors when you know the different religions and beliefs. If everybody had a larger knowledge, they would no longer make war.
Finally, people have to learn the more they could. Up to me, they have to be curious and intereste on everything they could met in their life. Because if they did not, they would be afraid for the rest of their life. It is well-known that people are scare of the unknown things.
