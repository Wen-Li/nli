now days we are expose to a incredible ammaunt of adverting on tv, news papers, magazines and almost every where you look, all this adds you see are there to promout a special product.

I tottaly aggre with the statement that says that most of the advertisements make products seem much better tha they really are, because of several concepts.

Firstable it is well know that in the advertising field, you learn to persuede people for doing, eating, buying even going where you want, that is why when you work as an advertiser you need to convince people that you ar right and that you have the best option of what they are looking for.
For example if someone is trying to promote a new soda, that might be compiting with a very popular one, lets say Coca-Cola, they should start convinsing people that it's product is better than the one they all ready know, and how do they do that? by letting you know the good things about this product, for example the is a new flavor, with a very innovate packeging, and is sugar free, this are real properties of the product, but compiting with Coca-Cola is not easy, so the advertiser stars liyng, that is maybe because now days people is no easy to wow!, so they star telling you that besides all this good propertis, the new soda is also going to help you to lose wigth witch is a lie. 

An other important thing is that with all the new technology, people can make us see what ever they want on tv and the worst of all is that we as a consumers believe almost avery thing they show us.
Is is very sad to see how day by day we have been falling for masive consuminsm, that dosent give us other way than to spend every time even more an more money on unusefull items that dosent by happines.
