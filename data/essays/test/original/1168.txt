I agree that successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing  what they already know how to do well.
   
  There are three specific reasons and examples to support my answer.
   First, most all of them have various questions. 
So, as they try new things, they would have a lot of experiences and find out special things that the other people don't know.
   Second, most all of them are not afraid of trying new things.
They have very strong courage.
   Last, they have the strong ritual that make them stronger and stronger.
                         
   Therefore, I agree successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well. 
And also I think that trying new things and taking risks make people succeessful.
