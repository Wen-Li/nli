Some people hols the opinion that aadvertisement can make products seem much better, others, however contradict this opinion. As far as I am concerned, I would agree the atatement. In a way, the products' benefits are enlarged by the advertisement. there are too many reason and examples to support my opinion.

There are numerous reasons why I agree with the above opinion, And I will explain some of the most important ones. The main reason is that, most advertisements are overaclaimed. It can be given a concret example, on television, we can offen see the medicine ads. The medicine always be discribed as a magic cure-all. 

Another reason why I advocate the attitude for the above attitude is that it is unreliable for us to trust the advertisement company.Those kind of companys may speak too much lies in order to sell the productions,that would let them make a great amount of money.

One very strong argument of a is that, in our country, the government has not issue the regarding laws or rule about the advertisements. This demonstrates the undeniable fact that there would be a lot of unreliable advertisements on our television shows. We consumers must chose the goods carefully in person in stead of the useless and unbelievable avvertisements.

However, as the saying goes " Every coin has two sides", advertisements also has adventages, forexample, we can know many informations about the goods we interested in. We can get a guidance about the world's fasion. further more,not all the advertisements are unreliable. But if all the factors are compared ,the disadvantages of advertisement carry more weight than those of its benefits. From what has been discussed, we can finally draw the conclusion that most advertisement make products seem much better. So, I agreee the statement.
