This is an important topic, and I suppose it has been discussed for years and that will be discussed for years to come by professors and all the people involved in the teaching and learning system. But, in my opinion, there could be no doubt of which is best for students. I am sure that is far more important for students to understand concepts and ideas, rather than simple facts. That way, they not only learn new things, but also learn to think and to develope their imagination and ceativity.
Take for instance the example of a student in the secondary school that is preparing a history exam. If he only learn the facts of what he is reading, say for instance, the french revolution, he probably won`t understand the development of events and the effects that they have in modern history. By thinking about the ideas and concepts that are the basement of the revolution, he would be able to get a more useful picture of the topic, he will probably remember more things, and above all it will be useful for his life. 
Talking about imagination, I can say that is also another desirable effect of understanding ideas. Take for example the gravity law: if a student only focuses his attention in the units used to express the acceleration of gravity, and such technical details, he will probably miss the core of the thing. Gravity is something that involves everyhing in our world, and is most important to understand its effects and implications than if it is expressed in foots or meters. And imagination comes there to help understand all of this.
When talking about creativity, I can give an illustrating example that clarifies it. Think about great inventors, like Benjamin Franklin. By understanding ideas and putting them togheter in new ways, he was able to achieve very relavant inventions and technical advancements that are today still used.
On the whole, I would say that we should pay more attention to this topic, and focus our efforts to giving the students the tools they need to understand things, not only remember them like a robot could do.
