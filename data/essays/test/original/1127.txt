There are various types of successful people.  Although most of successful people want to keep do things what they already know how to do well, and to get the best ability of their work, successful people, who always try new things and take risks, can be the best of the successful people.  When people try new things, even though they do not know how many risks they have to take, they cannot lose their focus.  However, people feel relaxation and pleasure when they finish or recognize about the things successfully. People always learn perfectly from their own experience.  Although people learn some things by reading or listening, it cannot be perfect.  What it means is if people try new things a lot, then they will learn and get as much information as possible by experience of the new things.  On the other hand, people who keep do what they already know, cannot be better then the people who try new things everytime, because of lack of experience. Actually, try other things every time without knowing how to do well on the thing which people usually do, will be worse, because although people try lots of things, it cannot be clear the work and it means people just skip every things.  However, if people do as many things as they can do, it will bring the people more success, happyness, and comfort.  Also if people try many things, those things can be benefits of the people.  For example, when I was really young like 12 years old, I usually sketched what I could see.  I was not good artists at that time, but these ability kept remain in my body and about 2 years later, I got a project from school.  The project was to create my own dance.  It was so hard to me to create new dance, even though I danced a lot before.  What I thought at that time was creating dance with using my sketches.  So I draw about 100 movements of simple dance which I made before.   I cliped all the papers and flipped every papers.  So the stopped movements of dance started to move like cartoon.  If I just danced it by using my body, I could not get A+ on that project.  As I mentioned before, trying new things can make people more successful, even though the people fail or clear the things.
