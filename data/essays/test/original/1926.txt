Business isn`t based on marketing?

I believe that nowadays it`s seem to be much important the way of we appear than the real behaviour of a person so i agree with the statement.

I usaually watch television and everytime during films or talkshow or other television program i`m fired by advertisement of any products,I believe that an adult should have a complex and structurated point of view about what he is seeing but a child need an help to better understand those type of images and messages.

And what about products they suggest?Advertisements  are studied to increase the attention on that good but many time that good isn`t a real thing that ,can be increase my style of life... maybe not.But colors music, the background where they built the advertisement make me feel better and i finally believe that it was created only for me.
The stronger example  can i bring are Mc Donald`s advertisements or mobile phone advertisements last week i have watched for hours television and at least i`ve eaten 20 hamburger and i`ve changed about 5 telephones in 5 hours.

I like watching television all around the word and i can affirm that everywhere advertisement are studied for the same purpose and are designed in the same way because everyone it`s made at the same way.
