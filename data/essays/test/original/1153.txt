everyone has their own opinon for this agument.in my mind ,i do not agree the statement.I think learning the facts is more important for students to undestand ideas and concepts.

learning facts is important for students.from the facts,we can know the real thing what we learned.some people says practise makes perfect.That is why we should learn the facts.through the facts , we can gain many different ideas.take a sceintist for example ,everyone  knows the plane is prodused by two great scientist.they devoted their life to make planes.tboth of them do not accord to ideas to make out the planes.they learn the facts.they take many excisement.and try to fly in the sky .they take their whole life in the creer.finally ,priactse again and again .finally ,the plane prodused.
so ,we should learn fact,from the facts ,we could know where we do not understand and where we made a mistake so that we will never make some mistake in the futher.learning from the facts ,we can also get ideas and concepts for ourselvse.it is more deeply emphomotion than we understanf ideas.and we can learn the facts ,and taech ourselves how to solve problme by our own.
howerve,there also are some advantages for understanding ideas and concepts.If people have some trouble in sometimes,we can use some ideas which we understand immedierly to save ourselvse for those troubles.
so i thinkwe can learn many facts when we in the chidrenhood,train our abilitise,a
