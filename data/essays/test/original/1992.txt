I think today young people are seperated into two groups. One group`s members only think of themselves. Helping to their communities is not a serious responsibility for them. They only aim to live their lives in the best way they can. The second group`s members are trying to change something in the world. They want to be helpful and prevent the factors that may create negative effects.

Nowadays, I think the number of the second group`s members are increasing. Young people are now more sensetive about communities. The are trying to be a part of something. And communities are the best places for them to reach their aimes. I think there shuold be more encourage to guide these young people to communities. As I mentioned above, the number of these people increase but the not with the same ratio of their nations population. So in my opinion the number of people who help the communities are not enogh today. 

When we walk on the street we can see a lot of young people walking around, spendig their times with unnecessary things. If the governments can guide these people, it is sure that their communities will develop them selves faster. And this will be for the benefit of all members. I think education system of schools can guide these people succesfully.
