I think that it is better to always try to take risks, risks make people succsesful because, for example when you risk something and you loose the next time you do it you will know how to do it and you will do it good, like they say in my country "the people that doesn't risks  doesn't win" that is because even failing makes you more experienced in what you did.
The people that doesn't risk anything have boring lives because their lives are always the same, they live in a circle because they do the same things every day.
In my opinion life should be fun, and where is the fun in doing always the same thing. All the big ideas and businesses are made by taking risks. But taking risks doesn't just applies to business, it applies to everything and every day.
For example i want to go to study  to a college in the US, but i could just stayed in my country and study a carrer there. So i am taking the risk to see if i can have a better life. The people that doesn't take risks in most of the cases are people with problems because they think that their life could be worse and they could get to a bigger failure, but if instead they take the risk and they succeed they would feel better and they can be better people. 
I think that one of the best things about taking a risk is the feeling that you tried to change something for the best even if you fail, taking risks makes your life more intense and interesting, and that is a healthy way of living because you are making an effort to change your life and not to keep it that way and just see the oportunities passing by, and thaths why i think that taking a risk is better and why i always try to take risks.
