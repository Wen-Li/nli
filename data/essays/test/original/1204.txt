     The statement suggest that young people are not giving enough time to help their communities and I think that is true to some young people but not to all. The reason for that is, I, myself, who is 18 years old, have hardly ever participate in helping communities in a last decade, but I know some people do help comunities.
     First, I do not participate and help my community is because I do not know anything about my community. I do not know what they do, when they meet or I sometimes feel "does it actually exist?" The reason that I do not know anything about my community is because I have never talked or taught about it. It is not compulsory thing to do, so many adults around me never asked me to help. The point here, which I want to say is that sometimes it is not only for the young's fault that they do not help their communities, but also it is adults' fault.
     However, I saw many times on TV programmes, in magazines and newspapers that many young people help for the communities, not only local and close community but also for distant communities. These young people try to clean public with their communities to preserve good public hygiene, so that people who live their can live comfortably. Also, old people cannot work these because they are hard-work, so young people do these for them.
     Also, in Japan, we have huge festivals that done by communities over the year, many young people participate in preparance of festivals. Moreover, many young people help to sell commodities to participants during the festivals. They do not feel reluntant abuot them, they are actually enjoying themselves, helping festivals.
     In conclusion, because of these things I have mentioned above, many young people are actually working for their communities. Ofcourse there are the young who are not, but still, many youngs are participating and
