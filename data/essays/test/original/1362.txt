I agree with the statement that "most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are" because I really tasted it.
 Not only advertisements, but also spots on tv make believe that. 
 Not all spots are true. They show the product as they want the product is seen by people. This is a terrible and huge mistake by the publicitarians because people go to the shop, buy th product and then clients are not satisfied by the product itself. 
 For example this mistake can be related to the bought of a pair of jeans, like in my case. After I saw a paper publicity of a pair of jeans, last week I went to Rinascente in Monza to buy that pair of jeans. Once I was arrived, I went to the first floor looking for the jeans and when I found them I was really surpraised because they were not seem to be like the one's on the paper advertisement. When I saw that, I did not buy the jeans and I went to another shop in which I found a pair of pants that I really enjoyed. 
 Another example is what is non-mentioned in and an advertisement: pheraps the product  can seem beautiful but it can be very and much expensive. 
It is all a question of language used for show products. There are different types of language and it is necessery find out the most appropriete to show a product. 
Nobody says that is necessery follow fashion, rather than advertisement. 
 It stays at each person judging if a spot is true or not. Fortunately there are different ways of thinking e so everyone can make his choise independently by others. Everyone has freedom of thinking and it is very, very important to make one's choises.
