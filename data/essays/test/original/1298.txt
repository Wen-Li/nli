I totally agree with that statement. There are lots of products presented as the best ever and that there will be never again a better one.
As an exampel can be mentioned the automobile industry. Often they  present their cars in advertisments as one of the fastest but on the other hand as one of the most friendly ones to nature. But how can an fast car with lots of horsepower be friendly to nature. The pollution of  an car with lots of horsepower is still very high even it is already lower compared to older cars which were produced years ago.
Also mentionable ist the cell phone industry. How often is explained in their commercials why everybody should use one specific cell phone. A producer of cell phones for example create an new cell phone and promote it as the best one for managers or people with  leading positions in companies, because it has special features which will make their work and daily life much more easier. But after a while first test are published and these ones show all the mistakes which were made during the production process. The only choice a consumer who had bought one of those cell phone has is to buy a new one or update his one with new software. But he never can be sure that all mistakes will be deleted through such an software update. The producer will then offer the same cell phone model with new features and without the mistakes of the older model a few month later.
An other point is that in advertisments often the products are so easy be put together. In these commercials the consumer is told that by putting the product together you have only to pull there and to do this and so on. For example a baby bed which a friend of me bought. She tried to stand it up to place her little baby in it. According to the directions and the commercials a woman could put it together an her own, at the end we were five people trying to put it togther.
