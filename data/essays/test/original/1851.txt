I agree to the statement that successful people try to continue seeking the innovation. 
I have two reason to support my idea as follows.

Firstly, the phylosophy of market has big reason for the successful people to try new things. In case the one company successed the business by some business scheme or business method in one market. The other company will, without doubt, try to enter the market by means of the similar business scheme or method, which requires slight cheaper cost than the one required by the original scheme or method. Then the following company will increase the share in the market. The company successed firstly in that market will be obliged to change the method in order to survive in the market. 
In such situation, the company, which successed firstly in the market, has two choices. which contains the change of the original method and move to the different market. 
The successful people trys to change their style constantly, though it has the different extent, since they understand the above phylosophy of market or economical system.

Secondly, characteristics of the successful people may have the effect. The target of the management of the company is eventually to expand the businss opportunity or business volume as much as possible. Successfull people who manages the company has the same target in their life. Therefore, successful people drive the company to try new thing and take risk to develop the comapny.
