There are several ways to become successfull.
Some people are always doing new things others only do what they know how to do well.
In the text it is stated that successfull people try new things and take risks rather than doing what they already know.
In my oppinion that is wrong.
I think that if someone is successfull he is doing something in which he is realy good.
I want to point out several examples for that.
If someone wants to become a successfull soccerplayer he needs a lot of practice.Only if he learns certain abilities he is able to succeed in a compitition.It is not possible for him to try out several new ways of life because if he would do so he lacks time he needs for his training.
In all fields of competition people need to have special qualities which can only be gained by sticking to a certain goal.
The second example is a great musician.A pianist needs to start learning his instrument while being a child.Furthermore he has to keep on going with playing to become better.If he would quite in order to do something else he wouldn t be as good as if he has kept on practacing.
What I try to say is even if you know something very well you can become better.And to become successfull you have to be perfect in what you are doing.
Another reason why I disagree with the statement is that people who stay in theire fieled of competence get to know other people who can help each other.For example a  if narrator talkes to another it might raise his creativity.
The conclusion can be made that knowing how to do something perfect leads to success.
