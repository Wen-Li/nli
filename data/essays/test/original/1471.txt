I agree with the statement that travelling in a group and should be led by an experienced tour guide. Then that tour would be full of fruitful and sweet moments to cherish and recall. I would like to state the reasons gradually why it requires a tour guide for the new place which we are visiting.

        First and foremost, an experienced guide might have a plan outlining the places, order of visit, time needed to spend and taking care of lodging (if required). At this  point, I would recall my personal experience with my family members in the tour with a guide.

                We visited all the spiritual and tourist places in northern part of our country(India). The guide was perfect in planning the logistics and  places of visit. The guide has planned our itinerary touring 25 places, lodging and food. Most of all he covered all the places in stipulated amount of time.

                              The guide had fixed specific amount of time for each place of visit. So that, we dont spend more amount of time in one place and spend less in other. He had taken care of food and lodging requirement in each place of visit.
 
                            Some historic and spiritual places require a person who is well versed with the origin of the place and any specific mythical stories related to the place. This kind of information could be available from the guide. The guide would make everyone at ease by revealing the invaluable information to us. On the other hand, this information could be available from the books at the site, but this would require a reading through the book and understand. The information from the book might be supplemented to the information which guide has given us.
                            
                             Since it is the group of people visiting places, it allows to develop the sense of fraternity among everyone in the trip. A sense of belongingness and  meeting differnet personalities takes us to different horizon of thinking. It would be lot of fun going as a group and enjoying it.
