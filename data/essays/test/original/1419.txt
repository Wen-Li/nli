The assignment of the advertisement is to show the advantages of a product, because the people should buy it. But here is the problem. Some advertisements show a product better than it really is. The people thing something of a poduct, buy it and then see the truth of it. In my opinion that is the problem of the strong competition in this century. Firms want to survive in the market and so work with all opportunities.  The customers should buy their products and not the products from another firm and for that reason they also work with unfair things. 
A very good practical example for that problem are the work of the energy firms in germany. The advertisement of these firms show low prices and the best available conditions. But last week the newspapers wrote about some (not puplic) negotiations of the energy firms where they bargained a common price level of energy. The customers, the government etc. did not know anything about that negotiation process and after a while you heard in the TV that one energy firm increase their prices. After some days the next firm increase their prices and so on. The problem here is that the customer do not have the opportunity to change the energy supplier, because all have the same conditions. And so the customer cannot do anything against this. 
So you can see that this problem in the advertisement comes from the strong competition. If the competition would be of a normal level then the customers would get what they see. The competition is very important for functioning of the market, but the firms should recognize the customer value. The customer confidence is the main driver for their firm success. But if the customers do not confident in the firms and their products than the firms cannot survive anymore. 
My message to the firms are: Recognize the customer value, because they buy your products. So make a true advertisement of your goods.
