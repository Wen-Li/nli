Most advertissememts make products seem much better than they really are. This a reality because this is the base of advertising theory and methods.

Adertissememt is used to make people buy the product or the service displayed. In this prospect, we can easily undertsand the advertising mechanism since it adapts to human sens of reacting. We are appealed to something that we consider as useful, cheap but above all beautiful. Conseauently, the main aim in an ad is to display a product in an invented reality which is aimed to make people react and dream. We can take for example a mere product, a yoghourt. At first sight nothing is really appealing and beautiful, its function is to be eated and good at a taste level. But the criteria are not sufficient and distinguishing in front of all the yoghourts sold in the market. The role of advertissememt is to make the product different from the others that is to say better. The yoghourt will be displayed as for example a necessary aliment when you are in vacation or the better yoghourt for your digestion.

Advertissememt can also make products seem much better than they really are because the integrate the product in a kind of history, a context.For examle, the bed displayed by the ad is integrated in a beautiful bedroom with design furniture. The bed is better in this context than in your own bedroom. 

Make the product displayed in the ad seem much better than a reality is a means which underpins the main principe of advertising theories. Peolpe must be catched by the ad so all the advantages of the product are exagerated. The consumer who copes with advertising mass and profusion is less and less attentive to these ads, this is too much like they qre used to saying.Consequently,  adertisors must find the distinction which is going to make the difference. And the solution is, in most of the cases, displayed a product in an astonishing atmosphere and with amazing advantages like no others. Don t mind to do false advertising...
