During 20th century, advertisement has become an important sector of the global economy. The need to expand its own activities, the growth of many industries fighting for reaching new markets and the new desires of the population influenced the rise of the advertisement importance.
A lot of companies have invested great amounts of money to develop their own advertisement sectors. Advertisement is a sector with the specific purpose to develop the imagine of a product, in order to increase its sales.

One of the tecnique used by advertisement is to present products much better than the really are. This purpose is related to some objectives:
- the imagine of a product could hide some bad elements, by which a product is made;
- sometimes the presentation of a product is also used to increase the desire of the population. This process produces the need of some products in the behaviour of the population. 

Sometimes the tecnique to present a product in a better way than it is, could be a boomerang. It's demonstrated that when a product, promoted with false advertisement spots, reveals some negative elements, the markets remain very affected and could take distance  from all the prodcuts of a company. 

It shows that sometimes, an incorrect advertisement publicity doesn't guarantee the effectives desired.
