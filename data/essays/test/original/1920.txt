From my point of view as a consumer, I totally agree with the statement that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are. There are several examples to support it.
    To begin with, there are full of toothpastes in out market. some of them are made to attract people who want their tooth become more bright. The seller made the advertisement which described a man whise tooth was dark three weeks ago, but after he used the amazing toothpaste, his tooth now is brighter! I think many prople will be haunted by it. I was one of them. I went to the supermarket and bought one to dry, but as you know, it was in vain.
    Moreover, the women in Asia dedicated themselves to make their skins become more white. Hundred of products were designed to serve this appeal. As I can remember, one year ago, I bought a so call fantasy lotion which would not only whiter your skin and also protect you from the sun light. However, after my roommates and I used it for two months, none of us became whiter!
    Last but not least, young ladies are always concern their body shapes and weights. There are countless medicines and loss weight oils in the market. I never believe that we can lose weight only by taking pills, so I never buy them. But one of my friends was crazy about it. She bought a lot of products that have lose weight function. But she always complain to me that "The medicine was a lie." Sometimes the advertisement describes their product with exaggerations. We must have to know it.
    In conclusion, I was the victim of advertisements. I spend a lot of money to buy them but the results are really limited. I think all of us should be aware that some of the advertisements are not as good and effecive as they presented.
