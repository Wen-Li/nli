After high development of capitalism, companies are tring to sell more than others in the market. And only way to sell more is introduce your products better than others. So this is the main reason of increse in  advertisement sector and wrong informations in the ads.
    Of course most advertisements make product seem much better than really are  Because customers of the advertisements want to sell more. But it is not easy to achieve that target because of features of a  product. What ever you say about your produc it is obvious that how much does it worth. if producers do not increse quality of the product the purchase level of the product will remain. and in that point affect of the advertisements starts.
   Advertisements in the Tv and newspaper show us very affective features of the product but they never show us weaknesses they had. For example in some tv ads we see that a kind of bleach is cleaning all over the house with the touch of a kid even if how dirty is. but it is not easy to clean houses as we see in Tv. Another example is a car advertisement. In the ad there is a special car and while driving car turns on a robot and starts to run. of course everyone knows that car will not turn on a robot but advertisements try to make us think about that car is superior than others. there ar thousands of example like that.
   consequently I can say that it is common to show your products much  better than its worth in market. that is the only way to increase your profit without any development in your product. so I know that too many  companies will follow that to increase their profit.
