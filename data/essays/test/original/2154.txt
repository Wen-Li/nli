The statement that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are is convincing to me. When I think about main purpose of advertisements, that is to maximise profits, I can get clearer picture as a whole. These are two reasons that support my opinion.

  Firstly, advertisements use 'quoting' but do not use it as a simple way. In other words, advertisement do not tell whole truth about the products that companies try to sell. For example, movie producers often quote some critics' review of their movies like - "funny and thrilling, but no more - XXX news".  In  this sentence,  advertisement uses only part it needs like this - "funny and thrilling". In part it is still true but the advertisement is not giving potential customers the whole truth about its movie.  The advertisement makes the movie seem better through quoting critic's review in a distorting way.

  Secondly, advertisements use exaggeration to maxise an impact of their message to cusomers. For example, in the advertisement of car insurance, a car accident occures to mother and daughter in the middle of the night where are no passign cars. This advertisement makes views, who have a car, worried and scared. However, when people carefully think about the situation it is not convincing because there is no explanation why the accident happened and why the mom and daughter in that dangerous situation. The advertisement express only extreme situation which we might never meet in life time. 

   In conclution, because main goal of the advertisement is making profit most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are. Quoting and exaggertion are two main solutions of advertisemet.
