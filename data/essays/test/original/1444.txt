Considering the existing petroleum resources will be eventually used up within decades, it is possible that in twenty years, there will be fewer cars running on the streets than today. Also, if we take into account that people may be more conscious about the pollution and damages caused to the environment while we are driving, it also may result in the overall increase in the usage of the public transportation in the future. Perhaps, people might even think about switching to bikes instead, resulting in the overall number of cars being used to decrease sharply. This is only one possibility of how the story may end. If we turn to see what is on the other side,  there  may lie an entirely different answer.

Knowing the consequences of driving, what it can do to the remaining natural resources and our environment, measures have been taken to avoid further damage as well as to seek our solutions for our future. 

Speaking from the environmental perspective of the matter, for example, I have seen on the news people are starting to purchase permits to emit carbon dioxide into the atmosphere or by taken actions by growing more trees, hoping to do their share of saving the environment. Although these are just small steps, but I am optimistic that in the future, we will find many other methods that we can involve more people into protecting the earth. Therefore, simply because someone is concerned with what their driving to work is doing to the environment, instead of giving up driving entirely, they might just take on other actions to lessen their guilt.

Having addressed the problem concerning pollution, the other problem with driving in the future is that we will eventually run out of petroleum. Luckily, we seem to have found the solution to this problem. In recent years, researchers in many fields have tried to find alternative methods and resources to replace petroleum in the future. For instance, using solar energy could be a possible method. In the department of Mechanical Engineering of National Taiwan University, a professor has led his students to complete a project, building a car that runs on solar panels, and that turned out to be a success, winning international awards and recognition. Who is to say what else can happen in the future, in this day of rapid technological revolution? If that project can extend further, making the solar energy cars available to everyone, it is very likely that people would not want or have to give up their luxuries and comfort of driving.

Overall, as grim as some of the problems may seem at times, I believe the old saying "there's a will, there's a way". Human beings have proven to have endless capacity, especially at time of needs, so who knows what the future may bring? So let's have our fingers crossed, and I bet in twenty years, there would still be as much cars running on the streets, if not more.
