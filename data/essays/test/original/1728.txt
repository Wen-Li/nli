I totally agree with statement which says that successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know to do well.     
    First of all, if someone is doing something like they always do and what they know better, they can't see different things.
Of course some people could think that trying new things could bring unexpectful risk or demege, so it is better to do what they know aready. I saw a lot of people like that, but they don't even know they really like what they do. They just do that becuase they know this only and better. And they don't want to take any risk for that. But I believe that someone who brave will eventually have what they want. I think life is too short for doing same things. I believe that we have to do what we want and try a lot of things to look for what we really have passion.   
    Furthermore, if we try new things, there are more possibility of getting oppurtunity for diffent and new things. Unless you try new things, you wouln't even know what they are and how it will make your life change. We have perverb in my country which is " Frog in bowl can't know out side of bowl and believe the inside bowl is wolrd."
It represents that people who is not try new things and routine what they know and stick with it. If we take risks and look for others things to do, we can see more than even we imagined before. And finally find what we want to do. They that will lead us to success.
    To sum up, I stongly believe that successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know to do well, because I think that brave one will get what they want and success.
