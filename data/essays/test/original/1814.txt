A successfull person is a man (for example) that can solve a very diffucult problem easily.
For solve asily a difficult problem you must use your knowledgment.
I think that there are many way to enlarge the knoledgment of a people.
To solve a problem you must do some steps for expand your knowlidgment.
The first is : research about the problem to solve and study the best of possible the argument.
The second is : talk with others people about your problem and listen the solution that they propose.
The final step is : try the solution. This step is more important to learn.
From your results obtein trying a solution you can know many things about the contest of your problem .
If a man doesn't make any experiment he can' t  
create a new invention, he can' t find new solution , he can' t have a complete visual of the contest , in other words , he doesn't expand his knowligment.
A successful person must try new things that he doesn't know .
In this way you can have an advantege with the other .
With trying the things we can find solution about a problem or  experiments a new farmacol that permit to save many lifes .
So i agree with the statement that say that successful people must try new things and in this way take the risks .
If you don' t try you can' t find a solution and you can 't make a successful person.
