Along with the education for more people, we should think how to educate is more benefit to students. Some people believe that students should learn more facts than ideas and concepts. However, in my point of view, perceptions are relative, to understand more ideas and concepts is superior. In the following passages, I will show a variety of unique reasons to demonstrate my personal idea.

In the first place, to learn many ideas and concepts can permit students to have a overall understanding of the field. Imagine that if a teacher all the day show some trivial facts about biology, what can be learned to students, even they do understand what the subject is. So I believe that student should learn some ideas and concepts, don't you think so? 

In addition, to know many ideas and concepts can allow students to grasp more subjects. If we take a large amount of time to something detailed, definitely, we do not have extra time to the whole subject. At the end, students can not learn nothing about the ideas and concepts, it is indeed pity, isn't it?  

Finally, to study many ideas and concepts can provide studedts an opportunity to comprehend knowledge more deeply. As a students, I feel the most sigificant to learn widely. Before we make the decision what we will major in, we are better to learn more.

To sum up, I am not sure how wise I am, however, given the choices, I absolutely feel that to learn some ideas and concepts is much better. A great education gives a man a great pull. In this way, we can learn something more widely, faster and more deeply.
