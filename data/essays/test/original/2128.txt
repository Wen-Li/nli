I absolutly agree with these statement. I think that is the secret of real success. Important is allways what you whant to do with your live. For some people is it good enought to get the old bakery from her fathers. They know this bakery since they are childs, they know what to do, and this is all they want to do through the rest of their lifes. That might work, to an certain point, but what  if anything changes? For someone who try new things all the time and who risks something is it easier to to make a decission suddenly.  Someone who alllways go foreward in his live will also find new things. New things bring you the success. But if anybody stands allways still, he will never find something new. It can allways fail to risk something but it can also benefit you.
