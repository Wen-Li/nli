Advertisements, exsiting every where, floods into our modern life silently. Thus people are annoyed by invading of diverse advertisments, moreover, advertisements,mostly, misleading people by widening the function of products.

From a ordinary customer's persective, most advertisements provde us many error informations which do not correspond to their real situations. For example, in the area I live in, the shoping mall often make huge outdoor advertisment advocating that it would send lots of cash returns for cutomers. Many people go to the mall, and perchase different kinds of goods. Finally, when they are expecting the return promised in the advertisement, the mall is always giving another explaination which is so flexible that people cannot find a convicing way to refute.

Sometimes, advertisements are democrated by the producer elaborately, and cutomers are attracted by their persuading appearance. One month ago, I saw a telephone advertisement in the television. The multi-function of the cell phone caught my heart immediately. As the introducement of television, this cell phone has the powerful function of camero and vidieo, and the most impressive is that the advertisement make a clear and complete exposition about the funtion in the television. Consequently, I broght it and found that it is not like the said of the advertisement.

In fact, we could not live without advertisements because we need the information they provide to pick us what we really want to buy, which save lots of times and energy. However, we find it hard to tell how about the products after interfereing by the advertisement because they usually widen the forms or function of the products. My mum's experience is one instance. Last week,she planed to buy a sweater. She saw the advertisement of one brand woolen sweater and was attracted by the low cost. After she brought it, she found that this sweater contains only 30% woolen.

I have to admit that advertisement play crucial role on our life. Yet, they also have harmful effect on our life becuase of their false.
