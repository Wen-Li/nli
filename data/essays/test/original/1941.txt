Nowdays,more and more people will go travelling during their holidays.Some of them will travel in a group by a guide.Others will travel alone or only with their friends.And in my opinion,travelling with a tour guide maybe my first choice.
Among various advantages that travel with a guide are comfortable and convenience.Because the tour guide often own lots of knowledges about the travel,if you travel with them,comfortable is obvious.For instance,when you want to travel in a foreign country,the language barrier is the most improtant problem for you.I can't learn the whole languages in the world.But at this time,if a tour guide is with you,the problem will solve easily.Most of them have strong abilities to using foregin language.You can communicate with local people through the guide's translating.And you also don't worried about you will cheat by the local people.Because the guides often have responsibilities to prevent their travel's member cheating when they travelling.And all of these will make you comfortable.
Equally important advantage is it is very convenience with a guide.First,the guide will book the room when you travel in some places of interest.You don't worried about you can't live near the places which you will travel.Sometimes you can't find any hotels to live in some famous places.And guides will solve the problem for you.Futhermore,the guide will make a very good plan for the travellers and you can learn lots of information by them.After the guide's explaintation,the understanding of culture,custom and histroy will increase greatly.And you don't bring a very heavy book which is introduce the places' interest.And you will feel the trave is a very convenience thing.
And in fact,if you travel alone and don't with a guide,you may feel freedom.You can go any places that you want to go and get up at any time that you want.In my opinion,everyone has different choice for the way to travel.If you like travel very much and want to be more freedom,travelling alone is good,But on the other hand,if you want to travel easily and comfortably,letting a tour guide with you is better.
