People are watching many kinds of advertisemets from TVs, internets, or magazines. Advertisements show their products which are cellphones, TVs, for example. I agree that the most advertisemets make products seem much better than they really are and they should change thier tricks, in my opinion. While I was shopping in internet, I found the jacket which would fit on to me. I finally bought the jacket from internet, but I disappointed to the product and promised myself that I will never shopping in internet. The product in front of my eyes and picture was completely different. Color was darker, and picture did not even show to me the specific parts. Advertisements are making their products better looking to people and the most people believe its picture. Another example, the laptop from the advertisement looked the best laptop till now. The laptop from the circuit city, however, looked similar to other laptops and made people to lose faith the brand which advertised. In my opinion, every brand is advertising its produts because brands want to be popular and famous. Some brands are doing with jealous, and some are trying to trick to people to buy products with little fake. As everyone realizes, most brands want to sell their stuffs and be popular among people. People, however, will disappointed and not find brands anymore if they trick to them which means make products seem much better than they really are by advertisements. On the other hand, if they show the truth and improve their products, people will slowly find them, and they will be able to be popular, even if what brands are. In summation, most advertisements should not make products seem much better than they really are, they will have to make products seem the same what they really are when people come to shopping to your brands!
