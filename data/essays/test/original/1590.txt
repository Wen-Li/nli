 Although some people think that is more important for students to have knowledge based on facts, I think that is more valuable for them to understand ideas and concepts. I support this because in this way, students know a variety of topics, can use this knowledge in order to develop their own point of view and also using this ideas they can develop their own concepts. In the following paragraphs I am going to explain this benefits and also give some examples in order to explain my position.

    First of all, understand ideas and concepts is useful because students can discuss a variety of topics that their teachers have transmited to them in classes. For example, I remember one opportunity, I was in my work and I had to discuss about Marketing and by using my knowledge about a theory that my teachers explain me I culd support my opinion. Another benefit is that when you know concepts, you can build up your own point of view, this means that you evaluate different ideas that you have recibed and decide what is your position. For example, when an student is learning about the differences among a variety of religions. They leanr about the philosopy of each religion and they can decide which one is better for them.

    Moreover, using ideas and concepts students can develop their own concepts. So, they not only evaluate information, but also create new information. This is what happens in many chemestry labs, they have the knowledge and discover new theories.

    As a conclusion, In my opinion is more important for learnears to understand ideas ans concepts than learn about facts, due to the reasons that I explained before. I think in the future many schools will follow this method because students learn better than learning by facts.
