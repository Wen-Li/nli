I completely agree with the statement that successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well. because a person who is successful knows well how to do the things and what consequences will bring it positively.

                Firstly, if we consider a film director who used to direct a number of succesful films knows well how to direct a film and when it will be received positively by the audience. he may be directing a simple story or a complex story, he should never make the audience get bored. they should feel something new and exciting elements in his film then finally it will be a successful film. These type of directors who catches the pulse of the audience can try new things with new ideas and take risks finally they will be successful.

             Secondly, if we consider a bussiness magnet who is successful in his bussines will go for new bussinesses though he doesnt know about that but his leadership qualities and creative thinking will make them successful. when they know how a bussiness will be successful by sticking to those basic steps he will be successful in any type of bussiness. 

             Lastly, when a person is successful all the other people around him will have confidance in him and encourage him to do new thing which will make him successful. "successful people never do things different they do the things differently". this is why i think successful people try new things and take risks.
