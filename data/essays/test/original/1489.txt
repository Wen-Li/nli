THE BEST WAY TO TRAVEL IS IN A GROUP LED BY ATOUR GUIDE.

Traveling  is going out side your country to dicover a new places,enjoy discover.and i agree with said: the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide. when you have a tour guide you will not have the think where ever you might go to the all historical plasces in the country you are visiting,and he will provide the history and the information about every place you go to. the guider will take care about that ,also about going to amusement places.
also the traveling with the group doesn't let you waste time because it is a scheduale trip ,but if you travel alone you may spend long time in relaxing and preparing to go out.another important matter is about money ,with the group you spend less money than if you traveled alone,transportation fees, the hotel costs and many other thing will cost you lessso,you will save money and by more gifts.
and with the group you have much more fun and good,happy time.
you meet meet new people and have new friends.

acctuly i have tried both ways,and i found that with the guider is better ,met new people,never have to worry if i can visit all the important places,the scheduale is always full and fun.
