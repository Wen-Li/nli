Children are recquired to learn a lot of facts at school. Later, students still have to learn some facts but they must also understand ideas and concepts, and I believe this is the most important for them.

The first aim of studies is to make people ready for thier professinal life. Students cannot learn how to face every single situation, so they will have to adapt. As a consequence, they will have to use ideas and concepts and think of a personal solution to the problems they face. For example, I want to become an engineer : it would take more than an entire life to learn the characteristics of all the products we are going to work on. Instead, we learn methods on sample cases and we will have to adapt these methods and to find new ones in our professionnal life. This is why, when recruiting, a firm does not only chek what studies you have made, but they will also chek your personality during an interview.

Studies also help people to build their social life. Indeed, interacting with a teacher and with other students is very important. On the one hand, people understand ideas and concepts by interacting with others. On the other hand the best way to learn facts is to study alone, with a book. Students do learn how to communicate. This will be very important for them, in their group of friends, in their family but in their company too. These three areas of life interact one with another. 
For example, someone who does not have any social life outside his firm will lack some simple knowledge about community life. The other way round, if someome is jobless, it will be harder for him to explain his children that they have to work to live. Nowadays, being jobless is badly perceived in the society so people might find it hard to tell their friends too.
