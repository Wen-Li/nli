     Many people belive that studing a lot in a particular field is important. Because they think that knowing one thing correctly is more useful than knowing several things with light knowledge. However, I have different point of view. I maintain that having many fields' knowledge is better than scoping one field because people cannot survive in the world with overflowing information. Nowdays, people need broad knowledge in their houses and offices to be seen as smart.
     About several decades ago, having deep and amount of knowledge in one subject allowed people to get jobs what they wanted. It was no matter whether they know how to play golf or know how to fix the mechines. However, in nowdays, a person should know how to play golf; to become closer with one's friends or bosses, and should know how to fix electronic equipments; in cases when a computer breaks at the office or a TV, computer, and a radio breakes at home.  Knowing a lot of information and having lots of abilities to do something are more appealing to people than focusing at one subject. Because people think that some people who got broad knowledge are smart. With narrowed information, a person is easily neglected in a group and eventually a society ignores that person. As the society thinks that the person cannot stand with the situation when one needs broad knowledge to solve the problem.
     As the world is fullfilled with amount of data, we need to prepare for the situations that we might conflict to get over that situations with many information. We should prepare.
