Personally I believe that it is essential to understand concepts and undermine them with experience and hard facts. But how can we train our students, who have not the working experience to be creative enough and still compare with evidence?

At my MBA course we do combine the two of them and that is what I would think of an ideal education. Some students are more theoretically oriented than others. Therefore it is easier for them to sit down and study theory. Others are more practically oriented and learn while exchanging concept and ideas with others.

A sound education focuses on both: theory and practice. All of us students work on management level of companies and have not so much time to study hard on concepts. However, we get our books ahead of the respective block (2-3 months) to study and complete a pretest which we have to hand in to the professor who teaches the course. If we have prepared well, we will pass the pretest and will be able to participate at the respective block. 

Our blocks last two weeks. During this time we repeat and improve what we have learnt before in our class. On top of that programme we do work in the evening on so called Living Cases. This means that a company comes in and presents us their question or problem which we - splitted in groups of 7 to 8 people - try to solve in the so called living case. 

Having understood the theory, we try to adapt it in practice and learn, that there are much more factors which need to be taken into consideration than only the theoretical concept itself. Ideas are not always enough to rate, analyse and understand. It does in fact need hard facts to compare previous experiences to understand or reject our ideas. 

Summarising the education explained above I would really draw the line that I personally profit more from the practical experience. But I could not benefit if I had not learnt theory before. Only the combination of the two is for me successful.
