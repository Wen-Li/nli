With the increasing problem of pollution, public transport's development , somebody think that in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use, but with decreasing price of car like logan or the futur projet of car's constructor to do cheapest car, is the affirmation possible.
The fact of danger for the environment conduct us to think that people will more and more take care of ecology because pollution is destucting the environment. People will prefer public's transport to car, because transport will be more develop and open to concurrence in France. The road will be divise to make more bus way and car which polluate will payed a important tax. We will be use car just to go outside the downtown. 
However there will be a alternative to petrol with "bio-caburant". The road and hight way will be more develop and the circulation problem will be resolve. Today, the two big problems of the cars are pollution and road free to drive. If we resolve that problem, car will be the best friend of human. In fact, city are becoming more biggest and if you haven't got a mean of transport in a city where the public transport are too far, that is very penible. 

Finally, this is very difficult to answer by yes or no but my opinion is that we will have more car, but a important technology associate to security, ecology, and the facility to drive.
