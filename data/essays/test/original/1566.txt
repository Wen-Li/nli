Although I think that people should not be influenced by advertisements, I admit that the marketing initiatives of companies influence our life, our mentality and our shopping patterns.
There are several reasons for this and my personal experience 
reinforces this idea.
As I studied at the university during a marketing course, the purpose of advertisement is to catch the prospects` and customers` interest on the advertised products. In this way they are fostered to buy it. The levers which are used to achieve this target aim at highlighting the main characteristics of the product. Moreover companies do their best to make the product seem much better than it is.
So I think that making the product seem better is a specific marketing strategy used by companies to increase their turnover.
There are several ways used by advertisements to improve the characteristics of the product and to make it better e.g to make it more fashonable or more beautiful or to increase the smell of the product in the supermarket where it is sold.
Once I entered a big store and I was nearly shocked by the advertisement done for one product that is bread. The advertisement was done by means of leaflets, commercial about this product were screened on big monitors, the smell of the product was intentionally diffused in the whole supermarket that everyone bought the advertised bread. Me too. To tell the truth it was not particularly tasty but I was nearly compelled to buy it.
As an employee of an international company which makes use of commercials as a key lever to increase the market share, I believe that this way of advertising is a good idea to make the business more profitable. On the contrary, as a private customer, I would like to point out that making the product seem better should be prohibited by the central government of my country since customers invest their money in a product which does not have the advertised characteristics or features. This cannot be considered a good conduct!
