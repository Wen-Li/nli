I agree with the statement that says that succesful peolple try new things and take risks than only doing what they already know to do well. When a person doesn't dare to try something new just because they are afraid to loose, they won't have the change to win an opportunity that can change his o her life. Everybody has to try to use his capacity and take the change to invest in a new area, a new bussines, a new experience, or a different carrier that can bring more satisfacction. 
I have my family like example. My father did not go to the university, he did not finish high school. He just had expererience like a taxi driver. One day he decided to buy another car and  hire a new driver. He began to make and save some money,  and later he had the economic capacity to buy more cars and impove his own transporatation bussines. Now his bussines is the most important an succesful company in my town. He hire almost half of the young poputation in the town and give oportunities to many familes to have a job an improve the quality of life.
If you feel you have the change to start a new proyect, or the capacity to do something different and yo do not expect to continue the rest of your yeas doing what you already know how to do well, just do no be afraid and invest all your time, experience and ability to take the risk and became a successful person. 
I know this is the example of many people that today is completly happy, just beacuse they took the risk to do it. Do it,
