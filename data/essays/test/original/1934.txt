What are the future of a whole entire world? Fewer cars or the totally lost of cars?We don`t think to a world without any cars or with fewer cars! The car have changed the life of all in the world! In past It have canged my life and I think that will change my life even in the future.And the only thought that in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than are today will be a good started to the development of another way to trasport.
With the advantages of aeroplane and its diffusion toward the people in the world, the cars won`t be the first way to trasport for the people who can catch the aeroplane easily and can trasfer themself quickly to one place to another without any problem.
If in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use that today this will be a good traguard for the world in term of inquinacy. Fewer cars means less smog in the city and in the country and this means a major healthy for the people who live this world.
Even major healthy for the people,either major healthy for the nature. With less smog,we will can reduce the hole in the ``Ozono`` and that will can influence the weater in the world.
After the removal of this problem, it can, as a conseguence, remove any other problem like the increasing of a level of water in the ocean caused from the glaciers.
Fewer cars in use will be a good decision and a good development of a thecnology that can improve the quality of life even for the people who liv this world,either for the healthy of the world. It will be a good pass toward a major future.That`s the why i agree.
