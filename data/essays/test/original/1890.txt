According to me, in twenty years from this date, there will probably be fewer cars than there are today. There are many reasons to why I agree with te statement. The most important reason being, increase in fuel prices.

Currently, most cars run on Gasoline, which is a petroleum based product. Fuel prices have been increasing continuosly from the past few years and it might get so costly one day, that using a car could become very burdensome on a common man's pocket. In my country, the price of petrol has doubled over the past 7 years. Going by this rate, petrol will soon be an unaffordable commodity.

Another problem with Petroleum products is that, they are in limited supply in this world. Oil is considered to be a non-renewable source of energy. It cannot be replaced naturally in the short term. Oil producing countries may reduce their production in order to sustain their economies over longer periods of time. Thus, the price will rise higher. The process is irreversible and the prices will continue increasing.

Apart from this, people will be more educated and concious about the environment around them. That's why they will avoid cars as they are a major source of pollution. They will also be more health conscious, and may take a walk or a bicycle ride to nearer places and burn some calories instead of moving around in the comfort of their vehicles.

Because of the above reasons, people will be more inclined to use public transport systems, as they are more efficient fuel-wise. Buses and trains will be more common and there will be fewer cars.

Unless an alternate fuel is made to run cars efficiently and cost effectively, the the number of cars on roads are bound to decrease. It's the job of engineers and technologists to find new and cheap sources of energy. Some cars have already been designed which run on Electricity. But this isn't becoming popular because of it's slow speed and accelaration. Research is already underway to produce cars working on Solar Energy, Water, Biomass and anything which can act as a substitute to Petroleum but their success is doubted in the near future.

So unless an altenative fuel is made. The number of cars is set to dwindle in the years to come.
