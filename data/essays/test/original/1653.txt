Advertising is a very expensive yet effective aspect of selling a product. many businesses now actualy run on advertising like internet based sites with banners and free TV stations. The advertising industry is a massive industry which involves allot of finance.For companies to pay that much money and higher a team of employes just for advertising can only proof the essence and importance of promoting the product.

      The question is since now we see advertising for may be most products on the market if not all, does that mean that every product is good? does it mean that every product is worth buying? in my opinion the answer is no! ive seen TV adds for a soap that magicaly vanishes the stains, Pills that makes you loose so much weight in just a week and turn you in to a super model, Toys that make you invinsable, adverts which parrents call "pointless crap" .

       Many countaries now banned or made laws agains that "pointles crap" they call good advertisment. Which falsfully promotes a product or brain washes kids on to making there objective of the month to make their parents buy that toy on TV for them. People are more aware of the Techniques of advertising and they are aware that not all advertisements are true and that they can say anything

      I dont want u to think that i am implying that advertising in general is bad or that it should be stoped completely. NO! advertising is very good and it is indeed a very smart way to sell any products. Personaly i just think that instead of falsfully advertising a useless project and convince people some thing that is completely not true. Why not make adds that are realy smart and catchy which are funny, which makes want to buy the product without making you beleive something that is not true. I think if companies did that it would be much more succesfull than tricking people to give them their money!
