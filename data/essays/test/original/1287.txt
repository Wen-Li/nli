With the desire to be the best in one's feild  we put in all our efforts and try all our means to reach there.Advertisements are the most common and believed to be the most effiecient means of  conveying one's product to the public.Advertisments can catch hold of viewrs imagination and can even manipulate(to some extent) his likings and dislikings.It may sometimes happen that product is not as good as it is potrayed in the advertisement.
    For example there may be a certain brand of cookies that claims to give 25% extra free of cost.Regular buyers of the cookie are elated and some others are attarcted by this discount.But there have been cases where customers are disappointed beacuse the quality or the size of the cookies have decreased or sometimes the cost of packet is increased.
    Purpose of advertisement is to make the society aware of a certain product.But it can be used to trap customers by stating that which is not true about the product.For example there are advertisments about wrinkle removal creams.They claim to remove wrinkles and ages marks within say 15 days of uasage.But u wont know how efficient they are unless u use them.It may also be possible that they have certain side-effects which may be mentioned on the package and will go unoticed because of the small size they are written in.
    At the same time there are products which are genuinely good rather as good as they are presented to the viewers.Such products are successfull in the long run.These are trusted brands which are liked by the user.
    Thus I agree that most advertisements make products look much better than they really are.Reason could be any from launching new product in the market or relaunching the older one.There are cases where the products efficiency is exaggerated.While keeping in mind that there are certain exceptions to this and some sort of genuine advertisement is still done.
