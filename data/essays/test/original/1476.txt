Students and teachers are poles apart when they come to the issue that whether it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts or not.Some argue that ideas and concepts are so abstract that it is hard to comprehend and thus are in favor of the opinion.Others hold the opposite view by stating that every idea and concept is on the basis of facts so naturally they should take our more efforts .As far as I am concerned ,I take a neutrual position by the following reasons.

To start with there are countless cases in which either ideas and concepts or facts are ddif to follow .I remember clearly the scenes of mathematics lessons in my primary school .Universally acknowledged concepts and ideas of mathematics are difficult to understand ,especially for pupils as I was back then.So the teacher adopted a special way to teach us ,relating those concepts to our daily routines .In other words he encouraged us to pay more attention to the facts of everyday life that we could easily catch.Had we spend a lot of energy and time learning abstract and obscure concepts ,our efforts would have gone in vain.Analogouly when composers conceive of creating musical pieces what often run into their minds is ideas and concepts expressed as feelings and emotions.Music just flows as a stream of ideas and thoughts.

More often than not either ideas or facts can act as a driving force to promote one another's development.Here is a good example to demonstrate it :the great Newton' gravatational law .Its significant discovery directly leaded to a myriad of subsequent key ideas and concepts in the scientifc field which in return fulfilled what was just emaginary pictures into facts,like the invention of steamboats and the discovery of Pluto.However the genesis of this profound law was the sduty of an apple falling from a tree,a fact! Is not it self-explanatory?

According to the dimensions mentioned above we can safely draw a conclusion that both ideas ,concepts and facts are of great importance for students to learn and understand.By examining facts we may be inspired to come to novel  ideas and probing into ideas and concepts may lead us to creat more pleasant "facts".They facilitate each other with no ending.
