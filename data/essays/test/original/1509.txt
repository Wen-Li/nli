I agree with the statement.
      Advretising is some peoples jobs they are earning their money by advretising ant their job is making the product so good looking and making the people who looks at it think that is a perfect product.
      For example a make up product when women look at the advretisement of the product they must think it is the best product for their makeup bag it look small in the advretisments it looks colorful it must look the same on their faces, but it is not people should not beleave at every product they see on the advretisments are perfect as they think.
      It is the job of the people who makes the advretisments and this is one of the legal way to earn money(brain washing people). Their job is to make u think it is a good product and make sure that you buy it.They don't care care abaut you after you buying the product. 
      That happend to me like it happend to every kid in age 8 or araund 8 year old kids, i saw a new toy advert and i loved the toy from the advert i beg to my parents to buy it and i sucsead but when i opend the the box of that toy i undearstond that it is nothing compeard the one i saw in the advertisement on t.v. So I undearstand that i should not belive evert thing i see on the t.v.specially the advertisements. 
      I am not saying they are bad some of them can be heplful if you don't know what is new on the shopingcenters or markets, maybe i didn't like the toy but some other kid loved it,but i am still suppoting with what i say in the beginning most of hte advretisments makes the product seem much better than they are.Almost all of the advretisments for the kids are making the product looking better than the kids see because they can imagine way more than a teenager or a adult can imagine.
