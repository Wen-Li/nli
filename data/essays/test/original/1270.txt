It is not easy to take a side between if is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts or if is more important for them to learn facts, for these reason being agree or disagree with the statement it's very complicated for me, however, my kind of personality is comparable with the importance of understanding ideas and concepts and this make me incline to be agree with the statement.
There are two characteristics of my personality that help me to illustrate why I am agree. First, I love to know the things bases, in other words, I dont's like when I don't understand things from the begining. Second, I am very creative, and that characteristic has implications like use different ideas or knowledges to built new things or ideas.
Both characteristics help each other to support my election, if I understand things from the beginig and I have the concepts clear, I have the capacity to built new things, besides I can deduce things by myself. When you learn facts, you are available to answer just what is involved in the things you  have learned, otherwise, when you have ideas and concepts clear,  you can figure out things that possibly would't be in the questions.
In conclusion, for me, it is more enjoyable the capacity of creating new forms of knowledge from the one I got before and learning facts would not offer me tihs possibility.
