There are many different ways of studying and understanding the topics in school. For some people it is easier to understand a topic when a teacher explains it and uses good diagrams or other things to support his or her statements. Other people find it easier to purely learn facts and present them the way they memorized them. Teachers will always tell you that the second way is not good and won't help the student in a test. The question is, is the first way really better than the other?
In school teachers mostly try to present the topics so that the students understand it. To fulfill this task they use diagrams and transparencies or prepare interesting experiments. You can say that this kind of teaching is the best way of teaching. 
On the other side there are teachers who just give you the text book and make you write down everything on your own. To not get in trouble most students might memorize the whole text, which is a lot of work. At the time being this seems to be a good idea because at the very moment you have the information in your head. After a while though you get more and more tasks and your head will be filled with much more things and after some time you will have already forgotten everything. This could be very bad, because you might think you still know it since you already had to memoriye it once, but if you don't understand a topic it will leave your brain if you don't review it again and again. The things you try to understand are easier to be memorized, because there will be a connection between you and the topic. 
It is also important to understand the whole idea for tests or exams. Mostly tests don't ask you to only quote word for word what you have memoriyed. Teachers want to see that you understood the topic and so they put questions in a test that ask you to maybe draw conclusions or use your own examples. Sometimes you also have to explein how it leads to a problem and if you didn't understand the topic you might not know how to handle this question.
All these things actually show that purely memoriying facts is not a good way to study, but sometimes learning facts can actually help. When I study for a test I don't always understand everything we've covered in school and this is the point where I purely memorize the sentences given by the teacher. When I'm done with that I start reviewing what I've memorzed and at this point in time I finally understand what they teacher was talking about in class. Just to be clear, this method doesn't always work for sure. To get a better understanding of a topic you should try to purchase different books that discuss the same problem. If you get different opinions on a topic it will be easier to understand. 
All in all it is alwys more important to understand the problem in front of you. The teacher is there to help you with that. She gives you her\his own opinion and she will explain everything to you in detail so that you understand it. And if the teacher should refuse to help you, you can help yourself by looking into the differnt book or you can ask classmates. When you understand everything it will be easier to write a test on the topic, beacsue even if you don't include one fact, the teacher will still see that you understood the topic, which makes her task fulfilled.
