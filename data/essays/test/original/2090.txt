In a society that stresses individualism, the complaint that young people were reluctant to engage in social work rises.
The following essay is dealing with the resulting question whether young people give enough time to helping their communities.

I clearly disagree with this statement. In my opinion, various projects are initiated by young people to enforce social interactions in communities.
Many schools offer so called "compassion projects" to their students. These projects are voluntary and free the students from classes simultaneously in order to make time for any social activities. These can be carried out in hospitals, asylum homes or other social institutions part of the community. At my school, such a project was a full success. More that 90% of the students enrolled in the program even planning the next project to come. Also, an exhibition was organized.
The students and the school administration as well see clear advantages of being socially active: the acquired soft skills are highly benefical when it comes to applying for a job. Companies often require people that are motivated in social interactions. Especially in leader positions like the profession of a CEO or manager, those core qualities are necessary to handle a job with challenging demands. Students are aware of these advantages and are more than eager to learn these skills by helping the community.

Another reason for my opinion, that young people indeed engage in social activities supporting the community, is the personal benefit. Young adults that carry out social work, experience not only advantages in their career, but also in aspects of their own personal development. Learning how to deal with people in need, such as homeless people or elderly, will improve the person's ability to deal with problems. Those problems may include social communication and interactions. If I will encounter a situation with a friend in need, I will be a better listener and comforter after having learned how to be in such a position in a social setting. 
Other than that, I will learn to reflect on my own needs and solve personal conflicts. Young people often face the question of identity. "Who am I, where am I going?" 
Social engagement will surely help to answer this question. Young adults will be able to identify their position in society when being exposed to different kinds of people part of the society. Usually, young adults are not dealing with people like homeless or other members of the society that are sort of outcasts. As a consequence, young people will gain an insight on society's problems and in what way they are personally affected by them. Another consequence may be a self-reflection and answer to the question "Who am I?"

Allover, I am strongly convinced that young adults are giving enough devocation to helping their communities for the reasons stated and discussed above. Those young people will make the world be a better place.
