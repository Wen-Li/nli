A path less travelled

There are various reasons to call a person successful. Achieving an important object, performing certain feat, realizing an idea that is unheard of are few of these reasons. One can list numerous scientists, explorers and leaders who tried something novel yet precarious and were able to achieve their goals.
For ages the Europeans and Arabs used silk route as only way to trade with India. But in 16th century Christopher Columbus proposed an alternative route by sea. This idea though seemed possible but was unheard of. Many people rejected this idea and refused to help Columbus. The voyage was dangerous because no one knew how far India is and where exactly it is located. Nonetheless Columbus went ahead with his voyage and to everyone's surprise he did find land , not India though. So by trying a new and risky thing , Columbus was successful and became famous.
If one reads history, he would find that many nations gained independence by means of force and wars. There were some countries which used non-violence as a weapon against opression or for freedom. Mahatama Gandhi and Martin Luther King are considered successful doing something unprecendent.
People are afraid of trying something new as they are unsure of the outcome. But this very unknown nature of the outcome attracts certain people to try it.  The successul people are those who after knowing the outcome were able to understand the nature of the thing and use it for everyone's benefit.
So it is good thing to try new things or do same things in new ways and at same time take calculated risks. It is possible the result of new thing can be disasterous but If one tries the same thing in yet another different manner he/she learn something new and insteresting. When he/she uses that knowledge for the benefit of others then he/she is considered successful.
