I do not agree that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are. To hold the contrary opinion is tantamount to affirm that most advertisements cheat customers, which I think it is not true. However, in order to defend my position I have to face one straightforward objection: if your statement is true, why do customers sometimes expected more from the product they bought than what they actually received? I will carry out my argument in two steps. First I will give the two reasons that support my claim, and secondly I will address the objection I have presented.

The main point to bear in mind is the distinction between what a thing is and how does a thing appears or is presented to others. For while what one thing is is just "one thing," the way it may appear or be presented varies a lot. And advertisers know this and play with it. I see no problem when they take advantage of this difference, provided they do not alter what the product really is (in this case they will be cheating). Moreover, I think there is no "sheer objectivity" in presenting something, and we always have to choose the aspect we want to focus on or that should be stressed. This happens, for instance, when we are trying to convince others.

Another point is that a product interacts (in the sphere of the seeming) with many other factors, such as environment, company, an so forth. For example, when we see an advertisement of a 4WD SUV the car is not presented in a garage, but in the best conditions: in the mountains, with a wonderful overview, a nice day, good company and so forth. It is the same car we may be driving a rainy day in the midst of a traffic jam after having a flat tyre...

Now I want to meet the objection. I agree that in fact this sometimes happens. You have bought such amazing car you saw in TV,  you have spent all your savings there and the first day you want to use it is a rainy day, and you are hitted by another car. . . You have not been cheated. Rather, the conditions do not help to enjoy such a product at its best. So this come from a failure on the side of the customer, who did not understand the difference between being and seeming. It is the duty of an advertiser to tell you the good reasons for bying a product, but it corresponds to the customer to think about the reason for not buying it. The correct synthesis of both sides yields always the best choice.
