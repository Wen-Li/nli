We confront with countless advertisement in our daily life. The modern advertisements cover the every aspects of our society, such as eating, wearing and playing. However, just a little portion of these advertisements are true. This situation can be justified by three obvious reasons.

In the first place, the food advertisement attract the children from the common food which offer the most nutrion they need.  The dramatical competition has inspired some companies to take focus on the unfair adertisement about food, especially the snack. For example, the advertisements could describe their produciton as the very nutrial one to console the parents to buy for their children. But aferwards, many of them were be tested to contributed to some heathy problems.  

In the second place, we offen be encouraged to try some new clothes or launched losing weight prodution by some famous people, who just work for the high pay from come companies. For example, some girls will swayed by the good looking women on the TV to spend much money to buy some kind of equipment used for losing weight. But, actully the slim body of the star just maintained by other simple ways, and the costed productions are helpfulless.

In the third place, some advertisement also use the new technology to persvade people to buy their producion. For example, they would refer to some new words or invention to interest the costumers. Many advertisement will quote that the producing process is caculated by computer or some technology we never heard. Because we are not familar with these staff, the advertisement producers will exagrate the effect of the prodction. The example emerge every day.

In the summary, we should take awareness to these fault advertisements, and reduce them as much as we can.
