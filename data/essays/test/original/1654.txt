There are many thing in our life looke like good by thier shape  but in reality it is so bad .

I completly agree that the most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are.however , there are several reasons that make the company to produce nice with beatful shape materials with bad quality .on of these reason  is to attract the customers to buy that things with less price .By thes reason most of company will harver huge amount of mony from people. 

now adays,  the main idea of most of  the company is to gain the mony by any methods. from my experiance in my life when we want to buy anything we must first carfuly seen to these material and then buy it.also the better things became too much expensive than the worest one because there are different in thier material.

we want to sumerize the idea in few points .first, the quality is most important  thing of most of all material.second.the highest price is indicate that the products is good .
