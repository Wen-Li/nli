In today's world advertisements are used a lot for a new product through the media to inform people about it. However the society often forget about the provocation of media in every means as it is in advertisements. Products are described by advertisements by how the company wants it to be described such as showing its best parts and not mentioning the side effects of the product. 
    The products are described in a fashion to have the largest market share and thus described by advertisements by showing it much better by its best parts and omitting the other worth to tell specifications which are not desired by the company. A lot of new products are released and huge advertisements are carried out every where in the media such as in newspapers, in TVs etc. For example these kinds of advertisemnets are carried out for kinds of medicines such as Viagra, which has been claimed to increase sexual strength of men. These advertisements led to a huge market share for Viagra because, people were affected Viagra's 'great' abilities which were told on advertisements through the advertisements. However later on, it was found that Viagra had important side effects for a range of men who had certain health problems and this issue which was discussed among people for a log time, is still controversial. 
    In the statistics satutated world of today it has also been revealed that people did not easily believe to advertidsements as they did before due to their past experinces. Today there are a lot web pages or magazies which explore the commodities that are sold through the markets. For instance iPhone did not have the specifications, as Apple's Ceo Steve Jobs told and the deficits of iPhone was explicitly told on web pages or in magazines.
    The exagerration of advertisements were also banned by laws through out the laws because some adversiments are thought to be doing fraud by describing the commodities not as they are. For example there are foundaitons in Turkey which protects the users for these kinds of frauds.
    In a nut shell it can be said that most products are described as much better than they are through advertisements and this is experienced and beanned
