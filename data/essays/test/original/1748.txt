 It is difficult to agree or disagree with the following sentence because it is hudge and deals about the futur. It is not easy to know the fate of our planet, but we can try to draw different visions, to imagine our world and to hope.
    The main problem to imagine a decrease in the cars' number is the mentality of our world. The american way of life reaches all countries, scratching, not completely, other cultures. And, in the american way of life, the car plays a major role. All the life is surrounded by car: you can go in theater with your car, you can eat in your car thanks to the drive-in,  you can go fast anywhere thanks to all equipement for cars. So the place of cars in our society is really important.
    But we can see a lots of people reject this way of life, also in United States of America. For instance, in New York, walking is usual and using public transports too. So, in the futur, if public and alternative transports expand, there will be fewer cars in use. In town, the rush hour incites people not to use their car and to use public transports because, now, public transports have become the quickest way to move in town.
    An other reason, lesser happy, for the decrease of cars' number is the lack of gas. Petrol's world's ressource are decreasing and, in twenty years, some countries might have not enought to keep the same number of cars in use. 
    To conclude, I hope for our planet and our children there will be fewer cars in use but I cannot be sure. I think all persons in the world must be aware to this hudge problem, a polution problem.
