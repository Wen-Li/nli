if i consider my own experiences i will definitely agree with the speaker's claim. Companies today are motivated by profits and sales, whatever the means. Advertisements act a medium to inform the people about different products along with their special highlights. this has led to increase in competetion among companies. the company whose product sells most emerges as the leader. Its due to this competetion that advertisement is being misused today.it does not gives customer an assessment of products but tells them it is a panacea for all their problems.
let me illustrate my views with an example. whenever we watch our television sets the advertisements about a fairness cream is fairly common in between programmes. These advertisements show a model who previous to using that cream  X was dark and was shunned by girls because of his complexion. but within weeks of using X he becomes a college heartthrob with girls dying to get a date with him. but is it possible to get a fair complexion in such a short time or to even get a fair complexion. to speak the truth i could not notice a change in my complexion in even a year.arent our body, our character, our behaviour  a result of genetic material? But these advertisements refutes all the scientific theories because their main purpose is not to support them but to increase their sales. 
The reason behind making such claims about their products is profit.
we all think that when we are spending money we should get the best. but how we are going to decide which product is best?
we are not technical experts of the field. we can only see advertisements and make decisions. So for any company to prosper this medium advertisement should be utilised or to say misutilised properly so that the customers get convinced that this company's product is the best. So instead of actually improving the standard of their product they take the easier route- to make us believe that their product is the best.  this strategy has worked well and is still working well. but these companies should understand that its their moral responsibility towards the society from which they derive their bread and butter; that they should not deceive the society with such exaggerated claims.
