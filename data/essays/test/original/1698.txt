When Henry Ford made that beautiful invention known as the "Car", little did he realise the impact he would be creating on mankind and environment alike. When the machine, four wheels running with the aid of a fuel driven motor, was first invented, many people were skeptic about it. Expensive, ineffective, cumbersome,etc were few of the adjectives used to describe the car. Little did they know, that Ford would be the one laughing all the way to the bank!

Fast forward to the current scenario and Ford's laughter is well accounted for. Cities, towns and villages are teeming with people who have are hooked on to the car like an addict is to drugs. The car is no longer an expensive luxury or cumbersome or any of the adjectives used by skeptics at the time of its invention. The car has become a necessity. 

In today's world it is almost impossible to imagine life without the familiar hum of cars. They're fast, sleek, beautiful machines that help us in reaching our destination with marked ease and comfort. With the increasing dependency on cars, it seems highly unlikely that humans will abandon this marvellous creation and go back to the "walking days"! The dependency on cars has affected human physiology to such an extent, that it's almost impossible to think about walking enormous distances on foot, which, ironically, was the primary mode of travel long before the advent of cars.

"In twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today"  Says who? Statistics certainly do not support that claim. Every year, the number of cars per square mile is increasing at an alarming rate. With almost no change in the width of existing roads, the inrease in number is quite evident on our already congested roads. With mortality rate on a decline due to advances in medical sciences and increase in birth rates, it seems highly unlikely that the number of cars bought will show a dip. More the people, more the want for a necessity! Its the simple Supply versus Demand theory here.Not to mention the privileged few for whom buying more and more cars is just a way of life!

Science has not yet evolved to an extent where alternatives for cars maybe produced and used. Nor has the understanding and conscience of us people, as responsible Earthlings, advanced to that level where we start thinking about methods like car-pooling to reduce the number of  cars on the streets, thereby reducing congestion and doing the environment a big favour.

Thus, reduction in cars in the next twenty years depends on how quick Science progresses and how soon we realise our responsibilites towards making this planet a cleaner place to live in. Till that happens, all I see is the graph for Number of Cars versus Time inching towards the roof - slowly but surely.
