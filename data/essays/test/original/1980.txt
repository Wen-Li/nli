The question is to decide if successful people are the ones who try new things and take risks, rather than only doing what they already know. 

I definitely agree with the statement and i will explain why hereafter.

Firstly, we have to define who is a successful person. To this philosophical and broad question, I could only give my own answer. 

A successful person is an happy person. Indeed, It would be very limited to define a successful person as a person who succeeds all he or she undertakes. Also, it won't answer to the question asked because everybody can be this type of person, choosing only doing projects he or she already knows how to well..

With a such definition, i believe that a successful person is necessarily a person who try things, because this person is curious : she wants to discover the world, and experiences new sensations.

A successful person would like to make lots of travels to discover news countries and traditions and to learn about that. 

A successful person  thinks also that it is important to be aware of  the place where we live and and about ourselves The best way to reach this objective is to take risks. In such situations, people can be really improved and learn about their main characteristics.

For example, a such person would like to improve his physical skills, practising hiking or alpinism. She would develop his knowledge in these fields, and could develop by this way his relationship

For this type of person, the most important is not to possess a knowledge, but to be able to possess it. The way to obtain it is more important than the result.
