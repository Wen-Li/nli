In the "James Bond" series, the hero James Bond appears to the viewers to be flawless. He inspires the viewers to follow his lead and mesmerizes them. Well, these days, the various products have become the James Bond of commercial. No, they dont quite chase the villains, or save nations, but yeah they can do a wide range of things. Like making your teeth appear really white, attract a thousand girls around you, or even take a test for you. Well atleast they pretend to be able to do so. Evidently, I am in favour of the statement. 
The reasons for these kind of advertisements are varied. Many advertisement corporations feel that the only way of designing a solid campaign, is to brag and exagerrate, which can be well remembered for a long time. It is the only way to attract custmers. The advertisers promote certain influential things in the ads, when choosing between the brands. Since the only link between the promoters of the brand and its customers are these ads, the promoters project the product as being on a higher level.

I would like to discuss some examples. Recently the perfume brand Axe, has published an ad in which it shows that any man who wears the cologne, gets instant attraction from the opposite sex. Not only is this impossible, but also a bit dreamy. It is directed to the men's desires. There is also a toothpaste ad, which claims that it can whiten the yellowest of teeth within a mere 14 days. A bold claim, but is it upto the mark? Nope. Recent studies show that it can only maintain the colour of the teeth, not whiten it.
Then, there are the cola commercials which are everyone's favourite. They deal with a wide variety of things. They can lift your spirits, make you pass an exam and what not! Studies estimate that as much as 30% of the cola revenue goes in its promotion.
One must understand that the product as it is projected in the ads isnt a true representaion and must not be blindly followed.And also a little bit of exagerration on the part of the promoters doesnt hurt anyone, and infact adds to the fun. So i think one must be a careful consumer and pick our brand and product wisely.
