I do agree with the following statement: It is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts.

Here are my reasons. 

Facts are a collection of past situations and/or activities without any dependencies. Facts could also be repeating events: e.g. a collection of dates Christmas day, Christmas Eve etc.

On the other hand side are ideas. They are time universal. Ideas did exist in the past, in the present and also exist in the future. Without any idea there would be no progress or development. Our ancisters had the idea that the earth is round. Columbus did prove it and explored a new continent. The horizon of the human beeings grow, some groups lost their influence and power.

Concepts are a collection of facts and activities with a future orientation. Concepts are can be possible answers for complex situatuations or can help solving problems. Here an example: You want to remodel a living room, because the fireplace is broken and needs to be repaired. A possible concept could be just do disable the fireplace and keep the remodelling costs low. Another concept could be to replace the fireplace and spend more money. 

The students are the key to the future. The need to understand the facts, the situation the human race is in, no doubt. But much more it's more important keeping ideas / concepts alive to go another step.  The human race is challenged in the future with environmental changes and resource issues. The climate is changing, oil is running out in the next 50 years. Answers are needed to questions like: Alternative transportation, global warming, civilization. The only key to find the answers is to develop new alternative concepts and creative ideas rather learning the facts.
