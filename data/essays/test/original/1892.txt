In these days, people can see a immense amount of commercials and advertisments. A researcher said that one human sees average of 80 thousand commercials in his/her life time Regardless of the kinds of items or products people try to advertise, they point out that their products are excellent, and are better than others. But, is it really true?

    Reviewing my past events and other informations, a lot of these advertisements are not actually true, and are just trying to make customers attracted. In other words, they are bluffing. Here are some examples .

    About a year ago, I bought a digital camera from one internet shopping mall. The advertisement said that this camera comes out in various colors and with a free memory card. Because this camera seemed cool, I bought it. And when I paid, it clearly said that the company will deliver this camera to my home exactly a week later. After two months, the company delivered me a pink camera (The color I wanted was silver) without any memory card.

    It is clear that advertisements are making their products seem much better then the reality because advertisements doesn't show us the bad sides about the products. They point the better qualities and hide others. Actually, advertisements are made to point out the products' best parts. For example, companies sometimes point out that the prices of their items are low while hiding the fact that the quality is low too.

    My uncle who use to work in a pizza store told me that people use cheep ingredients to make more profits for themselves. While doing that, he told me that the advertisement of that pizza store clearly says that they use fresh ingredients.

    To conclude, most advertisement bluffs about the products and make them seem better to attract more customers. And, I want to warn others that  the advertisements are made to be pointing out  their best portions of the products.
