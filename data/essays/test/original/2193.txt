 Learning a wide range of academic subjects or specializing in only one? I had to answer this question a few years ago, when I clarified my professional project. It depends on what one really want to achiev.
    If people are interesting in knowing very well a subject, they have to decide to study one specific subject. For example, researchers are specialized people. Nobody is able to succeed in stem cell researchs if he doesn't specialized in this area and this special topic. On the other way, specialists are not able to summary all information.
    It is very useful for the society and human knowledge to have people with global competencies and broad knowledge as leaders and managers. For this kind of job, knowledge and know how in a broad range of many academic subjects is mandatory. Managers in our technological world need to study sciences as mathematics and physics but also economics, marketing, finance, corporate strategy, etc. But making two kinds of people with specialized people on one side and generalist people on the other, is very simplist. There are a lot of relation between people, and specialized people discover and organise data for others.

    As a conclusion, I would like to give my point of view and explain my academic choice. I have chosen a few years ago to study sciences but also management and economics in order to understand our society. Thanks to a wide range of academic studies learned with my engineering degree, I am know able to understand and see relations between things and facts. And this ability to discover rules underlying the world is for me the most interesting result of academic studies.
