Success can be defined as the completion of a goal a person had set himself. In my opinion, it is in the nature of humankind to always want more, to never be satisfied with what we already have. It seems therefore logical that successful people would still want to try new things and take risks. 
    First of all, the want for more that leads to try new things is sometimes driven by greed. A casino player who has won the jackpot will undoubtedly want to try his luck one more time. He therefore takes an important risk.
    Moreover, a successful person who wants to try new things shows his creativity and his will to advance in life. A simple example is the one of the 2006 Nobel Prize winner, Muhammad Yunus. Mr Yunus, before creating the Grameen bank was a successful college professor. However, he decided to stop teaching and dedicate his life and knowledge to helping the poor. He took an important risk when he created his bank: being an economics teacher, he did not know much about banking.Successful people, for reasons that can be both negative and positive, are generally willing to try new things and take risks.
    On the other hand, some people work their entire life before they are successful. Once they have achieved their goal, it is understandable that they would not want to jeopardize their situation by taking new risks. They therefore try to consolidate it. A man who has work for years trying to make his business successfull, once he has achieved his goal, will not want to try new things by starting up a new business in a completely different field. He will only try to expand the one he already has since he has learned to manage it well.
    In conclusion, successful people can decide to either take new risks or rather keep doing what they know how to do. In my opinion, it completely depends of the type of person: someone who is creative, motivated, or even thirsty for wealth and power, will try new things. Moreover, even in the case of a man who only tries to consolidate his business and not starting another one, he is still taking risks by expending. I therefore agree with the statement. Rare are the people who are willing to let their life stagnate.
