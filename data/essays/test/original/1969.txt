I agree this statement. Becuse, I think to succes someting, you have to try new things and take risks.
 For example, I think that Tadataka Ino is one of successful person. He made the first  surveyed Japanese map in Edo period. He started leaning  survey at the age of 50. Although this age was quite old in this period, he tryed to start a new thing,serveyed all of Japan on foot.Finary, he made really exact map.
 Something new usualy good for us. We cannot find them unless trying. About Tadataka Ino,If he had not tryed to start leaning, Japanease map would not have been made. I think successful people usualy like try new things or can take risks,so that they can get good result rather than pople who only doing  what they already know how to do well.
