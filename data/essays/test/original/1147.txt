     Some people prefer to travel in a group led by a tour guide rather than travelling individually without a tour guide. I strongly disagree with their opinion, and I have some reasons to support my opinion of why I prefer travelling individually without a tour guide. 
     At first, I dislike travelling in a group led by a tour guide because then I would have to follow the tour schedule. If there is a tour guide, I would not be able to travel in my own pace and look over the places where I want to visit. The places where I could go would be very limited. 
     Secondly, I know that the information I could get would also be very limited if I am with a tour guide. For that reason, I have experienced travelling with my family and a tour guide once before when I visited Thailand. Before I went to Thailand I was so excited of listening to what a tour guide would teach or tell us about the place we go. I thought a tour guide would tell us something we do not know, or something which is very hard to know. However, when I was travelling in Thailand, a tour guide only talked about the history and the current situation about the place. She talked like if she has memorized all the phrases in a  textbook or the booklet, and the booklet woult be easily gained if I go to the travelling office. I thought a tour guide's lead was so boring, because the facts or information she said were the once I already knew. 
     To conclude, I strongly suggest that if a person want to really explore the place he goes, he should enjoy travelling by either himself or family, never with a tour guide. By traveling with a tour guide, the information we could know is very limited and it is sometimes what we are able to find in the booklet or in the internet. Also, the place we can go is very limited if we are with a tour guide. Therefore, to really enjoy the travel and explore the place visited, I think it is best to travel by myself, without a tour guide.
