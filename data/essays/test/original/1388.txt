In my oppinion each successful person is different. 
On the one hand there are a lot of sucessful people who try new things, take risks, invent something unique and get famous. 
On the other hand there are many people who try the same things and turn out not to be sucessful. Being sucessful is not just a matter of who you are what you exactly do it is also a lot about having luck. 
Luck could mean you have fortunate relationships like relatives that are in high positions and can help you to get in an important position as well.
That would be the opposite side of the statement because that would be an example for a person who might become successful but has never stepped out of his comfort zone.  
There are people who have certain talents but these talents will never be discovered because they do not get the chance to get into the needed position. 
There might be a woman in India with the most beautiful voice. She might be hundert times better then many successful popstars but she will never get the chance to show that. Maybe she is poor and has to nurture her 4 children. It does not matter how risky she would be: Chances are very low she could ever leave her country. She is simply in the wrong time at the wrong place.

I cannot agree or disagree with that stament. I have seen people who have been successful because they took risks but then I have also seen people who have taken risks to become successful and have poorly failed. Before a person makes a decision he should consider if he can life with all possible consequences and if the success is worth taking these risks.
