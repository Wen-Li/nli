I do agree with the statement that "successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well."
I do agree because I know some people that are great in their jobs, but they are not satisfied with the things they have because they know that they are able to have or get more and they take risks in order to success in other areas. 
It would be very easy to those persons to keep doing what they know they do well, but they want more, they are not completely satisfied, so they decide to take risks. 
I think it is very important to take risks in order to success. The best example I can give is myself. I am a lawyer, I have been working in a great law firm since 11 years. I think I am a good lawyer, so I could maintain the things exactly the way they are, but no, I want to be a better lawyer, I want to succeed so I need to take risks. That is why I have been working very hard in order to save the enough money so I can pay an LL.M in the United States. I want to study an LL.M because is a great opportunity to increase my legal knowledge, also I will be able to meet people of different countries and, it is the better way to practice my english.
Studying a master represents a risk, because I will leave back my family, my home, my friends and, of course, my job. But I am concius that I need to take this risk if I want to succeed. Of course it will not be an easy task, sincerely, I am a little affraid, but also I am sure that it will be the best experience of my entire life. It is one of my greatest dreams and I have been working very hard in order to make it possible.
Some day a good friend of mine told me that the harder one works, the luckier one gets, so I am working very hard each day in order to make my dreams possible.
That is why I do agree that is important to take risks if someone wants to be successful.
