" I am successful".  How often do you heared this pharse from someone?.  I would say very rare because they are not so many successful people out there.  The word successe could differ in meaning from someone to else, however; we all aggreed that to be a successful peroson should not try different things in life even the perosn well knowleged to the other subjects.

    One reason for not trying out other things is because the successful person should be concentrated on only one target.  Having a multiple tragets will confuses the successful person on his main traget.  For example, the person who invent Fedex in a normal perosn who works in not well developed job.  He thought about the idea behind delivering packages around the world very fast and introduced it to his manager which eventually disagreed with him because the place they wrok in different of what his idea presents.  Therefore, he resigned from his job so he would be concetrated on his traget.

    Second reason that states the idea behind the not searching of many new things is becuase searching for other targets until the person finds one time comsuming.  If anyone wanted to be a successful person, time is very important factor.  When time passes, less opprtunities occurs becuase by the time people will come up with new ideas which might effect on your traget.
