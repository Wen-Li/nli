people like changes and to do less work .they also have diffrent opinion for everything.new scientist most of the time changes and hope for a better way to make life easier.maybe in the futere people will live in the sea or another planet and they needdiffrent transportation for this new enviorment. also cars can have some accedint and people may die so the people may think another vehicle which is safeir to invent. thats is why i think in twenty years later there will be fewer cars than it is today.

in old times people used to drive horses and camels backthen. but now people driving cars for transportation . so in the follwoing years i think people want to change from diriving a car to a diffrent thing which easier and faster.

some people like to do less work and acheive thier goals quickly. like before they used to take alot of times to go to another place on horses but it takes less time and work by cars . so evuntually they will want something faster.

scintest are diffrent in their way of thinking from time to time they always look for solution to make the peoples life easier. before when the people ride on horses scientist wanted to find something faster thats why they invented cars. so eventully they will think for a better way to invent something will make the world smaller and every one an use it and sometimes cheaper.

nowdays somepeople want live in the sea because its beutey our outter space because it is a new experince and some people wants a new thing every now and then .

today you can find several car accedints  thats why i think people wants to a safer mobile.

in conclusion i thnck they will be fewr cars than now
