Although,nowadays people think that young peole do not help their comminties sufficiently,I think young people want to  help the others.Moreover,there are a lot of groups in Turkey to help their  communities enough time.Today, we have a better understanding of that young people give enough time to helping their communities and suppose this points with some examples such as Bilkent Univertsity`s groups to help the others. 
   To begin with,it is widely known that there are a lot of clubs in universities to help people who want to aid others and I am a student in Bilkent Universities and thus there are many types of clubs to help people.To illustrate, I participate a lot of clubs this year and work very much to help people.One of them,my groups help to old people such as visiting them in their home.For instance,6 mounths ago I work for children who do not have parents and they feel very alone due to this point.Moreover when I aid these kinds of people,I am very glad.Furthermore, my friends want to participate these kinds of groups after I tell what I do these groups.We may understand after these examples ,young people want to give all tme to helping their communities.
  Other reason is that in Turkey,young people want to help the others.Thus,young people in Turkey arrange some activities for thier communities such as party to give moral, competition to amuse them.For example,last year my friends aranged party for people who do not have parents,During  partthey were very happy so that my friends were glad.
 To sum up,because of these points young people want to help their communities and they want to spend all time for them.
