Whenever a customer visits a shopping mall he seems always confused about which product to buy or which new product to experiment with. The first thing that would come in his mind is a specific advertisement of a product. He just might buy the product whose advertisement he thought was most appealing at that point of time. This gives a best example of the power of advertising.
In this world of cut throat competition every manufacurer wants to potray his product as superior and will go to any extremes to make create a positive appeal in the minds of the consumer.Today's market has new versions of the same product coming up almost everyday and if a manufacturer has to promote his product and make his brand a household name he has to retort to large scale advertising.
Advertising can be in several forms such as television, radio, newspapers, signboards, large hoardings and many more. A product has to be vigourously advertised to create an impression in the minds of the customer. Due to this a customer is left wondering whether the product is really worth all the talk. Several times advertising can be extremely misleading. A customer may get fooled by the magical appeal of a product's advertisement and may go ahead and buy it only to realize it was not worth the money.
Sadly, the public believes in such forms of display and lives under the impression that the most advertised product is the best one.
One must realise that if a manufacturer is spending so much on adertisements he is surely compromising on the quality and if not then the prices of the product are increased to make up for the advertising expenditure.The customer becomes a big loser in this case as he is paying more only for a product that is highly advertised and not really a product with high quality.
An advertisement of a product generally emphasis on the strong points of the product and would always prove his superiority over other products in the same category. The advertisement may attract a particular category of customers and almost convince them of the product's effective presence.Also the advertisements play on a customer's mind, for example the product is displayed so many number of times that repetition enhances retention and even the worst products are remembered by the customers.
Advertisements allure consumers in all possible ways possible, for example i remember my baby sister convincing me into buying her a candy bar she had seen on television. Surprisingly the product was not the usual one she was always fond of. The advertisement had created an appeal and changed her choice. Also products that are re introduced or improvised or claim to be better have a wider appeal as people want to experience the change. This may be a tactic used by the manufacturer to drive the customer to buy the product. Products are also advertised with exciting offers or add on new products which propell customers to make the purchase. In such cases the offer may be more enticing than the product itself as a customer always looks to save a penny or two on his expenses.
Thus it is for the customers to choose decisively and buy products that are truely worth their name and quality and not get attracted to temporary saving offers or false displays of products.
