I actually think that you can't say if it is better to be focused and specialized in a single and specific subject or to be broad-minded, it is to say, to know about many subjects in a less accurate way. 

Let us take the instance of a researsh and development department manager. I dont think he will need eight persons when each one knows a few about a lot, but I do guess that he will be quite more satisfied by a team of eight specialised persons who, gathered, will be able to give complementary information and finally do a better job in such a department. This example tends to make me disagree wtih the question.

Till, if I had the choice between being focused on one skill, or at contrary  be open to every topic and be educated so as to have a broad knowledge, I definitely acknowledge that I would rather be broad-minded. Although it is taugh, to interest oneself in various topics helps to build a critical state of mind, wich is over essential nowadays to understand things of life like politic, philosophy, economy, history... To be critical is to be well-constructed in our modern and so complicated society.

To conclude I shall say that the solution seems to be a matter of point of view. Appearently, we need both kinds of education way. As I already said you cant answer the question simply by yes or not until you put it back in its context. Of course it's better to have many specific tools that are more efficient than unspecific ones, but if you simply got to choose only one tool, it'd obviously be better if this late can be used in a lot of different tasks.
