The main function of the student is learning. Learning includes the understanding of ideas, concepts and the facts. I stongly believe that students should understand the ideas and concepts,Eventhough,it is important to learn facts. when we need to write the exams it is required to understand the ideas and concepts. And also it is useful when we work in particular company.
Firstly,Today there is a lot of importance to undestand the ideas and concepts in the student's life. For example,if the student is taking his graduate course,definitely he need to understand the concepts and ideas to answer the questions in the examinations. Because, without having the concept of the particular topic he or she may not be able to answer the question effectively. And also if the student know the idea behind particular theory he can be able to present the idea in his own words or also able to develop the new things with the same idea. 
Secondly,Today most of the companies are offering the jobs to the students who have the knowledge i,e concept and idea of the subject. In the company, you need to work with your own knowledge. So,without having concept on that particular issue you may not be able to perform well and also it leads to stop your growth in the company and sometimes you may lose your job because of lack of ideas and concept.
To sum up,understanding the ideas and concepts about the particular subject or issue is more important than learning the facts.But learning the facts gives us to know what is happening in the soroundings and also able to know how the things have gone.Eventhough, it is more useful in real life to have concepts and ideas everywhere.
