What is advertising? A simple way of selling one's product was what it USED to be. Today, the advertising world has become a competetive jungle; one that, I feel, has lost sight of its original purposes, and has been reduced to a money-spinning frenzy that attempts to make products seem larger than life. I, thus, strongly agree with the given statement. 
    I come from Mumbai, India's commercial capital; where every road is a blaze of flashing neon-lit advertisements; where familiar faces of celebrities, endorsing the most frivolous products, jump out at you from every hoarding; where brightly colored advertisements are plastered on every spare inch of space in the city (buses, bus stops, walls, signposts, post boxes: you name it!) and where one third of the time you spend watching your favorite television show is spent watching advertisments. In the light of the above situations, I do not think I can be blamed for having such a strong viewpoint!
    Since when has a toothpaste been SO effective, that the poor old teeth that are subject to other toothpastes crumble in comparison? Since when has an energy drink been SO vitalizing, that it has bestowed upon its drinker the sudden magical abilty to win every race that he perform so poorly in before? Since when has a shampoo been SO nourishing, that the light reflected from the hair of the lucky damsel who uses it, has been enough to blind a crowd? Since when has a cologne been SO alluring, that a man who used it had a lady swoon into his arms on the very same day?
    These are all real examples of the blatant exaggerations that the advertising industry makes use of today in order to sell. It illustrates the shocking extent to which producers will go to make money, and is a depiction of their mercenery approach to life. I do not mean to preach; I merely feel that employing such ridiculous hyperboles, just to make a buck, is absolutely unnecessary. To say that advertisments make products seem much better than they actually are would, in fact, be an understatement; for they endow these products with qualities that, at times, defy the realms of reality!
