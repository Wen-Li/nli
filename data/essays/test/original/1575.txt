The main idea of the above topic is that  wheather " most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are".
I agree with this opinion .The reasons for this are described as follows.

Firstly,most of the advertisements are just for the sake of sales.The advertisements are to increase the value of the product which in turn increases the sales of the product.By this manufactures of the product are benifited.The advertisements are made in such a way that the tend to bias the people.
For example, consider the most famous add we see on the tv ,
"Gillete mach 3 razor".In this, the advetisement biases men to buy a gillete mach3 by showing  a man with cleanly shaven beard finds a girl easily.
This may not be true in most of the cases.The man would have used some other razor or might have got it done from a barber.This appears to us as though that the product is much better.But actually this might not be the case.There are many advertisements which seem better than they really are.

Secondly,the truth behind the fact that the product is good one is not known to any one.
For example , consider the soaps we use in our day-to-day lives.
We are biased by seeing the adds that show  people turning bueatiful and into stars by using the product. But in reality, this might not be the case.When we try these products by ourselves we can know the truth behind this.

Another thing is that they provide information on the concentrations used on the product.By seeing this we might believe that the product is good and buy it.But the actual concentrations may be different and this may be used to grab the attention of the people.In this way most advertisements make products seem much better than they actually are.
 There are a lot of examples which and lots of advertisements that mis-lead us.

From above reasons and discussions i conclude by saying that "most of the advertisements make  products seem much better than they actually are".
