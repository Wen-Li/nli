Today all the people are influenced by media. Everywhere we can see spot, pubblicity, photo, movie of a lot of products. These are used to make know the product, but often they are used to make appear the product better than in reality. 
People are always attracted by these things. A normal person in front of the television can see everyday so many spots to can dream products in the night. More the spot is good, more the person thinks the product is better. The product will no be the same betwenn advertisements and reality. Infact today nobody who wants make profit doesn-t lie. Everywhere for all the things that a person could by, there is a businness.
On the contrary in it isn-t always like this. In fact we can find products which are the same of the advertisements but this is follow by the expensive price of them. Not all the people can buy these expensive products even if they want quality products. So there is everywhere and there will be everywhere somebody who will try to sell a product less expensive than the others and with the same quality. But really only sometimes it-s true cause he-ll use all that he could for make you believe it. And at last a person who doesn-t works in this farm can-t knows the reality qualities of the product.
So, year after year there were some marks which take more place, and today when one buy something, he knows what he buy only with the writes of the mark on the product.
An adulct can knows in part what thw product is in reality, but not the child who dreams with beautiful spots. 
In the end i can say everybody know what is better, but only when one looks for the money in the bag he can choices to know what is really better.
