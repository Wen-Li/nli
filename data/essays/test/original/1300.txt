I agree with the statement that the best way to travel is in a group led by a guide.This is an effective way of enjoying all the moments in the right spirit and knowing the people around as well other than exploring the locales.I am one of those few blessed people who had the pleasure of travelling with family and and unknown people.

It brings with it the chance of making some good friends if we are with unknown people in the group.Or when we go out with our family the joy of spending time is different altogether.The best part is that one can never get bored throughout the trip.At the time of any difficulty you have people around you to help out so that makes one of the problems solved automatically.

It makes sense economically.Everybody pools in the money and so the total cost goes down considerably.e.g: Travel costs,stay costs,wining and dining costs.When these things are taken altogether it does make a bug impact on the budget allocated for the tour.Not everyone can travel alone all the time.It costs and boring most of the times.

Having a guide with the group is extremely helpful as it makes the task of locating the places easier.The biggest plus point of having a guide is that the guide gives the whole history about the places that we travel to.We get to know about the language and culture in a more firm manner through the guide.That makes the task of recognizing and identifying with the people easily.The guide also gives suggestions about what to do and what not to do but it can be expected only from very few of them.Not every guide takes a keen interest.
Things can be planned out efficiently when in a group.That makes the job of makng the decisions easier.Suggestions can be taken from people in the group and the guide also to if any problem relating to staying,eating or travelling occurs. 

Though travelling alone gives the option to be a free bird,the experience of travelling with people is a completely different experience.Anytime it weighs over travelling alone.
