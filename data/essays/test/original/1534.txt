Most of the time, there are two way of teaching. The first way could be to expose the facts and discribe these facts. The second wy could be the explanation of ideas and concepts. Some subject, as history imply the student to learn the facts. Other subjects, as philosophy, imply students to learn ideas in one side but also to understand these ideas and concepts. In fact we can see those two way of teaching in the same subject.

    To my mind, I think that it is interesting to learn facts. Facts, in the past, help us to understand the present time. In history for example leaning the facts could help us to understand the present time. Moreover when we learn facts, we learn their process, their consequences on our time. It helps students to understand the wolrd where they are living. For example learning the facts of the second worl war is really interesting for an european student because he can see, firts, the history of his country, second, what was the childood of his grand parents who can explain  cont to him this period. Economics is an interesting subject when we learn the facts. We can understand what is the origin of our socity and of our economy. We can also analize how the economy has progressed for the ninetenth century. Learning the facts is a good way too to imagine what will happen in the future. 
      But, i think that it is more important to understand ideas and concepts. I think that some people by their ideas, their genus played an important place in the History. For example, Aristote had a special view of the literature and yhe philosiphy which is still today a model for the writters. It is very important to learn the ideas end the concepts of p[eople who were a genius because they discovered things which have an impact today. Moreover some concepts seam to be eternal. For example artits are eternal by their works.

     According to me, it is more important to understand facts and concepts because they the  produce of a reflection. In general, they have no  effects of destruction
