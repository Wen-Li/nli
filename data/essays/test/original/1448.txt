Although people can have different opinion, I certainly agree with the idea that it is more important to understand ideas and concepts rather than learning facts. I have following three reasons.

First of all, today, facts can be easily found in books or using internet even if you forget them. Therefore it must be wastes of time and energies to learn and remember the facts. I know that many informations especially on the internet websites are sometimes wrong. However if you know the ideas and concepts under the facts, I think you can judge if what they say in the source are ture or not.

Secondly from my experience, facts without ideas and concepts behind them can be easily forgotten and what is more, I could not be interested in the subjects only with the facts. I took world history class in my high school. I really learned a lot of historical facts including which year the American continent was found. Yes, brief facts can help you like it was found at the very end of 15th century, but I do not think it does matter that if it was 1492 or 1495. After the final exam was finished, I was totally happy to forget all the detail facts. I sometimes regret that if I learned why they tried to find the new continet, I maybe studied more about the world history.

At last, I would like to mention about Japanese education. It might be widely known, that Japanese education is focused so much on remembering facts. So what happed now? Many kids can not think by themselves. They cannot build their perspective. Anyone cannot have their own perspective just with facts. We need ideas and concepts behind the facts for building perspective. Japanese government became upset about it, and they try to change the education. I recommend the most important first step is starting to teach ideas and concepts to kids in the formal eduation.

With the three reasons above, I stronly agree with the idea that it is more important to learn ideas and concepts than facts.
