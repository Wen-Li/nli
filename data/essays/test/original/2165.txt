I do agree with the statement that most advertisements are exaggerating their products to be seen more better. In fact, there have been many cases the consumers critisizing that the products they have purchased did not please them much but disappointed them. There are some reasons why these products being advertised are in actual fact more degrading than described in the advertisements. Plus, there are also factors which make us become attracted to the product.
  Firstly, the company exaggerates the product on purpose to make a better profit. The companies normally do not tell lies on the functions but do tell lies on how effective it is. There were many cases reported in news that the people who have actually came out in the advertisement to tell about the products efficiency did not try the actual product. Some advertisements do show the interviews of consumers. However, this act is not reliable since they may not be the real consumers.
  Secondly, the advertisement may not exaggerate but may hide the disadvantages of the product. For example, we can see a television advertisement. The advertisement will emphasize on the positive views of the television for sure, that it is wide or that it is clear. However, the television may not have a good function in channeling or may have a bad design. All consumers will choose this television when the advertisement highlights the clearness and the size, but not its design or function. And soon, the consumers will critisize the advertising company.
  Thirdly, the words use in the advertisement are too attractive. These situations are often seen on posters on buildings. I have seen many diet class posters. These posters will surely attract many obese people, who desires a better body line. However, the scientists state that a balanced diet and regular excercise are a better way to make a perfect body line. And plus, many people did not succeed in their diet by attending these diet classes.
  The unreliable interviews of consumers, the limited advertisement and the exaggerated words use are all factors which attract the consumers. However, if we, the consumers, calm ourselves down, we will be able to see that the products may or are made to be seen better than actual by those advertisement skills. We have to be careful when choosing a product, whether the advertisement is exaggerating or hiding something.
