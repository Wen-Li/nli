I strongly agree with the statememt that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are. People can see advertisements everywhere in their daily life. When walking in streets, wathing televisions, using internet, they see such huge posters around showing the products. Firstly, the purpose of the advertisements are to make consumers buy products by making those products look good. They exaggerate how useful the products are and how they can help in daily life. Therefore, production companies try to attract people to buy their products and increase their incomes.
    For instance In commercials in a television, there is someone introducing products and explaining how they work. When advertising furnitures or kitchen materials, a person stands next to the products and explain about them. For instance, in Japan, I have seen a television commercial which advertised a dining table. Since most Japanse houses are quite small, some people put a round table in a small dining room, and eat by watching TV. The advertisement was to show how this round table became larger and useful for the people. A man stood next to the round table to show the actual size of the table. My friend's family bought this round table, and got surprised when the product was sent to her house. It was actually still in a small size and there was no difference from the round tables used before. 
    People can see advertisements in magazines as well. In girls teen magazines, make ups and facial washing are shown in these magazines. When advertising facial washing soaps, the models in the magazines are all smiling, happy with the effect of the soap. Their face skin is shown very smooth that there is no pimples at all. Therefore, the teenage girls are attracted to those facial washing soaps and buy them. However, in reality, the pictures of the models in the magazines are photoshoped and removed their pimples. Actually, it depends on people's skin because sometimes, the soap can harm their skin. When I had troubles with the pimples on my face, I saw the effect of the facial soap in a teen magazine and bought it. However, it worsened.
Thus, the products themselves are not shown better, but the effect from these products are shwon better.
    Therefore, it can be said that the information of products shown in most advertisements is not true.
