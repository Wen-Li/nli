Advertisement is an often discussed matter in a time that is highly dominated by all sorts of media. In a sense of media as something that transports a meaning, advertisement also is one of them - and it is almost omnipresent. But it doesn't only have a social aspect, it is also a large factor in today's business. Some advertisements, like for example the ones in the breaks of Superbowl games, cost unbelievable amounts of sums. This money surely has to be generated somewhere else - products have to be sold. That most advertisements make them look better than they really are, just  to reach this goal, is a very common opinion about this topic.
I am a student of journalism and mass communication and therefore have heard several lectures about this specific phenomenon. I think that most advertisers make their products look better than they are,  because - and this is simple - they have to. It is necessary to make people believe that they need to buy a certain thing and in order to fulfill sales expectations they must present it in a positive way. If only seeing it in a market or a store would be enough for a person to decide to buy it, the advertisement would not be necessary at all. Research has shown that this is not the case, so companies try hard to stimulate people to buy their products. Problems occur where it is tried to achieve this effect by lying about the features of the product.
The statement seems also true to me, because of my own everyday experience. Not only TV stations show a great amount af adverts, it also becomes more and more present in the radio, one the street, in the cinema and various other public areas. Not only once have I tried one of the offered products - and been severely disappointed.
An aspect of the topic that makes it even more urgent to discuss, is that nowadays, many advertisements seem to be highly aggressive. The "stimulation" to buy a product I have mentioned before, has turned into manipulation and sometimes even into an order to do so. Making a product look good and worth buying is tried so hard that, in many cases, the mere opposite is happening: people feel repulsed by the aggression and are pushed towards a negative attitude towards the product. I think that this a dramatically dangerous development and even though I criticised the false positive presentation of products before, I would highly recommend some advertisors to return to this way of selling. Even if I do not agree with this sort of advertisement, it would certainly be a first step of improvement for them.
