"Life is a Risk", a very common saying heard. Successful people try the same things but with a better and clear prospective. They continue to do what they know well but again they also take risk.. For example the L N Mittal  - Arcelor take over risk losses
Tata Group - Nano
Relaince with reliance fresh which deals in selling vegetables at a lower price and better quality.

Although i strongly agree that successful people try new things as well as take risks rather than doing what they already know how to do well.

Risk helps you to expand business ans helps you gain a broader horizon that leads to new and better opportunities to grow and become sucessful but however the mark of risk always remains. For example Richard Brason has been an extremely successful man taking risks both personally and professionally. He satrted with a music company then going on to join hands with Virgin group, Airlines and now moving forward to space. Taking a risk of entering into avaition industry without any training or knowledge in the field created a unique place for him. He took high risk adventures like ballon flying without having any professional training in it. 

Another example of successful people would be Ratan Tata who lived upto his promise of coming out with a persons car as he had promised. It was a great achievement though he was in the same field. He successfuly completed the project of making Nano for less than $250. He made a four wheeler which accomodates 5 people as any other car would. It is gaining much appreciation as it is going to give tough competition to wheelers on the road.

The examples just dont end but with these there are many other successful leaders who continue to do what they in thier own caliber but not stopping them from taking risk at any point of time.
