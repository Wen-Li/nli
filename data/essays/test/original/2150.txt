"Successful people do what other people do not want to do"

      This is my favorite saying and I like to say it out loud everyday in order to encourage myself to break the limits of my confort-zone and to be a better person every single day. Often I feel lazy or uncapable to do certain things in life and certainly the belief that "sucessful people try new things and take risks rather that only doing what they already know how to do well", has pushed me to my edge. I want to be succesful therefore, I will do whatever it takes to get what I want. 

       That is the reason why I am here today, on a cold Sunday morning, taking the TOEFL. I could have decided to be at home having a warm breakfast with my husband in bed, but I decided to proof and improve myself. I left him, sleeping this morning, warm and lovely before I came to take this test. That is also the reason why I study hard everynight after a heavy class day. I always like to try my hardest and even when things do not result the way I want them to result, I gain many positive things out of trying. Trying makes me stronger and gives me the chance to live fully and deeply. 

      I think that life gets formed out experiences. So as many experiences that I can have, the better I am, the better I will be ready for the future. It is always easier to quite or to be indiferent to the movement of life.  But I always consider to be a good idea to keep on moving forward, even when you are not sure of where it is that you are going.  Work hard, do different things, try different ways, find your passion! Grow with life following your own flow. Every little effort that you make today, will mark the difference between you and the person right next to you tomorrow, who might had decided  to not to do what it took to get what he wanted.
