When you are student, you are likely to be in  dilemna which consists on  choosing between having broad knowledge (like what is done in the french Business School for instance), or specializing in one specific subject ( which is the case for medecine studies). 

For my part, I prefer to have a broad knowledge of many academic subjects, even if this solution includes the following shortcoming : you are not an expert at the end. 

Nethertheless, attending to different courses (finance and marketing for instance) enables you to be more open minded, to understand all the complexity of one firm for instance ( for the case of a business school) and simply, to have a more opened vision on the society, because you are able to understand more subjects, and more phenomenons.


By a personal point of view, it is a way to discover different ways of thinking, to work with different people, who sterms from various  academic background  : you are not closed in an only way of thinking. And in the same kind of argument, meeting a lot of people, having a lot and various talkings with them, you are more likely to do your own opinion about one matter for instance.
For my part, when I was in Preparatory Class, I shared my bedroom with a student who was in college of sciences, and both we appreciated to discuss to various subject ; what I  was not used to do with my classmates (because, unconsciously, we had the same ideas).

Then, studying many academic subjects is a good solution to break the day-to-day running, and that is important  for me. I can not imagine to do always the same thing, without upheald.

To sum up, I am convinced that having a broad knowledge of many academic subjects is a good method.
