Some people think that young people nowdays do not give enough time to helping their communities, but other people think that young people give enough time to helping their communities.
  I think that many young people do not give enouth time to help the others because they tell that they haven't  many time to spend for the community. 
  It is not true, because if a person want to do something for the society he can do it. The time is only an excuse.
  Many young people prefer to use their free time playing or doing different activities that they like most.
  For example, in my school there are a lot of boys that, after the lessons, go to join theirselves. They do not give any time to helping their communities. After the school, i take the train; i go to Milan all the days and i arrive at home very tired, but i do different activities to helping my community.
  I help the old men and women; i go to play with the children and i go with them to school to do the homework. The people do not pay me: i am a volunteer. I also teach  catholic religion to children and i very happy to do something for my community.
  I agree with the statement: in my small town there are only few people that do give their time to helping the others.
 The time that the young people use for other is not enough and i think that we could do more for our communities: in the future time, we will want that some people will do give time to helping us.
