I traveled about 20 countries in my life. Traveling around the world was fun and very good experiences for me. Sometimes, I traveled by myself or friends and I used group package tours with a tour guide. Some people said that travling group led by a tour guide is the best way. In my opinion, there is no way for best way for traveling and you can enjoy your trip without a tour guide and not invloved in group.
    Traveling in a group led by a tour guide, there isn't much free time to enjoy yourself. You have to follow a tour guide and listen what he says. After that, you have to ride a bus right away and go to the next place. These are all scheduled by a tour guide, so you cannot enjoy yourself. Personal tastes are all different, and you might want to stay more time in some places. However, it is impossible to do whatever you want, because it is a group tour.
    Traveling is series of unexpected happening. I think it is one of the reason that people are enjoying the trip. A group tour has fixed schedules, so experiencing unexpected accidents are very rare. Some people might don't want to have this kind of situations. However, when you look back your trip in the future, I can strongly say that unexpected accidents gives you more memeries and portrait on your trips.
    Tour with a guide are more expensive. All the package tour fees are including payment for guides, so it costs more that traveling without guides. Thesedays, many travelers go to the trip by themselves to save money, and there are a lot of information to help them.
    There is no best way for traveling. Everything can be changed depening on trip of purposes. I think best way to traveling is not a group led by toyr guide, but for you memories
