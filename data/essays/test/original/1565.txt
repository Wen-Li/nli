As ypu know , people can work in a group because they can make it more wonderful,but travel is not by together to make it wonderful or safely.If you fell great, the trip is successful.That's Why I don't agree with that the best way to travel is in a group by a tour guide.
  Some years before, my parents and I get into a group to visit Australia.We visit many beautiful place, but we can't get time to visit the place where we like.When you get into a group to somewhere to visit. You have to listen to the guide,what he say are almost business things sounds like where can by some gift and many more information that we can do nothing.
   In then next,when ones come to anothere city or country, the first thing he will do is learn about local cuture.You can not to buy something or just walk and walk, because you want to learn about it. You must not to get there to eat fastfood for learning local culture.
   In the third, you need to rest in yout trip,and not to get busy in your trip.Travel in a group led by a tour guide can also make you to feel your trip is too short and too busy to enjoy your trip.Not only can it make you unhappy,but also it can make you tired. If you travel by yourself or by a group which only are your friends, you can feel relaxed, and taht maje you put more metion to your next work.
  That's all of my opinion,nejoy yout trip in yourselves life,how fun you can get is only by yourself.I am love in this travel style,what about you? Let it to be.
