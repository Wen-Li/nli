 In my opinion, I am agree with this statment, because I think that if do not try to made new thing you will never learn to make new  things.  Some times when you make something by the first time the most probable is that it do not will be a good work or will be as you want, and you will have to do in a better way the next time and you will be learning many new things and will obtine new experience.  For example, I from Quetzaltenango, and I live ther all my life, but some day I have to drive to Guatemala city, and I never drive here, and I do not know this place very good and the fisrt time I was lost, and I do not know where I was, but the experience of drive many times here you will go learning new places, and the same is with all, for example, I work fixing computers but the firs time that I made it almost burn a computer, but the experience that I have now is a lot, and in cluse I can repair that in a few minuts;  but if you only made only one thing, the most probable is that you will made it very well, but you can not do any thing more, and is important thath you know many things, because for example if in your house the tub in your bathroom is not work, you will call at the person that will repair that, but if you know some thing about it, but you can not rapair that because you do not have time, you can leave the work at this person and you are sure that he will do a good work because you know what it has and what happen with that.  

    In conclusion, I am agree with the statment "Successful people try new things and take tisk rather than only doing what they alredy know how to do well" because it help you to be a better person, and if you take risks in your life you will take experience in many things, and if you do something wrong, you will know that the next time you will not do it again or you will do it in a diferent way.
