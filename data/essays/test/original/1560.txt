I agree with the statement that successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well.
     One of the reasons that I think it is is because people can be sccuessful only after you start new things.  When you try to do something new, it can end being sccessful, or can end not being.  But how could you get a sccess withought even starting it?   The point is that if you want to get a sccess, you first try to start something.
     Another thing is that taking risks can lead you to be a successful person in the end.  When you take risks, that is when you will face some problems doing it.  I think those times are when you learn to do something, because you will be dealing with problems, and after a while, you will have grown.  When you have grown, I think you have scceeded in your life.
     We can see why you have to take risks from some people, too, like hikers.  Some people go into mountain with only a bag, try to go somewhere they have never been to.  They are risking their life, but when they make it, you can always see their face full of smile which shows you their huge sccess.
     If you do what you already know all the time, you cannot never go ahead.  Once you start new things, and take risks, you can go forward.  Being sccessful is not that easy to be, because there is always "not sccessful" on the other hand.  However, without even starting the new things, you will not be able to learn anything.
