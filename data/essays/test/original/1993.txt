I agree that traveling in a group led by tour guide is the best way. The reason has two. One reason is that we can more enjoy the trips. The other is that we can get our safements if we are led by tour guide. Now, I will discuss about the reasons. 

 At first, if we take part in a tour travel, we can share feelings with our group. For example, we are moved by great buildings during our travel. We want to convay our feeling to someone. If we have a group, we are able to talk about our thinkings or feelings with group members.  Furhermore, a tour guid tell a lot of knowledges about history, buildings, traditional thhings in the place which we visit and so on. If coming along, we cannot know many interesting knowledges. These things may makes us more enjoy.

 Next, when we meet a dangerous accident, a tour guide gives a good advice. Because a tour guide is a professional of traveling. For example, if our wallets are stolen by someone, the guide tells How I should do. So, we can travel safely. Moreover, I group members encourages with one another. 

 A tour travel has a many good points. We can travel happily and safely. As described acvobe, I think that traveling in a group led by a tour guide is the best way to travel.
