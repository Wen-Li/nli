I disagree that to travel in a group led by a tour guide is the best way for a person to tavel. There are many reason to why i have this oppinion. First of it depends on who the group is and if I feel good traveling with them. I need to know the people I am traveling with and like them, if i dont know them or if it is a random group, I would not travel. second, if I travel with a tour guide he would have set up our trip and where we go each and every day, so maybe I would not like some of the places that we are going to but i have to be with my group, some people would like where we are going but i might not. Another reason is that if you want to do something you need to ask the group and take their oppinion and most importantly ask the tour guide. 
It is better to travel on you own because of many reasons. First you get to chose who you want to travel with and to where you are going and you set up your trip and what you are going to do every day in your trip. When a person travels alone without a guide most importantly he gets to have his freedom in his trip. 
In conclusin, I do not recommend anyone to travel in a group led by a tour guide, and I tell them that it is much better to travel on your own and you choose what you want to do everyday and where to go. You also do not have to take anybody's vote on anything or ask  a leader if you want to do something, you just take you own vote and do anyhting you want.
