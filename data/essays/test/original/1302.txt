Advertisements

                    I agree with the following statement'' most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are". 
 There are many type of advertisements, the main and the common type is the visual advertisements, also it is an effective  way to attract the people and to take their attention about specific products.For example,there is alot of amaizing advertisements in television about a different type of trades. as simply the person will sit in front of the television and can see different short clips about a certian products then they immediatly go to find it and buy it even they don't know exactly what is the details of how to use it or where it made.alot of products seem much better than they really are in the quality or how they looked according to the technology and photoship. alot of adjustments were done to these products before they show them to us just to attract the people . Nowadays, the life is change and the people trying to find the new and the strainge whatever the quality is but this is not applicable at all only at a specific level of the society.
       The most effective advertisments that one which combined alot of things to attract the people, visually and soundly because the human being is emotionally, can be affected . 
         Also the advertisements could be attractive, attract the one who watch it or can be in the opposite side .
        Finally, as that mentioned above that the advertisment if it used in a proper way it will be most effective and attractive .
