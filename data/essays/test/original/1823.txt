'Prosperity is a great teacher, Adversity greater.'
The above qoute clearly expresses the point of view of successful people. Also i personally agree with the statement of the question.
Successful people are more prone to take risks and try to learn new things every time.
Success is measured not by the return one has achieved by his effort but trying to do the same thing every time he has failed.
Perseverance is a very common trait shown by successful people and they also have a 'Never Say Die' attitude which works for them every time they are in a difficult situation.
Stating an example of a famous person from India would make my point more clear.
Dhirubahi Ambani is a term synonymous with almost every person in my country. He was a Professor's student who went abroad for his studies and got employed latter with a big banner company. During his tenure of employment, he learned every business strategy and decided to start his own business as an entrepreneur inspite of the company offering him a very high post in there office abroad.
He came back to India with his knowlegde wealth and started his working towards his goal with zeal. At first he met with many obstacles which started straight from his father but he did not give up. He faced many financial problems but did not let down from his goal of starting his own business. When his financial problems were solved he faced problems challenging the established set patterns of business in his region but still his attitude of perseverance got him through. He tried something new with risking his whole personal life and eventually he met with success from all quarters. Today Reliance industries has achieved global levels and it is due to his long lasting efforts.
From above example, i have shown how successful people try new things while taking risks and still achieve success. It is not in falling every time but trying to get up after every fall is important.
