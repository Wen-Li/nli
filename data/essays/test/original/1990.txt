 Having knowledge about many acedemic subjects may seem appealing. However, trying to learn information about many subjects will raise the risk of missing important details about a subject. Additionally, trying to learn many things may become boring where as studying a subject that really catches your interest is fun. Furthermore specializing in one specific subject will make a person more successful in that area and present advantages like making a career in that subject. As a result, in order to avoid the risks that are raised by trying to learn about many subjects and to gain other advantages, I believe that having specialized knowledge in one specific subject is more preferable.
    To begin with, in order to have knowledge of many academic subjects, one has to omit the details. However these details may be very important to that subject. To illustrate, a student may try to know little about all of his/her subjects. While trying to do this, s/he may miss important points of the subjects and s/he may end up with not being successful at any of these subjects. Instead, if s/he tries to gain more knowledge in one specific subject, s/he will be appreciated for his/her talent in that subject.
    Secondly, there are many different academic subjects and we may not be interested in all of these subjects. If we continue trying to learn things about the subjects which we don't like at all, we will be bored at the end. We may even give up studying the subjects we like. On the other hand, studying a subject which is interesting for us can be really fun. Obviously having fun while studying will result in a much more effective learning.   
    Finally, having detailed knowledge in one specific subject is very beneficial in the way it gives the opportunity to further specialize in that subject. For example, in Software Engineering, there are many areas on which you can focus your studies. If you choose one of these subjects to become specialized, you have the chance to further improve your abilities in that subject. As a result, after graduation you will be an expert in your area and this will increase the job opportunities presented to you. 
       In conclusion, trying to have broad knowledge about many subjects has disadvantages that cannot be ignored. In contrast, having specialized knowledge in one specific subject has the benefits of being appreciated for your success in that subject, making the learning process more fun, and presenting further career opportunities. For these reasons, I don't agree with the idea of having broad knowledge of many subjects is better than specializing in one subject.
