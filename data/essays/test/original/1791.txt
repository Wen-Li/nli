Personal achievement and success never come without risk. When seeking personal success, there are two alternative approaches. A person can stick with familiar situations or take on risks and venture into completely new paths. Although this decision heavily relies upon a person's unique characteristics, I believe that success calls for courage and availability to take risks.
    First, personal success may entail a fullfilling job. If this is the case, and a person realizes that his or her current job is not conducive to the desired outcome, the person has to be willing to change job. For example, a person seeking international exposure might have to resign and look for another job. Alternatively, he or she might have to travel and relocate to another country. This will require the ability and willingness to adapt to new situations, like learning a different language or living far away from family and loved ones. In turn, the person takes a risk.
    Second, personal success may entail experimenting with choices and situations that are very different from those we grow accustomed and come to master. For example, I have always wanted to play the piano. Although I have studied the guitar for several years, thus becoming proficient in playing it, the piano proved to be a very challenging and different instrument. However, being able to play it was very important to me. Had I stuck with what I knew best, I would have never started piano lessons and never enjoyed the pleasure of spending nights playing it. 
    Whether it be picking a job or a hobby, the definition of personal success and the degree of adversion to risk shape a person's approach to life choices. However, successful people tend to be those that embrace risk as a part of a less predictable but certainly more fullfilling life.
