 No I do not agree about this subject for many reasones ,and what might happen to the market or the compeny when they lie or repersent their product in better than as it is.
    Firist the compeny when they create a new product the should make advertisement for thier product ,but they don't have to make it better than how does the product looks like becuase if they make it better than how does it looks like the people will be supprised and they will not trast them on their new products any more, becuase the lied to the people about their porduct .
    Second the compeny will not success in there probuct and they people will not buy it ,for example one time I saw a product on the T.V and they said it is the best and when you try it you can not leave it ,but unfortunately when I went to the market I saw a guy who was talking to the salers about the product and how the company lied to the people and then I desieded to not buy the product .And this a semple example how the company might lose thier money in their products and no baddy buy the products.so the compeny has to get more customars to successed in thier work and get mare money , and to make the people trast thier products and them ,too.
    I suggest that if a company want to make an advertisement on the T.V or in the roads or anywhere they do not have to lie to get more money to thier company has to foces in the money and how to grab them not to lie on them , so the company want to sale a new product the people can trast them more than any company because the represent thier product and they did not lie to the people about it .
