In twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today. According to me, that would be a dream becoming true because I think that we live in a way too much polluted world.
To stick back to the subject, I think that there will be less cars in the future. In Paris, driving drives people crazy, especially since our mayor created corridors for the buses. Our mayor, Bertrand Delanoe, has also accrued the numbers of buses for the day and ameliorated the night bus service which are both really good things. So more people are using the buses than before and are leaving their cars in their car parks.
Also, when you live in big city, at certain times, it takes you less time to go somewhere when you use the bus or the subway than if you had taken your car. Traffic-jams are horrible in Paris, everybody yells at everybody; everybody is being rude and impolite also it is really stressing and gets on everybody's nerve.
If you want to go to the countryside, you can take the train, and while, you are travelling, you can do whatever you want, you can read, phone, listen to music, sleep, eat..But when you are driving, you cannot do all these things, no, you have to watch the road with attention, you cannot fall asleep. Driving is really stressing, you cannot enjoy the views or the landscapes, but only look at the black asphalt of the road.
I was thinking of something else also: in France, every year, we have many car accidents caused by alcohol abuse. Maybe these accidents feared people and now they are less reluctant to driving.
For example: I know that if I am going to a party with my friends and that I will drink overthere, I would not feel secure to driving back my friends.
An other element that can reduce the number of cars on the roads is the fact that now, some firms and companies ask their employees to share their cars, to do what we call in France 'co-driving'. Also, when I think of it, I know that sometimes my mum feels lazy after work, and that she has not got the courage to drive back home. So she takes the subway and leaves the car on the car-park of the company, poor little car, all alone in the dark, at night instead of being in the heaten car-park nearby our house!!!!
Sincerely, I hope that in the future, there will really be less cars, that people will more often use the public means of transport or their bicycles. I would really like our city Paris to be like one of these cities in China where everybody travels with its bike.
