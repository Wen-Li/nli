I live in a country where we have to learn a lot of different subjects until we are 18 or 19 years old. I really think we can have different points of view on this subject.
Let's write down the good and the bad points of each proposition before making a conclusion.

    Having a broad knowledge is very important as it is a basis.
You can't make a really good specification without any core knowledge. That is why you have to study various subjects before specialzing.
You also can improve your personnal culture by learning a lot of subject, which will create a strong basis very important to be adaptable and even open-minded, on topics-of science for example-.
Moreover, when you are young you often don't want to know what you want to do in the future. In that case, learning a lot of different things on different subjects can keep all solutions possible for you. It closes at least no doors.

    Learning really specific things permits you to have a great competence on a subject. It may permit you to work faster with shorter studies which can obviously be a great thing.
Then, when you specialize a lot, you can make really long studies and maybe get a good job.
When you really hate certain subjects or really love others, their is no hesitation to make : just specialize. If you really enjoy biology, stop learning litterature.
This kind of education permits you to be a real champion on a subject, it's certain, but I hope you really, really love it.


I think that it is really important to have a certain number of core competences that you must learn as long as possible. It's a difficult thing to choose between maths and geography, or litterature and biology, so it can be a good thing to be able to have a high knowledge in all those subjects. As a matter of fact, I had big problems to choose what subject or main field I really wanted to study after having left High School and it might be hard to think that you are studying a subject instead of another.
