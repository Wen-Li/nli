Some people say that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide. They insist that with the help of tour guide trip would be way safer and more fun.  However, I am not favor of the idea that travel with a lot of people and tour guide for two reasons. First, I am able to change my plan whatever I want during the trip. Second, a lot of people could distract my plan. I will expalin in detail. 
     More than anything else, my plan could be flexible while I am traveling. Of course, tour guide could show us a lot of historical places with certain plans. But what if I would spend there than I would have expected? It is true that traveling alone is a lot more flexible and exciting becuase nobody cares my plan. Let me take my experience for example. When I was first year of college, I went to Japan for the first time by myself. Truely, It was a little nervous and scared becasue I could not speak any Japanese and I had no cousin there. However, I had wanted to go abroad without anyone's help. 
On the second day of my first trip in Japan, I went to art museums where had  displayed prestigious Japanese arts. While I was watching a number of arts, I listened some student's complaining. They were talking about plans that they had assined. To be specific, they argued with one tour guide. Some students was really wanted to stay at museum, but the guide just kept saying that plan was already designed. At the moment, I was really relieved that I would not have to argue with a guide who had strict plan. 
     Moreover, a number of people might be able to  distract my trip. 
Obviously, some people could make a trip unhappy becuase of their lazyness or reckless behaviors. It was recently reported from my university school news paper that a large number of students  want to go travel by themseleves. They were interviewd that they had a bad memory due to annoying people in group. Obvi
