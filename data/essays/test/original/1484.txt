According my personnal experiences and personality, I think that it is a happy time for me to travel in a group, such as sharing the happiness with your friends, helping  each other and experiencing different culture,customs and delicious  food and so forth. Moreover, there are numerous benefits for that, I, just, put several good reasons as follow.

One the greating thing about travelling in a group is sharing the happiness along the trip. Outside the home, we commonly enjoy the picturesques scenes, hold the fresh air of nature. We are happy,   each one in a group has different experience about the wonderful trip.  That is more, sharing the happiness is a major task companied the trip.

Another point worth mentioning about it is that it  is necessary to help each other in the trip whil  we may be in some occasion accidents or trouble. Travelling is not always a good trip. Maybe one of my group be careless to hurt his/her ankle because of the wet road, doing  a favor with each other is conspicuously important. At the same time, you do not feel anxiety and nervouse in a group. It is safe for you to travel in them.

In addition, experiencing the extoic fansty and differnt culture,custom is an excellent  enjoy.  Meanwhile, during the process of the trip, we also make friends with several people of different conturies who have the same love, travelling around the world. Acrossing  the aboundaries of the space and get-togetherring in the same place, we are talking, laughing and enjoying the leisure time.

Each of the trip in a group, more or less, I can learn from the more knowledges, experiences and lessons of life. Our group is like a huge family which gives warm and kind for each in them. I would like to travel all over the world not to be lone, but in a group.
