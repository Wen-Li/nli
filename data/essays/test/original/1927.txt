I disagree with this opinion. My opinion is there is the subjects the student should study the concepts and facts and should not study the concepts. I have several reasons to support my opinion.
The first reason is if the students only lean the facts without ideas or concepts, the students may able to remember the facts and they can use their facts in the exams, but they only can use shortly their facts, in order to pass through the time of cousrese the students will forget. However, if the students learned the ideas or concepts they can use the ideas or the concepts to solve the questions or the problems even though they forgot the facts. 
The second reason is if the students only learn the facts, when the students have to do the new type of questions and problems, they can not do it, because they had not experienced those questions, but if the students leraned the ideas and concepts they can understand the meaning of the qustions, they may not answer the questions completely but they can still process to thier answers. 
On the other hand, I think there is the subjects or things only need to study thier facts. For example some simple algebra  mathmatics fomulas, I do not think the students need to learn the concepts or the ideas. I think the ideas of the fomulas are to complicated, the ideas only cofuse the students and make the students less interest on mathmatics, but the students really want be mathmatician or scientist, the teachers at the school should teach them individualy.
