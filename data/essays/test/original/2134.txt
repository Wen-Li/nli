Although many countries have to be comfronted with the problems caused by cars, we, human beings, completely depends on this kind of machines. Most of us, especially those in developed worlds, is unable to survive without cars. I believe that in twenty years there will be more and more cars in use than there are today.

People are feeling the power of modern technologies everywhere, but technologies are not strong enough to find an ideal alternative of cars used recently. Trains are too big and ponderous; hydrogen-driven cars are too expensive and unstable; planes have been proven not sutible to short-distance transportation. So we still live under the shadow of cars. Moreover, there is no evidence that the replacement for cars can happen in recent years. Therefore, the amount of cars used in future will increase or at least won't be less than today's level.

Many developing worlds are requesting more and more cars. China is a very good example. If you are lucky to visit Beijing, the capital of China, recenctly, you will find the traffic jams are rife from day to night. The huge capital cannot contain 3 millions cars, which are still increasing at the rate about 200,000 cars per month. The similar landscape is reoccuring in Bankok of Thailand. Moreover, statistical data reveal the increasing trends of cars in these hot regions. Therefore, it is able to be concluded that cars used in twenty years will be more than today does.

Now, it would be wiser if we should concentrate us on the negative problems caused by ever-increasing cars. Scientists and governments should be unitied to fight against the issues such as fossil fuel polutions, developments and extensions of city, and shortage of suitable energies.
