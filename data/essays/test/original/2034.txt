I agree most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are. 21th century is the age of technology. By the tremendous development of the technology, new products are made day by day. More products lead to a huge competition between the producer since the customers make a decision of which product they have to buy. The companies most important strategy turns to make an attractive advertisements to win this competition.

First of all today it is much more easier to introduce products since the increase of the televisions and computer. For example when a person comes from work and wants to have a rest, after the meal she firstly watches television to enjoy. By watching television she sees the advertisements naturally without any wanting. Therefore she can be impressed with one of the products she sees and decides to buy it with no doubt. Also in televisions or on the internet the colours and voice effects are sometimes very attractive. Any body can give a sudden decision to buy that product by only the effect of the good-written story of the advertisement.

Also there are lots of advertisements, put on the walls. When the time of  travelling or going to work they are seen every day. For example last year while  I am in the bus and going to school I saw an advertisement about a cellular phone. The advertisement says that it always works whenever it falls into see. But after three months that I had bought it I dropped it accidentally in a water and quicky picked it up there. After the that day I could not use my phone. Therefore advertisements are not informs real qualities everytime.

As a result we can always impressed and attracted by the advertisements. But they are just an advertisements as its name implies. If you look at them with wisely, it can be easily understood that advertisements make products seem much better than they really are.
