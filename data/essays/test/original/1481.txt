I completely agree with this statement.This is because people today have a tendancy to onl;y look at the bigger picture,not the minute details which may be as,if not even more important.So,they easily get distracted by big brands,shinning logos,big promotions,promotional stars and all the glamour and glitzy.This they do without understanding or wondering about the content,the real quality.
   So advertisers today take advantage of this fact to the fullest.They make loud advertisements,promotions of the event which not always highlights what  the product is about but it surely has a big star,big ad campaign promoting it.
   Take for instance,the chip making giant Intel.People today would go in for a computer only if it has a 'intel' logo on it.They do not actually understand what's inside it or what it actually does but it's promotion is immaculate.People don't even know there are better and cheaper substitutes available in the market which will perform better but the unfortunately,since they haven't heard of the  particular logo they wouldn't go in for one.
   Another case in point is the world's second richest man-Bill Gates.Most of us do not know this for a fact that his 'Microsoft' empire spent almost 10 times as much on advertising their product rather  on developing it.So,in what has come to be expected in this world today,Microsoft is supreme leader in it's field again when better substitutes such as Apple,Macintosh are available in the market but since these brands failed in promoting their product they are lagging behind even with a superior product.
   Another example in another field would be the likes of 'Reebok','Adidas' or 'Nike' which though are selling almost identical products,but their market shares vary.Adidas with promotional names such as Beckam,Tendulkar,Messi,Maradona is the market leader followed by Nike with Toger Woods,Federer and so on.The only reason they trail Adidas is not because their product is inferior but because they started their promotional and branding campaign a lot later.
In conclusion,products which are sold the most in market today are not necessarily the ones which offer the best quality or service but infact are the ones which are promoted the most aggressively by advertisements,branding,celebrities.Thus,an advertisement today is successful in convincing the general public about a product's quality or 'greatness' which does not exist in reality and it also easily displays the ignorance of today's consumer.
