Though it is appealing that the increasing amounts of cars will strengthen the burden of both the society and the environment, in my opinion, it is quite impossible to have fewer cars in the twenty years. My reasons will be mentioned as following.

The pursuing of a safer life stimulates the growth of the cars. The horrible situation of that prevalent disease are deeply impressed by the whole country. At that time, the most effective way to pass the disease is passing by public. The public transportation forms as underway, taxi,bus are frightening people by the potential disease they posses. As a result,the hot trend to buy cars starts from that period. It is because that majorities believe that they can stay in a much safer condition in their own cars, at least having less opportunities to contact the public.  Since future is unpredictable, how the enthasium to buy cars for sake of safety will decrease?

Besides, the better conditions of living contributes a lot to the phenomenon. People are generally getting rich, hence it is reasonable for them to enjoy a better life. Why not buy a car on the condition that people can afford them? To those who have career, being squeezed in the buses during the rush-our can be a nightmare.If possible, won't it be a good choice for them to have their own cars if affordable, both being effective and comfortable?

Futhermore, the productive ability has an incredible influence on the huge amounts of cars. Since the policy released by the government that automobile industry is listed as the most powful one in our country, a soaring increasement of car company began to invest in our country. According to the latest statistics,China will exceed Germany to be the third largest car producing country in the world. At that time, so many inventory will surely be a headache to those companies. To promote the sales, they will use a lot of measures to attract consumers. Who won't take actions under that condions as cars are cheaper and cheaper.

In brief, the situation is not so positive now. Cars are expected to be fewer but the facts contradicts it. Hence, to keep a better conditions of living, the decreasement of the cars is the trend in the future. To achieve that , it need the actions from both the government and individuals.
