This is an argumentative standpoints whether most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are. Depending on personal judgement , we may find that some people will agree that the advertisements make things looks like better , in contrast , some will not agree this point of view. The judgement , however , is hard to make. Nevertheless, in my opinion, I think the the former statement is more reasonable. Among countless factors which can influence the judgement , there are some conspicuous  as follows. 
First of all, the main reason why I support the above statement is that advertisements make products more popular than the product which do not be showed on TV or newspaper. For example, Dell is a one of the most famous brands of computer in the world. You could see Dell's advertisements everyday. And there is an unfamous brand in my country, which you even do not hear about it at all. Now, you want to buy a computer , which brand will you choose?  It must be Dell. But in fact, the quality of this unfamous brand computer is better than Dell. So the advertisements make products seem much better.
In addition, I agree with the statement also because the advertisements will exaggerate the functions and qualities of the products. For instance , a very famous cell phone company says that their new cell phone is very strong , you can use it as a tool when you are in emergency . However, nobody will use their phones as a tool. But people would buy this kind of cell phone just because of this function. In fact, the cell phone is sound as other cell phones.
Of course, sometimes advertisements are not useful. For example, a new brand claims that it is the best in all other same products.This will not persuade the customers at all. But I feel that the advertisements influence people deeply. 
Considering and analysis all these facts , frankly speaking , most advertisements make products seem better.
