Thinking about education processes it is possible to affirm that it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts. The understanding allow the student not only to adquire knowledge, but also to use that knowledge in the solution of different real problems. 

A commun education problem is that the teachers usually ask the students to learn facts and not to understand the concepts or ideas that they are learning, so the learning process becomes an insolated thing that does not result useful for the real life. If the students do not understand what they have learnt and they only worry about memorizing information, that information or knowledge will be completely unuseful for them.

On the other hand, the learning process has to be significative for the student, so he can be motivated with his own learning. In this way, if the teacher does not help the student to understand the ideas or conceps, the learning process will not be significative for the student and he will not be interested on continue learning what he would consider unuseful things. 

The knowledge or the information becomes interesting for any person when he or she is able to understand that information, when you only memorize or learn facts it is difficult for you to get interested on that. What is more, if a person does not understand one concept or idea it would be  difficult to keep that idea in his/her mind, in other words, the information that is not understood is easily forgetable. 

In conclusion,  in the teaching  process is very important to worry about the learning process of the students for helping them not to learn facts or memorize information, but to understand the ideas and concepts that they have adquired, and also for him/her to be able to apply the knowledge in real contexts.
