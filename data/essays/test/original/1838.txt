In this essay i will tell you why businesses make thier product look better than it is in real, and the advantageous and disadvantageous for both buyer and seller. could advertizement be harmfull sometime? 
i will answer my first question which is why business make thier product look good and perfect to people. These days people value the product by the way it looks, so companys is trying to attract people by making thier product look the best on the market, which could be good from the outside but fake from the inside, and i disagree with that, becasue the buyer is trusting the company and buying the product, so he should be given the right to have a neat product. The company will only car about thier profit which is ofcourse a smart tihng to do but they must also be aware of its product quality. 

For the seller,  he will benefit from the money he will get from the customers, although, if it wasn't that effective, customers will never buy from it again and buz talking will spread out therefore the business will decline.

i will always suggest that the business should not fake its product, they should be honest with people and be aware of the fact of cheating.
