In this statement, i totally agree with the statement that  most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are.My reasons as below.

To begining with,advertisement can bring amazing thing to this products.expeically new products.when company show up their new product, they will choose take advertisement to make people know that, which can introduce the product new technology, new ways new ideaing and so on.Or take other methods to get access to their goals,such as in the supermaket, the sales take advertisements to buyers, the buyers can get the advertisement to know and realize the products.

Seconds, when the products coming up, they need more methods to realize by people,and can take a lot of example to inhance this goals. take the example to support my statement. when the computer invention,people do not know what is the computer, how to use that,and to useful to their life.Then, the company can take advertisement on TV,people watch the advertisement, they will go to shopping to find the computer,and buy it. Finally,they found that the computer is very useful in their life. make a vitual things easiely,and use computer get the internet, they can get more and more information from all over the world.

Furtherore,in our country, a lot of people living here.the products will through advertisements to get the goals.particularly some small  companys.people have entertainment in their life, the most activies is watching TV.Take an example to support that.when they watching TV, watching lovly program,in the interrupt, will have a advertisement show up. and the companys will opportunity to show their products,make people knows and like that,also can from advertisements get information,which produncts are good or not. 

In sum,I totally agree with the statement that the most advertisement make products much better than we really are.
