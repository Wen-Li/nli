Taking risks is a part of business ventures. If people would step back at the thought of the negatives of the taking the risks there would not be any growth in the way one thinks. There would be no changes in the pattern of people handling their business. For instance if the kellogs company which makes cornflakes would only stick to its idea of making only normal daily cornflakes then there would be no change in the profits of the company. The other products like kellogs chocos that it markets has proved to be of a great profit to them. So if it would not take the risk of investing in a new business it would never be aware of the profits that it has made.
Businessmen and entreprenuers are always at a risk of loss when they invent in some new business but this never avoids them from investing further money. The fear of failure should not hamper one from going ahead. Besides trying new things gives us an experience of the pros and cons of a particular business. Trying new things gives a better prospective for growth. It is rightly said that a human being is a learner till the end. Some people often think that they do know everything about a particular issue or topic. But there maybe so many things that one may not be aware of. 
Staying only on one side of the fence and thinking about only that one side would never give us an idea about whats kept in store for us on the other side. By looking around and trying to gain information from surroundings we may actually learn many new things. Trying our hands at something new would make us aware of the different ways in which we handle our lives. It could bring about an everlasting change for the better.
