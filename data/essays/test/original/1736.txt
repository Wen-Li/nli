It is a complex issue whether advertisments make  products seem better than they really are.I should say effect of advertisements of products varies from product to product.It basically depends on what the company wants to convey  to the consumers about certain product like quality,reliability ,price, after sales services etc.But I  agree with the statement that most advertisements make seem much better than they really are. Herebelow i would like to provide some examples in the support.


   Firstly, take the example of  Japanese car "Toyota." The toyota car company  in its advertisements for this car states that over a million of customers are using this car worldwide including United States.
Company while advertising knows that this advertisement is working pretty good for incresement in sales of its car but the fact is that there are other cars available in the market of the same segment and with equaly good features and price range.But their sales are not as much as toyota cars. That means advertisements of toyota is having an edge over the other cars in regard to its volume of sales.


   Secondly, If  one take an example of any food product.For example Mac donald's burger.Though every body is aware  that it is a junk food which has lot of calorific values and its effect on health but number of outlets opening out in different parts of the world.Macdonald's famous advertisement, "I am loving it" for its products is working like a magic which is helping to increase the volume of sales and increasing number of outlets opening.This sales increase is taking place besides the fact that the products are having bad efect on health.This is possible because of its kind of advertisements .

   In conclusion, citing the aforesaid examples one can definately say that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are.
