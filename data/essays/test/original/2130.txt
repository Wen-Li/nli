In my opinion in twenty years there won't be fewer cars in use, because of the society. With the phrase "society" I mean all of us, no matter in which country. 
I think we now get used to cars for a long time and I think it would be very hard to give up such a important "helper". Many people can't image life without a car. A car makes many things in life much easier, or should I say more comfortable. You don't have to care about buses or trains and their sometimes chaotic schedules. The only thing you have to do is, sit in the car and drive where you want. Many people may argue that driving will be to expensive in twenty years, because of the declining petrol resources on earth and the increasing petrol prices. But I think the only solution for this problem could be cars with other engines. I mean there are several new techniques like gas or solar for example. Many of these techniques are already used. I think in twenty years we will have not fewer cars as nowadays, I think there will be more. But the cars will run from different fuel resources. Many people in the "western world" already have cars. In many families there are more than only one car, often two, three or maybe four. But in the eastern world, like China, not everyone or even every family have already a car. But they will have a car. The same will happen in many of the African countries. Every year the wealth increase there in a high rate. Many people there will be able to buy a car in some years. 
I think this will be the reasons for a increasing number of cars, in the next years. I think nobody want to use the bus or something else instead of the own car, me too...
