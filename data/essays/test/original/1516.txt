Human beings have never compromised with innovations, from the stone age to present modern life, the society has worked for the betterment and development as a whole. One of the finest example could be a the steam engine, that drived many countries for almost half century, the best use of steam engines was for locomotive purposes, and one of the most seen locomotive is a car. Car on the  course of development has reached to such a perfect stand that it has become necessity for each individual. With the advances of the machines and other faccilities it has become the most helpful invention for the mankind and since then there has been a gradual increase in the number of cars on the road. And I still belive that though there could be many reasons why one can thinks of fewer number of cars in the nxt twenty years i do not agree to the point.

To begin with I shall try to give some reasons why one can think that there would be fewer number of cars on the road. 
 Car requires fuel,such as petrol or diesel or some other form of energy providing fossil. The number of cars on the road depends a lot on the supply of fuel which definately will finish on our earth but then the reservoirs have enough fuel to last  for nest ten decades and the explorers are in search of new oil feilds, moreover we have also shifted from the basic fuels to alternate fuels such as the cars driven by electric supply. Hence, I dont think this could be one of the reasons why there would be fewer cars in use after twenty years then now.
    Then other reason could be that people might opt for other mode such as personal planes which are far more efficient and save time, but they are not very economical and does not fit to the pockets of many!  Other resason could be that people might shift to public transport because the present number of cars can be seen as the saturation in the big cities like Washington or NewYork, but there are many other countries where the saturation is still not reached, in fact the larger portion of the society in developing countries was not so sufficient to buy cars as they are now and hence, the market expects a larger rowth may be in next twenty years these markets would also saturate and to save time people might switch to public transports but then too the numbers of cars would be much more then present. Moreover public transport can always be opted at the cost of independence.

In general one opts for another option if the present condition is not able to satisfy the needs, or is heavy on pocket or some sort of hidden advantages, but i see no other option giving so many advantages as a normal car does atleast when compared to the options we have. Unless their is a better alternative that I can not see of in present future I can not agree to the point that there would be fewer number of cars after twenty years.
