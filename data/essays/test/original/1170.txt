I am going to explain why i am agree whit this sentence.
I think that the spreading out of the wealthness through the world, however through the rich part of the world, causes a decreasing of the attention of the youngs towards the necessities of the other people. They would have all in a little time and they are not able to make anothers efforts in order to help the others.
At the time being youngs take more and more time to whatch television set and therein they inspire their behaviour from tha characthers that they see at the programs on tv. therefore they have bad samples. Thus is conceivable that they do not mind for the other peolple that might have some necessities. The young peolple are stronger than the older, they are also both more excitated and more eagers than the older and maybe for these reasons thay do not know the requirements of the olders.
The problem is that the youngs do not to know that helping the other people, especially that persons that carry on some importants diseases, it is not as difficult and heavy requesting as they believe.
the dynamic of the people s life is changing too fast and so all the youngs use their features to raise up their social degree rather than help other people.
They prefer having a swim or do some sports or also meet some friends.
Younger want to increasing own skills and to achieve, for example like a univesity degree, what they aim and all these reasons explain why youngs have not enough time to do communities actions.
