Some people tend to belive that advertisers and advertisments make products exact how they are. In support their idea they might say that there is no reason to show the product much better than it is or lie to the customer. However I am not in agreement with this stance. In my opinion most of the adverisers and advertisments make products seem much better that they really are. In the essay below I will explore some several examples from technology and personal experiences to support my point of view.

First of all it is difficult to deny that any of the advertismenents make the prducts seem much better than they really are. The example of `iphone` really sits there. The company Apple started to the advertisemnts of their new up comming product iphone 2 years before than it came. They were really good at advertising, I can not deny it. They encoureged people with the new amaizing cell phone to buy it. And than they said that it will be on sale in our stores at the August 2007. People made lines for that produckt and waited weeks long at the door step of the Apple stores. They sold 80 precent of product they produce. What happend next? After a month they discoverd a software mistake and collected all devices that they have sold. This example of the company Apple will deffinitely demonstrates my point of view and agrees that advertisments lie to the clients. In addition to the iphone there is also an other example fron an other different clothing company which will also supports my point of view.

Secondly, there was a company, which allways proud of their trousers. They say that a person can wear our product for a life time. I was really impressed from their TV advertisements and went that shop to puy a pair of trousers. It was quite expensive for a trousers but I thought it will worth that money. After the first time I wor it i put it into the wash machine to wash it alone. After I took it aoutto dry it it got 5 size smaler to me. Tis was not my mistake I washed it exactly with the directions bu it got smaller. This example is also shows that a person should not belive in what the advertiseiments are saying.

In conclusion, the examples above of Apple and cloathing company will deffinitely demonstrate my point of view about advertisors and advertisments. There might still counter arguments abut advertisments but I still belive that they make products seem uch better than they really are.
