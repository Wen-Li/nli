Advertisements became one of the most important tool in all over the world. People who are watching TV, walking in the street, reading newspapers and listening radio are exposed to advertisements. Some tell that they are harmful for society that rises consumption and they manipulate products by showing better in order to increase sales. I completely disagree with this opinion.

In today`s world, advertisement became vital for everbody both for sellers and consumers. Sellers pay advertisement cost for only one reason which is to increase sale of that product. Some revenue of federal governments, TV channels newspapers and radio stations are all financed by advertisements. On the other hand, consumers rise their knowledge about products. However, there is a free market economy, everbody has right to buy whatever they want. A consumer may buy a product in the advertisements or not. Moreover, the product must satisfy consumer needs and this is not related with the advertisements. If a  person bought a product he saw in the advertisements and didn`t satisfy it, he would complain about the low quality of that product whenever he saw the advertisement. Then the advertisements would create an opposite effect and demand for that product will decrease so do sales. Therefore, the company has to produce as quality goods as seen in the advertisements in order not to lose its profits.

In conclusion, it can be said that advertisements have lots of benefits for people such as financing TV channels, radio stations and newspapers. Moreover, they are important for the information about products for consumers. The critism that advertisements make products seem better than real is related with the economic reasons. As explained above, that policy would have very negative results for that company, so it will advertise its product as good as it is real.
