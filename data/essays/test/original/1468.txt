In my opinion,i agree it is more important for students to understand  ideas   and  concepts  than it  is  for them  to  learn  facts. Firs of  all  , i think  any students should they have many ideas  about how can he understand to learn.For exampel,  about me when i was studyb in high school i remember  always i want get high score in  all the subjects ,  also, when i get alow scoer in some  the subjects  ifeel  by the shy from my self.

second,shoud any  students he want the high score shoud study hard and  sugesst for any students , shoud he study hard before the test or quies .

third, any students needs understand very  well they should write any thing write his teacher , because they help him to remeber  when he take test or quies , also , should on each students reviw any  lesson  before he started any test or quies.


In adition, In my opinion, ithink shoud on any students  you need  pass from any subjects should continued with his teacher to keep the information in his mind, also, in my opinion, should on any students, he have parents should always take some advice from them, becuase, the parentes there have a lot of experienc in  the life,also, they  see  some thing you will be don't  see. in the  end i want say should on each the students  study hard study hard for  any test or any quies becaues,  if you bstudy hard you will take the high score in the most examination, also, i want say if you study hard for the test  they  you will help you in any thing in any country and i will say  ihope take very high scoer in this  test  and iwant say if i take high scoer in this test iwill put big big party in my apartment.
