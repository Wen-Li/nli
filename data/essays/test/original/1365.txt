Nowadays, in many school the students gained their knowledge just by many practice, personally i think this is not a good idea. when we are studying what we should know first is the method and the idea that lead to the result. when students are learning, they must first understand why will it be like this or that, it is not only because it can encourage the students to discover the real core of the knowledge, but can also make the study effiecient and enterprising, while modifying their knowledge with flexibility and usage in a wider range.
   First, the students can really get what they have been told and, no doubt be smarter. The way of learning english for non-english speakers, for example, is to learn from ABC and use it, if the learner never have an idea of what is a bible or what is the greek mythology, he or she will not know the way the english is used, don't even mention about the magnificence of this language.  
   Second, if he doesn't know the why or the how the studying objective acts, that will make the process of study boring for the learner. In contrast, if  the students understand it, he will have a will to control it and the will of knowing more. 
   The base of the knowledge will tell the students why or how it acts and make them have the ability of insighting things.  You will say, yeah, a resercher or a specialist will need it of couse,but let me tel you, well, normal people also need it in their daily life. Family members must understand ideas to keep their relationship goes on well.  
   If we just learn facts that will be very fast, yes but not prounced.
