This essay is about the question wether it is better to have a broad knowledge of many academic subjects or to specialize in one specific subject.
In my opinion it is really important to have a broad knowledge of generel knowledge but not really of many academic subjects.
That does not mean that is useless to have broad knowledge. It isn't! I think the main questions are: How can you benefit from these wide range of academic knowledge? And how deep can your knowledge be in every academic subject when you have a wide range of knowledge?
To answer the second questions I think everybody has a range of knowledge capacity. That means you can get an amount of knowledge which is in fact not endless. When you have a wide range of knowledge throughout  different academic subjects it hard to specify in one of it. You can only sratch on the top of the subject knowledge and so you can not become an expert in a specific subject. But that is what you has to be to get a job for example as an ingeneer, doctor or a lawyer. You have to spend really much time for learning to become a good or even very good student in those subjects. And it will get your full effort and capacity. So there is no really time left to get a broad knowledge of other academic subjects.
Regarding to the first question how you can benefit from a broad knowledge. May you can take part into a quizz show or you find a good job where these skills are required.
But I think a trend leads to more specific skills in doing a job. So it is important to be an expert in that academic field you want to work in the future. Nevertheless it seems to be not bad to have a good generel knowledge additionally to your specific.

To summerize I think it is important to be very good in one specific academic subject to fullfill the employers requirements as good as you can. And when there is time left try to get a wide range of general knowledge.
