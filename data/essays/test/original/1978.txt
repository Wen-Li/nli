I agree that successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well. In my country have good proverb for this statement. That is "People without challenge can not be success their life." I think this is good proverb for explaning my opinion. Challenge always comes with some risk. After challenge ,however, person who do  this can get success.
    Very famous guy who is owner of Apple campany is good example for this statement. I think he has enough money for spending his whole life and he is already in high position in the society and in the company, but he everytime try to make new thing and develop new sofeware. I think he does not need to make a risk by himself, he dose not need to challenge for some new things. Without making new product and new software, he can spend money as he usually use and live well as before. But he is challenging. He is making new product and sofrware. This is the key why he has so much money and has world best seller product which is I POD. The success key in his life is challenge, even the challenge has risk.
    We can find one same thing from the successful people. That is their challenge story. They are doing or did somethings in their life, although their are some risk. It means without risk people can not success in their life.
