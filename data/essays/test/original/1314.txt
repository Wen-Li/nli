I personally prefer going to a tour along with a tour guide. I personally feel so because I have been on a number of tours and I have faced a lot of problems without a guide . Being accompanied by a guide for your tours is very essential and according to me is really mandatory.

Firstly, I would like to say that If we go to a new place  where we don't know the native language or the places, this is where a tour guide comes into existance. He is one person who helps you with all the things you need. For example, there was a time two months ago when i went to China and i really got lost without a guide. The language was an alien one for me. The writings were really like those boxes that I used draw as a kid. I really got lost in that situation, and then I realised that how important a tour guid can be.

Secondly, A tour guide can help you with all the details of every historical monument or any other place that we got to, which we could not even know without a guide. For example, a few months back my relatives came to my home town to visit me and I had to take them on a local tour. I being a local could tell them all the important points and the different events related to a place or a monument which is very essential.
 
Thirdly, If we go with a tour guide then we can go to places that suits our budget. He can really help us in telling which place or a restaurant is expensive or cheap or too lavish.

Thirdly, I would like to say that a guide take into considerance the number of people in a group, and sees to it that all of us are together and that we do not get lost. He is the one who keeps all the people glued and maintains their sanity.

Finally, I would like to say that  with a guide we feel satisfied that we have seen the best of the places around and even feel good about the fact that we know more about the places now, that we could have not even known without the help of a guide.

Hence I would like to culminate by saying that being accompanied by a guide is the best way to go on a tour, Rather than getting lost and loosing your enjoyment to the alien land.
