I agree with the statement that says that successful people try new things and take risks. In this essay I will explain my opinion briefly.
      First, I believe that any successful man is creative. A person who takes the oppotunity coming his way and changes it to the form that is useful for him. For example, I have a friend who is very creative and good worker. She was emploeyed in a clinic building, and she was not happy about her job. She tried to open a restaurant without having any knowledge in that field. She worked for a while in a restaurant, and then she opened hers. She was very successful in her business. She improved her income to a big extent.
    Second reason that holds my opinion is that many people who do not try new things remain stuck to their condition. For example, my cousin has been working as a cook for more than 20 years, and he will never change because he does not like to experience  new things.
    Third, life is very short but it gives the desires for the people who work diligently. If anyone does not take chances in his life, his life will be boring and he will not be able to improve it. If a person works hard in his field without changing or trying new things, he will end up as a failure.
    In conclusion. If you  want to be successful in your life , you should take chances an try new things in your life. Otherwise you will end up with the same man who never change.
