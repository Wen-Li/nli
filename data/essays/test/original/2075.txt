Education is a very complex issue. Many professors, scientists think a lot about the subject of Education. How do the students learn? What is the better way to learn and what are the most important things to know?  The issue about the importance of ideas, concepts and facts is essential. Some think that ideas, concepts are more important than facts. Others think it is wrong. In my opinion, i agree with the given statement. Understand ideas, concepts, is more important than to learn facts. Facts are not sufficient to understand the world, or school matters. In my opinion, theory has to come before practice. If students want to understand all the points of a problem, they will need ideas and concepts.

First , facts are necessary in education, they can help to better understand, but at the beginning there is a real need of ideas and theories. In chinese culture, students always learn in this way. Theory then practice. I will illustrate my point of view with a more specific example. In chemistry class, students first, learn the theory, how it works, why products react like that. After, they will make some experiences to verify the ideas and concepts already learnt. Ideas and concepts are really the beginning.

Moreover, I think that there are a base. Without such a base of ideas, concepts, researches are impossible. For instance, sustainable development. There is a theory but no real big scales applications. Concepts and ideas allow to product facts and practice. 

However, in primary schools, facts are essential. Children learn better with facts. The teacher begins to show them a fact and children discover from this fact, concepts and ideas. Children will not forget what they have learnt if they discover by themselves ideas and concepts related to the facts. 

So, to conclude, ideas and concepts come first in University and high studies but are second for children.
