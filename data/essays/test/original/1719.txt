Yes, i agree with the statement.As its  not  easy  to tour an  unkown  place  without  a  proper  knowlege of that respective place.So, a guide is quite  essential in   a  tour. Depending  upon the place  we  tour we  may  face  trouble lurking around the local  people as we  may  face  difficlty in understanding their respective language and we are not aware of the people's own  behaviour .They  might lead us in   wrong way for instance and we may even get in to trouble if they snatch off  our belongings.
                                   So,its  necessary to have an authorised guide for a tour and  we could know much better information through the guide as he'll be  trained for the job and know's everything in detail about the place we tour.   we can make our  tour  much cheaper as  possible through the giude as he suggest's the better hotel or whatever necessary according to our  budget.As this world is of different cultures ,religions and different  kind of people we can't asure safety.We might even hurt the peoples sentiments which may be against  their respective  culture and its a waste of time  bargaining over some expenditure issues. So, through a guide  we can afford our needs according to our budget .We should also be aware of the guides complete identification ,so that we may not be duped by fake guides who are more lethal . So, we have to be aware of the guides identity and afford him. A guide is the only  source who could make are tour succesful . The guide narrates the history behind the respective place and gives us vital information regarding the place of tour.Without out a guide we may  miss some important information  regarding our travel and landup  somewhere in  an unknown place.

                                                 Hence the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide inorder to have a safer and satisfactory tour.
