We would all agree that advertisements play an important role in our daily life since they seem to be omnipresent on TVs ,newspapers and magazines. However, when it comes to the question that whether most advertisements make products seem better that they really are, people's answers vary depending on dissimilar backgrounds,various experiences and different emotional concerns.This question, nevertheless is not easy to answer.Although quite a few people think that products are that same as what on the advertisements,I am, and probably will always be one of those who argue that ads make the products seem much better that they really are. In this essay, my reasons for my answer are introduced as follows.

To begin with, the most persuasive point is  that the purpose of ads is to make the products sell better. So in order to achieve this goal, the companies usually choose  make the products seem better. For example, satorial  companies usually invite charming film stars to wear their clothes. And will the clothes seem much beautiful on the actors and the actresses?Obviously, the answer is Yes.And people may tend to consider the it will be pretty in that clothe and decide to buy it. However, actually,will the clothes seem that better just as it is weared by the stars?The answer is No.This is just one of the small tricks  that the companies use to make the products look better.

Furthermore, it is an undeniable fact that that the companies often tries to highlight the merit of the product. The ads will often show the teeth are whiter than white to illustrate the function of certain kind of toothpaste that makes the teeth to get white.However, the white appear on the ads is speacially made and actually ,normal people will never achieve that white by only using that kind of toothpaste.

Last but not the least, there is another reason that deserves some words here. Ads often do not mention the demerits of the products.
We rarely hear  a drug ad say the side effect of that drug.

However,people stand on a different standpoint may argue that there are regulations to ensure that the product is the same as they appear on ads.While I agree that regulations do have some effect to some extent , they can not totally prevent the difference between the real product and it on ads.

Taking all the factors into account, we can see that the companies make that product appear better on ads by using them in different people, underscoring their merits and not mentioning their demerits.
Consequentely, I agree with the statement that most ads make products seem much better than they really are.
