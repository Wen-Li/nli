I do agree with the statement that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide.
  Although we can get a lot of information,for instance,search on the internet,before we travel,there are many details we can not handle completely.Since the infomation we get is so limited,we need someone to help us during the travel.
  Therefore,travel in a group led by a tour guide is the best solution.A guide is familiar with all the tiny aspects during the travel,and the guide can give us several suggestions to help us deal with something during the travel,so we can save lots of time and energy.The guide`s explanation can also help us fully understand the meaning of some specific things,so we can get joy from the progress of the traveling.Furthermore,travel in a group can add our pleasure and keep us more safer than travel alone,especially in the area with little population or dangerous animals.
  Last summer,our family went to the Tube in a group led by a tour guide.With the guide`s help,we made much clear about the famous places and had a good time there.For the patience of the guide ,we learned some stories that little people had knew and became good friends.
