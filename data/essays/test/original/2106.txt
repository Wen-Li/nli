From my point of view, in twenty years the number of the cars on the on the planet will lower.
Firstly, because the mankind will understand that it is impossible to continue to live without respecting the envirolment. Then, it is a common knowledge that the too big number of cars with the the big quantity of  smogs that they produce are killing the envirolment and ourselves. Therefore, in my opinion the governaments in some year will start a valid politicy to lower the number of cars.
Secondly, it will be possible to have least car with the creation of new regulator plans, especially for the big cities. This because, in this way, it will be possible, very easy and also quite chip to build a complitely net of pubblic ecologic public transports as like as the elettic buses, the trains and maybe hydrogen buses.
Finally, I think that in about two decades it will be possible to almost all kinds of works by computers in our homes. Therefore, this means that will not need to go out every days to go to work and so use the cars, but, on the contrary we will be perfectly able to work at home.
In spite of big industries, for example BMW, General Motors, etc., are working for create and to sell ecologic hydrogen cars, I think that however, for space reason, it will be better to lower the numbher of cars however.
