Everyday we are reminded of the fact that we head towards a cleaner future, a better future. A future wherein there will be less pollution. This would be attributed to the assumption of less cars in the future. However, in my opinion, not only will it take us a long time to reach our goal for a "cleaner future", but there will be a marked increase in cars over time. There are various reasons for my support of this stance.

Population growth, as always continues to be a problem. On the one hand it means an increase in poverty. On the other hand it also means an increase in more middle income people, increased employment, etc. These types of people consider a car a necessity without which they cannot survive. This will create a persistent, consistent increase in the number of cars we see on the road. 

However, it is not only the middle class that will create an increase in this. Every type of income earner would cause an increase in cars, some, by just being born. As families become progressively bigger it is imperative to have more than one car. For example, in a family where both the husband and the wife are working there will be atleast two cars. 

Most governments over the world are facing a population "explosion" of sorts in their countries. Due to this, public transport systems have to be established and grown progressively, While it is true that this does solve the problem of less cars on the road, it is also true that some, like high income earners will not avail of these types of transporting systems. Annual increases in some public transport systems like public buses also contributes in a small way to increased vehicles on the road. 

This also leads me to my next point - cars are, in todays world considered, like many other products, to be a symbol for status. For example, a wealthy family would not be content with having just one car, or even two. It is not uncommon to see five or six cars in come people's garage, espescially the rich ones. 

Another possible increase in the amount of cars on the road is the possibility of having "enviromentally safe" cars in the future. If these cars, like the Honda Privia, is made public, then many people would buy these cars and, as such cause an increase in the numbers of automobiles we see on the road. 

In conclusion, it is my opinion that there will not be fewer cars in the future.
