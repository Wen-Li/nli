I agree with this statement that the poeple try new things and risks rather that doing things they know because if the person made his goal to the end, he or she will always try to find a new goal to achieve. Is the World was made just for a person to have one goal in his or her life there would be no interest in living afret achieving it.
    The person have always try to find his/ her limitation. People find something new in their lives, try fighting their destiny and take risks through their entire lives. Is the people do the thing their anly know about their lives will be boring and meaningless. The World will be not as interesting as it is and there may be no progress in the future.
    From the begining of your life when you are born you beging taking risk of exploring the World and learning how to survive. You learn how to walk even knowing that its going to be painfull in the begining from falling but you still continuie to walk. You find people and become friend even knowing that they may betraied you and bring mental pain. There have been always a lot of things and risks the people pass through and still we keep on doing till the end, till they achieved what they wanted.
    Being successful or not doesn't realy matter. People always where trying to find their limitations and finding their own way of doing things. The exploration of the World is an important mean of why we still take risks and do things that we do not know well. The seeking for knowledge is what keeps us interested in everything and learning new things we wish to know or think it will be usefull.
    The successful people may go very far on try new things and by taking new risks to find what their want and seek for. The willing to try this is deep inside people. People will rather find new things than do the same thing over and over, make their lives boring and uninteresting. The taking of the risks is only one of the conditions the people take to try new things.
