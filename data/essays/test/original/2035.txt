     The topic of the statement that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guilde can be approach from several different angels, it is really a complex one.  Some people would tend to agree with that it will well when there are a group led  by a tour guilde, while other people did not agree with that issue.  I have develop my point of view as well. As far as I am concerned, I agree for this statement for two important reasons. At first reason, when we came to a new place  I need some one to intorduce the new knowledge and culture foe me. Additional erasons, it will let me more effiency to got deeply in my trip.
  
     First of all, I need the tour guilde to intorduce any kind of the culture which I never been before.  For instance, when I was a student in the senior high school, I join in trip to the china.  Although I am a chinese whom live in taiwan, I never visit to CHINA. Therefore I do not have any ideas about there.  However I met a good tour guilde there, she had a lot of experiences on this job so she intorduced very details about the social culthure and traditional crafics to us.

     In addition, there will let me more efficiency to had a lot fun in my trip. I think that it is vey convince in the daily assigments, because the tour guilde will take every thing in my trip. Moreover, the guilde sometimes had to designed very interesting games in our traffic time. Therefore, I am not only to worry about any little thing in my trip, but also I could had fun from it.

     In my conclusion, maybe there are some people do not think that statement does not good for them. However, I think it is very wonderful for me.
