Most of the prodcuts we can see on advertisements seem better than what they really are. Everywhere we are flooded with advertisements, but why a company should pic products in a different way they are ?
    
    Advertisements are the mediums used by companies to purpose their products and mainly to increase their profits and, all around the world, companies follow money. If a company can increase the number of customers also the money they will get will be increased. For example when I was working in a computer shop I could see how my boss was describing, in a leaflet, a new kind of computer he was selling in a way it was not. That computer did not have the power that was written in the advertisement but people was accracted by the nice pictures of the computer, by the capturing style of the fonts and my boss could increase his profits.

    And as we are speaking about a market, with all its rules, it is obvious that an advertisement must capture the attention of the customers in order to be better than another company. For example when I go to eat an hamburger the sandwich I usually get is not that big and colourful I see in the advertisements but obviously it has to be like that so that people will eat at that place instead of going to another one.

    But sometimes the advertisement is studied so that we create the idea that the product is very good. For example imagine a cleaning liquid for the bathroom, in the advertisement they can only show it as it is but what if they put a picture of a shining bathroom in the background ? People will like the idea of the shining bathroom and will think the product is very good also if it will probably not be like that.

    In conclusion I think that advertisements always make seem products better because in the moment we wanna purpose something, and get money for that, we always have to do it in the best way, sometimes even cheating.
