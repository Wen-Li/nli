"Eat Dr. Andres slimming pills and loose 10 Kgs of weight in a matter of 10 days".Does that claim seem familiar ?.I am sure most of us are used to readin such trite advertisements in the dailys,magazines,hoarding-almost everywhere.But how many of the claims made in these advertisements really true?A miserably small percntage in my opinion.I firmly support the topic of this discussion.

I feel, that to attract a vast customer base, compaies issue advertisements which not only dismiss the side effects or disadvantages of their products but also exagerate the advntages.Due to the competitive nature of the market, most companies tend to spend a lot on advertisements which glorify their product.For eg. slimming products or techniques, as i mentioned before, are advertised almost everyehere, but nowhere will customers find out about their side-effects untill they themsleves encounter these!A similar examle is of the never ending advertisements of the supposed "Fairness" creams availible in the indian market.

 When such products are actually used by the cutomers ,they dont genreally fullfill their claims and instead expose their disadvantages or side effects,ence causing a feeling of everincresing dissatisfaction amongs the customers.The customer feels cheated and exploited whereas the company salescontinuously increase due to more cutomers being fooled by the "glorified advertisements".A feeling of prpetual distrust harms other genuine products and their advertisements too.

I strongly feel that the government should do something about this issue.I feel that each product before entering the market should be tested by a government organization to ascertain its advantages and list its disadvantages and side effects.The company should be permitted to list only the confirmed advantages in its advertisemnts and also include the side effects it may cause.This way the customers will be able to bank on the advertisements of the products.This, i feel, is the only plausible solution to this problem.
