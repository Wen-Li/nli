Life is full with risks and we often face different kinds of risks during our life time. I agree with the statement. I think successful people always take risk to do new things. There are a lot of reason to be successful by taking risk.
Firstly, I think the person who is afraid of to change his life doesn't try to new things. So, he can not meet to right opportunity to change his life. Perhaps, he has a perfect talent for music, but when he doesn't try, nobody can know this. As a result, he lost the oppotunity which can change his life. I always believe that if I hadn't take risk, I couldn't improve my mined. When I graduated high school, I was a nurse and I had a good salary for a person Who was 17 years old. I didn't need to take risk to change my life, but I thought that I could be better. So I resigned from hospital, then I got into university. After I graduate to university, I took some exams in my country and past them. My goverment chose me as a student who would go to the USA for master degree. Now I am here, 10 years later than the graduation from high school. Sometimes taking risk cahanges our all lives and makes us successful.
On the other hand, taking risk makes us brave and we can make new decisous without being afraid. So it provides to think logicly, because when we are afrait to be fail, we can not think well. I think taking risk improve our ability for make good decisious. For example, the success people who tried tnew thinks usually become more successful in the future, because they can think clearly without be afraid.
In summary, In my experiance, although there are some exceptions, taking some risk can make people success. Because they play for big praze, if they win, their benefits are bigger than other people who choose to be same. In addition, If we don't try, we can not know what is waiting for us on the unknown part of life.
