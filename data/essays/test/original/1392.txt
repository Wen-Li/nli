    Cars as all we know is one of the basic traspotation nowadays.In twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today . I disagree with the statement ther are many reason some of them i have discussed here.

   First of all ,nowaday  people are  buying more number of cars to their uasge  because of their necesities for example lets take my own  family example ,we own only one cars ten years ago but now we own three cars because of  the necessity have increased. Like this only ,people are buying more and more number of cars as the days go and necessities increases .So by the next twenty years their will be more number of cars than today.

     Secondly,nowadays cars are getting chaeper in price and will get it in instalments also so more number of people can afford car now so by this the number of cars running on the roads have increased .
 .The car productivity have increased in number,the tecnology have have become more and more advanced buy this the performance of the car has increased . so the people will buy more number of cars as to their comfort.
   
   Finally ,the cars have become the most easiest  and comfortable way for transportation .So people are haeding towars buyin cars aas i told in the above which is easier to afford by middle class family also.
  So. i conclude that, i disagree with statement  due to this reason .
