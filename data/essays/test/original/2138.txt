 When it comes to knowledge, some people presume that it is better to have specific knowledge in own subject to accumlate details.  In contrast, I think that to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects is more heplful in our life. Broad knowledge give us not only  having wide overview to look at the world, but also helping study many kinds of academic easliy.
 
 We need to have broad knowledge for two reasons. 

First of all, a lot of background knowledge may lead us to look at a world with wider and various view. To know huge knowldge of many academic helps to have abundant commonsense in a world news. For instance, when we watch a news at night, it is really hard to totally understand about  accidents or problems that who has only knowledge of own major subject because of swallow commonsense. 
 Second, to know broad knowledge is so advantages of studying many academic. Because almost academics are related and connected, so if we understand about many kinds of academic subject, it will be aid for understanding easily. For instance, I am major in broadcasting and journalism. During vacation, I study various field of academis because of applying for broadcating company. And it really helps for me to study and participate on selcetive academic which is not required. Journalism is related about every academic such as politics, management, business so on. 

 To have broad knowledge has many benefit for living in a world. Old people always say that 'Knowing is a medicine'. It totally correct. To know broad and wide knowledge of many academic subjects is good medicine for all of us. Becuase it gives to us varity background to see a wide world and think more deeply to our own mind.
