When I  think about my own experiences considering cars, I can tell that I already used fewer cars within the last three years. Three years ago I used to own a car and I was living in a small town in a rural area and it was necessary for me to own a car to go to school, to go to work and to meet friends.
For three years I have been living in Berlin and in the last three years I never felt that I would need a car in such a big city.
Reconsidering my own experiences and arguments that I will offer below, I would agree with the statement that in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today.

As a first argument I would like to mention that it is evident that the oil recources are going to its end within the next 30 to 40 years. Since wether the oil nor the automobile industry shows a real interest in changing their behaviour and their marketing plans, I assume that we will use all the oil until its gone and that in probably 30 to 40 years there might be finally a car that can be fueled with a new kind of "gasoline".

My second argument that speaks against more cars is that I expect that within the next twenty years there will defenitely a next big scientifc development that will make cars useless. I truly believe in science and the car seems to me a rather old and antique way of transportation and men will find better ways for transportation than we have today. Maybe nothing we can imagine right now but there will be something and it will not be a regular car.

My last argument is the scientific proof that more and more people are moving into big cities. Recent statistics show that the rural population declines whereas the urban population is constantly growing. Just like I did it, a lot of other people will move into the big cities to study, to work and to live there. Big cities are attractive in many ways and thanks to a sensible public transportation system one can easily live without a car in a big city.

As a conclusion and to combine all my arguments I would say that cars are antique, the times are changing and humankind has no need fo cars who take a away space in growing cities that get bigger and bigger. Therefore I agree with the statement and would say that in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today.
