That' s a very interesting statement. I think that's a problem we have to solve in our nowdays life. But I don't agree with the statement when it says that young people don't give enough time to helping their communities: I think they don't give their time at all!!
Today young people are not involved in the problems of their community because they don't have time to realize what's wrong near them.
They are too much occupied by following the last music trend or to mimic one of the "television hero". They are just worried about how to be trendy; how to be fashonable and they don' t care about anything around them.
I think this phenomenon is very common in the big cities: in this kind of reality  is more easy to be fashonated by advertising and all the material stuffs that everyday keep bombing in our head.
When people grow in this atmosphere is very difficult to make change their point of view during their life.
I think the situation is different in a little city where you live more closely to the society. In this kind of reality I think there are less way to escape from the everyday problems. So people are much involved to help their communities and to get interested in what they are surrounded by. 
The "tragedy" is that the big cities have more problems than the small one so they need more people to get involved! They need more people to be motivated to solve some conditions.
I think this is one of the problem of our era: to be too much far from the society we live in and not to realize that if everyone of us give just an hour of our time to help our community this society could be better and our life too.
