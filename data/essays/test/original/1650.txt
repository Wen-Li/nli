I do not agree with the statement that it is better to have a broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one subject. Even though what is better for an individual differs according to his personality, life styles and professional career choices they make after the university, I believe that having a broad knowledge of many subjects without a concentration area leaves individuals unskilled.

In today's world, it is important to know what you are doing at a specialized level, in addition to being open to learn about other subjects. I believe that it is essential for an individual to have a broad outlook on the world in general and to be familiar with a range of academic subjects. However, being open to broad range of subjects should not impede the indivual from concentrating and specializing in the one subject that motivates and interests her the most.  Coming from a background of multi-disciplinary studies of International Affairs and International Development, I realized at the end of my studies is that I actually lack a specialization area. In the business world, even though I knew about a wide range of issues and could easily adapt my skill set to the requirements of the position, I always felt the burden of non-specialization. This is because in every area, there are people who are heavily specilized academically and professionally which makes it extremely difficult to compete if one is not coming from a similar background. That is why actually I feel that I need to focus and do further studies. Jack of all traits and master of none may be relevant if you are a good talker, but when you have produce a concrete outcome, whether it is in science, business, or IT, specialization in a specific subject allows one to go deeper in the subject matter. Moreover, specialization leads to innovation in the field.

Having said that, I also do oppose individuals who only specialize in one subject and have no interest in any other areas. One should always have the skills to evaluate issues from different perspectives. However, having broad general knowledge should not deter an individual from specialization. Therefore, rather than an either/or, I think the optimum solution is to have broad knowledge on a range of issues and specialize on the subject that matters the most for that person.
