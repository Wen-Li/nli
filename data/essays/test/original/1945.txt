well ithink  its more important to learn facts  because facts is very important in our life to under stand life betrer and also to learn more .
and by learning facts every day you can prevent bad things that  can hapen espesily when you are astudent ,because every day you learn something and you cant understand idias all the time some times idias can be wrong and get in avery big truble that you dont need.
facts are help ful to be responsebol and also careful all the time in schools most of wate we studey is some ideas of wate happend and some other stuff but ithink and iwish that schools  foces more abut teaching the facts it can be verey helpfull in the futer for our students
so in conclosin iwold like to say that by teaching our kids to understand ideas and concepts is not every thing they need to learn more abut facts.
finly concepts and ideas are not all that maters wate maters the most is to understand facts all the time.
