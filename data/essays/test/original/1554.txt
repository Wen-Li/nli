I absolutely agree to the statement because the need to make one's product more attractive to increase sales had made advertisers to rely on new techniques that make the product look better that it really is. This push has came from a highly competitive world where it's required that a company increase sales and efficiency to have a good performance on the stock market. 

Some techniques advertisements agencies use to achieve their objectives are, the use of motor oil to make food look tastier that it really is; or show products on good looking models where any product look good or show just the best parts of a specific location, for example a hotel, while hiding others when trying to sell a touristic package. 

Some other techniques are related to the kind of words used to describe a specific product or service, sometimes you can make a mental picture of what you are reading but you do not realize that the seller is intentionally omitting some information to make its product attractive. For example, when booking a hotel, you will see the pictures from the nicest room and the best locations on the hotel but they missed information about facilities and surroundings most of the time. I have seen cases where hotels have advertise things like "view of the pyramids" and although it is barely true, they forget to mention that you are 1 hour away from this place (by car) and you are not able to see them every day. 

But to overcome this problem, modern communication tools like internet, web forums, blogs and emails play a very important role since they reach a large community where you can share your  experiences with a specific product or service. It's very common today that online travel agencies includes the option to write reviews about a specific hotel or airline; but it;s not limited to tourism industry because you can also find, from popular place like amazon.com, reviews about electronic and household products written by previous users.

As a final statement, we must make use of the available tools we have in a global community to research on a specific product before making purchasing decisions that could be greatly influenced by the kind of advertisement used.
