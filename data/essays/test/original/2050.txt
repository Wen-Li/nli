I tend to agree to the statement although I have doubts. Of course, when you think of great inventors or explorers, they tried something new and took their risks. But when you think again, what had Gutenberg to loose when he invented the book print? He was successful without taking a huge risk. On the other side, Christoph Columbus took a great risk by landing on a new world - without knowing that it is new. How would a map of today's world look like if Columbus and his fellow explorers didn't take the risk of get to know the unknown?
What contradicts the statement are successful people and companys that don't take risks - and being successful just because of that. McDonalds, for example, makes the same burgers every day since about fourty years. This company doen't experiment with the taste of their products and so people know what they'll taste when they buy a burger. That's what makes McDonalds successful. People rather walk on paths they already know.
Sometimes people are just not ready to adopt and so a great achievement can fail. For example the computer keyboards, as we know them, are not very efficient. There are ways to sort the letters which would let people type faster. But no one would take the risk to change that, because his or her new keyboard wouldn't have a chance, although it may be better than the ones we know. 
What I want to say is that the reality is more difficult than the statement pretends to be. Not every taken risk leads to success and sometimes doing it the common or known way has more success than taking a risk.
In the end, I believe the most successful people are those, who take risks, but know how much of a risk they can handle and know how much of a change people can deal with.
