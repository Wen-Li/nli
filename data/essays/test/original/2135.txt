I completely agree with the statement " Successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well".
For example, let us take into consideration two people A and B and let us also consider that both these people are in the business of automobiles that is they manufacture cars. The first kind of people that is A manufacture cars but those kind of cars which always run neverthless of the market like the sedan segment. These cars always run as they are perfect for a typical family and so their business always have good returns and these cars are priced normally with the standard fittings and standard gadgets accompanying and also made according to the regulations keeping in mind the safety regulations.
And now let us consider the second king of people that is the kind B. These people are also in the same business manufacturing the standard cars. However, they want to experiment something more taking huge risks into consideration. Like they will introduce a new type of car into the market making it more spacious than the regular sedans and lot more comfortable and luxurious. There is a huge risk in this like what if this car does not run in the market ? Then their whole business will go down as they have invested heavily in making the car with putting up more gadgets, more luxurious items like the refrigerator or a television and putting up more safety gadgets in addition to the standard ones. They have taken a huge risk in launching this car as it is different from the rest and also costly. They are experimenting trying oput something new. And let us consider that the car is a hit. Now their reputation in the market has dominated others and their company rises. Like the bmw, rolls royce, ferrari or mercedes. These cars are the dream cars for many people. What if these companies have jus made regular cars ? They would have run normally. However with a lesser brand name than they have now.
So, in order to be successful one has to take risks and try out new things instead of just goin on with whatever life gives. And one has to have the gutts to try out something like that which has a huge risk invovement. As successful people do things differently with added spice.
