Today it can not be ignored that, advertisements are everywhere, on every walls, every TV show  break and every T-shirts of your favourite basketball team. The opinions are divided about this question : are the advertisements realistic ? According to me, they make products seem better than they really are.
    
    First of all, the advertisements only highlight the good sides of the products. Even the pictures are taken under such light or such angle that it hides all the default. I have a strikking example for that. I have ordered a computer screen on internet last month. So I never had really seen it, but just on two pictures of it. When I have opened the box, I was very surprised : it was smaller and less beautifull than on the pictures ! I send it back to the seller.

    But worth of all, there are the advertising who are not telling the truth. Some of them simply lie about the product, that is a shame. But however paradoxical it may seem, rarely the advertisers are punished. For instance, in france, only a few associations of consumors are fighting against these abuses.

    Briefly, it is our responsbility to focus on the product before buying it and to fight against liers. But it is also to the politician to rule more precisly and make the law tobe respected by all.
