I agree with the statment and there are following reasons for it.  
  First, you can start learning something easier with intersting ideas and concepts surrounding a fact or incident than facts themselve.  It is true that you cannot study anything without learning some basic facts.  For example, in history class, when you discuss a historical incident and how and why it happend, you need some facts like the names of key persons or the year.  In this stage, however, it seems studests cannot take interest in the subject and it can follow that students stop studying the subject.  On the contrary, understanding ideas and concepts of historical dinamism will make them take interst in it and foster forward studing.
  Therefore, in motivation of learning something, to understand idas and concept first can be effective oppourtunity for students. 
  Moreover, to learne ideas and concepts can lead to the possibility of development.
  In conclusion, it is more important to understand ideas.
