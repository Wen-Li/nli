The statement says that in twenty years there will be fewer cars circulating on Earth`s routes. Even if this would have positive consequences on the pollution condictions, I really don`t think it will be possible and I don`t agree with this statement. In fact, everybody knows that during the last period the use of the car has spread in the world, in particular in the rich countries of the planet. Some years ago only rich people had the financial possibility to brought a car, but then the cost of a car progressively felt down. Above all, Ford, the famous productor of German cars, had a strong importance in this process. He reorganized his factory in order to produce a lot of cars quickly and with lower costs. Thanks to him, the cars prices collapsed. The most famous model is the ^T model^. It was a small, black car and almost everyone had the financial possibility to buy it. 
Now the cars market is almost saturated. That means that everybody has at least a car and the sells are basically due to the need to change it after some years of use. So maybe nowadays the number of cars bought each year is not as hight as some years ago, when for the first time people began to use car to travel or move in cities. However, I don`t think that the cars market is in crysis. On the contrary, the use of cars could spread in poor countries.
This obviously has tragic consequences on air pollution. In addiction to this, the oil sources of the Earth are almost over. Because of this problems maybe in twenty years there will be different kind of cars that don`t use oil but different sources of energy.. the so called ^clean enery^. For example it`s possible to use the sun energy to make a car move. There is also the possibiliy to buy an electric car that has less influence on pollution.
