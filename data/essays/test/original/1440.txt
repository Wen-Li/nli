I genarally agree with the statement that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are. Specifically, when I evaluate the new products rather than well-known ones.

    The idea of advertisement derives from the need to promote the product. Therefore, the basic goal when advertising the product is to announce to the broader number of people the brand, quality, price and adventageous results of the use. When a product is new in the market it needs a thorough promotion, otherwise people will not have an idea on what actually it is.

    In this context, people in the marketing sections of the firms, try to increase the number of customers of the product and might consider each way as applicable. Advertising only the good parts of the product or trying to display them much better than they are in real, may be the instruments to challange the other products in the market.

    To give an example, I had bought a "magic-knife" following to a TV advertisement. In fact, it broke up after a few months when cutting a solid bone of a chicken. The producer refused to refund it as cutting a chicken bone was not appropriate for the knife. On the other hand, while watching the advertisements, one can easily believe that the knife would cut everything, even a stone.

    As the economy is based on making high profits, companies may apply these strategies in order to sell their products to a wider range of people. It is understandable that they have to make better advertisements than their rivals, however, consumers must be cautious when buying a new product that they do not know. 

    Having acknowledged the statement as "generally", I also believe that well-known brands cannot apply falsifying or misleading advertisements, as the image of the brand will be affected seriously. In the modern times, the associations of consumers and state institutions are endeavouring against misleading information or advertisements about the products. In addition, gaining information about products is easier on internet. Therefore, consumers should be encouraged to use internet for their complaints and learn more about the experiences of the others.  

    In conclusion, I believe that misleading consumers about a product is more difficult than it used to be in the past but due to the increasing  number of new products in the market and measures taken by the authorities cannot be adequate so it is not easy to state that firms do not apply this method.
