I agree with the statement that successful people try new things rather than doing what they already know how to do. 

The first reason to agree the idea is to stay in the same rotine,  situation and ways does not create somethings new.  It it ture when we do something new, we have to take risks of failur, usually we will be failing first. and form the failour we learn and make things better. 
It has been said that we can not success without knowing fail. 
In a nut shell success is based on the fail and risk. 

We can find good example of this from transpotaion.
If people had been satisfied with the speed of the bycicle, we would not have seen the motorbikes, trains. cars or even ariplaine. Indeed, in the course of creating ariplaine, lots of people took the risk of death. But we tend to think taht  porson who made the airplain is successful.  

The second reason is that  doing what they already know satisfying with the situation,  does not make us the creative. 
To become successful people, creativity is the essential element. 
We can say that the situation that someone is satisfying with now has been created by someone.

We tend to pay the money to the things,  we think,  which is more effiecent or vaulable than the others.  
Example  
You have Car A.  You found Car B. Car A is faster than Car B. Car B is also cheaper. we will be buying car B. People who is satisfied with Car A can not create Car B because of the satisfaction.
