I do agree this statement. Taking risks  makes us successful. If we don't try  new things or we scare a lot from  changing, we won''t be able to get what we want. For instance, in business life, if somebody wants to be an entrepreneur, but scares to lose his/her money, he won't even be able to start a business and will keep working for somebody else. And probably he won't be productive and motivated to be successful.

Especially, technology effects our life. My mother is a kind of person who doesn't like to try new things. Since we are pretty far to each other, she had to learn how to use computer to communicate me.  Now she is able to use the computer for her work and this makes her work life easier and faster.So she has time for her social life and she doesn't have to worry  while she is working. So, trying to learn computer makes her more successful. 

Risks also give people enough ambition to succee.I like to try new things and take risks. And in the life, we have to be a little adventurist. If we dont' try, nobody will give our wishes in our hands. We don't have magic creatures to have three wishes in life. We have to be our own magic creature. 

According to the researces, one of the properties of a successful manager is taking risks. If he waits to be secure for a decision, he will be later than  the competitors and the company will lose its market. 

So taking risks and trying new things are important for both our self improvement and business life.Also, in my opinion, it is quite boring when i do the the same things over and over. To do new things keeps me alive and makes me positive. And if we are positive, we can get success. Trying new things gives us the patience,so we can keep studying to be more successful.
