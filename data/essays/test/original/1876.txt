The best way to travel is to travel in packs led by a tour guide because one would enjoy more and understand the surroundings. 
    One main reason for traveling in groups is that one would have more fun cohesively that individually. If it is an individual trip, then who would he/she have to enjoy the scenery? Who would he/she have to share the thrill of the adventures of traveling. For example, when one goes to skiing in Canada, how would he/she enjoy the trip without people to go along and race with or just do it for fun. On the other hand, what if there was a problem? There would no one to help but teh group one is traveling with. 
    Another reason of having a tour guide is that it helps to understand the scenery of the surroundings. What is the point of blankly staring at a sculpture if one doesn't know when it was created, who created it, or what it means? For example, when I went to the Sixth Floor Museum in Dallas where it tells the history of President JF Kennedy I didn't buy the tape recorder that explains the significance of all the pictures or anything else that was there. So I was just walking around trying to read the subscripts and going out of order. A tour guide helps provide information about what they are looking at. The guide also helps one not wander off or get lost. For example, when one is exploring a cave there are many passages to take not all of them are the right ones. The guide takes you through the right passages while you are admiring it beauties. 
    All in all, going in a group with a tour guide helps one not to get lost, understand the surroundings, and enjoy traveling.
