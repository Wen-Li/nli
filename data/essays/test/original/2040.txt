Today in the media world everything is showing that is perfect. every product has several good ways and better options than the other products which are in the same market area. It seems me like a paradise. Every product is incrediably good and better than the other that person I do not like. Adverstisements are creating the world for the person that wants to live in that. But real world is not as good as on advertisements. I do not believe that the advertisments are saying the true to us.
     Firstly, in today's world everyone has a mobile phone(cell phone). But the new models are coming everyday and buyers are on a compatition, to buy the newst (because the best) from the other people. New one can easilly be the bad one from that you have. For example a phone company trade a new product which name is "Shine". When I saw that product it was like a mirror it is really shining. I went to the market to buy it but I could not expected to see an ugly product. It does not have anything in it besides a out view of mirror not even a camera. The advertisement changed the truth and expected me to buy it, but adversitment can not actually gave me what I expected from the TV.
      Second reason that I do not belive that advertiments are not showing the reality is the people on the TV advertiments or in the Billboard are always the World Top Models. It does not show the reality. For example a jean looks great on a Top Model on BillBoards but when I tried on it, I can not really imagine which part of my legs and humps are invisible to seen like a Top Model's. IF they can be more relible people can buy it easily but in this way the given message for my opinion is 'if you do not have a body like this, do not even come to our boutique. 
      Finally, advertisments are not showing the reality. They want to be seen visibly good and trend but they are categorizing the people. People who wnant to buy the product because it looks great and wear by Top Models and the people who wnat to buy the product because it is useful. Advertisements should indicate more reality if they want to sell much more.
