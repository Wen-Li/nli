 Car is the most usual mean of transport. In developped country, there is hardly a vehicule per inhabitants, and things are going in the same way in the rest of the world. Will there be more cars in twenty years than there are now ? 


    They are strong evidence proving that they might fewer cars in use in twenty years, than they are today. Indeed, as ressources of oil are decreasing, fossil energy will be more expansive in the future, thus provoking a decrease in the consumption of oil. It would be harder to afford a car for anyone, and people would rather choose to use other means of transport. 
As city are becoming more and more crowded and congested, governement might one day ban cars of downtown cities. Because of the global warming, people, who are going to feel more and more concerned about environment problems, might decide to choose more environment-friendly means of tansport. 
    On the other hand, we can believe that the number of cars will keep growing in the following years. Indeed, thanks to new breaktroughs in the field of energy, some cars may replace those of today considering as poluting too much. For instance, Toyota has developped a hybrid vehicle that is said to be really energy saving. 
The global population is growing in a drastic way, and more people of countries such as China or India can now pretend to afford a car. 


    I think that in the future, other means of transport such as the bus or train will be ;uch ;ore developped, thus enabling people to avoid using their cars.
