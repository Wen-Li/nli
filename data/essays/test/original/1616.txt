There are advantages in both understanding ideas and concepts and learning facts. If you learn facts, your knowledge about a certain fact will increase. It is very important element in the life; however you need to know why facts are created. In short, it is a process to reach a fact and I think it is more important than just knowing facts. Therefore I agree the statement.
     Of course, learning facts is a very significant factor in your life. If you know more facts, you can learn more about the world; however the process is more important because if you do not know the process or concepts, you can not say that you fully understand facts. If you understand well about the facts, you can explain and apply them to the real life. Students are younger and they are going to participate in the society in the future, so learning is the time for them to prepare for the future. They need to learn skills to apply their knowledges in the society and then they should know the ideas and concepts behind the facts.
     Personally, It was very difficult for me to understand the facts without explaining ideas and concepts. If I do not know concepts of the facts, I can not explain exactly what it is including its background.Also the worst thing is that you can not connect a thing  from other things. For example, you have learned the history of American independence. If a teacher explain the flow of the history, you can explain as he did; however if you only know the word "American independent", you can not explain exact history. It is not efficient for your life, and you can not broaden your knowledge more. Therefore you need to find the connection between the ideas and concepts and the facts. In this sense, I think students should understand ideas and condcepts rather than facts.  
     Therefore I think understanding ideas and concepts is more important than learning facts. If you understand well about ideas and concepts, you can broaden your knowledge more by yourself and  apply them to the real life. It is one of the most important thing to be able to combine ideas and concepts with the real problems in the society, so it is not enough to know only about facts but you need to know the ideas and concepts.
