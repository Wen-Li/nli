I agree that young people do not give enough time to helping their communities. Although I think that it has not always been this way.

Due to the technological inventions and to cultural changes, the important aspects of life in the eyes of young people have changed. Whereas helping in a community and being active as a volonteer has been quite common some years ago, young people nowadays prefere spending money, and having as much free time as they can have. 

In order to afford all goods which they assume to be necessary, they start working very early. They are convinced that being wealthy and showing it fulfills them with joy and happiness. In the meantime they neglect that this emotional profit can also be achieved differntly. 

To young people "profit" often equals money. To my mind, profit has its meaning in a whole other aspect. My understanding of profit is to enlarge the joy and happiness of the largest number of people possible. Helping in communities as a volonteer is one of the best ways to achieve this goal and to enlarge the resented happiness around me. The contanct to other people and the offerred help for example contribute a lot to this goal. The fact that nowadays money has become more and more important and the it could even be stated that "money rules the world" is a sad development. Qualities such as loyalty and friendship have been exchanged by egoism and the desire to be rich in a materialistic way. Being rich in non-materialistic way is nothing to aim at anymore. 

I am convinced that young people have to make up their minds and seriously overthink what they have been doing. The should reflect the real importance of being alive. Possessing a lot of money can definately not be the reason  for being living in a community. A communitiy is a group where many people should feel home and be happy. All members of it should contribute as much as they are capaple to make the living as beautiful as it can be.
