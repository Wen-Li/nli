 Advertisements are a thing which I am very skeptic about. I think that advertisements are more focused on making money, on selling the product, than on actually showing the public what the product really is, or what it really does. Rather than just presenting the product as what it actually is, and letting it sell itself because of its true characteristics, advertisements enhance certain things in order to make the product seem more desirable or irresistable. Examples of this can be seen in our daily lives in things we might not even notice.
    One example of how advertisements make products seem much better than what they are is the presentation of food in the advertisements of fast food chains or restaurants. When we see a McDonald's ad, for example, we see an enormous, juicy, perfect-looking hamburger. This makes us want to go and buy one right away. Later, when it is sitting on our plate, we realize that it is nothing like what we saw on the poster or banner. It is smaller than what we imagined, and not nearly as perfect as the one we saw previously. This tactic used by publicists makes the product sell more, by giving the buyer the illusion of a much better thing.
    Another example of this is the way celebrities are shown in magazines. When we see magazine covers we always see people with the purest skin, the most flawless makeup, and most perfect hair we've ever seen before. This makes the magazine more desirable to people passing by becasue the "beautiful" people on the covers stand out more, which sells the magazine. People are led to believe that these people are perfect, when in fact they are normal human beings, just like the other six billion on Earth.
    Another example of a product made to seem better than what it is is the Mona Lisa. This painting by Leonardo Davinci is advertised, in a sense, by many history books and movies. It is portrayed by many as the most amazing work of art that has ever been painted. I was lucky enough to be able to visit this painting in person, and it wasn't all that I imagined it to be. When we see the Mona Lisa in books and movies it appears to be a large painting, when in fact it is quite small in relation to others. Also, there isn't anything special about it, in my opinion.
    Advertising can have a very influencing effect on people, which we can see throughout society every day. We cannot believe everything that we see.
