Advertisements are so common in modern time that most people are guided by them. As a shop-hunter, when I go to shoppling, I always pay much attention to the goods whcih have lots of advertisements. However, I was misleaded once and once again. In my opioion, the advertisements make products seem much better than really are. 

Sometimes the differents between the products and them in advertisements are just results of misunderstanding of language. The purposes for the companies to advertise is to introduce their products and attract customers to buy. To reach the goal, they need to use attactive words and explanations. However, sometimes we change the meanings of those words. A famous product in China, which called Brain Gold, has some advertisements say that it makes people to have a good sleep. People get the idea that it may improve sleep conditions as a medicine and have a good impression on it. However, the real function for the product is that it contains some organic materials which can help people sleep but not have lasting influence.

Also, somem products looks better than it really is because of the comfortable light in the advertisements. Once I saw a beautiful hat on TV and thought it was really suit for me, bright and opening. However, when I saw it in the supermarkets, I found it was not as well as on TV. It contributes to the light in the advertisements which makes the hat much bright and good-looking. Our eyes lie to us and give us some wrong informaiton.

On some other cases, the advertisements always use methods of phycology to give us wrong details of the products. When we sit together and have a lunch, there is some products on the TV, for example, an video. The advertisement is about what great views and happy time of a family that the video can catch. All of us will feel comfortable and make an good impreesion of the products, even though sometimes the video does not act as well as on TV.

In sum, I really think that the advertisements always mislead us and make products seem much better. The companies catch our attention by using language skills, light and the phycology.
