Successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well. True. Taking risks is all life is about. The uncertainty of the moment and the hard work to progress are the key points of a successful person. If you stick to the old conventional way, there is rather a high chance of keeping rooted to the spot you are in and never move forth and progress.
    Today, big business corporations and companies prefer creative and innovative people in their ranks over the only academically achieving. Education is a must, but the brains or guts separate the workers from the achievers. The world's most successful people today, were in the past normal people who just broke the runtines and liked to try new things and innovations. 
    Highly risky individuals are often criticized because of their outgoing manner and different way of being. Keep in thought that even the greatests geniuses of our times were misunderstanded. For example, there is a funny quote on internet  that says, "Only 8 people really did understand Eintein." If the Benjamin Franklin had not flew his kite during a perilous thunderstorm with the imminent danger of being electrocuted, he would not have been able to discover electricity. Actually, we would not be taking this TOEFL test on a computer!
    Most of the innovations we have in our homes are work of the masterminds who ignored the odds. The airplane, the bicycle, the microwave, the television, even the light bulb over us are inventions or discoveries from risky individuals. We live comfortable lives just because others put their brain and creativity to work. And as a friend of mine says, "The impossible is what still hasn't been tried."
    People who put it all in the line are comparatively more active in their social life and people enjoy their company. They are mostly joyful and happy all the time. Most are successful one way or another, love, work, happiness, or enlightenment. Who would want to be a conventional conformist? Being stuck on a mono routine is just plain boring.
