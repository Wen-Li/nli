I agree that certain advertisements make products look much better than they actually are. In my opinion the basic aspect of the advertisements is to show what the product really is in a reasonable manner but there are many ads exaggarating the product they represent. 

Detergent advertisements on T.V. set good examples for this case. In most of them the potential buyers see an extremely dirty shirt that is perfectly cleaned after a single wash with the product of the concern. There can be other claims in the ad as well, such as that it does not wear the clothes out, cause pale colours or it cleans any kind of dirt on the clothes. I personally feel suspicious upon seeing such an ad, as many other watchers do probably. 

Another example lies in cosmetics commercials. A shampoo or a make-up ad includes much more than the effect of the product and this is always untold. The watchers can not estimate the contribution of the product in what they see on T.V or on a magazine. The lighting conditions, shooting process and the preparement of the model in the ad adds considerably much on the effect of the product.  

Unless it represents itself reasonably or unless the claims are supported by a legal recorder who has observed and confirmed them, it is quite difficult to fully believe what is told in an advertisement.
