About the question whether to prefer broad-based education over specialisation in a specific subject, I firstly want to mention that it is not a question of strictly deciding for one of the two options. Actually, it is rather a question on how much one should tend to one option.
And I also think that the answer of question can not be refered to as a general solution for every person, because each person is different and has other attributes making it better for him or her to obtain a broad education or to concentrate on a single subject.
    My personal point of view is that I rather prefer achieving a wide-spreaded education in many different subjects and aspects of these subjects.
    This is because I am convinced that this method is most effective. Once one has reached a certain level of knowledge in many educational directions, it is much easier to learn new things. For example, if you want to learn a language, it is much easier if one already knows things about the related cultural and historical background. Learning English for example, becomes much more convinient if one knows, that it emerged from French and German and originally from latin, presumed that one speaks one of those languages.
    The second reason for me, personally, has to do with the attitude towards learning. I believe that learning does not only target on the gathering of information for the sake of their functional recall in adequate situations, but that it is also an considerably important instrument for forming once character and the personal evolvement.
This means, that if zou educate yourself in various areas, your personal gain from this knowledge is then also increasing with to the same extent.
    Related to my introductional statements, it is also important to have at least one specific subject, which you are especially interested in. In my opinion, a broad education can be imagined as the personal base on which one can build and accumulate great knowledge of a certain subject.
I think that this knowledge about one certain subject is ultimately necessary for one's personality, because one can identify with it and have a subject, that is really belonging to oneself, on which one really knows more than most other people.
    Another reason speaking for the emerging of outstanding knowledge in at least one specific subject is in mz opinion as simple as the expectation one is confronted by society. A person can do so much more for society, if it has a so-called profession, a word which fits the meaning of this described specific subject very well. Without a profession, a person can probably do many things quite well but nothing very well, so that there are scarcely any other people, that would be better in doing it.
    All in all, I think that on one hand one should always be ready to learn new things and always willing to continue ones personal development, which includes a broad education.
But on the other hand it is definetely also important to find one specific subject suitable for becoming professional in it.
The balance between both of them has to be determined by every individual by itself.
