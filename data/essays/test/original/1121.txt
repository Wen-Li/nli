My country is knowen by people living in there. Becose people in my country are very hot and helpfull. Nowadays there is a common question, ' do young people nowadays give enough time to helping their communities ' . I believe that our people are changing by day by. Nowadays young people become less helpfull for their community.

Firt of all, young people must behave more helpfull in their community because, they must know that one day they will be old. Last week, i saw an old women in the street and she has lots of lagguges. Her lagguges were very heavy for her, there were lots of young people in the street however none of them has not helped her. This was'nt good behaviour for me, i do not appreciate this kind of behaviours when i saw that occurance my thinkings had exactly changed. Before that occurance i was thinking that our young peoples are very helpfull but after that my opinion changed. Now i think our society is going on a bad way.

Why young people think only their benefits is very important and its answer must be search. In a community, people' s behaviours develop as an early ages. Young people in communities mus't be helpfull all the time. We must not teach young persons when they were young. If we don't teach them such kind of things in early ages, they will not be good citizens for their country.

To some up, our people's behaviours are changing nowadays. We should do some things for this situation. We must educate our childrens in a right way and teach them not to think only their benefits.
