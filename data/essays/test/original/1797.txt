I agree with the statement that most advertisement make products seem much better than they really are. I have two reasons to support this idea.

First, both the maker and the seller of the product wants to sell more, so they have good reason to show it attractively. 

For example, when I bought a skirt at an internet shopping mall, I checked the pictures of the skirt in which a model have the skirt on, checked the size, length and texture, then bought. But later when the percel arrived at my house, I found that the skirt didn't fit for me completely, as I am not so good in style as the model in the picture.

Second, especially the maker have more information on the product than the consumers. Because there are not so severe ban on the advertisement which brings the wrong information, the advertisement tends to express the merits, concealing the demerits.

Think of the advertisement on the wemen's magagines, there are hundreds of advertisements of drugs for loosing weight, but most of them have practically no effects, even some are toxic, but no consumers know which are really effective and which are not.  

Some say that the maker which creates good product can appeal the goodness to the consumers in order to make their life richer and happier, they just want consumers to know the merit. Nonetheless, it is consumers who decide which product is good. 

In conclusion,  I think because of the difference of the amount of information they have, the advertisement can easily be too attractive. I think the maker have to make big efforts to convey the right and enough information to the customer, also the retailer have to stand for the consumer and sell good products to the customer.
