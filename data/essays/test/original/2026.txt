In Japan, where I live, some young people prefer to travel by themselves. However, I agree to the statement that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide for the follwing reasons.

My first reason is that to travel in a group led by a tour guide is safer than to travel alone. For instance, when I was a junior high school student, I traveled to New York in a group led by a tour guide. In that time, I heard that New York was a quite dangerous city. We planed to visit a famous theater. Actually, the theater was located in a downtown where was a quite dangerous place. Because I was in a group, I was able to take a tour bus from a hotel where I stayed to the theater. In addition, a tour guide helped me to visit there. So It was totally safe for me. If I had traveled alone, I would have had to take a subway to visit the theater. I am not sure if I was able to visit there alone without any help from a tour guide. This example clearly shows that to travel in a group led by a tour guide is safer than to travel alone.

My next reason is that I can make more friends if I travel in a group led by a tour guide than I travel alone. For instance, when I was a studying in Waseda university, one of the most famous private universities in japan, I traveled to Europe in a group led by a tour guide. In the group, I met a girl, Shiori. AIthough I never met her in my campus, she was also studying in Waseda university. In addition, I was able to make some friends in a group, including a tour guide. A tour gude, Miki, and I was actually living in a same apartment. After the tour, I often contacted with her. She is now one of my best friends. If I had traveled alone, I would not have known them. Because I traveled in a group led by a tour guide, I was able to know Shiori, Miki and other people. This strongly illustrates that I can make more friends if I travel in a group led by a tour guide than I travel alone.

In conclusion, I agree to the statement that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide.
