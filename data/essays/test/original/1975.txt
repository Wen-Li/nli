The topic of understanding ideas or learning facts is often discussed in the public. There exist a variety of causes for both sides. On the one hand it is easier to learn facts, but on the other hand it is more effective to understand ideas and conepts. In my opinion it is more important to understand ideas and concepts.

The first reason for understanding ideas and concepts is that this way of learning is more effective. If a student understood a concept, he is able to reproduce this concept in other challenges. For example, an understood concept during the studies can be practiced in the job. 

Another argument is that you learn something for your life. If you have once understood a concept, you can use it in every situation of your life. The student is prepared for all challenges that will come. For example, if a student understood mathematics, he could solve compex problems in his job, because he has learned how tho think.

Furthermore understanding says something about the intelligence of the student. A student, who understands concepts and ideas is more intelligent than a student who just learns facts. Learning facts can do everybody, you just have to spend some time on it. But understanding is more difficult, that can only do intelligent students.

Learning facts has the following advantage in contrary to understanding ideas and concepts. It is faster and easier to learn.  They are helpful for exams during the studies, but they are not helpful to solve problems. For example, if you have learned some facts about birds in biology, you cannot use this later in your job.

A lot of reasons are against the importance of learned facts. Learned facts will be forgotten very fast, because they are not used commonly. Learned facts are very specifially and normally not useful in the job. In the job there are so many different types of problems. You cannot prepare the solutions of problems with learned facts.

In conclusion, there are more advantages for understanding concepts and ideas. In my opinion it is more important to understand ideas and concepts because it is more effective and it is something that you learn for your life.
