From my point of view this statement is absolutely true.
There are three major arguments that support my opinion.

First of all I would like to invite you on a trip through our recent history. It was about 1000 A.D. when Erik the Red set sail to Greenland with about 25 ships. More than half of them sunk in the rough sea passage between Iceland and the colony they were heading for. They set sail even though they knew about the difficulties which they might have to face. All of them could have continued their career as beeing a craftsmen of a farmer. But they did not because of their inner desire to discover something new, to extend the border of the known world. Erik's son Leifur (national hero of Iceland) was the first to set a foot on the New World (Northern America). With this example it can be seen that progress only occurs when men or women take risks. 

This is of course only one of thousands of examples throughout history. What about the discovery of X-Rays by the german physicist Roentgen or the Apollo-11 mission to the moon? All these achivements (many of them increased our life standard enormously) would not have been possible without taking risks. Therfor we should be thankful for all the brave people who put their ideas and dreams above their own lifes. 

In contrast to that I would also like to point out that it is hard to define a successful life. Is somebody less successful just because he stays at home with his wife and cares for his kids? As you can see a conflict arises about a clear definition of success. Nevertheless I would like to leave it like that and draw my conclusion.

Throughout history progress was only possible because of brave men and women.
