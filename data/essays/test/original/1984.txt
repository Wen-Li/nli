I disagree with the statement. I think it is as important for students to understand ideas and concepts as it is to learn the facts. These two cannot be separated, because they complement each other. It is crucial to an effective learning process to combine both concepts and facts. The understanding of a concept is the base for understanding facts. The concept/idea makes the fact clearer to the student because then he/she has a background supporting a particular fact they might be facing. 

Let's say a student is taking an internship in Clinical Psychology and has to interview different kinds of patients. The student will not be able to give an appropriate and complete diagnosis based on only the interview. He/she will be able to see in reality many of the things he/she has learned in class. For example, the body language of a patient. The student will not be able to interpret all the signals the patient is sending unless he/she knows what those signals or body messages mean. And this is when the concepts and ideas play a big role. By combining the information he/she has learned in theory with the information provided in practice, the intern will be able to make an accurate interpretation of the messages conveyed by the patient.

Many Universities here in Chile base their curricula more on theoretical courses rather than practical. I believe that a good curricula should always have a good balance between theoretical and practical courses. It is true that the conceptual courses will train and shape the minds of the students to a more abstract kind of thought, but the factual world will shape other skills in the students as well.

It is in the practical world where the students will end up working, and not in the world of ideas and concepts. Therefore, it is crucial for them to face the facts of the concepts they are learning in class.
