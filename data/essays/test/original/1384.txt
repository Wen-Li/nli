I agree with the statement. It's reasonable to think young people have no time to help their communities or they spend a lot of time in a bad manner.
A lot of people can't think to spend own important day life without learning money.
It's so because our society obliged to us to learn money as you can and have a good work which you can permit everything with.
This is the biggest problem, usually you don't do anything without a material scope.
I'm convinced by another important thing. A lot of time our society, I love define as the western society, obliged to us to be physically in a certain way, so young peolpe prefer to put our attention on theirself.
They prefer spend much time in gym, or other places like that to improve their physical aspect .
There is the idea that I come before all the others things or people. At the beginniong I have to improve my way of life then , if there is more time, I can think that I'm not alone.
It's important to underline how people are obliged from this kind of society, they accept this conditions without can do anything.
In this contest, another impostant thing we have to underline is how  a day is shortest than a day of some years ago.
Nowdays a young people spend a lot of time at school or working and sometimes is impossible to think to do other activities during tha day.
