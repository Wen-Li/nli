I am completely agree with the statement, because when you undrstand ideas and concepts, you can learn logicaly the thing taugh. It happened to me when i was in highschool, i had a history profesor that always said that the dates are important, it is true, but when you understand the global thing, the logical chain of events, how one event in the past is linked with the next one, like a story, you will remember naturally the date in which the event ocurred. So that i followed my profesor's advice and i start to understand the process of how and why the things happened in the chilean history. Suddenly, history became a very interesting subject, like a story and i barely could wait to the next class to continue learning. Then, when i gave the test the dates and facts just came to my head because I undertood the whole thing and why it happened.
I think that if you only learn a fact, maybe you can remember it for the test, but some day you will foget it, because as rationale beings, it does not have many sence remeber things only because. At least for me. Maybe there are people with better memory than i, I used to study with a class mate that just keep facts and he repeted them once and again, i almost went crazy and realized that i can not study wth him anymore. With the pass of the years i become Veterinarian and i still have some of the history knoledge that i once learned. but my classmate does not remember as well as i the facts that occuried in the chilean history. Nevertheless, we was and are only two people and maybe my classmate did have the interest that i had in history. So that i think that is very important to understand ideas and concepts, it makes easier the learning process, it worked for me then and it works for me now, but it is also very important the motivation that every person has to face one subject.
