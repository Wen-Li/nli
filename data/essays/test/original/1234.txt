It's very hard to say which is more important understanding ideas and concpets or learning facts but I agree that students should understand ideas and concepts for two reasons. First, students could have desire to study by realizing ideas and concepts. Second, it leads the students make great invention without knowing themselves.
First of all, understanding ideas and concepts is basis of learning someting. Of course, they could study more without them but it offers good chances to the students to study more. The great inventors or scietists knew the baisic idea of they inventon. Edison invented lights, Bell made telephone. They didn't do that by accident. They studied and stuided on the base of the lights or comumicatin using wire.
Second, it's really difficult to understand ideas or concepts however, once the students realize what they learn exactly, they could study much easier and enjoy their learing. When I was in high school, I really hated in chemistry class because I didn't understand lots of name of atomic or principles and I never studied it for the time being and my grades of chemistry was terrible. There was no teacher who cheered me up or help but I had to study it to get good scores. And I just mermorized them everyday for almost one month. Then miracle happened to me. A little by little, I got to realized what I memorized. To be more suprisingly, I have experienced that again during in my university. I was major in socioloy and sometimes the terms were unfamiliar with me and many times, I gave up reading socioloy books. And I made a decision again to read them more carefully and slowly. I realized again what the terms meant.
It might be my personal opinion but I am sure there are many people with the same expereince. I think all of those were thans to that I focused on baic concepts so I still agree it's more important to understand ideas and concepts.
