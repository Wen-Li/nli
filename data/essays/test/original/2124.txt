In my opinion, i doesn't agree that there will be fewer cars in use twenty years later compare to todays. The reason that i said this is mainly because people are going to have higher living standard twenty years later compare to today's. Because of this, they will have higher demand asked for vehicles as now they can afford to purchase luxury and very expensive cars. Because of this, cars became an neccessity in their daily days, no matter they want to used it for travel, to show off or maybe they just want it as others have it. 
The following reason that support my idea is we will have the more advance technology in twenty years time. This will make the issue of the petrollum which will  polute our enviroment might not be an issue anymore, so everyone who want to purchase a cars will need not worry about this issue anymore. Furthermore, there're techology that make a huge impacts on our daily life such as we can just simply switch on a button and pick up a location from the map which we will like to go and the car will then move by itself and bring us to our destinations. By this, we can do many others things within the travelling period instead of driving a car. We can even get change or take our breakfast in the car while outside was having a terrible traffic jam. If this really happen, then waiting inside a car might become an entertaiment instead of something that drive people crazy. 
Therefore, the last reasons that i think the numbers of car will be increasing in twenty years compare to today's is because the price of a cars will be much more cheaper compare to today's situation. The reason that make this happen is mainly because, when there're high supply in the cars industry and people are overall rich, there'll definitely a decrease the cars pricing. To further explain this, when people don't take cars as a symbol of their wealth as all ordinary people were capable to purchase luxury cars, the demand for luxury cars will fall. Developement of the technology might also become one of the reason that cause the cars price fall.
Due to all the reason above, i think that in twenty years time, there will be an increase in cars used compare to what we have today's.
