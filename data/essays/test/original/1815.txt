Advertisments are meant to explain about the product and its benifits to the consumers there by increasing the sale of the product. At time advertisments are used to attract more consumers by means of creativity in advertisment but still not conveying wrong message. But few advertisments exaggorate about the product. They show them much better than what they are actually.
    One of the most popular advertisment in India which I think fall in this category is about a soap named 'Lux'. The product developres use cinema heroines for this advertisment and quotes that the reason for the beauty of hearione is the soap. Obvisouly it sounds redicule. These days everybody knows about the make up they go through. But they still continue with such kind of advertisments.
    The other example is in general about bikes milage. Most of the manufactures of bikes quote that their bikes give 60-80 kilo meters milage per 1 liter of petrol. In reality it gives only one fourth or one third of that at maximum because of various other reasons like condition of roads, maintenence. But they never mention them.
    The most rediculous and most bothering advertisments these days are about bank loans. These days banks are coming up with all types of possible loans. Home, personal, vehicle, festival... what not!!. They advertise so attractively quoting that all over needs will be satisfied by taking the loans. And they are litrerly behind you to take the loans. But they don't quote the hidden costs and incremental in the intrest rates that may occur.
    There are many such products in the market. This kind advertisment may be to sustain the compeition. But once consumers use the product and if they find the truth they may not purchase it again. There by the manufactures loose them permanently. The purpose of advertisment will itself be lost.
