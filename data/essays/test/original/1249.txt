In modern life, when you turn on your TV, you will hear McDonalds' "I'm loving it"; when you go to the street, you will see Nike's "Just do it"; ... It is an era of advertisement.  You would see them everywhere, in the bus station, in the highway road, in the plane, etc.  However, do these advertisements exactly reflect the real products?  As far as I am concerned, my answer is "no".

For one thing, the advertisements always magnify, or even "create" the merits of the products.  It is quite common in the products of make-ups.  The directors of the advertisement always hire some famous models or movie stars, and claim that the beauty of these persons should be contributed to the special products.  They concern nothing about the truth, but the business effects of the advertisement.

For another, the advertisements would generally trivilize, or even neglect the disadvantage of the products.  Some products may even have side effects, to which most advertisements would pay no attention.  A case in point is an equipment for eyesight therapy several years ago.  In the advertisement, many children who had used this equipment were interviewed "randomly", and claimed that the therapical result was quite satisfying.  However, when this product was put into real use, it caused many children to lose their eyesight permanently.  As a result, the manufacturer and the advertisement producer were sentenced after that.

In addition, some advertisements may not even mention the effects of the product, but only to link the product with the consumers' special emotions.  For example, a home-made food simbolizes it as "the taste of mother".  You would never know how this food exactly tastes through the advertisement.  Neither would you know what effects this food will do to your body.  

To conclude, to be a wise consumer, I think we should pay little attention to what is said in advertisements.  The reason manufacturers pay to make advertisements is to gain profits, not to tell the consumers the true story.
