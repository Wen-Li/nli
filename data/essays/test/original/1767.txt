Altough there are some people woh beleive that learning facts is more important, I agree with the statement that it is more valuable for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts for the following reasons.

First, we can get a lot of information not only by reading books, but also checking web site through Internet. On the other hand, when we try to understand ideas and concepts, we have to check the facts and then consider it  very seriously, which means everyone can learning facts and it is not valuable. I am now working for a trading company. My responsibility is trading gold with future price. I can check the fact, current gold price, with Internet, but can not predict the future price easily. However, I learned the concept, how to predict such price, when I was a graduate student. I can trade gold 
with the concept, which is making much profit for our company. Therefore, understanding of the concept is more important than the fact, the current gold price.

Also, we can apply our understanding of ideas and concepts in a certain field to another field, even though facts are just facts. For example, my elder brother is a enginner who designs laptops at Sony, the largest manufacturing company in Japan. When he was a university student, he learned physics, math, computer enginnering, and electical enginnering. Now he understands how to manufacture Sony computers using ideas and concepts of these subjects. If he were not a serious student, and just remember the facts, such as the answers in term tests and some formula in math or physics, he could not be a Sony engineer. Therefore, learning facts is less important to learn concepts.

In conclusion, I strongly believe that it is more important to understand ideas and concepts.
