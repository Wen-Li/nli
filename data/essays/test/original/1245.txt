Advertisements are all about increasing the popularity of a product whch may or may not achieve the result as claimed by the companies. In most cases by employing the celebrities to advertise the products the companies are actually taking the advantage of the respect people hold for such celebrities. They are also hitting on the psyche of the consumer by actually tempting him to use the products after seeing his idol use the same project. 

History is full of such examples where the adverstised product has not yielded the desired results. The advertisements which advertise buying medicine to decrease obesity or retain hair growth, slippers to increse height are all there to make a fool out of the consumers. The mutual funds  and investment companies which employed stratergies of using a celebrity to increase their popularity have many a times left the common man bankrupt. 
Although in this age of globalisation it is not wrong to advertise a product to fight off the competition  but then again the govenments should look into this before someone is really hurt badly.

Like man kind, advertisements and marketing of a product  have also evolved. A recent form of advertising a product has been vehemently opposed by many a governments. It is employed by pharmaceutical companies all over the world to advertise their projects. By giving expenses gifts to doctors, paying for their vacation and sometimes funding their post graduation studies  have lead them to fool the customers by sometimes handling them a bad and expensive medicine. Another form of advertisement in this regard is by paying the politicians for their election campaigns and then getting the benefits after the party comes to power like that done by Blackwater firm of US currently working as a task force in Iraq. Another type of evolved advertisement is by actually propogating fear in the minds of the people and then implementing the personal agendas like waging a war or curb the rights of the people as done by the countries waging the so called war on terror. 

To some people many of my examples seem out of context but if looked closely these are the advertisement stratergies which should be scared of as the affect the lives of many people.
