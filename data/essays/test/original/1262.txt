People have got different qualities from each other . Some of them try  new things and take risks ,some of them waste their time only doing what they already know to do well.In my opinon ,  people who try new things and take risks rathet than only doing what  they already know how to do well  are successfull.
     Succesful people do not afraid of the encountering new things .They believe that if they can achieve these difficulties they feel themselves  the happiest person in the world.They think the result of this accoplishment.They do not escape the risks .They try to figure out the problem and try to find the best solution for this event.Achieving the new things which have not seen before and taking a risk for it belong to succesful people.
         The people who occupy with things which already how to do well is not spend their time very much on this situation.They believe that they can success it very easily . They do not encounter with difficulties and they do not try to defeat this difficulties.Because of this they do not understand the worth of the success.They asume that become a winner is very easy and they feel themselves very calm.
          To sum up ,achievement which is won easy ways does not accept as an success.The people who do not afraid  the encounter ing new thigs and risk achieve the eveything .Everybody in the world admires them .Because everbody can do everthing if they know enough data about this condition .But achieving the new things which are not known is vey crucial for people and they know the value of this.People support the succesful  people ,too.
