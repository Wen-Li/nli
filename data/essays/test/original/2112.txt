The best way to travel in group is not led by a tour with a guide for whille it can be convenient, one cannot enjoy at the maximum extent the marvels of the visited places.
Many individulas choose to trave lwith a guide. Most of the time, not having the time to devise an organized plan of places the individual want to visit, he resorts to a pre-made "field trip" in which for sure all the most important and relevant attractions of a place would be visited. It sounds good so far right? But it is not.
Traveling with a guide is romantisized  by the ignorant and yet hated by the knowledgeable. Those tours are way too stricted to actually feel the sweet feeling of being in a beautiful place because everything is in a rush. 6:00 AM one have to be ready to take the breakfast in half an hour. Then half an hour to get to point A and then another half to reach point B...Just too stressing for one to enjoy. At this pace, the tour seems like a photo album: one is just looking at it from a far away place and despite the fact that you are looking at it , after all, you just look at it and are not able to reach it. 
Another problem with this is the expenditures. Everytime one goes to a restaurant, that restaurant charges too much capital for food that the residents of those areas obtain it for low price. I would be bold enough to say that the guides take adavtage of the  tourists to go to eat to expensive restaurants where whether the wealthy, ignorants or unstoppable spenders  go.
Finally, the apathy of some guides is just admirable and unconceiveable. They have so many people to attend that in notime they are overwhelmed by stress, tiredness, and boredom. They do not do the job that they are suppose to. They just try to go by day after day, making the traveling experience one of low quality and monotonous.
Traveling with guide in a tour is NOT the best way to travel. If one want a full great experience one has to plan carefully one's own trip. It is not worth to put trust , money, and time in a mediocre company to offer an, in most cases, one-time-only experience. Thus, traveling with guides is not only hte worst  way, but also the one that travelers would regret the most.
