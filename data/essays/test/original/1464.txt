I compleatly agree this sentence.
Maybe there are many reason why young people do not give enough time to helping their communities.
One reason because young people don't spend much time to helping their communities could be that they have to do so many things in their own life, so they haven't too much time to help someone else.
Young people have a lot of things to do in their life.
First of all they haven't so much time to spend out of the school.
They have to do homeworks, and than they often make some activity out of the school like playing some sports or they take lessons about singing or acting or somethingelse. 
Secondly I think that when you are young you don't think people needs your help.
When you are young you don't want eny help, because you think you don't need it.
This could be a reason young people don't help their communities.
Finally it's correct to say that there are also many young person who help thier communities.
But maybe they are less than who don't do it.
