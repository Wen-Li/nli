        Cars are an extraordinary invention which took place in the nineteenth century during the industrial revolution. It began in United States with Ford and with the taylorism and then it came in Europe. 
 Today we are at the beginning of the 21st century, in 2006. Cars exists in nearly every part of the world. They have changed, improved in several ways, and have become the most convienient  and favourite transport of many people.
Can we guess that in twenty years there will be fewer cars than there are today?  
        One of the main argument of those who think that this can be  possible, is an ecologic one. In fact, today we are more and more concerned about our planet, about our own survival, about being careful to the Earth. Thus, people and governments particularly, are trying to vote laws against pollution and are tying to make people aware of all the dangers for the environment.
Unfortunately, in 2006, here we are: everyday we here about more and more ecologic disasters: oil spread in the ocean for exemple.
Moreover some states such as the United States have refused to sign the protocol of Kyoto. So can we really think that there can be fewer cars in use? Maybe yes if other ways of travelling, more convienient and less expensive, are developped in 2026. 
     Nevertheless the obvious opinion is to think that in fact there won't be fewer cars in twenty years and on the contrary, there will be more cars.
First, because economy plays a too important part in the wold. Fewer cars means fewer money. And this industry is very powerful today and it is in constant developpement. Industry such as Ford, Renault or Opel are selling everyday more and more cars; they create new design, new abilities for these cars and people feel that they really need them in their life: to go to their job, to go to holidays with their family and so on...Moreover, twenty years is definitely a very short time for people, and governments to change their habits by something new. All we can do is encouragins less polluing transports such as bikes.
