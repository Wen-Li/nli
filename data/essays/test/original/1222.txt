My personal opinion is not supported by scientific topics ,I think it is not only important the quantity , but the quality of  the advertisements .Then I also think that if the products are not quality products  then people will not be attracted by them.If we watch an advertisment and it is well done and we watch it many times too the consumers is surely tempted to buy the item and with the new modern technic some items can appear very charming . I talk about computer technics , with them every defect can be fixed and it is really difficult to understand the difference between the real world from the virtual one.Special effects and beautyful appearences can present the products much better than they really are. For example if we look at food items then they can be presented very well but if they are not good then people will not buy them again, but if it is a car to be advertised then if it seems better than it is ,then the advertisement worked very well and the goal of the advertisement was correct even if it used mystiphications to advertise the product.
I remember a my personal situation when i had to buy a new computer i was attracted from many brands and i was very confused and i didn't know what i had to buy .I started to read advertisements on the newspaper and by television and I must tell that iIdecided not only for the technic quality of the item I was going to buy but I liked to have a product that looked well in my house in combination with my fornitures and for this I choosed by the best advertisement able to give me what i was looking for. So THe advertisement must speack to different segment o
