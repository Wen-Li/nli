Successful people do try new things and take risks rather that only doing what they already know how to do well. There are many people who have proved this and their success has made me a staunch believer of this policy.
          Mr.Bill Gates has re-written all the rules of the book and has churned out an ultra-successful business with his out-of-the-box thinking.No one ever imagined that the personal computer would take over all of the world. He  realized its potential and took a risk of investing his time, resources and money in an area that others scoffed at during his time. He has answered his critics back and his company would stand as a testimonial for this.
          My uncle Bob was a carpenter in his town. He had a steady business and lead a satisfactory life. With the software boom he saw computers being used everywhere and he saw a potential business opportunity here. He observed that these computers did not have a proper table and chair. So he set about to make a computer table that would hold both the monitor and the processing cabinet.The tables sold like hat cakes and in no time he became a millionaire. But what is interesting to note is that his monthly margins ecxeeds that of the local computer store! He sure knew how to cash by being different.
          My friend Peter back in high school was a boy of variety interests. He loved trekking and had an interest in videography.He combined both of these interests and made a movie on how to trek showing the finer nuances of trekking by shooting them. The video made him the star of our school overnight and his videos sold like hot cakes.His difference is what earned him all the fame.
         Through all the experiences I've been through I certainly believe that it is those who try out different things and take risks are the one's who succeed and are the trialblazers for others to follow.
