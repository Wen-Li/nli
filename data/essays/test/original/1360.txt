I agree with the satements that ''Most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are.''
In general commercials are used to increase the selling numbers of a product. Therefore it is the purpors of an advertisment to make a product look good, since nobody wants to buy a bad product. For instance, an advertisement for a new kind of candy is used to introduce the product to the market. Hence, the advertisement will show how nice and good the candy is. That the candy might contain sugar, which might make certain people fat, is not metioned in the advertisements because the candy company wants to sell the candy. And in times of a free market there are so many products that an advertisement has to point out the advantages of a product. Therefore I agree with the statement because an obviously bad product (the candy) is shown in a better light than it is. 
The statement is usually considered to bad. However in a society where profites and selling numbers are the only focus it is a neccassity to show ones product as the best on the market. Hence, there is no other possibility other than to make a product look better than it is. For instance the contangan (pain releaser, makes, however, babies become handycaped) has been sold million times. Thet fact that babies are born crippled has never been mentioned in the advertisements. 
One might argue that is cruel and bad that advertisments make products seem much better than thez really are, I however, argue that it is a relsult and a neccassity of our modern society.
