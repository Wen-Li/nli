The grown-ups are forever complaining about the end of the world with the youngsters caring too much about their vanity and spending so much time for their own selfish ends. However,on a new insightful inspection of the world that we are living in now, this blatant statement might all be true.

     In the past, the world was a more loving community where visits to neighbors were more frequent and encouraged. However, on observing the world now that is more and more rapidly developing, this has become impossible. Our excuse for this is that 'We don't have enough time'. Time is one of the most valued things to ensure personal survival where the competition for more education and ultimately high-paying jobs, is considerable. Subsequently, youngsters struggle to find liberal time to help the local community, harder so, their recreational time.

     Furthermore, in an immense contrast to the past, there are more 'distractions' to spend their meagre time on. For example, there are, personal computers, -who doesn't have a computer at home, nowadays?- DVDs, TV, cell phones, stereos, etc. The most recent addition to this list, Apple's i-pods definitely does not improve the way the teens organise their time to benefit everyone.

     The past was a world of clubs and socialising with friends as less technological development meant that there was no way in which the youngsters could occupy their time in the selfish manner that the modern teenagers are prone to employ. Social groups like Scouts, Explorers and various other youth clubs strove to find ways to constantly reminding themselves that you cannot live alone and everyone is a part of a community. They all participated in helping in orphanages, children's homes, nursing/care homes and even charity shops to improve the residential area as well as themselves as whole persons.

     In conclusion, should we despair so that the teens are unable to experience that feeling of magnanimity by following the christian belief, 'Love your neighbors'? The answer is no. Already lessons on respecting communities are noted as essential in schools and gradual change in this matter is duly expected.
