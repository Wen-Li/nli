 Some might agree to the statement that in 20 years time there would be less cars than are today. They may say that the technological advances could have far reaching effects such as development of more sophisticated means of travel , thus cars would reduce in number.

    Others might argue saying that cars infact will become an essential comodity. The owning of a car would be a necessity rather than a just a means to travel.Hence the number of cars instead of reducing would probably multiply.

    However in my view point I believe that the numbers of cars in the comung years might just reduce.

    There are various reasons for my belief. Firstly 20 years down the line probably the technology would have advanced such a great deal. This advancement in technology could cause scientist and engineers to come up with another means of travel , not necessary the road alone. Probably we could have small jets flying around in air making use of the lower layers of earth atmosphere thereby reducing the number of cars. People could simply sit in the small private jets and fly to their destination. All this might seem to be out of the box, but the rate at which technology is advancing there might just be a distinct possibility that this might become true.

    Also the already tremendous increase in number of cars has saturated the means of travel by road. The amount of time taken, furtherd by traffic jams have already made people to move out and look for other means of travel. Furthered by the time constraints already alternate solutons such as use of speed boats and hover-crafts have come into effect causing people to make use of these rather than travel by road.This reluctance to travel by road will also disuade the people further from investing money in buying a car thus reducing the number of cars present.

    Apart from this the space constraints 20 years down the line would discourage people from using cars as there would be less or no parking places left. People of today are utilizing all possible land and 20 yers hence the scene could be just worse. This would reduce the number of car users automatically causing fewer cars to be in use.
    
    Thus in my view the number of cars are bound to reduce in the near future.Owing to advances in technology and time factor, people will explore other means of traveling, other than by cars, which may lead to the cars become obsolete.
