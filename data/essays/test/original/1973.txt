I do agree that most advertisements make procuts seem much better than they really are.
Let's take for example the pictures of a fast food meal. They always show perfectly shaped sandwitch, colorful sauces flooding out of them, fresh salade leaves and very attractive colors.
But when you find yourself at the counter, things are really different.
The sandwitch seems half size compared to the advertised one, an unidentified mix of sauces appears at the sides and a few slices of salade can be found inside, which are almost tasteless.
I think that with food there is at least some hoest reason why the product cannot look exactly as the advertiswments do: in fact, there is an inherent difficulty of producing identical items.
But what about kid games? Here things are different: the product is identical of that shown in the advertisements, but it is always advertised in a context which lets him appear much more better than it really is.
For example, a single LEGO police station, shown in the context of a huge and fully operative city made of LEGO, will appear much better than it is taken alone.
It might appear a very interesting item in that enviroment, but taken alone on a shelf in your bedroom, it could be not so attractive.
Off course, you might alway buy a full city made of LEGO, and probably that is the actual target of that advertisement!
In both cases, the reasons for making a product seem much better than it really is, is to attract people toward that product.
Sometimes, similar products have similar characteristics and features, and the only way to direct the consumer's attention towards a product instead of another one, is to tell the thruth plus...a small lie.
That small lie is the actual difference between the reality and the appearance.
