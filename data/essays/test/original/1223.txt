I agree the statement "The best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide." There are two reasons, safety and the satisfaction of watching spots.
       If we travel in foreign countries, we may be in not safe
conditons,because we can not understand foreign languages very much. Being in foreign countries makes you much more dangerous than being your own country. The thirf who get only foreigners' purses insists. futhermore, we regularly be corrected our passports by the guide for our safety.And at the one more other point, when we shop foreign countries' shops, we often would be shoped at unsuitable prices. The last one, because we do not know the way much, we often get our way lost there. However, if a tour guide is by us,he/she would save us by these things. 
       Second, we would be able to visit many watching spots if the tour guide teach us. If we travel alone, we do not know where we really should visit. If you had searched where to go by books or Internet, there are no ones that can be better than the real voices. They always lead us whare we really want to go or experience. If we want to talk and make friends with the people who live there, it is difficult for us to make it real when you travel alone.In addition, there are some places where just only foreifners can visit all the time in Japan. For example, Kyoto Gosho does not allow the people who do not have any paper that can show who thay are. However, because foreigner always have passports,thir foreigners tour members can visit there any time.  Besides,we can ask our historical or culture questions to the guide, and he/she has much amount of knowledge.
       By these points, I think the best way to travel in a group led by a tour guide.
