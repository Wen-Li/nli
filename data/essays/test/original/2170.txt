 The percentage of successful people in society is low. Rarely you can find a successful person. In order to be a successful person you have to experience new things. I believe that successful people should try new thing and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well. A successful person should try new things so that he completes his successful life, and encourage other people to be successful.

    The first reason is to complete his successful life. If the person was successful and the years go on, in my believe he starts to loose his success. For example, if a person was an excellent student when he was in the high school and he got the hightest marks in all subjects in that high school, then after the high school when entered a good university he did not do will and he strats failing his courses, in that case this person is not success because he did not complete his successful life. As a resualt, in oreder to be a successful person you have to maintain your successful life and do not let any thing  to break it.

    The second reason is to encoureage other people to be successful. Many people are influenced by other people such as actors, players, singers or scientists. If the person loved a popular person he will start acting like him/her. For example, if the person loved a scientist and he was influenced by him, if the scientist was a successful person and he always try new things and experience differeant things the person will start acting like the scientist and he will try to be like him. This point will help many people to be successful.
    
    In conclusion, successful people should try new things and take risks in order to maintain their successful life. If a successful person only do what he already knows how to do well, after a period of time he will loose his success because his knowlege is still the same and he did not learn new things.
