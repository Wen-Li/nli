Ancient times saw the popularity of an item or a product by a kind of publicity which can be considered quite reliable since it was a mouth to mouth publicity mainly due to the lack of means of communication and media as we have in the modern day. 
  Now, this media that we have today makes me think twice before I believe it completely. And one aspect of the media today is 'ADVERTISEMENT'. Advertising everything it is paid for, never mind its effects on society. Well, when this aspect comes into picture then it definitely makes me think twice before i buy any product advertised on television or by other means like hoardings etc.
Lets look at the definition of advertising - it means making people aware of a certain product and also inform them about its good effects, mind you only the positive points of the product though there might be negative associations with it. 
  Well if a company had to advertise the shortcomings of its product then who would buy it? So it highlights only the positive points in such a away that it is misleading at times, it actually exaggerates its positive features. For eg.a bathing soap is actually just effective in fighting germs to an extent of fifty percent whereas the advertisement shows it to be effective to an extent of ninety eight percent. In this way they make their product seem much better than it actually is.
  Another example being that of Soft drinks - they have been promoted using the most popular sports persons, actors, etc. associating  these products with their success, but the ill-effects of it are disastrous like most of them containing pesticides leading to a cancerous effect in individuals. People usually idolize these successful icons and follow their path and buy whatever they advertise unaware of the ill-effects.
The fact is that the war of different companies making the same products leads to this strategy of advertising each one's product to outdo the other, hence leading to these exaggerated advertisements showcasing even a mediocre product as the best one in the market.
And this completely justifies why I believe that most of the advertisements actually display a product in a much higher version tahn it deserves to be.It is only when a consumer uses a product does he know which is the best quality product.
