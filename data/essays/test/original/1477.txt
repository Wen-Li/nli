Travelling is one of the important activity for  entertainment and  to gain knowledge . It is better to take the help of a guide who is familiar with the facts and events that occured in the  history in a particular place. So in my opinion travelling with a guide along a group is the best  way.

  First to know about the traditions , customs and civilizations about a particular place is quite difficult without a person who is familiar about the place is a difficult task. So to explain and illustrate the importance of a place a guide is necessary. In many cases the guide will be a local person of the place and he is much more familiar than a stranger and he knows what  the particular place is prominent for.

  Second,  Mostly the tourists who visit a place will not be knowing the local languages. So to help them a guide is essential. A guide acts as a means of communication between the tourists and the local people.
For example , if we go shopping we dont know much about  the value and cost of a product which is famous there. Therefore taking this advantage about the strangers the sellers may cheat the travellors by saying too much cost which it does not actually value for it. In this case a guide may help the tourist without being effected by the sellers. 
 
In a group if any individual suffer from the health problems the other persons may help and the guide helps to consult a doctor for the problemand there is lot of co-operation among the fellow persons and also the communications skills develop a lot in a group.
Finally a a tourist guide is very helpful in travelling for knowing better things about a particular place which it is prominant and famous for and also as the tourists are not familiar with the local language a guide may help them in many ways .
