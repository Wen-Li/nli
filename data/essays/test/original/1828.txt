I strongly agree with the statement that advertisments are making products much better than they are really. In the sense that, advertisements are over hyping there products though they are not really that effective. I will support  my opninion based on the following reasons and examples.

Firstly, cosmetics advertisments like soap, shampoos advertises there products much more better than really they are.For example, during advertisments of soaps, movies shows a very dark woman at the begining and will transform the women suddenly in fair and beautifully my misleading audience that there so called product had converted a dark and unfair woman into fir one. The reasons why is disagree with the advertisment is due many reasons.Firstly, color od an individual is innate; it is aquired by genes but not by using soaps and stuffs like that.Secondly, color of an individual is based on the region of earth where people live.So, I strongly agree with statement that advertisments are making products much valuble than they are.

Secondly, recent one of our neighbour purchased a mobile phone after watching the advertisment whicg shows that the usage of the so called mobile phone makes human kind prosperous anf richer.But, in reality, purchasing mobile will make a man rich sees to be absurd and illogical.In fact a man can be rich only by his effots and hard work but not by purchasing mobile phones.

Thirdly, adverstiments in the field of motar vehicles like cars and buses.In this kind of adverisments, to make their business popular and prosperous, motar companies use film and sport stars who are well known icons in the society. In addition to this, some advertisments shows a sport star rides the cars very fast which in reality is impossible.But, people get attracted towards the ridiculous advertisments and will purchase motar cars from the well famed companied, although they are not that much effective in usage. 

In some advertisments like the one which trades hair shampoo shows in generally a dramtic recover of hair and baldness after using their so called product, shampoo.In fact, color of hair, growth of hair, baldness are gentically and therefore, cannot be regrow again and again.

To sum up the above statements, most avertisments like cosmetics, electronic, motar vehicles are making their money by just hyping there avdertiments which in really life as impossible and absurd.So, puplic should aware of all this kind of misleading stuff. Finally, based on the above reasons, I strongly agrees the statement "Most advertisments make products seem much better than they really are".
