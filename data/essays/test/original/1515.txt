                                        Successful people

Allways, we can see differences between all the people.
Some german lawayers talk about opportunities, and they think that only  successful people have new and great opportunities in any job or in any place, it just depends of the intelligent ideas and the cappacity of the person.

A first important aspect in this topic is the academical preparation.
When a young person  finishes the high school, the first feeling is the confussion, and in this aspect, succesful people have other special skills. This people have an special plan for the future and it consists in a special preparation, they preffer read more than have parties or another similars ways to fun. Successful people prefers to buy a great book than go to the beach in the summer season.

When this people finished the university, their first hope is do a postgrade course, it means more and best preparation.  However social relations are extremaly important in this context, because a person that havent friends is a person that havent opportunities in the present, and of course, in the future.
This new studies represent new opportunities for this people, represents,  also, the possibility to know more people and grow up more ideas. 

Risk is other important skill for this kind of people. In spanish we have a rally intersting quote El que no arriesga no gana. It means that if a person wants to start with a new bussiness, this person should take risks because is the only way to demostrate that his/her idea was great.

Finally, I think that succesful people try new things, try new ideas, and also want to develop the intelligence with new courses, and with new friends. Is important to want the  development of this kind of people specially in South America.
