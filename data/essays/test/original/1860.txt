I strongly desagree with the question saying that " it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts". I trully think that to understand the concepts and the ideas is equally important with learning  facts. 

Students need to understand ideas and concepts pointed out by the teacher. The student also needs  to have proofs and learn facts of what the teacher is saying. Giving an example, if a student is following a chemestry lesson and the teacher makes him understand the concept of an experiment but the student hasn't done the experiment, the student will understand it but he will be missing the practical part of it, and he would not posses the proof that what the teacher is saying is true. 

Understanding ideas and concepts is a theorical part of the studies, facts are the practical part of studies. When in primary school we learn that an addition is the concepts of adding numbers toghether but that the teacher does not show it with an example, the childrend will get the concept of addition but will not know how to apply this new concept. Therefore it is important that the teacher shows to the student a fact and proves him that it works and connects with the concpets he has learned. i.e: 1+1=2, this is a fact and with this fact we can show that one candy plus another one equals to two candies, it is a proof for the concepts of adding numbers together and the childrens will appreciate it.

Some facts can be seen or even touched that helps a person appreciate the concepts he has learned. It also can make a person, personnal contentment grow to show facts on what he has learned and showing that he knows what he is talking about.

Sometimes we learn facts but we don't fully understand the idea or concept that is hidden. This is why i am strongly convinced that understanding ideas and concepts is linked with learning facts and that it is important for a student to get both informations.One without the other is not useful.
