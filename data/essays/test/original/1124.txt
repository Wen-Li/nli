There are two types of reaching success. The first is to do all the things in the way that is desired by the community as well as possible and do them always most efficiently. Alternatively you can try to act innovatively and handle risks with courage. That is the way I prefer. So I agree to the statement, that the way to (better) success is the way of innovation and risk taking. I identify the reason for the implication "better" in two dimensions: On one hand the temporal dimension is to be researched. Eternal dealing with well-known strategies might be efficient for a certain time, but after some time boredom will certainly appear. As soon as a way of acting loses its potential to surprise it will be desired to be replaced by something new - especially in the fast renewing community we are living in in the 21st century. People are constantly asking for new, more, innovative input. So keeping acting in one scheme for too long will send you automatically into a state of being uninteresting and all the success of the time of social loafing is decreasing rapidly.
Anyway, the second dimension of quality in innovative processes is building upon the first one. Kept strategies do not only bore somewhen but also lose the ability of self-reflection. A product or strategy that had worked for years might be caught by new, smaller, more simple products who have still a view for the consumers' needs and not already lost in self-adorement.
Let's take Microsoft and Apple as example: For a long time Microsoft was the number one software distributor in the world. With their operating system "Windows" as their flagship they walked a well-known path of software development. However, one day Apple sneaked silently onto the market and from one day to the next their computers and software solutions were as regarded as never before. Their strategy was the permanent review of the consumers' needs and the possibly own mistakes. Only through this ability to reflect the own product permanently made them now the new number one. 
Big might be powerful - but small is, on long distance, more effective. Without investment into innovation and without some acceptance of risk success is no effect of duration. Always reflect your own mental models and you are going to be (for long time) able to succeed in what you do.
