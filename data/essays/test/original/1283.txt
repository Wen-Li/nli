They are two differents points of vue about the increas numbers of cars in twenty years.
First, on ecology vision, it will be fewer car in the futur. 
In fact cars reject so much pollution than gouvernements and ecology associations will try to find new solutions or will create many taxes in order to reduce polution.
Probably they will so develop common transport as bus, train or subway and taking plane will be probably cheaper in the futur.
Petrol's price continue to increase because of it's a rarelly ressource and it will be necessary to decrease numbers of cars to limited the consommation and control natural ressource as gaz and petrol.

But car manufacturers invest many money to develop new technologies specialy to reduce gaz emission and develop new engine which use new energy as biology fioul or electricity.
So people will change their mind and continue more and more to use personnal car.
We can see in car manufacturers new car's category. In fact, sizes of new this new category is smallest so need more car to drive people.
The size of towns and distances between both will be biger, and movement for professionnel and personnel environnemet will be more important. So it will be necessary to move more and more and to use many cars than today.
