Nowadays, people especially students have to handle with a very fast moving environment. 
This led to a new conception of the word competence : according to my mind, it is interesting to have a specialization in a particular field but also to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects.
Let me explain that vision through several examples.

Companies focus on finding managers who are able to integrate very specific technical action methods, but they also require people who have a broad culture and are able to behave in many different situations and thus to adapt themselves to the environment and to each particular professional situations. 

In addition, business schools and universities insist on offering students not only the possibility to develop a real specific speciality but also the opportunity to diversify their curriculum. To illustrate that meaning, I would like to underline that in my school students have to choose a speciality [for instance marketing, finance, logistics...] and to complete their program with general management courses.
This shows that schools aim to form people who will be able to evoluate during their carreer by developing different competences.

The environment is moving and is definetely unstable in our era.
Many people began to work in a domain and then had to change to a completely different field which justifies the need of broad competences.
This was not the case thirty or fourty years before.

Having a broad knowledge also helps people to be recognized by others : someone who knows a very large range of things will always be admired by others and be able to reach a decent position in the society moving in different circles , whereas someone only focused in one topic will rapidly bore other people.

To conclude, I wanted to say that the best thing to succeed in life is to establish the balance between speciality and broad knowledge combined with a close awareness of the environment that is surrounding us.
