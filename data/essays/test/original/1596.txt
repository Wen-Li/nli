I disagree with the statement. Indeed, advertisements make product seem better than they really are because it is the purpose of the advertisement, but I think, for most people, they don't seem "much" better than the reality.
     First, advertisements today emphasize more on their good images than the capacity or functions themselves. For example, an avertisement of shampoo which show that a famous actress use it improve their image but don't indicate the function is much better than other ones. An dvertisement of soft drink show just image of cool feelings but it don't say it is much better. 
     Secondly, most advertisements can't make products much better than they really are because most poeple know that most  advertisements include exaggeration. For example, even if an advertisements of an airline show that a man on a first class seat sleeps well, poeple don't mislead because people know that the noise of airplanes and the fact that few people can afford to buy tickets of first class. For example of shampoo above, most ladies know they can not be as beautiful and charming as the actress even if they use the shampoo.  Moreover, consumer can get more information on the Internet directly from other consumers nowadays. They are no longer ripped off. 
       Third, here in Japan, the law forbids false advertisements including too much exaggeration and too misleading expressions. I think it is the same in many other countries. The Japanese government became more concerned about protecting consumers. Recently, the directors of the company which make the false advertisement showing that everyone can easily their weight by their suppliments. The people demands companies moral about advertisements more rigorously than the past. 
      That' why I disagree the statement.
