 Nowadays, people are used to do a lot of activities when they are young. Different countries have different ways of teaching and educating young people. We will thirst see that a broad knowledge of many academic subjects is benefic, then we will talk about the problems implied by this method and finally, we will discuss of the necessity of having a specilisation when you graduate.

    I think that children need to be taught everything. Even if they are not experts on everything they know, it is necessary to have a minimum of general culture. This will help them considerably when they will be older. Plus, in order to choose what they want to do, they have to know various topics, various worlds and civilsations and all the most they need to be open minded.
    However, some students lack motivation and interest in what they are being told. Either there is too much subjects for them to handle or they simply don't want to learn. Therefore it is wise to take these children to more specialized schools so that they can fell less excluded and useless. It is often seen that parents, who want their children to be the best, push them to learn music, do some sport, to work hard on their homeworks.. This is too much to handle for most of the children and they can be disgusted by everything. That's why we should try to reconcile pupils and students with some specific academic subjects.
    Besides, althought a broad knowledge is useful and advantageous, working people only use a very tiny part of what they know for their job. There is currently no use to know eveything because there are always other people who know how to do what you don't. So why not be more specialized and have better workers on all subjects. Eventually, everybody could gather their work and contribute to the global evolution of the society.

    To conclude, I could say that it is better to specialize in one specific subject because otherwise it is difficult to find an interesting job and the more people specialize, the more jobs are created. That really helps society to improve.
