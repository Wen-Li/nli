I completely agree to the statement that successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well.In my opinion only when you try new things you will be able to learn new things. 
         One of the most successful person we have today is Mr.Bill Gates .Had he been content with what he had and what he knew,this era of information technology would have been unheard of.But because of this change he brought,he not only benefitted himself but also the entire world.Small,under developed countries are developing at a faster rate because of this technology.
           Trying new things is very challenging and is often considered a gamble espesially when large sum of money is invested.It goes without saying that monetary gains are very crucial in any business.So people often refrain from taking risks.But it is very important to take risks when you want to try something new.Lets consider a simple example of a small shopkeeper.The shopkeeper can allure customers only when he has a very good range,quality and a variety of products.If he is ready to take a risk  and store products as per the customers' satisfaction he'll be largely profitted by this.His business will be successful.
            Even when you consider in the field of science,most of the theories proposed by the successful scientists were not approved in early stages.But the zest to do something new has kept them going and got them all the accolades they have  won.
