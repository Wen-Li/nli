I disagree with the idea that traveling in a group led by a guide is best. I think traveling with tour guide doesn't make me grow and sometimes feel bored. 
  First of all, in the case of traveling with tour guide, we don't need to make a schedule or book the hotel. But these kind of efforts make my ability of arrangement grow. For example, my job is examination to the bank, and I have to go to the province every each month. So I'm required to arrange the shedule, like booking the tickets or hotels. At that time, I feel that my experience which I traveled in many provinces of Japan for a month in my college's day. At that time, I arrange the tour myself.
  Secondly, traveling with tour guide don't make me  effort ot learn about the directions. In the case of traveling without guide, I have to learn about the directions to choose where I'll go to see. The knowledge gotten through scheduling the tour sometimes help me. For example, when I analyse of certain bank's business model, the knowlege about that bank's business erea is required. I have helped by the knowledge which I got through the tour scheduling many times.
  Thirdly, traveling with tour guide reduce the fun of the toravel because sometimes I cannot go where I want to see. Especially in my case, I'm interested in the Japanese castle and want to concentrate seeing the castle in my travel, but I have never found such specialized traveling tour. Also there are many cases the tour company affiliated with the suvenior shops and take the tourist to these shops in the tour. For example, I have ever joined in these kind of goup tour, and I was required to spend half of the tour time in the meager shops. I felt bored and even affliciton.
  For these reasons, I thought traveling without tour guide is best. It gives me more knowledge, experience, and movement.
