Risk is what makes people prosper. Without risk we would always be doing the same thing and having the same routine. People have to take risks to be acknowledge and to be respected, without it you would be a nobody without the courage to fight for what you want, always having people stepping on you, eventhough you are smarter and do their work.

As in  the legend of Sundiata from African culture. Sundiata was the king's son that could not walk until he was seven years old, he did not had the necesity to walk, eventhough he was not going to be the successor of his father's crown. One day his mother was insulted and nothing could have her gain her hoor again, unless Sundiata could bring her himself some leaves. He took the risk of walking at age seven to please her mother and by this fulfilling the profesy. Then he became the king of his kingdom, and he was a just and brave leader. As the time passed a new threat arrived, the sorcerer king of Sossa, who wanted to conquer evrything including his father's kingdom. Sundiata confronted him and defeated his army. The sorcerer king was never heard of again. Meanwhile Sundiata went to the Sorcerer king's capital Sossa to destroy it. By razing it's capital, Sundiata became the legend he is today. Without taking the risk of walking Sundiata could not had done all his heroic deeds and would be without the ability to walk the rest of his life.

As Sundiata teaches us, we have to take risks to change our life and the world. Risks are essential in our life. We have to take them everyday, with every challenge we encounter during the day. We must take them with courage and knowledge to be sure we made the right thing to do for our completion of our goals.
