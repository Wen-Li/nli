I beleive that learing facts and understanding concepts & ideas are correllated, and all are important for students to learn. However, this importancy might vary among the differrent levels of study. 
For example, while teaching students in the very early years of school, study should concentrate more in teaching facts, besides basic concepts that would be easy for students to understand.
On the other hand, for higher level of classes, ideas and concepts should be studied more, since students' minds will be more able to analyze and understand the differrent concepts and ideas.

Concepts and ideas are used to of analyzing facts; their reasons, their viability, development of facts.. etc.
Basically, it's too important for students to understand causes and reasons of facts, but they should be fully understanding what is the fact all about. 

Teaching fact should be prior of teaching concepts. For example, it is important to teach students about gravity and emphasize that they are fuly aware about it, then they should study the concept of gravity law which was made by newton.
If study was only concentrating in teaching concepts and ideas without illustrating the fact, students will feel that they are lost.

It is also to be noticed that many concepts and ideas can be available for one certain fact. Therefore, study should start with illustrating the fact, and then teaching the various concepts and ideas on it. It is too important for students to be aware of all concepts and ideas, to understand the principle & purpose of each.
Students will get a brilliant ideas on how to think and analyze by studying the differrent concepts. This will make their minds to work more and will help them to manage and organize their analysis in cases they face in their future.

As a conclusion, studying facts is too important to clarify it to students, and teaching concepts & ideas is also too important for many major reasons.
