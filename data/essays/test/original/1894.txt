i agree that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are the reasons for having that opinion are

advertisements are intended to introduce a newproduct which not aware for the consumers .advertisements will give the description about the product .advertisements give an analysis of the efficiency of the product by comparing with other products which are using presently by the consumers .they will convince us to buy that product 
if person is satisfied with product he feels it is an necessary to watch advertisements.

consumers are now a days attracted to the advertisements .they dont know the quality of product until unless they will use it .but in oldendays  .a person  in avilage uses one product introduced in the market .if the person satisfied with that product the person will recommend that product to other person .this process goes on and ends with  all persons in that vilage owns that product .the generations before are very careful about money 

advertisements is a  very commercial and costly process .it involves spending a large amount of money  by the company .because most of the advertisements will cast by  celebrities who demands crores of rupees for single advertisement .the company will left enough  money which  will affects on the quality of the product .so they are comprimising on the quality of the product 

advertisements are  telecasted mainly  to influence children .most of children are attracted due to the animations used in the advertisements .they are forcing their parents to buy that product because they like the ads very much .with out caring much about the product the parents are willing to buy that product
