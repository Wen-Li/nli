of course ,alone traveling has lot of adventage that if i want to stay in this place, i can stay for a long time , and i can feel freedome
but if i have opportunity to travel. i prefer to travel is in a group led by a tour gide
first of all. when i arrive strangth place, i feel dangerous there.
because  i don't know every thing, even their languege.
so when i trevel whith grop. i will feel sefety 
and if i have dangerous situation, i recieve halp from other people
i can't feeling lonely aslo
when i travel abroad alone , i got stolen my bag. at that time . i was embaressing so i didn't think anything. i felt loney 
if i travel with other people then the same situation happen again
i can solve this problem easily and i don't feel isolate 
in addition guide knowes this place very well. so i can save my time and energe even money. i can understand everything -culture, history-easily 
when i went to japan for trip alone. i didn't know every thing
for instance, i don't know that how rided the bus, and metro
where i was stay domitory. where was the best place to see
so i must be spend lot of time on the rout, i was cheated form shop's owner . as a result. i lost my memey and chance of viewing other place
then, when i showed some structure, i didn't understanding because the board has japan's strupture
although japanesse were very kind . i remained regret 
in this reason, i would rather  to travel is in a grop led bu a tour guide than to travel alone
although i give up feeling of freedom. it is better economical than waste
