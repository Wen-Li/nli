Like the elderly people say: The world has been changed.  Nowadays people are more busy with their jobs and themselves. Everyone is complaning about something which they have faced with, but they are not listening to others about what they are complaining. The new generation, the young people are the best example of people who applies this kind of behavior: They are the most changed and most adapted to new world, afterall.
    We all see teenagers when traveling by buses, railroads or another another means of transport: they all wear earphones and listen to their own music. If a burglar steals the bag of the man who walks behind them, they will not even recognise this event happened. This is a simple example of teenagers became unaware and indifferent of their communities.
    We also see many other situations which teenagers take part in: A college student is on a bus which is full, but he has a seat, he has worn all of his brend new clothes, probably he is going to meet some of his friends and go to the cinema or have fun in a some different way. An old woman gets on the bus, she has a limp, she walks really slow and she hardens herself to walk as quickly as she can for not to wait the bus. There is no vacant seat so she is standing. The boys recognises the woman, but he is pretending like he is unaware of her getting on the bus, just to keep on sitting.
    The worst of all, young generation is quite unaware of that is happening around the world, or even in their country. Even celebrities. As it is asked to Britney Spears that if she is supporting the war between America and Iraq, she says `If president Bush supports it, it is OK`. She does not even have her own argument about such a big event!
    To sum up, the world keeps changing, but the path it follows does not seem bright. There is a thing must be done: This genereation must be helped to realize that the world is living and also they are living in this living world. Humanity is a society, and a society has to share many things together. As all people combined themselves in such a way,  people, especially young people cannot behave so selfish.
