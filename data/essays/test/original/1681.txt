I agree that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities because new generations are become more unresponsable. I can support my opinion with the following reasons>
First of all nowadays young people spend too much time to attend the schools and they study a lot of subjects. One example to support the first reason is that young people such as students have to study much more subjects than before therefore they can't spend enough time to helping other people. Another example is that there are some young people that have no time because they whether studying and working.
The second reason to support my opinion implies the young people that think only about theirself.
For example most young people think that buying a lot of things is the best way to feel good. I don't think so. I think that these are superficial peolpe.
Other people think only about enjoy theirself and anything else.
They prefer spend all their spare time driving expensive cars or getting in the disco.
I believe that young peolpe nowadays dont give enough time to helping their communities because they don't care about the problems of other people. I think that if everyone give little of own time, It is possible improve the relationship among people.
