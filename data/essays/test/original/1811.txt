   Being a student is not a professional situation since any students can not earn money from his or her knowedge. Because of this, students sometimes can't concentrate on what to emphasise in their lives. However in time they realise what is the most important thing about their eduction life. But this awareness may occur lately and that will ruin the person's life badly. I definetely belive that, it is more important for students to learn facts rather than understand ideas and concepts. I observed people around me and see that people use their knowledge in their business and daily life. In addition a person without an expertise and full of ideas doesn't mean anything to people.
   First of all, being a student is the first step into business life and in business life you are nothing without facts and scientific reasons. I see that business life is full of stress and difficulties and the only way to beat these difficulties is the facts that learnt in the school life. As an employee or a manager a person should show all the signs of his or her expertise, in order to handle things properly. I am sure that ideas and concepts are not enough to maintain your position in a company, hovewer facts will bring you the way of succeding. I have  involved a number of companies as a traniee and saw that all the people working as managers are the people that know everything that they should know.
   Secondly being full with facts is an important issue in daily life too. Rather than being  workers; people became mothers, fathers, neigbours and etc. And people around you will look for the facts that you can give to them. For instance a mother can not grow her child with ideas and concepts, nonetheless she will use certain facts of life to make her child more interested. It is not imaginable that a mother is preventing her little child from the stove by telling him concepts about heat, she shows the result of the heat, she shows the facts. Or does it make any sense to talk about ideas on a conversation between a neighbour about the apartments water channel?
   In conclusion, life is the art of handling the harsh conditions and the only way to do is the facts you have. So i think a student should get concentrated on the facts that presented in their education life. That will bring happiness in both business and daily life.
