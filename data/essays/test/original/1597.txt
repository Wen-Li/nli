I agree that advertisements make products seem better than they are.Usually the companies use  advertisements before they release the product into the market  to introduce the product into the public and the public get attracted to the new product and feel that the new product could do better than older ones.But in many of the cases this estimation could be wrong.advertisements indicates 100% results of the products.where as when they are really used probably the results could not be upto the expectation.and there are many examples for this which includes fairness creams,slimming centres and many more.the advertisements of fairness creams is best example for my opinion.In these advertisements the products when used completely chances the complextion of the person who is using it andthis really doesnt happen.also the slimming capsules or centre do not show the drastic change when really used.their are many examples for which advertisements makes the products seem better than they appear.hence advertisements is one of the way for the company to increase the profits of the product.In some cases advertisements cheat public by not showing the best result as shown in it.advertisements only makes profits to the company but in no way to the public.According my opinion advertisements are no where good for the company to spend huge amount of money on them.so they are just an aditional expenditure for the company.If advertisements really make profits to the company it specifies that the public have cheated because no product gives the results shown in the advertisements.the products usually does contain the qualities shown or displayed in the advertisements.adverisements just make the streets and news papers colourful but nothelp in any other manner to increase the profits.so according to me companies shouldnt waste thier money and time on advertisements.
