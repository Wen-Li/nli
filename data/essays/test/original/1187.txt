I totally agree whith the statement that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are, for many reasons. It is the goal of a good advertisement to do it, and they have lot of techniques to manage it. 

The goal of people who make the advertisement is to sell the product. 
So they need to present it in a way as better as possible. For instance, for an advertisement for food on the television,  they will broadcast the advertisement before dinner time, and it will be exposed the item in such a way that you will want to purchase eat immediatly.
But  then when you have your product, you are often desappointed, because it seemed to you that it tasted better on the screen. All people have seen  advertisements for coffee. On the television, you have the impression that you will have a lot of cream in you coffee. But when you prepare it alone, the effect is never the same.

Futhermore, marketing managers know lot of techniques to present well the produces. They will use some software as photoshop, which allowed  to highlight the advantages of the item. The item is almost always replaced in a context. For example, for an advertisement for a soda we will see a woman who drink a soda on the beach. Thus. the product seems always better on the adevertisement. Moreover, for a paper advertisement, they will will place the item in the good place, in order that you focus at it directly, when you look at the picture.


However, consumers are not so stupid. We take into account the fact that the reality can be different than the advertisenents, and we do not except for having exactly the same thing on our hands and on the TV.
