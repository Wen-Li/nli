      During your college courses, teacher teach you dufferent subjects, After when you go to university you have to know which sort of matters do you prefer and you have to think about orientation you would like to go and the environment where you think you will be able to work. So broad knowledge of many academic subjects can have advantage but also disavantage.

To introduce my opinion, i would like to start speaking about the reaons for not choosing to specialise and to prefer to learn diiferents subjects.
when you didn't know what you want to study or  which university will be better for you, you are a person uncertain about his futur but you have to take a decision. In this case it will be better for you to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize because of the laks of information you have about what you want to do.
Next, it can be interesting to have different knowledge if you consider the fact that you can be polyvalent.
For esample if you work for an export companie which is a very little companie and that you are the manager you will have knowledge about accounting and not alone in marketing and management.
In this case, you will be better valued and it will be better for you to have differents competences and differents skills.

In an other hand, we can say that it's important for people to specialize when they know exactly the job they would like to do in their futur after school.
this case can be expressed by this example. a man who zant to specialize in architecture will learn how to dessine, plans, mathematics.. for him studying  music it's not neccessary
Moreover, in France, for esample jobs who didn't find people to work in are generally specialize jobs such as electriciens, plombiers..
For those jobs, which are manuals work learning another subject that those in which you need is unuseful.


As a conclusion, to answer to the question about the better to choose to specialize or not, i will answer that it depend what you are looking for, the subject you like, subject you want to discover or subject you need for your work... All that question are important before doing your choice. Nevertherless, you have to take account that now, in our society  you have to be polyvalent and to be able to change work and to have a lot of knowledge in different matters to succeed. In fact a good manager is someone who can show his ability to changing quickly and with efficiency  environment.
