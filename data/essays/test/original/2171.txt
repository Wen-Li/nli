For me it is a lot more important that students undestand ideas and concepts because with that the can formulate or have their own concepts if we are talking in an specific subject. If the student just learn facts, according to my point of view they are only memorycing that fact, they are only repeating and repeating the word until they finally remember that word. But what is the point of doing that if he is only memorycing and not learning (the main importance of any school) 

I do sometimes memorice things for my exams and to tell about my own experience, that things that I was studing the next 2 days I completelly forgot all of the things I was studying for my exam. 

If we adopt this way of studing, about only memoricyng, later that will make a problem for other  of the clases that the student is coursing, I had some of those problems.

Of course this is something the teacher are in some ways responsable of. Some of the teachers does not leave homework to their students, they just wait till the exam shows and he just tell the kids to study. For me homework is very important (however this does not sounds good for many of the students) to make students have their own analicys and could do things by their own, like for example thing by their own, not only to responce of what the teacher said.

Also it is very important that, during the class seasion students can be allow to participate as many times they want to. To make something like a discussion on class, for example a topyc about some students are agree with and some are not. But finally make an equal conclusion, of course one that the teacher could make the last idea and of course the better idea. But not taking out the students ideas. 

The thing here is that students learn something and by doing that they necessary has to have their own points of view.
