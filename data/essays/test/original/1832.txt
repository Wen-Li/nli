I firmly agree with the statatement that 'It is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialise in one specific subject' 
Real life encompasses diverse aspects and its is not possible t0 deal with them with the knowledge of just one. A person with kowledge in numerous fields will always be better equipped to handle real life situations than a person specialising in only one field. Specialisaton in a particular academic subject cripples the mind and confines the intellect to a bounded region.  It prevents the mind to develop in more profound ways. By specialising in one area, one is bound to gain, but only in one direction. Minds remaining facultioes are wasted and left unexplored.
Also, academic subjects are more or less theoretical. I personally believe that no student has had enough exposure to decide with surity what he wants to do later in life. I will like to illustrate this pont with an example. Lets consider a student very intersested in the sciences. He does a chemistry major and becomes a researcher. But after becoming a researcher he realises that he doesnot like the redundant and mundane laboratory procedures. He doesnot want to continue with his work. But with only the knowledge of chemistry, it is not possible for him to do anything else. He is now stuck in a profession  that he doesnot like for life.
 But suppose he had also acquired the knowledge of marketing or informaton technology or any other field for that matter, he would definitely have been able to improve upon his situation.
Life is all about growing and experiencing. The more we learn in life, the more we grow - not only intellectually but also spiritually. The knowledge of myriad subjects doesnot only make us a scholar but also makes us more aware of everything that life has to offer and we are able to appreciate it in a more complete way. 
A broad knowledge of multiflarious academic subjects puts us in a better position to take a decision of what we want to do further in life.  It brings in greater adaptability as well as greater oppotunities. The specialision can be brought in at a professional level.
