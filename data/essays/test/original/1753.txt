The youth of today is the future of tomorrow. Keeping this saying in mind, I strongly contradict the opinion that "young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities." To support my claim, I would like to provide examples of a charity school and an incident I witnessed on the road.
I am aware of a charity school that is run entirely by people within the ages of eighteen to twenty- five. These young men and women come to school every evening for two hours to teach and instruct children who are not privileged enough to receive a formal education. They also instruct the children in extra curricular activites such as dance and music. In my opinion they are opening a number of doors for these children by providing them with an education free of cost and are saving the children from a life of poverty. The education these children have accquired, however less it may be, will help them to secure a job which in turn would ensure them a livelihood. In this, one cannot say that the youth of today is not helping society.
I often walk on the streets of the city in which I live. Once I noticed an old man trying to cross the road. He was rather hesitant and visibly scared but no one came to his aid. To my astonishment, I saw a young girl of not more than 16 years, come up to him and help him cross the road. 
These are two of the numerous incidents which, made me think that our prejudice against the youth of today is not completely valid. There are still the young men and women who devote time to their communities hoping to help people and better their lives.
