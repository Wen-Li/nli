   Many people claim that it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts that it is for them to learn facts. I think it is not the case for many reasons like reliability , validity,even from the theories.
   For general ,most ideas and concepts we learned come from the books and newspapers , so most of the information is recorded as theories which could not provides us reliable infomation. And students would not cofirm the reliability until they saw the facts.For example, we heard about the theory about the market strategy from the textbooks, but we could not be sure that the theory works in the real world, and we have to apply those theory in our jobs or volunteer careers to see its reliability. 
  Secondly the ideas and concepts in the books could sometime be out of date, the students could hardly find a book talks about most fashionable design for now in the library and they have to go online and check the website ,see the picture and had a clear ideas with the valid information.And the real world now provide us for convenient ways to learn facts , from the TV programs, Internet,even from other's experience.
  Furthermore , techniquely speaking, from many test in the labs we confim the facts that pictures  images and facts  could bring more fresh memory rather than the understanding of ideas and concepts.That means it would be more impressive for us when we saw the fact.
   In a word , we could gain our understading of ideas and concepts form the facts we learned, the procees of analysising those fact could impress our understanding. So I claim that It is  more important for students to learn facts than to understand ideas and concepts.
