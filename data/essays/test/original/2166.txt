I agree with the statement says about "Successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well" I think that some one who knows about succes, will be not happy in doing something already know how to do well.

 We are human. In every one, i think there is something in mind, witch want stronglly a succes. if we got a succes in certain category and do that work for 15 years, one day, i'm sure that we will have a mind that we want to see more far and high and will start to try to get another succes in other category. For example there is a competition like an olympic. One player won man's 100m. He got a succes. But he will not say that "i'm very happy to win so it's finish to me."if  the player is me i'll resister for 100m huddle,200m and 400m maybe for a maraton too.to get another succes and to be more famous in this category.

second resons is if we know about succes,we can't stop to go on. we can do everything even we fail. Because it's so good.The sansation is undiscriptable when you got a succes more than when you fail.Have a succes, is a dream of everybody.for this reason i think that peoples lives to get a succes because with succes we can live with out many problem. Idon't said that we don't have problems when we got a succes but we can control more easly the problem because somebody with succes will be more cool than somebody who is running to get a succes.

For these two reasons i'am agree with the statement and i hope strongly, one day i'll know about sansation of succes.
