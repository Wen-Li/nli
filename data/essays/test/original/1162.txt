Humans are social animals. This saying has been true from the time immemorial. Individuals needs society as much as the society needs individuals. Its a symbiotic concept which has been a gospel truth and would remain so,for the generations to come. It is expected from each and every member of the society to contribute towards the growth and development of their community and society. Young people form a significant portion of the society. It is a disappointing fact that recent years have witnessed, a remarkable decrease in contribution from this younger lot towards their community. Well, i completely agree to this unfortunate decline in younger generation's enthusiasm towards their community. 

This remarkable decrease in partcipation from the younger generation is quite evident from the fact that there are hardly any youngesters helping in old age homes, destitue centers, orphanages. These growing up kids are least bothered about the current events going on around their community and neighborhood. They are like silk worms who are happy in their own cocoons, their self made protected world where they enjoy their life and are not answerable to anyone. Very rare do we come across volunteers who raise their voice for a social cause or for the benefits of people at large. 

There can be many reasons, which have made the younger generation so apathetic towards community service.First and foremost reason given by these young people is the paucity of time.Earlier generation was more active in community welfare programs, because they had ample of time after their day's work. This era has witnessed an all time high in the mass media propogation,electonic media through advancement in Information and technology and many such things. The younger people who are impressionable at this age, tend to get distracted with so many avenues of utilising their free time. There is internet, gaming parlors, online chatting, blogging etc etc..the list just goes on. They find so little time to themselves, that they are unwilling to go and do some community service. On weekends these people consider to socialise in discs and parties with their college buddies rather than spending a quiet evening in an orphanage.

Well, blaming it all on the younger generation wouldn't be a fair judgement to pass. There has been a tremendous rise in the competitiveness all around. The students have to slog right from their school days to college days to get admissions in the universities of their choice. The pressure of studies has become so tremendous that these people really fall short of 24 hours. Also these kids are brought up in such protective environments that they really don't feel the need to stand up for the community cause. Everything is readily available to these students.

For a society to progress, it is important that the younger generation shows an active interest in development of the society as a whole and rise up from the concept of individual progress. Only then we can all expect a more humane and better place to live in.
