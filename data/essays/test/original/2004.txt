There is an argument concernign about whether products seem much better that  they really are is made by most advertisements. Although it is true that advertisements can help to people who buy some products, i believe that most advertisements is not always as advantegeous as our lives.

Most of all, many people have damages because some advertisements are not true. Some advertisements decieve their client inorder to sell more their products. For example, when i was a freshman in university, i bought a mp3 player that is advertised many places. By the advertisement, the mp3 player should get 1000 musics. However, i was able to get 800 musics, instead of 1000 musics. So, i complained the mp3 player to the company. They said that the advertisement is not true. In this respect, most  people can get damages from not true advertisements.

Moreover,  most people spend more money because of advertisements. After most people see the advertisement, they feel the buying impetus. So, they sometimes regret their spendings. For intance, my girl griend like shopping and her hobby is shopping. When she had a bad feeling, she saw some advertisements by television, so she went to the department store and spend all of her money buying the products that is advertised by TV. Later a month, she regreted about her behavior. In this regard, some advertisement can give damages to people because of over spending.

In summary, i disgree with that most advertisements make products seem much better that they really are. This is because most people can get damages from not true advertisement as well as over spending.
