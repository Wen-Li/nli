Yes, I agree because it is unbelieveble how many cars are on our streets are nowadays. Especially in Germanz if you heard them crying over the bad job situation. On the other hand if you see on the street you can see a lot of expensive cars.
I think the most important thing why there will be much less cars on the street than today is that the oil and gas recurces getting more less and less every year. This is like a circle if the is not enough gas the price will be increase. If that happend less people will buy a car Because it is too expensive to drive it. That will be the biggest reason why there less cars in the future.
The only way to stop is to find a new recurces with which cars can drive, too like the bio gas or the sloar the sun energie. Here is the next problem to find alternatives you have to look for new techologies. That's very expensive, too. If the poeple don't like the new stuff zou waste a lot of money for nothing. I think a lot of companys are littel bit scared to finace into new products aslong there are still the old recuces. 
An ohter factor is that the people have a certain life standart and thez don't wonna leave it. It's the same with me I have my car with some extras which can drive 250 km per hour. It's very hard to change this life standart if you grow up with it. 
There are some ways I had explain what could the companys do to sell there cars in the future but I don't believe in it. Everz companz what to make as much money as possible at the moment and I don't think the are thinking that much about the future.
