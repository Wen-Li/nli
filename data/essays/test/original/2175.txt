Successful people are generally differs from the other groups of the public because they take more risks and they don't just repeat the same things again and again. They always try harder for creating new things because to be succesful you need to be unique in what you do. 
    Successful people always try to reach to the impossible. Their ideas are way more differen than others. For example the creators of "google" makes an unique internet site which no one ever thinks. The creators are just 30 years old but their minds are much older. Their thoughts could be seen as crazy for average people hence they have kept on thinking. 
    Successful people also try to renovate their visions. They don't stick with the same thing, they make comparison of ideas for the best solution. Let's say a known chef of a famous restaurant , he/she can not repeat serving same foods, he/she should think of new styles and cuisines for the customers. If he repeats himself/herself he/she is not regarded as an unique chef. He/She have to come up with new ideas all the time to be successful.
    Another issue is they should know the future aspects for people. They have to think of innovations about everything. Not only they should proof they can do better but also they should show that they can improve their vision continuously.
    The people who are doing only what they can do best and never changes their styles are not seen as successful because they don't use their capacity effectively. They should take more risks to improve and change the original thougths. Only by this way they can stand out in the public, as a result their ideas become famous and approved.
    To sum it all up, successful people are the ones who always try to do the best and changes the vision of the others. They don't just do what they already know, they improve it with new ideas.
