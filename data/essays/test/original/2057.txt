According to me there are reasons that support this statement and reasons that don't.

Trying new things is a good idea mainly because also if you can do very well something, you must know that there will always be somebody that can do the same thing better and faster than you. This must push you not to be always stable on your idea, but to be opened to change, to be faster in adapating to this "rapid changing" world. For examples, in electronics business technologies are in a very fast evolution (according to new discoveries and researches), and if you doesn't support change, probably your succes will come to an end. Another reason for what change is good is the concept of "new idea". Customers are interested in a product for a serie of characteristics of the object and among them there is the importance of NEW. New things attract people as well as well-done things. Using the situation of electronics business, you can say that innovativity is one of the most impostant aspects that make a customer choose a product instead of another or that push him to a certain way of living is free time, for instance.

On the other side, leaving a route to take another you don't know where it goes isn't always a good choise. In fact if you are strong in a business, it would take a risk for you to begin a new "business-path", because you can lose part of your money or even lose the carismatic importance you've got in a certain field of the business world. In a conservative view of business, leaving the old route (or giving more importance to new things) can be destructive: it costs you a lot of money (new technologies, researches...) and, of course, you can't know how your new business area can evolve.

But looking at all these points, I think that in our society, with so much changes in action, an economical politic of renewing things and smart "gambling" is absolutely needed. This image of the SMART GAMBLER is, according to me, the best position that successful people must assume: someone who has to take strong decisions without forgetting that reason has to be the background of his behaviour. 
We need gamblers. Without them, our modern society is going to fall down in a terrible hole of routine and inerthia (dead calm).
