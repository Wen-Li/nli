     NO FUEL_NO ROADS_NO CARS
    People would not be able to breathe after twenty years due to pollution and we think of cars."dust dust everywhere,no trees for oxygen,a big hole in o-zone" are enough to make my view clear that cars would be extinct from the world in near future.cars running on petrol and diesels would not get fuel for their startup.
    Today in the present era,the consumption of fuel and energy is so rampant that within no time our world would be xhausted from all what god has given us.The foremost thing required to run cars is the fuel which is depleating day by day.The indiscriminate logging of wood for our selfish motives would also become a decisive factor for the future of vehicles in the world.
    Scientists have evolved a new concept of solar cars running on solar energy but i have a question for all of tham that what willl be the ue of cars once situations arise for pertaining your own survival.The increasing pollution due to dangerous gasses emitted by cars would be the cause of their demice.The roads are built after industrialisation on the places where forests prevailed.tThese things would ultimately lead to the damage of society.
    The ozone layer has got a big hole which emits harmfull ultraviolet waves straight to us from sun.once these waves start flowing,even solar cars would be of no use.
    The cars newly made to run on gas are actively and highly inflamable where a bit of error can cause life sufferings.These gasses are also depleting due to their extensive use.Thus virtually there will be no way out.
    I would personally like to suggest the use of cycles and public transport means which would increase the life span of vehicles reducing pollution and preserving resources.
    Thus concluding this topic,i would like to take a note to all scientists to prepare ways in which the earth can be saved and not the increment in cars.The depletion of resources surely would end up the era of cars.a fewer would also be difficult to be sought out.
