I do believe that successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well.  Many reasons explain that is.  Among them certainly figure the importance of motivation in one's success and how risky experiences often turn out to be very positive.

I firmly believe that people are much better at doing what they are passionate about than at what they are not.  Motivation is an important factor in people's general performance in their occupation.  Doing things we know how to do well is certainly very compfortable.  However, that often becomes redundant, not to say boring.  We then lose interrest for what we do, and our performance begins to decrease.  Successful people will not accept to stay in such a state and will try new things even if they are risky.  It brings challenge to what they do, which is very motivating.  That puts one back on the track of success.  A good example of that is my friend Dominique's.  Until mid-2007, she was a Pharmaceutical Representative.  She was even rated first Pharmaceutical Representative in Canada by Novartis in 2005.  Over time, she started finding he work repetitive and challengeless.  Rapidly, her sales went down sharply.  That is why she decided to resign to persue a new goal.  That is how she became a Physical Education Teacherin August 2007.  She left her employement security with her easy routine behind to explore new avenues.  Dominique is now very successful at her new job and keeps being given excellent evaluations by her employer.  This clearly show that successful people are open to living new experiences.  It highly motivates them.

Other than that, it can easily be seen that participating in new ventures is beneficial for individual growth.  Living new experiences rather than continuing to do what we know how to do well allows us to enhance our knowledge.  An example of this could be the arrival of technology in an accounting company.  Even if no specific reason is calling for change in work methods because they always turned out to do fine, shifting to computerized work is desirable.  Companies, even if they found the change was risky because their employee were more likely to make accuracy mistakes with a new system than with the older one, decided to go on with it.  They quickly realized that their efficently augmented steadily and significantly because of that change.  That is the key of success.

In brief, successful people don<t relie on what they know but t
