Success is, for a person, what he defines it to be. To succeed, a person might resort to use tried and tested ways, which have little risk and a fair chance of success. Another way is to risk it all and try new things. I agree with the statement. Successful people try new things and take risks rather than doing what they already know how to do well.
Pioneers are people who are first in doing something. Pioneers have done what is new and that which hasnt been done before. Pioneers wouldn't be pioneers if they were not willing to risk it in doing something that wasn't done before. To support my stand, i would like to use the example of Dhirubhai Ambani, the founder of reliance group of industries. He was a person who took whatever risks were requred and made it big. He knew that by doing what he was doing, he could never become succesful, alhough he did it well. He decided to try his luck and he risked it all by trying new businesses. The result was tremendous success. Once someone attains success in a field, it doesnt take time for the others to catch up. In order to stand out from the crowd, to attain great success, a person mu7st be willing to come out of his "comfort-zone", and try something new, keeping in mind the risks involved. The outcome might not always be success, but it is always worth giving a shot. Doing what you know, all the time, for the rest of your life is not really an interesting prospect for me. Life becomes too monotonous. Change is always for the better and to succeed, a change is required at a certain point of time.
In my opinion, it is alright to take a risk in doing something, but one has to be sane enough to not underestimate the effects of the risk.To succeed, risks should be taken, but never to the extremes.
