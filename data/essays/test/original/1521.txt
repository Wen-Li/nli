I agree the statement because I know the successful people in the history always tried something new.
     First example is John Nash, the nobelist in the economy. Before he established his own idea Governing dynmics, "in competition individual ambitions serve the common good" is widely spread. But after his idea was penetrated to a variety of the regions, for example in the trade system and negocition, the new system has been creating more profits not only one side but also the other side.
    Second example is Nobunaga Oda, one of the many leader in Japan around 1550. He introduced an old type of guns to the war, which were never seen in the history in Japan. Actually they were difficult to use as well as very expencive. However, he established gun troops. By using it, he beated a lot of enemies and almost controled all over the Japan.
     Third example is emigrating to the United State arould 1600.
     As I describe above, great successes always acompanied with the new ideas, things and/or persons. So if you want to be successful to something, all you have to do is to find and try something new in the field.
