    I agree with this statment that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are.For example,many products start with good comortials in the tv,the radio and the internet.Many people start to buy this products after they saw the comortials;however,sometimes it's not that good like what they were saying.Some companies have another ways to sell more of their products.They start to put their products in nice covers and lovely boxs so,they can get the costmer attention.Another companies specially the food companies start to said they have the most healther food than the the other companies which is something importnant this days.Many of times,I had been bought some products and the after a while I find that it's not that good like they said before.I want to avoid this stuff but I can becuse i saw it every where in my tv or when i am walking in the street.In the other hand, I like to try new stuff that's why I like to see what is the new thing in the market and try it,but I hate in when I am brouk becuse I bought alot of thing that I don't need it in my life.Most of my time when I am hopping I tried to don't look at the new products,beucse i don't want to buy any thing more.I feel that I have many thin in my aprtment that I don't use it.I belive that not all of the advertisemnt products are that good,it's just how it look like which take your attnetion when u are shopping.I think that this there startgeis about getting the coustmer attention by let him belive that there is something special in this products than the others.I am planning to study markting for my undergraduat school;moreover,I would like to know how to sale products of mine and my company.I think the smart comanies who let u think that they have something speial in this producto more than the other which it could be hard sometimes.In summmry,I belive that the most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are.
