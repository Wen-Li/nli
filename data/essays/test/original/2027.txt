I agree with the fact that most advertisements make products seem much better than they are in reality, and I am pretty sure of it because I am a graphic designer and a lot of times my work definitively  consist in making something appear what it is not or what it should be to make people like it.
Appearance, in general, is very important in our society. 
Most of all how people appear is fondamental.
And obviously people appearance is based on what they want, what they buy, what they have...
Some of the products themselves are good. They are products of good quality, maybe handmade, valuable because of the material they are built of. But many other times they are not, and they are just presented like that. Sometimes the food with the nicest pack is the one which tastes as dog meal...but it is successfull because of its wonderful package.
In fact the package too is a type of advertisement.
The same thing can pass with a pair of shoes. Maybe on TV it is presented as if it was the most comfortable pair of shoes in the world, and everybody buys it...but after one week of use they break or they begin to be unconfortable. Sometimes advertisemnts not only make things seem better, but even different (thanks to photoshop, for example)! 
It is strange even to notice that many times people already know that one product is not so good, but they want it anyway, and this because the most important thing is to be cool, cool, cool!
I think one of the most appropriate sentences to express this topic could be the title of a song: "Smoke gets in your eyes" by "Platters". Of course it was referred to another kind of relation but the relation between consumers and the advertisements could often be expressed this way.
