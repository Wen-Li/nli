MODERN ADVERTISEMENTS- REAL OR ARTIFICIAL

Advertisements are a source of public awareness for different products available in the market. They provide us about the necessary details for use and the effect of the product. Advertisements has also gone through an era of modification. 
              "Most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are." I completely agree with this statement. In the advertisements, most of our role models endorse the products with such an art and creativity such that they create an impact of really buying them. These days ads are animated beautifully to attract plethora of youngsters. They also add  special gifts, quizes, etc to the bulk of sale. 
If we look into an example of a toothbrush, say Oral-B, we can dig deep into the advertisement field. "Oral-B has been acclaimed for its large dentist use all over the globe." This statement really impresses the public. The ads also shows the use of toothbrushes for its effectiveness. Defects like tooth decay, bad breath, gum bleeding are some common problems faced by the people, have been presented very gracefully in an animated shot. These days they show the data of sale of a particular brand of product in last few years in a statistical way. 
                                                 With view of change in the modern world, advertisement world has developed and reached upto sky-touching heights. The changing trend in the society, the upcoming of a new product, the plethora of uses has been depicted in the advertisements in a very good manner.

Thus, advertisements not only create public awareness but also do increase a sale of product to a substantial amount.
