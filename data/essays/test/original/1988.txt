I disagree with the following statement and do firmly believe that the trend of increasing number of cars, which has been in place for more than three decades now, would be reversed in a short duration of twenty years.

The growth in number of cars in the developed nations of the world and in the past decade, in the developing nations of the world like China and India has been meteoric. Car manufacturers like Hyundai and Honda are among the biggest corporations in the world now.

The primary reason for this is the rapid increase in population in the cities. As more and more people will continue to move away form the rural areas, the public transportation system in the cities will not be able to cater to the needs of all and people will resort to cars as their preferred mode of travel. Alternative modes and means of travelling have been slow in development and do not offer an economic solution as provided by cars. We still depend on fossil fuels for energy and the development of new energy techniques like fuel cells are also directed towards applications in cars only. The advances in public transport systems like railways has not been able to keep pace with the increasing demands. 

Cars are also aggresively advertised as status symbols in a society which is increasingly getting materialistic. As the purchasing power of people increases and the prices of cars decrease by new technological advances in their manufacture, it will become accessible to more people and hence ever increasing sales figures are insured. Cars are still among the top of desirability charts among the common populace. They are no longer just transport systems but offer popularity and increased social standing to the owner.

The argument that the number of cars will come to a saturation point is not vaild as efficient means of disposal of cars and recycling of their parts is being brought about car manufacturers. These policies would ensure that the need of a new car would not be offset by the problem of disposal of an old car by an owner. Banks and other economic institutions are also readily providing loans for purchase of cars and low interest rates and easy pay-back options.

New markets are being created and captured by car companies. We are informed daily of newer deals and strategies by these conglomerates for market capture in localised socities, primary among which are Asian and African nations. Cars are being made according to locals needs and desires which enhance their attraction even more.

These arguments cannot be repulsed in a duration of twenty years alone. It would require a more sustained and rigorous effort than the measures which are being currently underway to check the number of cars on our streets.
