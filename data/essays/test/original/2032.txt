Some people may not consider that most products look better than what it is due to the advertisements.  In my understanding, advertisements is one of the effective tool to promote the sales of the products; hence I assert that producs are made seem better than usual by the advertisement.  I base my assertion upon the following three aspects: the function, the appearence and the price of the products.
     First of all, the advertisement will impose on the good point of the product and will not reveal the bod point or effect.  An example that makes this clear is that the recent advertisement of the laptop computer.  Some Japanese manufacturer imposes only on the endureance of its battery whereas the battery is heavy.  Some Korean manufacturer imposes only on the mutiple function of the laptop computer whereas it works very slowly.
     Secondly, the advertisements makes products look better than what it really is.  For example, car makers uses the most good-looking color of the car in the advertiesment.  And, they designate the angle that the picture of the advertisements is taken.  In addition, the products are located in delux surroundings in the advertisement, which contributes to good a appearence of the product.  I have found this true from my own perosonal experience, too.  I bought my car because I was attracted with the good looking in the advertisement.  In the advertisement, the car was exhibited in the city of Paris, one of the most beautiful cities in the world.  After delivery of the car to my home, I have found the car not to be attractive in the advertisement in the suroundings of the rural area of Japan.
     Thirdly, advertisements impose on the inexpensive price of the products in spite of the fact that the price is not compared in the advertisement.  In Japan, where I live in, Fair Trade Coimmision, which corresponds to the Federal Trade Commision in the U.S., prohibits the advertisements from comparing the price of the products.  Therefore the customer can understand the meaning of the price of the products are expensive or not only after they compare by themselves.
     Considering all of the above factores, I believe that most products seem much better than what it is due to the advertisements.  As I see it, advertisements is the potent tool of manufacturer and seller to attract the customer; therefore we have to deduct the bottom-up of the product by the advertisement when purchasing the products.
