Sometimes my friends from univeristy and me do have a discussion about the best way of learning. A frequent mentioned topic is the question if it is more important for a student to understand the general ideas and concepts than it is for them to simply learn facts. 

On view on this topic is, that a student is only able to talk and think about a certain subject if he has the necessary backgroung knowledge, which consists of basic facts. To give an example I could mention the  historical topic of the second world war. How would a person talk about this topic, if he lacks completely the most important facts like who was involved in the war, when it started, when it ended... Therefore one could argue that students first have to be taught about the basic details of the subject they study, before they can go on and study about the main ideas and concepts behind this subject.  

Another view on this expresses rather the need of a student to understand the theoretical concepts and ideas of his field of study because this will provide him with an overall understanding of the topic. In addition he will have a deeper understanding of the whole subject, which he can later perfectionate by reducing his lack of factual knowledge. The knowledge of the concepts will also make him able to analyze and calssify new topics more easily, because he knows the mechanisms and roles of the overall subject and he knows which details have to be obeserved more carefully. A short look on students of Political Science can contribute to this point of view: Political science students first learn to classify a political system by learning about the most important elements of political systems and the different structures these systems can have. After knowing about these different stuctures a student is able to analyze and categorize every single political system in the world even though he doesn't knows the details and all the facts about it.

I personally think that everybody should get a adequate knowledge with the main facts of many different fields in school so that he will be able to first start his studies by learning about the concepts and ideas behind a ceratin area and not ba learning facts. Facts can later always be added by
