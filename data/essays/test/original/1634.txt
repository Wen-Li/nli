The selling of a product includes several strategies. Among them is advertising it. Advertisement probably plays the biggest role in the process of selling a product. In a three-folds, we will thus discuss how advertisement can be reliable in the sense that it tends to beautify the products it is designed to sell. We will first go through the different types of advertisements, secondly describe the ways in which they can modify the vision of the product and finally the impact of such a process.

Advertisement can be separated in three branches. The media, the press and computer based. The three of them display a variety of advertisement in the sense that we can find a specific clothes on internet as well as in a magazine, as much as a wooden chair in a catalogue as well as on the wedsite of a store. All of these means are accessible, available and be reached by everyone because advertisement interacts with everybody's lives.

However, when looking for a wooden chair on a website, one might like to touch the wood, check its quality or even sit on it. In other words, things that are not possible through paper pages. So the customer would buy the chair anyways because it looks good. But does looking good rhyme with good quality? Technological devices can modify the appearance of a product, computer based wise, as well as in the media, such as special effects for example. 

Along the ways to modify, arrange, improve how a product looks on television, on a website or in a magazine, the three branches of advertisement also put the product it wants to sell into an idealistic context and environment that pushes one to buy a product. For example, if the wooden chair is presented into an asian decorated house with other wooden chairs and in a wooden furniture room, the person would tend to think: it indeed looks good and I want to buy it. 

Nevertheless, it might happen that when the person receives the wooden chair, once put into his or her own living-room, that it would looks bad. He or she might think that it looked better on the website. This is the danger of advertisement. Customers can be disappointed and deceived by a product that looked better on the advertisement.

In conclusion, companies or any group, brand that sells poducts should be careful in terms of how they make their advertisements, which would eventually lead to a challenge at how realisitc can be an ad and how reliable it can be to the customer. Why not go back to the good old days of spending time in the good old stores to make sure we would not be disappointed?
