     I agree that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide.
There are three reason.
     First, travelers don't know the detail of places where they visit. They can't visit all the famous places because they spend time to decide the place they go. But, in the tour they don't need to choose the places where they go. Theremore, the places where is decided by a tour guide are standard and famous places for sightseeing. We can ask a tour guide if we have places where we want to go.
     Secondly, the travel in a group keep the cost cheaper then the travel individual. We can discount the cherge, for example, hotel, plane, entrance fee and so on. In general, it is cheaper to take a lot of  tikets than to take a tiket. 
     Thirdly, in a group trip, people don't concerned about everything. For example, in parsonal trip, people must search the way to place they want to go. Until they arraive at goal, they worry the way is correct. in a group trip, a tour guide lead us to the goal. We only enjoy sightseeing, eating or playing at the goal. We don't waste the time for concerning.
     Therefore, the best way to travel is in group led by a tour guide.
