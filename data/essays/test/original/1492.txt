I don't think I will choose the way travel in a group led by a tour guide. I perfer to go out with my friends according to our own traveling plan.I have at least two reasons to reject group tour.
      First, I don't like to follow the tour company's arrengment. Since no company will run their business without the intension of making profits, the arrangement of tour company offten tends to be tight. Thus, the customer has to travel for one place to another without staying longer at certain beatiful scene and taking deep breath where the air is so fresh. If I travel with my freids, we can stop anywhere, like the sea side, just enjoy the sun shine and the breeze. By this way we can find the true meaning of traveling itself, to lose our pressure in daily work and routin life and gain refreshment. 
      second, if we traveled in a group led by a tour guide, there must be a lot of chance to go shopping something we have no interest at all. Because the guide will constantly recommed to the group what are really worth shopping in that area. And, when some customer were persuade to go, we have no other choice but to follow them.I think it's waste of time to shopping those boring things.
      All in all, I like to have my trip arranged by myself. Of cours it's also not bad to consult wth some friends. But I have to say that the perfect situation is that you happen to have good freids in the place you going to visit.
