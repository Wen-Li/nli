In th early days a particular products quality was determined by the popularity it gained among people who used it and then had provided proof for other people who were willing to use the product .Nowadays there is a trend to camoflouge the customer by making more advertisement and alluring him to buy the product ,untill he finds the reality after he uses the product .
     To a great extend i agree with the statement that "most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are ".i say this because most advertisement are intented to sale of product rather than for the satisfaction of the customer .For example a builder provides an advertisement of a new project with natural habitat ,easy transportation facility ,playgrounds  to play ,school nearby etc ,but the actuall case is that the final product the customer gets after completeness ofthe project is totally different .The advertisement was more appealing than theactuall product .The motive behind this is to gain maximum  profit from the sales .better advertisement  also help to get a upperhand over their counterparts .
         To some extend i disagree with the statement "most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are " because ,in this world of competition advertisement cannot provide all the facts about the product and stand for the needs of the people .Also the brand the product has acquired assures that exagiration was not to get the sales but actual product is also providing the same effects 
            In order to get the best profit and capture market products are advertised in a much better fashion than they really are.although the products of inferior quality may be sold because of this but the prime moto is to sell for the best money .
