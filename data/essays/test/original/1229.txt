 The number of cars on the road have been increasing at a rapid pace. The per capita income is increasing, cars are being made affordable to consumers, there is a constant rise in population and man will soon find means to solve the oil problem. Keeping this in mind I totally disagree with the statement that there will be fewer cars in use twenty years from now.
    With an increase in the per capita income and availability
of cheaper cars the number of buyers are increasing. Now a person who could earlier not afford a car in driving one. There are various scemes in place which allow people to pay off in installments. This is a growing trend and shall lead to an increase in the number of cars.  The population is on the rise every minute. More people means more consumers and that means more cars. 
    One may say that oil will run out or beome too expensive but then man has already made a car which can run on solar energy. With advancement in technology in the years to come man will certainly be able to create a car which can run efficiently on water or solar energy. This will slowly decrease the overall expense of running a car.
    A car is the most convenient way of travel. One can just enter his car and start his journey whenever he feels like and can travel to any place at his will. There are no limitations to certain timings and destinations as in buses, trains, ships or airplanes. Better public transport facilities can make a difference but then the car moves according to the will of the owner and whoever can afford a car will always like to have this convenience. 
    It is possible that the rate at which the number of cars in use are increasing today decreases but under no circumstances will there be fewer cars in use twenty years from now.
