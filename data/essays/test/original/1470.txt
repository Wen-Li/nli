I definitely agree with the statement that advertisements usually make products seem better than they really are. Advertisements are produced with the sole purpose of increasing the number of sales of a product and making the biggest profit out of that product. Pretending that their product is the best out of its league is probably the best method of selling it. 
    I frequently witness examples of this issue in my daily life. For example, a couple of weeks ago I saw the advertisement of a hairdryer on TV. It had an attachment shaped like a fork at the end where the air blows out, and with the help of that attachment, the girls in the commercial were able to shape their hair into any style they wanted to - within seconds! I was so amazed by how multifunctional the product was, it could straighthen, curl, or add waves to your hair via the same apparatus. I was convinced that I had to buy it; and within the week I saw the commercial of this "perfect" hair product, I bought one from their local stores. Although I didn't need a new hair dryer since I had other ones at home, I bought this one simply because I was attacted to its advertisement. 
    When I got home, I quickly washed my hair and took out by new product from its box to give it a test drive. At that moment, I think I had the biggest dissapointment of my entire life. It was nothing like what I had seen on the TV commercial. It was much smaller and less ornate than what I had imagined, and one of the parts of its attachments was missing! I turned it on and tried it on my hair anyways, but the machine kept on stopping in every ten seconds. Deciding that this product was obviously not worth my money or my time, I promptly returned it back to the shop, feeling deceived and mislead. I promised myself that no advertisement would ever be able to beguile and trick me into wasting my money for nothing.
