Many people in Japan, where I live now, believe that succeful people do not try to new things and take risk. However, I strongly agree with the idea that the the successful people try to to do that.

First, the successful has a lot of imformaiton and ways of thinking.
For exsample, when I was in Tokyo university, one of the public university in Japan, I took professor Tanaka's English literature class. The professor had a lot of knowlege, not only English litterature but also modern international industries, Japanese history.
Because of his widespread knowledge, Toyota corpolation, one of the most famous car makers in Japan, invited him as a CEO. I learned from him many things and the most memriable message of him is that we need to get a lot of informaiton to be success in society. As the above exsample shows, if we want to be successful, we have to learn a lot of knowledge and information. 

Second, I believe the rule "high risk, high return". Presently I work at SMBC, a Japanese commercial bank. Hideo, one of my coworker, quited from this company and began to work as a fund manager. Characteristics of jobs of fund managers is very risky, hard through  using millions of dollers. However, if they can deal with their business successfully, they can get a huge amount of money and become famous toward medias. On the other hand, works as banker is generally very boring and repeatiung to do same things correctly. Therefore, I am not able to get a meny money because I continue to work at the bank now. As a result, Hideo got a lot of money as a fund manager and is trying more exiciting work and 

 Therfore, I definetely agree with the statement that we need to try new things and take risk for success.
