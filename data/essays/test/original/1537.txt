Advertisement's liars
Switching from one channel to another you can hardly find a program,all you can see is publicity for certain products.So lately it is becoming the major source of money for most of the companies.Unfortunatelly this creats chaos in my mind, and greatly effect my behavior and my decision,because obviosly our recent advertisements are making the product much better than they really appear.This reality is the reason behind personal benefits and behind the decieving world we are living in.
           My first point why i see that these recent advertisements are all fake,becomes when i look around my self,in my environment and all i can find is every person seeking for his own benifit and profit.So each business man tries to make his own product the best product on ground,which will has a great negative impact on decision making.The second reason why i see advertisememnts so not trustworthy is the way the whole world is functioning.In other words when i see that all people are becoming agressive and violent,greedy,and cheeters.For example is the Mac Donald hamburger,when u see it's advertisements on the roads you find it so big, or big enough for you,however when it comes to reality,or when you arrive the place and order it you find it two times smaller.
