In my opinion it is important to take risks in order to be a successful person. I therefore agree with the statement that successful people more often try new things.
In order to be a successful person you need to risk chances and try things out. (It also matters that if you are financially successful person and the cushion you land on by failing is softer.)
As long as you do only what you know how to do there is less chance of failure, but also limited chance to reach a new level of business, understanding or even a new continent.
If Christopher Columbus wouldn't have risked his health, the money of his king and a lot of time, he wouldn't have found America. And in this example the failure of the contract was a story of success in itself. 
Therefore the tale of success is often a story of taking chances whose outcome is not clear. A person will be even more successful if entering spaces that no one has entered before - taking the road less traveled -, it doesn't matter if it is a continent or a new invention in a laboratory.
Another reason for the conheritance of success and risk-taking is that successful people are more self-confident. A good confidence in yourself and the world is extremely important to take chances, but also to win people over with your idea. If Columbus wouldn't have been self-confident he wouldn't have persuaded the spanish king in giving him money and ships. 
The story of success, being self-confident and taking risks therefore is linked.
