Effect of Advertisement on the Apperance of Goods and Services

I agree with the idea of that most advertisements enables to the goods and services seem much better to consumers than they really are. Advertisements are created and planned very carefully to attract consumers to look at that specific product and affected of that introduction. Thus people who work in this job try to persuade consumers to buy that good or service. Unfortunately this motivation of advertisement personal mostly force them to exaggerate the product's quality.

The effective way of advertisements (ads)  which are usually introduced at TV programs try to affect the target audiance like children, young people, women or men. For example, ads that mainly trying to capture young population and persuading them to buy some specific products like parfumes or deodorants usually use the school or party locations in that many students are together and the girl or boy who use that adverted parfume can affect his or her friends by the marvelleus smelling effect of the product. So the boys or girls believe that the product is so different that everybody will aware of his smelling even at the walking ways, restaurants or even in a very crowded happy year party. Thus the ads reached their aim to eanble the boy to buy that product. But the consumers like this boy will never satisfy with that parfume because mostly nobody will ask him about what kind of parfume he is using, so he will become dissatisfied and will think that the product is not good enoug as introduced in the ads.

The job of advertisement is unfortunately includes some kind of exaggerament of the the product's quality to affect potential buyers and force them to select that product when they go to the shopping place. Thus most consumers usually don't satisfy with the product of they bought bt the effect of ads on TV or other media tools. So consumers should be aware of the ads they watched or seen are not reflect all the time the right quality of that product.
