I personally disagree with the opinion that young people nowdays do not give enough time to helping their community.
I think that if young people are strongly motivated they will do a lot and not only in helping the community. 
An example that comes to my mind is that when last year I did a course for helping and working, of course without  being paid, on the green cross at the hospital. This has been a really interesting and challenging experience for me and I think that I gained a lot from it.
This was just an example, but i remember that there were lots of young people at this course and all of them went there for my same reason: being helpful for the community or at least being a part of it trying to make it better. 
When I look at my society in general I see that are usually  young people that help the most in the community. I know that they must be directed or guided from people that have more knowledge in it but, again, if they are moitivated they can give lots of satisfactions.
In conclusions I can say that there always been critics to young generations but in this case and based on my personal experience I don't find this statement absolutley true.
