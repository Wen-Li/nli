  In this modern society, people are given the chance to choose in what way they are going to study concerning the best type that fits for individuals. Some people believe that having broad knowledge of many academic subjects is better while others thinks it is better for them to specialize in one specific subject. I agree with the latter opinion because students do not have to waste time to study other subjects that are irrevent for their major and because our society has been requiring people to be specialized in their fields.

  First of all, specialising in one specific subjet saves people from wasting time to spend doing unneccessary subjects so that they can study more on thier major subject. One of my friends is majored in biology in the university and he alwasy compains about his high school life. According to Korean education system he had to choose either scientific subjects or literal subjects and he chose to study scientific subjects since he wanted to study biology in his university. However, he also had to choose either music or art as a compulsory subject.  What a waste of time! He should have to take music or art to study biology. what if he spent time studying science rather than music? He could have used his time more effectively to improve his knowledge for his future. For the sake of worthwhile time, it is better to specialise in one specific subject.

 Additionally, as the society progresses, people are expected to have expertised knowledge in their working yard. If students are not prepared to satisfy this assumption, they will find it difficult to get a job or continue working in work place. As students study for one specific subject, they possibly will satisfy specialized demands in their working place. There is one student who wants to be a hair designer. But she has no time to concentrate on studying special hair cutting skills that would be required to learn for her job. Because she has to do many of compulsory "academic subjects" If she is able to study on beuty subject other than academic subjects at her high school, it may be easier for her to catch up other hair dressers in the real life. 

 The world is changing. It is essential for people to realize and try to follow up a number of changes. For students, it is far better to specialize one subject not only to adept these dramatic changes in the world, but not to waste their valuable time for preparing their future.
