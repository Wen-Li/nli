Successful people always want to do or try new things rather than what they already knew.They will try find solutions to new things and help unsuccessful people.They will become the "Role Model" to everyone.Doing what we have already know is a mere waste of time,energy etc.

       By taking risks we can find solutions to many difficult problems which a unsuccessful person can't perform.We can find the ways of solving the problems and also easy ways to accomplish the difficult task.For example,consider Edmond Hillary,a new Zealandian who was a successful person trekked the difficult Mt.Everest and became many persons today.There were many people who took risks and found new things.For example, Gandhiji,Father of India who was a successful lawyer took risk and brought freedom to India in Non-violent manner.

      In trying new things the successful people get pleasure, renowned energy,enthusiasm etc.By explaining them to others they lives become devoted and people remember them even after there death.Trying new things and taking risks is the invention of successful stories and souls.For example,consider Dhirubhai Ambani who was a watchman once and he was a successful watchman in the past but tried new things say he established Reliance Industries Limited. Today his limited is vast empire not only in India but also in some other countries.If he was a watchman like as in the past he would remained without any economical growth and we wouldn't seen such a vast empire.

          So trying new things is the mother of new inventions and discoveries.
