Advertisement is a tool through which the producers provide the information about their products to consumers. Now advertising can be done through various means. For instance, through newspapers, through commercials in television etc. The producers use different techniques to make their product look much better than the products of their competitors.
Now the moot question here is that whether advertisements make products seem much better than they really are or not. According to me, the statement is actually quite true. It is not true for all the advertisements, but yes, for most of them, it is surely true. At most of the times, the producers who are just entering the market have to go in for advertising because they have to face the competitors who are already famous and whose products are well accepted by the consumers. In order to enter the market and make a place for their new product, the producers go in for advertising and thus claim false but attractive things about their product.
Also the producer's main motive is to create a huge market for their products and in turn earn huge profits. So, the longing for compounding their profits motivates the producers to advertise for their products. In that desire, at times they claim some facts about their products which are actually not true. Thus the advertisements are quite deceptive. The consumer should not be carried away by the facts and attractive characteristics of the product  just by watching the advertisements. In the race of earning maximum profits and achieving rank one in respective markets, the producers have deviated from their main purpose. The main aim of the producers should be to offer quality products to their consumers. Its not that they should not aim at earning profits. They surely should try to compound their profits but not at the cost of the quality of their product. The traditional concept of "consumer is the king" should prevail and only the true characteristics of the product should be advertised. Such a thing would add to the company's reputation as well.
