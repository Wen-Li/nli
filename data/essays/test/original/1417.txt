I think that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are.

First of all, there are hundreds of firms producing thousands of different items. The firm's financial success and profit totally depends on its sales. Thus, in order to increase sales in this competitive market, the firms can sometimes claim that their products are much better than others.

Secondly, I believe that we live in a world of "imperfect information". That is, consumers, do not have enough information about the quality of goods and services offered to them. Therefore, they are ready to use any type of information they can get and the only way they can obtain some information is through advertisements. However, most of the time, it is only after they use the product, they realize that the advertisement is misleading. For example, one of my friends have been experiencing hair loss and seen a doctor. The first thing the doctor asked was the brand of shampoo she used. She told the doctor that she was using one of the best shampoos, one which is advertised everyday and used by many people.  The doctor  told her to change her shampoo because it turns out that one of the ingredients in it may cause hair loss. She began to use another one, but that advertisement is still on TV and many people keep buying that product!

Last but not least, I think that there are important problems in the legal environment. The firms' activities including their advertisements are regulated by competition law and commercial law. Yet, they fail to identify and penalize the firms, which give misleading information about the products. I think it is also necessary for consumers to complain about the products they use whenever it is necessary. Only by this way, the legal authorities may be aware of the problem and the law can be enforced.

Consequently, beacause of imperfect information and legal problems, most of the firms do not hesitate to make products seem better than they are.
