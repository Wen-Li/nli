Everybody need a minimum of knowledge of many academic subjects but a specialization is often required to work in a specific subject. The main problem is that it is difficult to learn many subject and to  be specialized in a specifice subject because it require so much time and energy. In the first part, I will show why a specialization is useful and in the second part I will explain why a knowledge of many academic subject is important.

    First of all, companies are looking for specialized workers because the labour is becoming more and more divided between employees and specialization are demanded. Moreover, a knowledge of lots of subject will not be use in the work. Remember that the objective of school is to prepare us to enter in the work world. For example, a student in international business will not need knowledge of biology (unless he will do business in biology!).

    In contrary to the importance of a specialization in a work, a knowledge of a minimum of any academic subjects is important for the general culture of the individu. With that minimum, he would be able to exchange talks with differents person and  be opened up to meet different and interesting persons different from people at his job! 
    You could also get a twin skill diploma and that academic subjects could create a sinergy and make you becoming researched by some companies. To give an example, some  building construction companies are looking for people who are skilled in business and in building construction in order to sell their products.

    To conclude, we can say that we need both of them because a specialization is required for the work and a knowledge of different academic subject is important to be opened to other subjects.
