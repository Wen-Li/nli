I disagree with the opinion.I think The best way to trvel is in a group with no tour guide.
If one travels with a tour guide,one cannnot experience the true living the people there do.I think the people who live there know the best point there.
Nowadays,people watch travel program on TV,so,travel as the same way that people do in a TV program is not give people new experience and new sight,new curutural topics and new movement.
People usually travel in  great expenditure,so,I want to experience other things people usually cannot do in japan.For example,eat foods which do not exsist in japan,and speak people who live there and want to know what people there think everyday.
Once I had gone to Borneo to dive and to see animals.We made friends with a man who live there,  and he explainded to us where was a dangerous place to go,and where was a delicious market and so on. our family enjoyed our trip,and we could make a new friend in Borneo.
Trip with a tour guide is good for a man who only want to see fasmous places,I think.But by such trip, people can not see the real figure what the country is.
To enjoy the country fully,I think it is the best way to travel without any tour guide.
