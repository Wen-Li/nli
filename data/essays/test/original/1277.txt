Nowadays, there are a lot of type of education. Some schools teach and give their student so general education without deeping the subjects. Some other schools give so specific education to their student. I believe that students can be more successful with specific education. Because of this, I disagree with that it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts with two reasons.

    My first reason is that if students learn facts in their schools they can learn easier because the facts provide real things and the their classes may be more logical and the most important thing in this point, if students learnd facts they do not need to memorize anything. For example, if we explain everything to student, he or she will not have a question mark in his or her mind. Moreover, he or she never forget this ideas. Thus, learning facts are more important.

    My second reason is that if we teach students just ideas and concepts, these things may shape his or her life style. He or she may start thinking everything so general. It can effect his or her life. For instance, if a student learns  just general things he may start looking at people like that without thinking deep about them. It is not good because people have emmotions. 

    To sum up, students can understand ideas and concepts easly but for them the most important thing is that understand ideas correctly with all of points. Without that, students can not think deeply and they can not critics their world. Understanding ideas and concepts are easy way for students. They can not improve their selves in their future, if we teach them with these ways.
