Learning knowledge has two steps of study processing- understand the ideas and concepts, and then learn facts. I disagree with the statement that to understand ideas and concepts is more important for our students than to learn facts. I think that they are both important in our learning fields, such as science, art, phylosophy and so forth. 

The first step of study is to understand ideas and concepts which include the sagasiousness of our human beings. When you are reading a technology textbook, for example, what you want to pursue? What you want to get from the book, in main point, is that you want to know the principles and mechanism of  technology in the book. In other words, you want to understand the ideas and concepts showed in the materials. Moreover, you want to, in some cases, get the ideas and concepts and then use them to address or figure out the problems you face in any fields. 

After understanding the ideas and concepts, you exploit to learn the facts included in them. Just understanding them is not enough while you learning them. Another aspect is that you should to learn the facts. How to and what to learn facts are the main domains in learning the facts. Because of understanding the ideas and concepts, you have to apply those to real world, objects, and subjects and so forth. Though applying the knowledge you have studied, you can learn what  the facts are, and also, you can revise the ideas and concepts which are of faults and foibles. Then, you have learned the facts presented in the ideas and concepts. 

In sum, we can not separate the two steps of study processing. We can not decide which of the steps is more important than the other. The  one that we can confirm is that understanding ideas and concepts beyond learning facts.
