Generally think that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping thier communities.Probably, it is true.Because they have to do their homework,assignments and so on,and also they want to have a fun with their friends.I definitely say that most of people like staying with thei friends better than helping their communities.Because we can meet our neiborhoods anytime .I think that this reason connects to this issue that recently,young people do not give enough time to helping thei communities.However, I disagree with this statement that young people do not participate in communities.

      First, they surely have their time. During the time they sre frre,and also they can do anythig what they want to do.Thus, I think that people should not regulate their time,and they do not have any rigts to force to do something.And it is one of selfith of adults in the community.    
  
      By the way,in the summer,my community has many summer festivals with neiborhoods.To achieve the festival we need many stuff, and also they want outgoing persons.Each year,the people who arrange the festival always annoy about lack of stuff,however many youngstars in my community  participate in the festival,and also they enjoy it really much.They can know how to communicate with oter people due to participation of a community activity. I think it is the most important to live in a daily life s a human.

     I know that there is deffetrent tendency of the number of stuff each year.But I am one of a person who includes young people,I do not want someone to say such like a statement.In assition,I think that many youngstyars know how importance of communication with oter people like I mentioned above.Therefore I definitely disagree that youngstars do not participate in their communities.
