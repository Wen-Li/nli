In twenty years from now there would definately be fewer number of cars used. By fewer number i mean that they would only be present on earth,being mose specific they would be lying in junk yards.

We humans are growing at a rapid phase,we are exploring right from a nail to space.Because of this development we will not only explore space but also will start living there.The car will start getting modified will all the gadgets invented by us and in few years,inorder to break light barrier,they would have speed beyond that.At that speed car will not be on ground but it would be flying.And i hardly think there would be any need for cars to travel in space.At that time we will be having a more sophiscated car like thing;you can call it space shuttles,super cars or something beyond our imagination.

People will start living in space,different planets,stars and they may also start living in different galaxies,who knows.now inorder to travel from one planet or star we would hardly need a car.Car will be made used by people who are either poor or middle class,as they do not have much finance to get a house up there.This cars are used by them because its only twenty years from now but not forty years.Then according to the new definition of car,we will start guiding others by saying"This galaxy is just another half a light year away."

 Invention of new cars;would hardly have any pollution and no health problems,because solar cars would have already been invented and put in junk yard.

Or we may invent some type of fuel for the car which will have no pollution and health problems.

So twenty years from now we will be having a very large number of cars in use than there are today,but the cars will be called as super cars or shuttles.
