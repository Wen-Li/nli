This Spring Festival,  I spent almost a week in Sanya with my parents, and also a tour guide.  Fortunatlly, I had a good time there, since the tour guide arranged our scheldule and fixed everything. What I should do was just to enjoy the trip! Consequently, I prefer to hire a tour guide during a group-traveling. When you visit somewhere you do not familiar with, if you hired a  guide, he would provide you with car , tell you the history of the city, show you interests of places. 

Firstly, when you travel outside, where is far from your hometown, commonly, you will not drive your own car. Thus it is obvious that you will be much easier and cheaper if you hire a guide who can provide a car. For instance, this time we went to Sanya, we called a guide to pick  up us and  took us to the places we wanted to visit. If we, three persons to take a taxi, the cost will be doubled.

Moreover, the guide knows the city better than you do. He not only knows the history of  the historial inherents, but also manage to tell you where is the most beautiful place in the area. Such as what a guide did when Iwas in Xiamen last year, She  showed us a place you will never find by your own! There, the combination of the sun, the sea, the beach is fantastic!
 
Finally, which I think it is important tome, the tour guide will take you to a much cheap hotel. As you know, the cost is rising thse days. When I am in sanya, the hotel charged us 6000 yuan per day. However, the guide showed up, he bargined for us. At last , we just spent 1700 yuan per day.

To sum up, I will choose a guide to lead my travel, not only for the money stuff , but also for the convieneint.
