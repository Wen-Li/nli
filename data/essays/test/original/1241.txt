Adertisement is the mode to make people aware of a thing for mercenry purposes. I agreee that  Most advertisements make products seem  much better than they really are. But the word "Most " covers  ample of advertisements but not all.   
Apropos of the present scenerio, in the hordes of competition, the advertisers are using hooks and crooks to excel their product value, consequently its sale.
They devise the norms to allude their  customers' attention so that customers have long term impacts on their mind. The advertisements do an agitation job. In one advertisement it was shown that a person gets a heart attack if he\ she  does not use the advertised sunflower oil. Isn't this seemed rediculous?
Another Flauntness appears in the increased level of fortification of the product (that it does not have) having positive and beneficial effects  not related to your health actually . More will be the important ingrediants with other benefits , more will be the sale.  Take the of common salt  now it is termed as "iodised salt with extra minerals" aboy gets first position in its academic only by consuming the salt. Is this seemed to be a absurd thing? this i call as positive effects of consuming the product. In the age of break neck competition, advertisers use modes to distract their customers.
