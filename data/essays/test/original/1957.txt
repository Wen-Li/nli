I disagree with the opinion that young people do not give enough time to helping their communities: in fact I think they do it, but their work and their contibute are not evaluated and appreciated as much as it would be. I will  support my opinion with several examples of situation I experienced in my life. 
Young peole is more interested in culturals events of his contemporary period and more expert in terms of knowledge of music, theatre or visual artists than older people of their communities; so young people often organize shows, concerts or reading in order to share their experiences with the rest of the communitie. This special help to their communities is often undervaluated to the other citizens. For istance, when I was 16, a group of friend and I organized an art exhibition of contemporary art in the city hall of my village collecting and showing several pieces from local artists. The majority of the exhibited pieces was rather orrible and all the citizens didn't appreciate our work. Looking from another perspective, we gave the chance to young artist to exhibit somewhere and some of them now is a famous international artist and he remember yet he exhibited in a small village where everybody despite the youngpeople hated him.
