I agree to the given statement, that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide.Bacause, during the travel we will visit many places.They may be familiar to you or may not be.If I travel alone without a guide there are a lot of problems that I have to face.I may be misguided by my minor knowledge about the place and it becomes difficult to manage them.
              For example, I may enter a new place where I don't know anything like where to go, how to get my work to be done.Some times if I am out of the country there will be a problem with the language.Since I don't have any idea about the place,I have to enquire others to get the information,and there comes the problem with the language.
                If I am travelling to a new place and if I missed the route to travel,then I will be strucked there without help and I can't reach the destination.If I travel in a group with a tour guide, he or she can assist the correct way to travel and also helps in getting the things to be done.The guide takes care of us and guides in a correct direction in any matter.We can solve the problems like the language problem ,since ther are more chances that atleast a single person in the group know the language, which helps a lot for our travel.A group can give the best solution to a problem,rather than a single person.
              If we are travelling in a group and if there is any problem there are many chances of getting the best idea to getrid of the problem.If I am travelling alone I may not get the best idea of getting out of the problem.The guide also helps us travel to our destination without any problem since he knows everything about that place.So I prefer travelling in group led by a tour guide.
