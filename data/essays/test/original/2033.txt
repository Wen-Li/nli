I do not agree with the statement becuase there is no specific formulae for success in everything what ever one likes to  do. A person successful on a particular thing need not be successful in all the things that he does.
 I know a person who is a good teacher, he started an academic institution, because he is  a teacher he knows the needs of the students and plan the courses accordingly, his training classes and material  were very successful, he could attract somany students to his institute. He earned lot of money and reputation.After a while Realestate business started picking up in his city,he started venturing his hands into it, as he is not experiencd in that business,he failed miserably.May the proverb a bird in hand is better than two inthe bush is more opt for him.
 A successful news paper owner known to me  in my state entered into banking sector.Loking at the success of his news paper peole started invesing into his bank, after seeing the success again here, he diverted the fund to movie making where he has failed miserably, people who invested in his bank are trouble as he is not in a position to pay the money back.
Good planning and good domain knowledge can only make the people succcessful but not evry boy who tries at new ventures without doing a good risk analisis. 
A teacher should not be made a soldier there by we may be getting a bad soldier and losing a good teacher. 
 So I strongly  feel people should continue in the fields  where they are really experts, and should not keep moving to everything that comes on their way and start experimentng.
