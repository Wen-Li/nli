It happens to me a lot of time to taste food or to try a product that reveal to be not as good as shown in the advertisements. 
The mass medias can do miracles in showing items to be put on the market in a different way. They use the image, which can modify a lot the real consistency of the item to be advertised. For instance, what you look through the television or on a poster on the street is slightly different from the reality because of the use of colours and lights when photografing the product.
The advertisers use marketing strategies, abouve all in showing you the product with the perfect background: rights words and slogans. They use the tool of communication to attract you. In addition they try to make a good use of time (usually they have really short time) and images, a good combination of both of them makes an advert very successful. They also know to whom address their porpouses, usually they use target groups, in which children and elederly are most common.
As far as food is concerned, I think that advertisements can be a sourse of attraction for the buyers because they only see the product without tasting it. But I think that you can do a wrong choice the first time then you know that for the following time you will be not buying the same products even if it is good advertised.
I prefer to watch a product with my eyes than let me convice by the adverts, even if sometimes they are really well done and a kind of art.
