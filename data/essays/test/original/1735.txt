"The best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide".I strongly agree with the statement because there are several advantages for people to travel in a group led by a tour guide :A tour guide can guide the people in right way,how people see the entire city and how people communicates with others.
              Firstly, a tour giuder can guide the people in the right way because he knows the place well when compared to other people.
for example, the famous places to visit , where to get proper food and boarding.so that the people doesnot miss the best  places to visit.at the same time he take care of boarding and food.if people are alone in a place that which they doesn't know much it is always problem for them to get  good food.
              secondly, this allows the people to see the entire city.for example,some people doesn't know the city and there is always a chance of missing important places.people spend a lot  of money to travel and watch the important places and sometimes people even feel bad if they miss some important places.
               Finally, it is difficult for people to communicate with others and understand their language. For example, if people travel to places that they doesn"t know means if a person is from andhra pradesh and if he wants to visit a place say oothy (a place in tamilnadu).They can't understand tamil so it is difficult to manage. This problem can be solved only if  there is a tour guide.   
                 In summary, people can even travel places in a group with out a tour guide. But , I always prefer to have a tour guide while travelling in a group led by a tour guide because he is the responsible person for a successful tour.
