I do not agree with this statement. Eventhough today most of people know about the disadvantages of cars, i think there a several reasons why there won't be less cars in twenty years than there are today

First of all, people don't like to change their habits, they are lazy and always trying to maximize comfort. They are just so used to their cars. Therefore it would need a big changement in the consciousness of the individual and this cannot be attained easily. Eventhough nowadays there are organizations that try to make people aware of environmental problems an so, however, most of people don't consider their own compartment as part of the solution. 

Second, more and more people live in suburbs, especially young families. These people still mostly work in the big cities and travel there by car daily. I really believe that this development of the social structure doesn't help to get the cars away from the streets. People basically need their cars to make a living.

Last but not least, the lobby of the carindustry plays a big role. As long as there are cars, there will also be people making a lot of money with it. And those people, who are most of the time very powerful, are ready to make a big effort to prevent the public opinion to shift towards the unneccesity of cars. They will always try to provide other solutions to problems like pollution. For example they could try to argue that todays cars have catalyzators or don't need a lot of gas anymore. 

In conclusion i tried to show with three examples, which are in my opinion the main ones, why i do not believe that there will be fewer cars in the future that there are nowadays. The three reasons are: people's habits, social structure and the lobby of the carindustry.
