When you see succesfull people you can ask yourself what they are going to do with their succes. There are many examples in historical persons and contemporary personalities that show that succefull people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well.

    Indeed I can take the example of Alexander the Great in anciant Greek History. He is considered as one of the biggest conquestors in human history. Initialy he comes from a wealthy Athenian family he is the Athenian King's son. When he is 18 he becomes King of Greece and he want to expanse his Kingdom. First he fights the Ottomans: he wins the war, then he wishes to become King of the most important territory ever. So he continues his conquests he encreeses his empire up to India ( he has been the first occidental to have discovered India. He has been defeetes in a province of India and he had to go back to Babylon which has become the capital of his huge empire. When he died his empire imploded because there was no one with such a carism like him to garantee the stability of the huge empire.

    An other example would be Napoleon who has been defeeted by the British army 1803. He wanted to reign all over Europe, he won against the biggest armies ( Austria, Prussians) but he made a critical tactical error when he wanted to invade Russia. He went to Russia at the beginning of autumn and in Winter he arrived in Moscow which had been burnt by the local inhabitants so the big napoleonian army could not find any rest and had to go back to France. It was very cold ang the huge army of more than one houdred fivety thousend men at the beginning of the russian campaign was only five thousend at the end which means a verry big humiliation and its the beginning of the end because one year later he gets definately defeeted in Wateloo.

I have tried to show that persons who suceed in something always want more and that leeds to catastrophies. It has always been like that. Only a few wise persons who suceeded try to take mesured risks and not inconsiderated ones. I presume those people exist but I don't have any exaple to mention.
