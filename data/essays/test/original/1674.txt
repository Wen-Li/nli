How to travel is controversial and complex issue. Different people have different opinion about how to travel due their respective angles and expriences. in one hand, many people enjoy traveling by themselves. On the other hand, many people ibelieve to travel in a group led by a tour guid is best way. These two ways both have their advantages.However, as a old man, I prefer to travel in a group and think it is best way for old people. We should judge it on a case by case base.  In the following stament, I will provide my reasoning and evidence to support the statement that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guid. 

In the first place,  travel in a group is more conviniet. We all know before we travel, we have to prepare a lot. We will search the related information from internet and books to know which are historical sites and landmarks of the cities we will visit; We need book plane tickets, hotel. Sometimes, tourists also need to reserve the tickets of some very hot view sites. If you go aboard, you still need to deal with many issues about visa. It require a lots time and effort. I travelled to maldives in my honey moon last year. I spend almost a half month to find which island is best and arrange hotel, visa and transportation. In the end, I only spend sevens days in maldives while I spend much more time to prepare.  It is a very good case that demostrate travel in a group led by a tour guide will help you to save a lots of effort.

In the second place, travel in a group is also cheaper.  Because the huge demand from the travel agency, the travel agency always have a good discount with many hotels an airplane companise. The huge discount can gurantee them to be profit even they offer you the more cheaper price on transporation and accomodation. To travel in a group can really help you  save a lots money. 


Last thing,  I really think travel in a group led by a tour guide is expecially beneficial to the old people. For example, my parents are 60 years old. Everytime, when they travel alone, I will be very concerned about their health.  However, if they travel in a group accompanied with guides, I will feel much better because my parents can be taken care by the guides of the travel agents. 

 there is no denying, sometimes to travel along is also very attractive. But nowdays, because there are more options and high quality travel services, as far as I see, I will prefer to travel in a group.
