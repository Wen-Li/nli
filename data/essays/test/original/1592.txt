Those who think the advertisement does not make any difference of products might say that the advertiseement has no effect on how it seems. However, I agree with the statement that advertisement influences how products look. There are two examples. 
   Advertisement can elevate the image of brands. For example, FILA, which is one of the fashion and sports companies, invited Paris Hilton to a club party to elevate its brand image. It was very successful. FILA was once considered as boring and not a trendy brand. However, After the evet, they accomplished a dramatic improvement in their image. Now people think FILA is the most leading brand of young fasion trend. Considering this case, Although their products have not changed at all, people became to think FILA has better product before by one highliting event. 
   The above example is a significant change in short period of time. Long term star marketing is also able to make products seem better than they are. Most of the sport equipments companies use huge amount of money on star marketing. For more than ten years,  NIKE invested on Micheal Jordan a millions of dollars asking him to be their model for products. The reason of becoming a model of NIKE was possibliy big money he would recieve. This has nothing to do with how good their products are. However, many teenagers think the product of NIKE is good only because Micheal Jordan wears the prooduct. Moreover, some of them believe that they can be like Micheal Jordan someday by wearing the product. Although this is a case of false image, advertisement contributed a lot how the product of NIKE seems.
   When it comes to star marketing, People think a company has a good product because of models in its advertisement.  In summary, the advertisement plays a huge role how products look like.
