Some people say that learning facts is more important than understatnd ideas and concepts. however, it is more imporatant to understand ideas and concepts. truly, students need to learn the basic facts.  but there are more importatnt reasons to understand the idea. first, they are more likly better understand what the text books says. second, it is helpful for students to organize and remerber what they stuied.
 first  of all,  by understandind the ideas students can apply that idea on  other fields. and it will makes students better understand not only their fields but also other areas.  let me take my experiance for example. when i was in a first year of the university, i took two elctive couses. one was arts and philosophy and the other was customes inthe contemporary sciety. in the former class there are a lot of reqiurement to undersandig the idea. at first it was callenging but in the end i got valuable informations.
 next, when students just learn about facts, they cram right befre the test. and after the exam they about what they studied. but understanding ideas takes much longer time to understand.
and that would be offer more chances to think and imagine in various manners. as a result, they can remeber well what tey stuied. according to recent study released by korean national reserch center ninety percent of of survayed students reveal much more high grades than thoes who just learn facts. this shows that understanning ideas is far more important.
