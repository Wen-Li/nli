Nowadays young people are very selfish. They do not want to do any thing for their families, and also their communities. 
   
   One of the most important reason for this can be technology. Watching too much TV and using too much computer is not excellent for youngs.  Before the TV was not invented ,people  conversed a lot. Now youngs even do not want to look at their parent's faces. As a result ,they do not listen their parent's command, and leave them alone . It is very big problem in the world.
    
    The other reason for not giving time is that they do not respect their tradition.  According to them, these are   silly things. For example, they do not listen an old woman. They think the old is very boring,  If they give enough time for old people ,  they can help their problems.

    Finally, they do not want to be volunteer. Especially, university students think that all things are for themselves. According to them, they do not have enough time. They have a lot of studies to do. Clearly , they are not generous.

   The behaviours of young people are getting  worse from day to day . They prefer to spare  their time , instead of helping poor , old people and their families.
