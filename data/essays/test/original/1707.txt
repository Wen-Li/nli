Throughout their schooltime, students have to gain a huge amount of new knowledge. There are two different types of dealing with new  materials. One is focused on understanding ideas and concepts and the other one is just learning facts. However, what is the more important method?
    To begin with, it is very important that students are able to understand what they have to study. Therefore, they need to understand certain ideas and concepts. For instance, if they know about the background of some themes and can remember them for a long time, instead of forgetting them right after an exam. This is more often the case when learning about ideas and concepts.
    On the other hand, learning about facts is not avoidable. In some subjects, students have to learn about many facts and it is difficult to always introduce concepts. One subject where there are many facts to learn is history. As that time has already passed by it is often impossible to, for example, know the exact reasons why some invents happened and the ideas and concepts that were taken into consideration.
    In conclusion, students have to use both methods in order to learn about new topics. The more important one, in my opinion, is understanding ideas and concepts as to learn facts is just learning by heart and often does not stay very long in students minds.
