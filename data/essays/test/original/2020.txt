Today the number of cars on our planet is really high.
Some people think it will increase in the next years, others are convinced that this number will be smaller than today.
I feel strongly that the second position is more realistic, and one of the most important reason is that the cost of natural resources as petroleum and gas, will increase in the future.
Theese kind of resources ar not everlasting and they are the main resources used in a car's motor. 

A second point is that also the cost of life is increasing. Actually it's really expensive to buy a car for a common family and in the future many of theese families will not have enough money for a cheap vehicle.

Another point is the lack of parking places inside a big city and  traffic jams. Theese  are seriuos problems in a urban centers and they will lead to a reduction of the vehicles. Otherwise the life of citizens will become an hell: they will spend all their spare time in searching of a parking or in the middle of road, crowded by others' car.

Finnaly I think that some problems could be solved. For istance the structure of motors should be change, permittng them to work also with a different fuel: water will be the best candidate.
However I think that a reduction of cars could be consider postive for our future life.
