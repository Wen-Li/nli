having broad knowledge of many academic subjects or beeing specialized in a subject present both advantages and disadvantages.


first of all we can say that having broad knowledge on many academic subjects is very useful. in fact you can interest yourself in a large number of problems and discuss it with lots of people. indeed it is very exciting to have lots of knowledge and skills in a large number of subject. furthermore you are more interesting because it often  seems that you are open minded. for instance peolpe, who are interested in cenima, litterature, sport...are often admired by other peolpe.
but there is a disavantage because you can't really have knowledge about many academic subjects, it is saying that you are not accurate in what you know.

nevertheless, beeing speciliazed in some areas presents also advantages because you are very accurate and specific in what you say. you can go further than most of people. in this sense it makes you an interesting and comelling peson.
however the drawback is that you may be seen as a narrow minded person, because of your specialisation in one subject.


Actually it is a moot point, but as far as I am concerned I prefer having broad knowledge of many academic subjects because it is very useful in you real life. in fact you can't ignore certain subject, you are concerned. for instance that is why I chose to enter a business school, it is very amazing all the subject you can study. I study several fields and not only business, for example I study behavior in one of my couses, which is very interesting and useful in your real life. it allows us to understand some kinds of personnalities in the real life. of course my knowledge about this subject is not infinite, I am definitely not a specialist, but I am able to discuss it with other people, which is for me the most important.
