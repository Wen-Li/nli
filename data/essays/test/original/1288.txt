We should think people as two types.One of them is like water, another group is like a wood. 
 For the people who is like water can be look like every sitution trying new things and not to be afraid of taking risks, it is impossible to see or understand which situtation, action or behaviour is right or wrong. Because they believed that succesful hides behind of creativity and in order to be creativity, we have to try new things in our life.  Of course, these people know they having some risks making them poor,even die. But after they try what they want, they have no disturbtion or anything else on their minds. While these people speaking relating to new things, never feel any hesitation. Moreover they always trust themselves, because of seeing the whatever talking about. On the other hand, it is possible for these people trying new things or doing taking risks to be ill relating to heart or sugar because of adrenalin. For example, Albert E 
 For the another group of people, who is like wood, it can be said for them that they are strong, never fall against the life, mostly they will not have a big problem on their life because of not to take risks. Beside this, during their life, they have done the same thinghs or things the another people had already tried. They have never been creativity and succesful. For example
 Finally, I agree to people  who likes risks and adrenalinand I believe that creativity hides behind of risks and new things and people can be succesful if they make creativity things in their life,so do them .
