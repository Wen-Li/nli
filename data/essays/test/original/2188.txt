I agree with the statement that most advertisements make products seems much better than they really are.It is because the advertisement is a tool for companies how can they spread the product the most effectively.I will give three reasons to support my opinion.

First, The advertisemnt is for sales.The companies need profit to suistain their companies, so that they want to sell their product as much as they can, and maintain the high price as much as they could.To make it effective they need a good advertisement which turns out most people feel that advertisement is better than a actual product. 

Second,the advertisement is for commercial reasons, which I mentioned a little in the first reason, so that to make an advertisement leaflet they just take the best picture of the product. For example if the company made a package of 10 special tasty apples but they do not have to show all of them, what they can do is, they can simply show the one best picture which they have taken from all of the apples.

Third, most of or all the companies want to maintain the high price for their products.They tried to advertise more effective to more people get attracted. I was encountered several times, I can give an example which I still remember, I ordered a chocolate box but the size of the product was much smaller than I expected, which was very unexpected.

In conclusion I agree with the sentense from above three reasons. The sad thig is even some companies,made a good product they can not sell effectively unless they are successful in marketing, means good advertisement. So that every company need to success in advertisement which lead to most advertisements make products seems much better than what they really are
