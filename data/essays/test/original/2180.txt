I agree with the statement. There are lots of advertisements which mainly purpose of creating an illusion on the eyes. Most of the advertisements aims to create a world of Alice for everyone. 
 
I think there are three reasons of that problem.

First, the companies want to get all the efforts spent on the item in kind of bulk of revenue immediately, in any way possible on professional life. This is somehow about ethics. However and unfortunately, firms operate in a basic manner: `to get the maximum profit`. After all the efforts have been spent on a product before coming to shelves of stores, the firms are at a no-way point. They start to think that they should make their product appear in a more shiny way. This is only reachable when you show some extra things on your product, which may be totally useless or though which may does not exist.    

Second, advertisement professionals are paid for that. They should say some fantastic things to crate an illusion on the eyes of customers in order to attract them. If they only refer to normal specifications of the item, they will not attract the customer, basicly. So the mad-mens, how the advertiesement professionals called in late of 50`s in USA, should find some extra things other than normal people can see or can utilize. This has been a ethical problem since the industrialized days started.  

Third, people tends to buy products which is totally different, fantastic and speculative. This is the trend growing among all of the societies. Therefore, the counter trend growing in advertisement industry is not quite surprising. 

I think  the solution lies on the quality of the education. People must understand that they have to get what they paid for. This will be only be possible if enough awareness injected in the brains of young generation.
