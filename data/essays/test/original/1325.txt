When it comes to the advertisements, there is a controversy over the issue that how reliable they really are. Inspite of showing the quality and features of the products, the majority of the advertisements make the products seem better and not so reliable to customers.

Admittedly, advertisements play an important role of showing the products to customers. They introduce the new products to the people who are not familiar with the products. Advertisements can show the shape, the color, the textile vividly to the people in front of the TV or computer, giving information and making a link between the products and the customers.

However, what has mentioned above is a one-sided statement. Usually the information from advertisements is not so reliable. Advertisements sometimes shows the advantages that the products do not have. For instance, tea is good for human health, but some advertisements say their tea can also help people to lose weight, which will not affect the customer when they drink it. The advertisements always show too many advantages of their prodution to be reliable.

Furthermore, the advertisements often emphasize too much on one good aspect and do not say the bad aspect of the production. The prodution may have that advantage to other products, but it can not be suppreme, and it must has some disadvantages. For example, when you by a car of Toyota, its advertisements is always about the saving of gas, while the advertisements never say the speed disadvantages to other brand like Ford. So the advertisements si less reliable because they only show the good aspects and emphasize too much on good aspects.

To sum up, as far as I am concerned, the advertisements make the products too good to be consumed.
