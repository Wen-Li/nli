I disagree with the statement that in twenty years there will be fewer cars on the street than today. Although I disagree, I would like to briefly examine why such a statement could have been expressed. After that I would like to show why I disagree.

First, a possible explanation for this statement could be that in twenty years there is a shortage of oil or the prices are that high that barely anyone could afford the gas. Another possibility is that the goverments make a law which sets a limit on a certain amount of cars in a country, due to environmental problems. The third thing I can think of is that the people themselves restrict their usage of cars. But, as I mentioned above, I don`t think that will happen and therefore I cannot agree on the statement. So this brings me to my arguments that there will be more cars in use in the future.

I am expecting that the automobile manufacturers will invent new technologies which are polluting the environment less than the cars today. So there won`t be any critics who state that using a car would destroy the world. Another major factor is the increasing population. Let`s assume that only every second or third citizen of China uses a car on his own. This would lead to an enoumous increase in the demand for cars. The third point I would like to mention is that more and more people own more than one car. I can tell from my experiences that in my neigborhood there are a lot of families who have more than one car. Even some single persons have two cars. One for the summer and one for the winter. I also have to admit that using a car is much more convenient than using the public transport system and as more and more people have two jobs they have to use a car to be mobile and to arrive at the company in time.

All these arguments make me think that the amount of cars will rise in the next years.
