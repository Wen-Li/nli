In contemporary Western society, largely dominated by individualistic values and good levels of wealth, it is surely true that the people, and the young people in particular, feel less linked to the communities in which they live. Therefore, many people consider less important to actively participate to collective life and to directly manage surrounding problems than to attend their personal ambitions and troubles. Obviously, young people generally think that, having a future to build for themselves, they have a special right for this egoistic attitude, in particular during the last years, when the educational and professional training is quite long and hard and the job market is really tight.
Being a generation that had the luck to grow, on average, with many economic and material advantages, if compared with their parents and grandparents, nowadays young people could feel that the matters involving the community are not a dircet concerne for themselves. It is usual to hear people stating that the responsability to resolve collective problems, form the biggest (such as crime, or natural disasters) to the smallest (minor troubles in local infrstructures, for example), is a burden of the official authorities and the institutions.
Thence, the personal contribution that a person can give to his community is dramatically underscored, and the possibility to learn through direct experience helping the others, that could be very important for the youngest, too.
I belive that the only effective way to front this problem is to educate boys and girls to consider their lives and personal projects for the future as strongly linked with their community, in which they could become, when ther are adults, citizens and professionals with big responsabilities.
