 I will first discuss both interests of broad knowledge and specilization and will then give my personnal opinion.
    
    To have a good broad knowledge requires a lot of work and interest in many subjects such as maths, english literature, politics, foreign languages, etc... Broad knowledge of academic subjects  sure can be useful and is even required if you are planning on teaching. 
    It could also be convenient to posess that kind of knowledge during a conversation with a friend, or a representative, or at a  dinner. That way you will not feel lost and will be able to discuss the subject even if you don't know everything about it.
    And this point will lead us to the specialization into one specific subject.
    
    To specialize in a specific subject doesn't mean that you don't have pre-requirements in other fields of interest. It just means that you are willing to learn more about a subject more than another 
    Plus it means that you are passionate about something, and to be passionate is often the key to sucsess. Because you are eager to learn everything on this particular topic, it may ask a lot of work, but what becomes work thanks to passion ? Amusement ! I'm sure everyone experienced this phenomenon at least once in his or her life. 
    I will take my own experience as an example. I used to detest english and  I'm now studying it. I remember that what triggered everything was my first experience of watching a movie in it's original version - since, french dubbing on a foreign movie really annoys me. A couple of years ago, if I told anyone that I would become an english major they would have laughed so loud. And I am today passing the TOEFL in order to candidate to an ISEP program.

    So my opinion, strictly personal and again only based on my personal life experience tends to disagree with this statement
