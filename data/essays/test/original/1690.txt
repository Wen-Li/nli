 Successful people are Successful people because they took a risk. I think that if you do not take a risk you can not reach your goals. Many people in the world try to do the best in theirs jobs, but they have to take a real risk. One example of a person who took a risk is the president of "Dell Company" he started his own company using and investing his own money. He started in his garage with only one computer. Buying computers parts and creating or customizing the computers. Now his company is one of the mos important computer branch in all the world and he makes a lot of money every year. This is a good example of doing what he already know to do well. Other example is Bill Gates, a computer software genious, actually he is one of the most rich persons in all the world, he is the creator of the Operative System "Windows" this software was created in the 80's creating a new way to use a computer, he change the old command promt for a graphic interface. This year Bill Gates put on sell his new Operative System "Windows Vista" an excelent software with new applications, he took a risk too when he started his company but look at him now, he is a successful business man. Other good example is Lance Armstrong he is a bicicle racer and he had cancer. He fight for his life and he is cure. He had won seven times the tour of france. Now he is retired but he made a lot of money winning these championships. He took a risk and he did the best he could. These examples are the reasons that I think that the people have to try new things and take risks. All of them are successful people and I want to be one of them.
