In Japan, where I live, some people believe that best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide because it is easier to travel. However, I personally disagree with the statement for the following reasons.

First, travelling with a tour guide will limit time for free activity. For example, in 1995, when I was a tenth grader in keio High School, a private high school in Japan, I went to Korea on a field trip. Since it was a trip scheduled by the school, and we had to move in a group, the trip was guided by a tour guide and all the schedule on the trip was fixed. There were no free time and as a result, I did not have chance to go to some museums I wanted to go. If the trip had not been guided by a tour guide, I would have had chance to visit places I wanted to go. As the above example illustrates, I truely believe that travelling with a tour guide will limit time for free activity.

Second, there are not much suprises in a trip guided by a tour guide comparing to a trip on our own. For example, last year, I went to Italy and France on our honeymoon. Since we wanted to travel freely, we traveled on our own. Before the trip, we incidently not decide what to do or where to go on some days. In those days we went to some places where some people usually do not go and found many beautiful places. Also, during the trip I found new feature about my wife because the trip was not all guided and we had to decide everything. If we had not traveled on our own, I would not have found these new things. As the above example demonstrates, I personally believe that there are not much suprises in a trip guided by a tour comparing to a trip on our own.

Therefore, I disagree with the statement that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide.
