Understanding ideas and concepts is crucial for students. However, this does not imply that learning facts is less important for learners.

Facts are definition or statements that are real and undebatable. For example, we breathe in air to survive is a undeniable fact. Ideas and concepts can be defined as the explanation of the fact. For example, we breathe in air in order to supply oxygen to body cells for respiration is the concept behind the fact aforementioned.

Facts are important in the way that we have to learn about facts before understand ideas and concepts. For a primary school, if a teacher explains, even relatively brief, an idea to a student of how our brain controls our movement, would you expect him to understand what the teacher is talking about? Would the kid understand those difficult wordings such as nerve impulses and ion carriers? I believe what the student will get is confusion. On the other hand, if the teacher starts by teaching the fact that brain controls all of our movements, I'm quite sure that most students can get the teacher's meaning. In a nutshell, facts are the fundamental knowledge that should be learned by students first.

What follows behind facts are ideas and concepts which are also of paramount importance. Once a student has learnt enough about facts, the next task is to understand the ideas and concepts underneath the fact. These concepts explain the principle behind the fact. Students usually have some questions when learning about facts, for instance, why does our earth rotates around the sun? At this point, when the student has understand enough about the fact "earth rotates around the sun.", it is time for him or her to learn about the concept behind the fact---"earth rotates around the sun due to gravitational force". Ideas and concepts let the student to have the whole image of the fact which is crucial for students who are studying.

Facts are important as they give a clear definition to student first as they are unable to understand the principle behind it. when the student has developed enough to understand. Ideas and concepts are taught in order to give a comprehensive image to the student. Therefore, ideas an concepts are essential equally.
