I studied law and I think that in this kind of studies it's more important for the students to understand and assimilate ideas and concepts than learn facts only by one reason: The facts can be modify.

It's a simple reason but not easy to understand, so I try to explain it well.

In my point of view if you understand and assimilate an idea or a concept you can understand what is the essence of the idea and then you can create in your mind a general structure of this idea. If you do it, you have the main idea, the general idea, and you can change the elemental structure if it's neccessary for the situation, because the situation can change, but if you have the general idea, the basic knowledge to solve the new situation, you can do it. And to have this general idea, first of all, you must understand the problem, the idea and understand too the basic concept.

I think that is worst to learn facts by one reason, it's impossible than one fact will be repeated, it could be similar, or very similar if you want, but the fact won't be the same fact, and in this case, when you find something very similar but not the same as you know, you can be blocked because all is not the same as you know, and then, you have a new problem, similar than the other that you know, but not the same, and you can't resolve it if you don't open your mind to the ideas or concepts, so in this point, it's better or easier to start understanding the ideas and the concepts than start learning the facts.

As a resume, this is my idea and my principal reason to think that it's better to understand ideas and concepts than learn facts because it permits you to have an open mind and more points of view about one problem, and if you have the base, you can see a situation, think about it and solve the problem, in the other case, you will see a situation, but it's not the situation that you know so it's probably that you will be blocked and can't solve and hipothetycal problem.
