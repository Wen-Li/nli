I agree to the statement that it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts.

I can say from my own experience that I often tried to learn just the facts. It was easy. I reviewed the material at home. I was not very active at class. Just had some day dreams. I did not joined class discussions.

One day we wrote an exam. I got an very low grate. We needed to express our own ideas and concepts. I did not know this I just knew all the facts.

Then a started to change my behavior. I tried to understand the ideas not only of the teacher but of the other students as well. 
That realy made an big impact in my educational life. I started thinking by myself. It was fantastic. It was not about leraning facts, it was about a higher understanding of a tobic. I even joined discussion in class. I could not belived it, school started to be fun. I loved to be there. I was realy motivated. By the way, my next exam was great! 

A also like to motivate other people to concentrade on the understanding of ideas and concepts.

When my younger brother went to his first school day I just explained these leassons to him. I said to him: Try to understand the ideas of the teacher. My brother asked why and I gave him different reasons.

First, you will enjoy the school more.
Second, you will learn more.
Third, you will join discussion in class
My brother did so. I also liked school a lot. 

In conclussion, I learnd that school is much more fun when I understand the facts. I love to debate with others. I love to understand there ideas. I believe that understanding of ideas is not only important in school but also in  professional live. In my work as an sales man I need the ability to understand other people. I learnd it at school. I am very gratefull for this expierience.
