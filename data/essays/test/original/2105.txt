Although having a knowledge of the facts is important for students, I think that a better understanding of the idea and concepts that caused the facts is crucial for a student's growth and development.

First of all, a truly understanding of the facts is only possible through  an indepth understanding of the idea or concepts behind them. For example, I read on the "Discovery Magazine" that in 2007 some scientists have thought about the opportunity to delete bad memories from an individual brain. This is a fact that may not be understood by people that haven't had a bad experience. Apparently, the idea behind this fact is that a bad experience occurred in an indivual's childhood may have a negative impact on the individual's life. By eliminating the memories of a bad experience the indivual may live a "normal " life. For example, let's assume that a child was abandoned when he was 5 years old. He will remember the feeling of abandonement everytime someone that he loves leaves for a trip or moves to another city. Such person will then be less inclined to get closer to other people because he knows that if he loves them, at a certain point they will leave and he may suffer. By eliminating the memories of his abandonement, he may leave better and without misconceptions.

Furthermore, knowing the idea or concepts behind a chemistry or a biology fact, for example, may help the student in applying that idea (or concept) to other discipline and find an explanation of similar results. 

In conclusion, although knowing the facts is important, only a knowledge of the idea or concepts behind the facts may give a better and complete understanding of why and how something happens. This is true in all disciplines, from history to science to chemistry to biology and so on.
