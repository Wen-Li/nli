Nowadays we are exposed to advertisements during the whole day.
We listen to them on the radio when we wake up, we read them in the newspaper, we watch them on television or while driving our car.
Advertisement campaings are an essential part of the marketing of every product and companies invest a lot of money in them, sometimes much more of what they invest for the manufacturing of a product.
In all modern countries governaments and parliaments had introduced specific rules in order to regulate advertisements and give a little proctection to consumers.
Of course, in advertisements all products seem nicer and more useful.
It must be so, since the advertisements are made to sell the them and the success of an advertisement campaign depends on the sale results of these products.
I usually do not give much attention to advertisements and I try to buy just what I need. 
However, I remember that I bought a pair of shoes just because I had been convinced by the advertisement.
According to it, this particular shoe had a rubber sole with a special membrane, which allowed the sweat to go out through small holes in the sole while letting the water outside.
It seemed a good idea to me, because it matched the advantages of a leather sole, which is naturally breathable but not water-proof, and the advantages of a rubber sole, which is water-proof but not breathable.
Unfortunately, reality was very different from theory. The first time I used these shoes in the rain I came home with my feet soaked in water.
Since that day I listen to advertisments with more suspect and I always think that they are trying to cheat me somehow.
Of course it is not always so. 
Many good products are advertised and may advertisements are correct and fair.
