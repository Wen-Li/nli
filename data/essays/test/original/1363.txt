 I agree with the statement that there will be fewer cars in use in twenty years than there are today. I have three reasons why I think so.
    The first reason is that another transportation system will be more comfortable than now such as trains and bus. In some country it is impossible to move to another places without cars. And so, many people have to use cars. However, 20 years is long enough to spread another transportation systems. There are still few transportation systems in the country side. In some places, there is no transportation system at all.
    The secound reason is that people will care about environment more. Cars are not good for earth's environment. Even now many people care about earth's environment, I think there will be much more people who care earth's environment in the future. Trains is better than cars about environment because trains can move much more people than cars with same enogy. And trains work with erectricity which is better than fossil enegy for environment. Recently car companies are deveropping new cars which are good for environment, but I think even such cars are not better than trains.
    The third reason is about population. Population of the world will not increase any more. And the ratio of elder people is increasing. Older people doesn't prefer to drive cars because it is dangerous. These days many elder people were killed by car accidents. 
    Because of above reasons, I think there will be fewer cars in use in twenty years. I also wish there will be fewer cars because of environment and reducing car accidents. Many people wish there will be fewer cars as I think. This is another reason why I think there will be fewer cars in the future.
