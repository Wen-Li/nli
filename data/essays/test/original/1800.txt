Nowadays, advertisements are more popular in people's lives. People are likely to buy some products accoding to the advertisements. However, i believed that most advertisements are over the truth and not as good as they show on TV. And my reasons are as follows.

First, many advertisements on keeping fits is not useful as they are. They will show us some medicines which can make you become thinner within a week or a month. Maybe it is real, but you should pay great price both on money and on health. Usually, the medicine to keep fits will do harm to the human body. And in advertisements, they will never mention this.

Second, some women are interested in the cleaning products. The advertisements always say their products can make you do less work and get more affect. However, there will be bad results. That is that they used some harmful chemicals which have a great power to clean things, at the same time have great power to destroy things. It will often shorten the span of your furniture.

Finally, the most important one, is the food advertisements. Everyone should buy food everyday. So the advertisements make use of this to enlarge the sale of their food. No matter how much nutrition it concludes, they will say it without hesitation such as including Vc, Ve, and so on. It will change people's judgement for their real needs. It is bad particularly for children. They are in a period of growing, so the wrong diet of food will destroy their health dramatically.

Based on what i have disscused above, a safe conclution can be drawed. The majority of our advertisements is not as good as they showed to us, and most of them even take harm to our health and life.
