Helping communities is a topic, which is discussed very often. Especially young people do not give enough time to supporting of their communities. There are three main reasons for this statement.
First, young people have a lot of other interests that take a lot of their time. Children nowadays are more interested in computers. Many parents complain that their children spend most of the day in front of the computer. Therefore the children do not have the chance to participate in social life as they mainly stay at home. This brings me to my second point.
Kids consider it more important nowadays to know the latest computer game. It is not considered to be "cool" to help other people or even to support the community. Today it is very important what other people think. Especially children do not receive a high reputation from their friends when they help the community. It is therefore not very popular. 
Finally, there are not many possibilities for children to support the community. I know this problem from my own experience. I tried to get involved in social activities in the city I live in. I had difficulties to find institutions that offer possibilities for me. In addition, I only have the possibility to support the community during my free-time. Most activities take place during my normal workday and it is not possible for me to participate. As I have already had those difficulties, how much more difficult will it be for children to be engaged in social activities? As a result, young people may get discouraged when they try to help the communities.
In summary, nowadays it is unpopular for young people to support their communities and they may have other interests. It is also not easy for young people do be active in the community. Therefore, I agree that young people do not give enough time to help their communities.
