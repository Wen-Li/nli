Nowadays, with benefits of technological industry and development of vehicles, many people can travel to other countries or travel far place very easily.  Some people like to travel in group with tour guide, but others like to travel by their alone.  I prefer to traveel in a group led by a tour guide rather than travel alone for three reasons.
  First of all, it can be more academical travel with guide.  One would be the first time visiting the place, but the guide knows very well about the place because he or she guides the place for long time.  The guide can led people to many kind of museums or famous places that we must visit.  For example, when foreign people came to Korea, they would not know well about popular places of Korea, but guide can lead them to interesting and academical places such as Kyung-bok-gung.
  Secondly, you may not worry about lost ways in new place.  Some people are very bad at looking for ways.  In my experience, I have lost in new town where I visited for two times.  If I were traveling with guide, maybe I would not lost my way. 
  Finally, traveling with lots of new people in group will be very meaningful.  Visiting many places and having own time can be reason of travel for some people, but making new friends can be another good reason of travel, too.  For instantce, the group of people are first time to the place as same as you, except the guide.  So usually in that kind of trip, guide give free time to make people to become friend and know with each other.  If you make a friend in a trip, you can keep in touch and get to another travel together if there is another chance. 
  For three reasons I mentioned, to make a trip more academic, to not lost ways, and to make new friends, traveling in a group with tour guide is the best way.
