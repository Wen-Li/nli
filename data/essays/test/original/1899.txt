I do agree with the given statement. I think a main fact is that having success rather pushes one forward than staying on the same level or taking steps backwards. For example a gymnast who just successfully tried a new more difficult jump at the vault is willing to go further and try another new difficult jump in the future compared to a gymnast who has not much success in learning new jumps or moves. This last persons is rather discouraged by the former experience than the successful person. Success generally encourages people in trying new things and taking risks. 
I do agree with the fact that it also depends on the individual as far as character and habits but there are people who might start taking riskes, who have never done so before as a result of positive experience in the past which encouraged them to act more risky than before. Therefore I think the individuals character affects that habit only to a certain degree.
Human being also tend to rather want to go forward and experience new terretories than staying where they are. That desire is even greater when one is successful because it makes one feel good. Eventually one wants more of that feeling and therefore tries to find ways of getting to that point again. Of course it can result in surrender and discourage but even then one would try again to get to that level of success. 
Another example could be a player in a casino. At the beginnig this person has not won anything yet but once he or she starts winning it will be hard to stop because there could be more to win and it gives a certain pleasure. A fact why many people can't stop playing is the feeling they get by winning, which is enormous at gambling.
The feeling of success is one mayor cause of people taking even more risks.
