  In my personal opinion is more important for students to undertand ideas and concepts, than, only learn facts. Learning about the ideas and concepts you would problably get in to the facts, knowing step by step how is the result. The develp of the fact would give you the meaning and the principal idea of it. Why does occur? It is not only a matter of simple proccess.
  Moreover some facts has an extensive proccess that is difficult to learn, but, you would get incomplete information if you only learn the fact. I think, If you want to have a complete formation in any subject, the ideas and the concepts will teach you differents facts. For example, The idea that Roman were the most important ancient poblation, It is a fact, but the concept is valid if you know that they develop a lot of construction tools, and a pretty well develop sociaty, during the conquest and empire.
  Also the ideas and he concepts can give you the opportunity to create your own facts, studing the develp of some facts you will see new ways of one simple result.
  In addition one fact could had more that one option to be solve, but if you do not undertand the main idea, you will probably get in the error that they already found.  
In conclusion, understanding ideas and concepts, would give you the enough tools to have different options that one fact can give.
