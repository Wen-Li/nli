As we all know and see in our daily lives, some people are somehow more successful than others in various things. This fact has many reasons such as studying more, concentrating and focusing to the right points, searching freely and intensively and investigating with full energy and time. But shouldn't we also consider that they try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well?
     According to some point of view, successful people are the ones, who achieve things well, which are familiar to them. In that way, they could get professionalized and specialized in one subject and get more and more practical each time. As an example, we can consider a baker who bakes the same kind of bread every morning. It can't be denied that he could become better in it, in comparison to other bakers, who bake different cookies or cakes each day. 
     Although there are views that people should often try what they already know, in my opinion this won't contribute to real success. If people try new things, face with different alternative problems and situations each time, this makes him/her more experienced. Sometimes there may be few difficulties in finding out new information or doing unfamiliar things, but soon this can be got over. It is important to mention that people who take risks, adjust to the various alternatives and situations more easily. So, this could help in urgent situations. Let's assume a firm that is in bankruptcy situation. It couldn't go on with its current goals and strategies. So, it needs to continue with new plans and orientations. For this, open minded and successful people are reqired and these people should be able to get risks and become used to find new ways.
     What can be concluded from these facts is that successful people are the ones, who are open to new alternatives and tryings,because the real success, as they know, is to confront with changeable and unstable variations instead of sticking to one familiar point. In retrospection to what I said, i agree that successful people try new things without frustration, even if some risky events may occur from time to time.
