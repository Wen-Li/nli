First of all I want to say that I strongly disagree with the statement.
There are many exemples of young people actively involved in the support of their communities.
The first exemple I want to provide is in the environement protection in my city.
My city is near the cost and so young people are really concerned about the problem of the pollution of the sea.
There are an association in my city in which young and less young people spend a lot of their time to promote the respect for the sea.
Each year the association organize the cleaning of the beach and young people partecipate always in alrge number.
An other exemple of young people actively involved in the life of the community is the men and the women that every evening and every night give their support to people in a difficult situation.
I personally have a sister and a friend that two times a week serve the dinner for poor people in the cafeteria of the local.
An other exemple is myself.
In my university there is an association involved in a program for the development of poor countries.
This organization is composed mainly by students or young engineer that during the years organize events to promote the activity of the organization and to collect the money.
The money is used to finance the construction of bridges and shool directly in Africa.
I really don't believe that young people do not give enough time in helping thier communities.
In our society is really hard to find the time for other but I think that my generation has made a great job in balancing its/self and others.
