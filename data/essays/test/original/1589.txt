The important fact from the learning is the quality of the knowledge. The learning has a purpouse and it is how much a learner  knows from a concept or a theme and what these are involved. Moreover, others importants concerns are the contexts and the related terms of a specifical theme. So, I agree with the statement that the students learn more when they understand ideas and concepts rather than learn facts. 

An important fact to advocate this is the porpouse of the learning.
The basic porpouse of a learning is the quality of the information. When a students learn a theme or a topic he or she learns in order to satisfy the hungry of knowledge. So he or she wants to look out for more information, then he or she starts to learn and comprehend the basic ideas and concepts that this involve. Whereas a learner starts to find out information based on facts, he or she doesn't connect the ideas and the context of the facts, so the learners start to hesitate about the basic mean of the theme.

Another point to explain the importance of learn from ideas and concepts is the importance of know the terms and concepts related to a specific topic. Every single theme are retaled with others themes, so when a learner understant the main ideas and concepts he or she can inferr about the other related  concepts just making connection with the ideas learned formerly. On the other when a student udenrstand only the facts he or she does not inferr about the other topics, again this causes confussion and makes the learning boring.

In fact, is not important for learners to know facts rather than learn ideas and concepts. Kwowing more about the related topics and sastifying the hungry of knowledge the learner can take advantage of the learning procces.
