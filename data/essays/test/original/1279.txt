I completely agree in thinking that people opinion on a product can be better than effective aspects of product  because of advertising, but I think this is part of the work that the industries do to sell much products and I do not criticize them for theese reasons.
A lot of product take a great advantage by using advertisements and, because of this, industries spend a great amount of money in advertising.Sometimes this costs are higher than the costs spended in developing and taking materials for products.
If they decided to spend so much money is because they know they can earn more that what they spended.
This is a correct way of working just if are not shofake caracteristic about the product. In Italy, the country where I live, law does not permit to advertise a product with not real caracteristic and an industry can have expensive fines if what they tell about a product in not real.
Some years ago was not permitted also comparation between a product and another, but with new rules government introduced this aspect in advertising that increase his fame by an important comparation between Pepsi Cola and Coca Cola.
There are another way used by industries to improove popularity in products. That is using amazing words of ingredients that can stupify the listener or the reader. In Italy is easy to listen an advertising that talk about a shampoo or a product for washing dishes linked with an important chemestry product such as pro-vitamins or other that maybe do not increase powerful of product but surely increase interests in who is listening.
Finally I think that, even usually you can buy a product that does not respect your hoping, if the advertising respect rules and laws, you must not protest or criticise it.
