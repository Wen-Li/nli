In twent years there  will be fewer cars in  use than there are today. I do not think it is really possible and hence, I completely disagree with this statement. 

Over the last decades the automobile engineering has definitely made giant strides in terms of advancement and to me it does not seem to wither away so easily. A burning building cannot be put off in one minute even by the fire brigade. In this case I have observed that car machinery and technology has definitely become much better over the years owing to the burgeoning needs of the customers.If I talk of my country, India, I have seen here many number of multinationals pop up during the last decade only and manufacture cars for sale in the market.This definitely indicates that business tycoons are not restraining from investing millions in this industry.

The chief reason I feel that the number of cars in use would not decline is we, the customers.It would be strange if I ask anyone that would he stop driving a car after twenty years?He would give me a surprised look as the question sounds absurd.People hope to buy new bigger better cars in future as provided by their finances, they never think of giving away the old car and give up driving.Thus its the customer that has evoked the need of better cars, faster cars and more and more technologically advanced cars.With time the economic status and level of the common man is also increasing and thus allowing him to harbour dreams of buying a new car or a bigger and more novel car.

Another reason for me to support my opinion would be that if people won't travel by cars then how will they travel.It is noticeable that trains and aircrafts do not reach each and every place and hence we have to resort to cars in any case.Its worth mentioning here that a recent survey conducted by the Outlook magazine of India clearly illustrated the view of the people that they enjoy car-driving much more than any other means of transport.Even if I contemplate, I realize that there is nothing as thrilling and fun as going oyt in a car with my family or friends.

If we look around ourselves we will dicover that there are universities which are promoting bachelor's degree in Automobile Engineering and scores of students are undertaking these courses .It does not signify a decline in the upcoming years as these graduates are readily being employed in corporate houses.In India, the number of cars have increased approximately tenfold in the last decade and so in other countries too more cars are coming on the road.

In the conclusion I would say that in present day circumstances I see no evidence to prompt me to support the view that there would be fewer cars in the next twenty years.
