I can't really say that I agree or disagree with that statement. On the one hand young people are very engaged helping their communities and on the other hand there are also young people who do not really care. I would like to give two examples to explain my opinion.
I have a neighbour he is sixteen years old. In his freetime he goes to the mainoffice in town and works in a group of youth that tries to help creating our community. His name is Marc, he is very helpful and open minded. After finishing school he wants to study politics. Since he was a little boy he dreamed of being a politician someday. He is the leader of this so called political youth group and has some interessting ideas concerning the environment of our town. This group plans new places where teens can meet and talk about family problems. Furthermore they help a agricultural group to collect some ideas for the new park. It is very interessting to see how much he likes his freetime activity. Besides, the groupe increases month by month because he is able to motivate other boys and girls to enter the group.
My second example is about another boy who is the opposite of Marc. His name is Andre and his freetime activity deals with hanging around the whole day. He is an aggressive person and provocates the people around him. He does not care for his community. Sometimes I believe he does not even know what community means. Last week his class went to the mainoffice in town and watched the work of some politicians. Some pupils seemed to be very interessted in visiting that office. He and his friends does not. They ran away and started hanging around again. In my opinion Andre is a very lonesome boy. Both, mum and dad have a fulltime job. They do not really care for him. Marcs mother, for example, spends a lot of time with him. 
You can see in my examples that there exist different types of young people. Sometimes it depends on their social environment and their families how they act. Because of these two examples I can not really agree or disagree with the statement.
