I agree that it is always better to have a broad knowledge rather than to become perfect only in one subject. It is true that it is difficullt to learn all the subject at once. But, if we think that we are wasting our time in reading all books, learning all the subjects then that would be not appropriate. Learning all subjects and becoming perfect in all subjects it would help us in future.

In my veiw, learn all subjects, as far as we can. In life academic knowledge is very much important to go ahead and take not only  one subject but also take part in all most all subjects how much we can cover. Later, in future if we get an oppurtunity in a particular feild where we are not perfect we have to lose that oppurtunity.

Becoming perfect only in one subject, we will probably face some difficulties in finding a job or to set up a business. For example, if we study all subjects like accounts, business management, statistics, etc., would all mainly help us in all feilds if we are searching for a job. Mainly in any company where we attend an interview they would rather ask us any question related to any subject at that time we might face a problem. At that time we will be blank and thinking whats the answer is? But, If we are perfect in all then no one can stop us to answer the question. We would be appreciated for that and get a recognition on the day one itself.

As the trends are changing the thinking power of  a human is also changing. He wants to gain more and more information as he can. He wants to be the top one in the world. He can be a perfect men or women in the world. Gaining all the academic knowledge and applying it in the personal life or at work place it changes our career. So that if some one points out that he is weak in this then its a negetive remark. Finally, its always better to be the best among all.
