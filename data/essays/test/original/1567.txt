Some people say that it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts them to learn facts,if I could make decision then I could choose that to learn facts is much important when we l are learning.three most crucial reasons why I think facts is much useful are listed as follows, we can associate with society;we can understand more quickly by handling a situation;moreover testbook and definition is not always true.

One very convicing argument for associating with society is the best way to clarify what is the fact that we will encounter in the future.For example we could meet a lot of people and they can share a lot experient eith us, futhermore no one can deny the fact that associating with society could make us more confidential.

A point also very wealth to noticing is that to handle a situation is the shortcut which we could pass the process from textbook .For instance if we learn much more facts or do somemore experiments form lab that can make us understand more faster and make deep impression in our mind,furthermore in some parts of departments facts is always more important then idea and concepts,only by doing yourself that could help you more.

Last but not the list ,all of we know that ideas and concepts just similar as definition in testbook,not everlasting true ,and much of then we can not prove it , as examplification from a brightly frame of reference it is no way to prove why E=MCsquare . moreover if we dought about that and no mathod to prove we will feel distress.

In summary I protest the point that ideals and concepts are more important then to learn facts, as I mentioned sometimes concepts are no more reliable but perilous to us if we have no opportunity to prove that.after all to learn fact is much bet
