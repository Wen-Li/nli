 I completely disagree with the thought of "the best wat to travel is in a group led by a tour guide". there are a couple of reasons why I think this way. Let me tell you one by one.
 Firstly, guided tour does not allow me to look around anywhere. If I want to go to somewhere else to where the tour will not visit, I could not visit there. Also, I maight have to go somewhere I do not want to visit.
 Secondly, in guided tour, there is timekeeper. Whether I want to stay more or leave as soon as possible, they will not allow me to do so. For example, when I visited Kyoto in that tipe of tour, I had no enough time to see the place, because in that tour, we had to visit many places in a day, so we had only thirty minute per place suprisingly. And the makes matters worth, we spent a long time in a bus.
 Thirdly, when I travel in a group led by a tour guide, there are few oppatunity to meet and talk with people who live around there. Meeting new people is one of interesting purpose of traveling. when I visited Malaysia on my own, I made many firends there and people who lived in there tald me much about not only the place but also their custom. On the other hand, when I visited U.K. in that kind of tour, I did not make friends with anyone.
 The last but most impotant, reserching and finding about the place by myself is the best intersting thing in a trip! So, the guide tell me all about the place is something boring for me. Truly, guids are kind to tell information, I appreciate that, however reserching by myself is more inte
 These are why I do not prefer traveling in a group led by a tour guide. Seeing to anywhere, staying anytime, meeting new people, and fiding about something are the goal of the travel.
