Any company has at least an objective to increase its products' sales. For that, the company's management should do several methods to reach this goal. For example, the management is supposed to enhance the products' quality, decrease their cost and let the customers recognize their features and benefits.

How can the company let the customers recognize the company' products with thier benefits and features? The answer is clear that it should be done by having many advertisements using news papers, TVs and others to advertise the company's products.

However, I totally agree that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are. The reason is, as I indicated in the first paragraph, to increase the products' sales in order to increase the company revenue and profet as well.

In my opinion, the customers who have the responsiblities to recognize good products from bad products by not believe all the companies' advertisements but check and verify this by themselves. For example, if there is an advertisement in the TV says when you have or buy a Toyota car, you will get better maintenance services by repair your car within 24 hours only. In fact, this advertisement could be true for someone who live in NY but not in Middle East. For that, the customer should check his/her local market and verify that this type of services are available in order to get a new car. In addtion, the customer may have this 24 houre maintenance service for mainting his/her car but the quality of the maintenance services will be low and not as it should be if he/she use to get in different car maintenance shops. 

In conclusion, any company should consider the advertisements method as one of the major objective to reach thier customers. As a result, mosts advertisements make products seem much better than they really are. For that, the customers should recognize and check the products not only by these advertisements but also by other ways.
