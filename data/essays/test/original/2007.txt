I agree the statement that successful people try new things and take risks rather than what they already known for the following reasons.

First, we have to do the anther way which our competitors do to  compite and dominate the market. For example, when I was 26, I worked for a internet advertising company. There were lots of competitors in the market becase internet advertising market grows rapidly. Our company, Cirius Technologies, had to aproach our clients in another way to which our competitors proposed because we started our job later to our rivals. So, we need innovation. We introduced new technology for easy manegement of our client's budget. Our sales was increased rapidly because of our new technology. If we had sold our service the same way of our competitor, we wold not have changed our situation.

Second, taking risks is chance after all. When I was in the company I mentioned, we were not affuluent. In business, the terms to success are much resouuces, especially great employee. We took the risk to finance from bank to invest for 

For those reasons I mentioned above, I strongly believe that successful people try the things which have not known already.
