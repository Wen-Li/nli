Advertisements are widespred and they play a mayor role in today society, since they significantly influence the behaviour of the masses. While it is generally believed that advertisements always make products seem much better than they really are, in my opinion this is not exactelly true, since a distinction has to be made on the type of product and on the type of customers.

The main objective for all kinds of advertisment is to emphasize all the positive aspects of a product, and this often translates into totally neglecting the negative ones. This is only possible for non technical products, or products which are not conceived for professionals. In this case a lie or a non working feature would lead to the opposite effect.

In the case of non tecnical products which are to be used by masses, advertisments usually aim at stimulating the more subconscious and subjective ideas of the consumers. The value of the object is therefore not the value of the bare object itself, but the value that society gives to it. A very popular example is the iPod by Apple, which has become a status symbol.

It is very difficult to evaluate the value of an object by looking at its advertisments. I pesonally think that in general advertisments are quite objectives and it is people that give objects they see in the ads more value, due to the appeal that the advertisement is able to give.
