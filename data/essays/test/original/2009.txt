I Agree with the statement that the best way to travel is in a group led by tour guide.Following are the reasons why i support the statement.

     Though travelling alone or in a group is good because it provides you feasibility to decide what to do and when to do .When you tavel alone you can not decide on  your budget and you may not even control your expences.While travelling in a group you can have control over your budget and can spend limited amount  in the journey.
       Sometimes it is possible  for the budget of the travel to increase  since we do not know about the good and cheap hotel to stay that are available in the area.Sometimes the time factor may be one concern to deal with because do not know the exact places to move and see them .Having a guide along will solve the problem when we go to new places and can have  good tour along with the guide.
           A guide would know  the best  place  to  stay  which would match our budget and also plan a proper time schedule for us to see the best places around without much problems.Since a guide also knows  the best places for us to visit we can have a brief idea of the places of visit and choose where we would like to go also when we visit the place we may not know  much of the importance of that  place.
It is guide who can slove this problem  owing  to   the fact that  he is a localite and knows each and every place over there.
So having a guide along with you lessen your problem to see the  places arround and also can control the budget from your end also. Though hireing a guide might be a bit expensive but still u can have more satisfaction  on the tour as you can see all the  best places around.As I could remember the last time when i went around myself i couldn't catch up with my budget and also the time. 
  So i prefer and agree with the best way to travel is in group led by a tour guide
