I strongly agree to this statement that it is more importang for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts. This may be supported through several ideas and points. 
Firstly, understood ideas and concepts are a much more reliable and useful type of knowledge rather than memorised facts. Having spent my school life in two very different countries; Japan and Australia, I have experienced both ways of learning. An effective example of this would be the way science was taught. In Japan, we were expected to memorise all the scientific terminologies and definitions of key terms. The exams were focused on how much information students were able to memorise from the text books rather than how much they could understand and develop. At my current school in Australia, the teachers expect us to understand concepts and develop them in our own ways. The exams are frequently based on basic concepts that were taught in classes and how we can adopt that to a situation in real life or a new scenario provided. I find that the knowledge I have gained at my Australian school has been more useful in real life and makes sense, whereas the information I learnt by memorising never made complete sense to me, or connect with the other facts I knew. 
In addition, I think that ideas and concepts that are once understood are more difficult to forget. Memorising can be an effective way of studying in the short term, but these facts are often forgotten in a short period of time and it is unlikely that students will be able to remember those facts in the future. Opposed to this, understood facts enables students to develop their own ideas based on them and expand their knowledge. Also, as these forms of knowledge will not be forgotten easily even after a long period of time, it makes it easier for students to link what they have learnt in their previous years of study with what they are studying in their later years of study. 
Although learning and understanding ideas and concepts are more important, I think that learning facts still plays an important role in gaining knowledge. No matter how well the concept is understood, if the key terms or relative definitions are not memorised, it makes it difficult for the student to demonstrate his knowledge or convey his ideas based on them. Thus, I think that a minimum amount education should focus on making students learn facts by memorising. 

In conclusion, although I agree to the statement that it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts, I cannot deny that learning facts also plays a significant role in studying as well. They each cover different types of information and thus is benefitial in different ways. Therefore, I reccomend that education should be primarily based on enabling students to understand concepts and ideas but also it is required for a minimum amount of some basic definitions and terminologies to be learnt by making students memorise them.
