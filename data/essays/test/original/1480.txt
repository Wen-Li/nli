In the following i am going to discuss if jung people nowerdays are giving enough time to help their communities.
I think that this is a difficult question but i would definetly answer it with "no". In my oppinion jung people nowerdays often just care about themselfes. They are not really interessted in their community and in other people around them. To give you an example: I am speaker for the students in our school and we often have new ideas which could make our school better and our buildings nicer. But most of the people around me never care. They like to have longer breaks and coulored walls but they would never do something to change the situation. They always think that there will be others to work for them - and most times they are right. I think that is one of the reasons jung people changed, because they know that there will be no followings if they do not care about their community. And they know that there are always others who will care.
I red an article in the newspaper "Die Welt" yesterday. There it said that jung people have not learned to help others and to be responsible. Parents simply do not teach it them. So they grow up without caring about anyone else, they seem to have their own problems. So i might have a very negative oppinion, but i think that many jung people nowerdays are very egoistic and there are often just a few who care about others. 
In Germany there are some organisations to care for the community, they clean up, help old or disabled people and they try to get money for that. The number of jung members decreased a lot during the last ten years. It is the same in churchprograms. There are a lot of jung people who are not interested in making work without beeing paied. 
A reason for that might be, that everything is getting more and more expensive and living is not that easy. So jung people habe no time or no money to care for others. But i think that is a very unimportant reason. 
Years ago when people had less than we have today they also cared about their community. I think the vallues of the people had changed and what is important in life. 
So as a conclusion i would say that jung people nowerdays do not give enough time to help their communities and i think that should change.
