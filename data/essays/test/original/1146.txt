Affirming that young peolple don't dedicate much time to their communities may be a generalization, because you will always find some youngers that are really involved in their communitiy life, but I quite agree on this statement.

Indeed, I think that young people are sensitized too late in life to the issues that touch their communities. In most cases, they are only concerned by their hobbies, their friends and families during the first part oh their life. Studies and enjoyment are often the only things that matter to them during their daily life. People begin to realise that their commuties encounter issues and and are motivated to try to help them only when they are older and often when they are touched by some of these problems.

In fact, this problem is maybe related to our educational system. even if chidren and then students are told that it's really important to take part in the social life of their communities and to adopt a civilian behaviour, these are just recommandations. Children are rarely obliged to set up a project that could contribute to helping their communities. young people are rarely encouraged to involves themselves in charities.
To illustrate this idea, I will give a personnal example. I have been attending a business school for one year and during the past year we had to plan a tea; project and to achieve it. We were free to choose the project which attracted us. Many projects which were launched failed and among those which have been realized, many were not interesting. I think that the school should oblige students to chose projects wich are related to their communities are to a charity in order to create a work that could be useful to everyone.

It's sure that so;;e young people decide to involve one selves to projects useful to their co;;unities. They are too few.And educationsyste
