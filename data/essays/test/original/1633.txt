The thesis given poses a question that whether most advertisers make product seem much better than they they really are.I  agree fully with the assertion that the above statement is correct.

Development of human civilization has given birth to commercialisation and industrialisation.Advertisement is a major part of commercialism.To sell its product more than its's competetor advertisement is used.Companies driven in complete madness to earn more,have produced an era which has produced the level of excellency in the field of advertisement that has never been experienced before.Now even the financially bankrupt companies cannot afford to exsit without having a separate adbvertisement and publicity deparrtment.This department is full of hilly skilled technician and artists which work together in such a way so as to display the valubility of the product more than what it's worth.

At this moment i would like to give the reader the example of manchester united.thy are one the the most known football clubs in the world.Their players such as Cristiano Ronaldo was signed as a brand ambassodor for the pepe jeans.His stunnings looks while wearing the jeans during the advertisement inuces a sort of feeling in the watcher's heart that he could be comparable to ronaldo in appearence if he wore the pepe jeans.Thus the brand value of the jeans is increased and Ronaldo through advertisement has made the jeans worthier than it's inherent quality.Hence companies use many celebrities as brand ambassodors which seeing openly as the name itselfs states increase the value of the brand.

Telecom services giants vodafone for this reason endorsed   manchester united.Also that's the reason why Bradd Pitt is endorse by Rollex,a giant watch-maker.The advertisement war began in the 1970's when the cola war began between pepsi and coke.Each tried to outdo one another by hiring the best team of technicians which could produce the best visual effect in television available at that time.But one must realise that the inherent value of the product will not change.

In the end I wold like to convey that one must be aware of the true qua;ities of the product in case of final buying and not become a trap -goat of the advertisers.One must be a vigilant and alert buyers.The masses should not be influenced by advertisements and spend in a wise way as every penny is worth the fun.
