knowledge is been the aim of all mankind throughout the centuries.But knowledge needs a widely opened people capable of receiving and learning from what they are getting through years.
Some people spend their life collecting information from all their experiences through life.These have experience and good connections with all types of people and miscelleneous subjects.Others sit down,put their priorities in front of them,and highlight what they want to know,so they specialize in a subject they feel interested in.
Here is the race with time and intellegence.People starts working on gaining as much knowledge as their mind can hold in a specific period so they can benifit of what they know and give information to others.To have broad knowledge in several subjects increases the appreciation a man can get and simplifies lots of obstacles stopping his way.while being specialized in one subject makes the admiration a lot more and in every place.The rank of the specified person makes him more sure of himself and that's because he focused on a specific major and this shows organization and self esteam.
i believe that both categories of educated people are needed to improve a society and goes forward through life.Progress is achieved with both the organised specialized and the wide minded people.
