I disagree with the statement that it is better to have a broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subjects. For this opinion I have several reasons.

First, I think if one specializes in a specific subject, one will be able to spend a lot more time on this subject than one would if one studied a wide range of different subjects. This extra time can then be spent on studying the one subject one has chosen even more detailed and get deeply into it. If one is real good at it, one may even do some research on it and discover or invent new things, which can be enourmously helpful to society. This is to say, education will be more effective and productive this way.

Secondly, if one does not specialize one will never become real good at something but more likely perform average on most of the classes. This is just simply due to the lack of time. Being average is not a cathastrophy. However, one will never get the sense of achievment one would have when inventing or discovering new things and would thus probably at some point become dissatisvied with oneself, always working pretty hard, but never having a real breakthrough. One may even feel kind of stuck.

Finally, there is proven evidence for my first argument of increased productivity: Our society has developed this way. Back in the times when primitive human beings were hunters and collectors, the strong men had the task to hunt and the women had the task to take care of the children and collect berries and so on. 
Later, job specification took place, because people noticed that if one person has to do all the jobs by him- or herself, he or she will have a very low living standard, as there is no way in which one person could possibly be a cook, a hunter, a plumber, a farmer, a dentist, and so on at the same time.
However, one's living standard can be improved bz job specification: if everybody specializes in one special job, everybody will be a lot better and thus a lot more productive at his or her job. 
If then people start to trade, everybody can be supplied with a lot more and better goods than he or she would have produced by himselelf.
Therefore, job specification is more effective than doing everything by oneself.
This idea can also be transferred to academic subjects: If every student knows a little bit about everything, there will hardly be any progress in research, because the students will be busy studying what has already been found out. But if students specialize, progress is more likely to take place and help the other students as well.
For example if a student in physics or mathemathics found a way to store sun energy, then this would be helpful to all the other students as well as an alternative source of energy.

So after all, I mainly have two different reasons for preferring specification over broad knowledge of a variety of subjects:
First, the increased effectiveness and secondly, the sense of achievement one gets. Moreover, the first argument can even be proven by the fact that society is organized in the same way.
