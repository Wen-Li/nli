This is not an easy question because I think both points are not correct on their own.
At first I think it is very important to understand the main ideas and concepts of a topic. This is true with no doubt. But in my opinion some main facts are essentially to get the main ideas. It seems to me impossible to accept all main ideas without the knowledge of some main points from the topic.
For example my topic of research is Quantum mechanics. In this field exist a few main ideas and concepts like the Schroedinger equation and its interpretation. But with no facts about the topic where it is important to apply this equation you may run in trouble. The fact is that many of the interpretations will not help you in special situation. In these situations you have to know how facts to handle the problem.
Now one may argue, that if someone knows the main ideas he can look in some books and will be able to solve the problem in principle. But if you do not know further facts on the situatuation it will be possible that you have to look in hundreds of books before you will find the correct solution.
An other important point I want to be mentioned is the task of someone to connect different results. If you only understand the main concepts of the broad topic of quantum mechanics you may not be able to connect different fields of research of this main topic. To do this you have to know facts from both fields.
Summarizing my arguments I want to say that to understand main ideas and concepts is very important but without the main facts, which one has to learn, you may run in a lot of trouble while you are doing special research.
