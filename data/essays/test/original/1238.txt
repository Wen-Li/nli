 Nowadays, knowledge is often the basis of every succes. There are many types of knowledges and each of them have it's efficiency in the  day to day life. In my opinion, all the knowledges are importants because each of them will one day in our life help you to figure out the solution for a problem or will help you responding to someome, or just having a discussion with someone. 
    The aim of school is to teach all the basic subjects such as maths, history, biology... and then after when you grow up you start specializing in one subject, and you will use this knowledge in your future work. In order to manipulate a specific subject, you wil need a minimum knkowledge of many other subjects, because all the subjects are part of other subjects. 
    Making the choice of having broad knowledge of many academic subjects or specializing in one specific subject is a choice of life. I think we should have knowledge of everything, but it's not possible. Having knowledge of everything would make us independant and more efficient in life because we would be able to fix everything by ourselves. Thus, we can highlight the fact that people whose success is the best are people who do some specific schools like "Polytechnique". These kinds of school are teaching to people to adapt themselves to any situaion by giving them the basis of everything, and then they specialize in a specific subjects. This kind of formation gives them an asset because they will be specialized in a subject and they wil be also able to do some other tasks and to manage people who do no have the same specialities.         Furthermore, having broad knowledge of many academic subjects will allow to someone to speak with eveybody and to be interesting in every situation, and like I said before, he will have the capacity to adapt himself to any environement. But it is necessary to be specialized in a subject because you will have a main asset and people will recognize yo for this, you will use it in your work and this is the thing that is going to make you different from the other people. 
    As a conclusion, I can not say which choice of life is he best because I realy think we need both of these choices. That's what I am trying to do on my life. I am specializing in Finance bu I also have many knowledges in computing and music and sports and... well I just try to open my mind and improve my knowledge on al the subject that I can have because it gives me an asset, a specific thing that not all the people have. These kind of things makes the difference between two people who are just specialized in a specific subject and the ones who have the same skills, bu also have many other skills. Usually people will choose the second one for a job
