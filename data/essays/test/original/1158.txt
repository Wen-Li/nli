It is debatable whether traveling with a group led by a tour guide is the best way to travel. Some people say that traveling alone is better because if someone travel alone, he or she can spend their time more freely while traveling. However, I agree with the idea that traveling in a group led by a tour guide is better for tourists for the following reasons. First, I can learn about other cultures more precisely by asking them to a tour guide. Second, I can meet diverse people while traveling with group led by a tour guide.

First, if I have a trip in a group led by a tour guide, there would be more chances to ask something related to the country's culture where I visited to the tour guide. The tour guide can offer me accurate information there. For example, when I visited New York CIty alone in 2005, I just enjoyed hanging around the city. However, later I visited New York City with a guide one more time in 2007, I realized that there were too many things I missed. I could not know the history of Rockfeller Center well and did not go to the Wall Street becuase I did not have enough information about where it located when I first traveled to New York.

Moreover, traveling in a gourp led by a tour guide offers me opportunities to meet other people from different cultures through the tour guide. For example, when I visited Egypt during the last winter vacation, I got to know a lot of people there. Especially the tour guide, Al, teached me how to interact with other people from different countries and helped me whenever I was in trouble. We have preious memory and we are keeping touch with each other now.
