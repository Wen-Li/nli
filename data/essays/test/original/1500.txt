Some people hold the idea that if a person wants to be successful, he or she  should try new things and  take risks. Others, have a negative attitude. According to them, people who wants to be succesful should do what they already how to do well. As far as I am concerned, I would like express myself as one of these who agree with the idea that a person who wants to achieve some things ought to take risks and try new things. Among countless factors, I would like to say  two conspicious reasons.      

The first and the foremost reason for my this propensity is that history shows us a person who wants to be succcesful shoud take risks and try new things. When we look at the successful people in history, we can see all of them take risks. Alexander, for example, was a perfect commander and conqurier. He wanted to take the reins of the world. Therefore, he took risks and became the emperor of the world by invading all the world from Europa to India.  

Another reason why I agree with the idea that is stated above is that to discover some things or make an innovation  is one of the way of to be succesful. As a result of this, if a person wants to be succesful, he/she should try new things. As all people know Edison was one of the most succsful person in the world. He tried new things to discover bulb,  even if he was in the thoes of ill. 

As a conclusion, we may react that a person who wants to be succesful sould take risks and try new things.
