Many people think that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide.Others think taht making and organizing a trip by there own is the best way.I think that this kind of trips has both it's own advantages and disadvantages.
    On one hand, guided trips are very good for tourist because they give them the possibility to know all the place they are visiting because the tour guide will know very well that place.In this kinds of trips people learn a lot from the place such as the history and culture and they do not have to worry where to go or visit because they have all scheduled and organized. But the problem comes when a person doesn't feel like doing what is scheduled and wants to do something that they want to, this is not impossible but this person is going to loose for example the money they paid for an expedition. 
    On the other hand, trips by your own have the benefit that you always do what you want and you spend your money in the things that you want to, not in the things scheduled by a tour guide of a group. But the drawback that this type of trip has is that probably you are going to loose much information that a tour guide could have given to you as regard the history of the place or the culture.
    To sum up,I think that both types of trips has it's own advantages and disadvantages, but i don't think that one is better than the other. I believe that the decision of choosing one type or the other depends on the person and the kind of trip he or she wants to do.
