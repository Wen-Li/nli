Today cars are considered as a necessity apart from food, shelter and clothing. But in the years to come cars might neither be a necessity nor a comfort.A gradual transition is bound to take place as far as the traveller's preferences are concerned. Twenty years from now, there will be fewer cars than there are today for several reasons.

There are a lot of other modes of transport that are gaining importance already because of the traffic congestions and pollution problems everywhere. For example, metro rails connecting different cities and those running within the city are being preferred to cars.A city like Mumbai, located in India has shown significant trends in this regard already. The local metros trains are being prefered by the people who own cars themselves because the city has a lot of traffic jams everyday and rails are quicker and convenient.In twenty years from now , there might be more reduction in the use of cars.

Moreover fuel prices would rise in the next twenty years to come and so using cars would be more costlier then. So people would prefer public transportation to cars.And even if they use cars, they would share it with friends. A person going in car alone to his office would prefer to drive along with two or three friends in years to come so that it is affordable.

Another reason is that the environmental concerns about the air pollution due to automobile emissions would limit the use of automobiles including cars, scooters etc in the future. The governments world over are likely to make a lot of infrastructural improvements in the public transportation area to encourage the people to use them and limit the use of automobiles and thus control the air pollution to some extent.

With the reasons mentioned above, I strongly agree that fewer cars would be in use twenty years later than there are today.
