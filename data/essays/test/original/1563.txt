"The best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide".
  
              I disagree with  the statement mentioned above. I am a person like to travel independently with my family. Because they are the persons known to me and being with unknown person is too problem to me. I am very interested to spend with my family because when we grow we cannot stay with them and i will be busy in studies. 

          First reason, when we go alone we don't have lot of time to stay at hotels. But when we are in groups we have listen to the others and have to stay longer time with them. We cannot have an oppurtunity to speak with the locals and we have to stay  along with them upto their work finished.
         
          Second reason, even without a guide  also we can handle the situation because now adays  a tourism book is also available in bookstall and railway stations. Through this book we can visit many palces without a giude. Moreover guide knows only few palces.
After going to the place we can have guide to explain the popular things if we pay to him.
    
     Moreover after the completion of tourism we can return home soon. When we will go with groups of people it will take lots of  time and we cannot reach soon. Even one person is missed we have to wait until the person is found. For job holders it is very difficult to spend  more time because they cannot get more holidays.

       At last even ticket booking is also available in railway stations before some days and we can confirm ticket in this way. We are lots of ways to travel. When person has to return with in two to three days he can travel by airports which will take more time to reach the tourist place. It is probelm to take a guide with them.
