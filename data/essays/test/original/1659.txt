In the present world competations have increased ,many development had taken place it is  hard to do any thing because the people are aware of every thing.There are many number of advertising agencies today , to compete with todays world there should be changes in many things.

Some companies show there product look much better then the  actual product look, it beeing a form of atracting the people.
Advertisements are shown in that wayfor many reasons one being the competation among another company , second beeing increasing the sales , third beeing increasing the profits .

When the products are shown much bigger than they apper , they atract the people to purchase the product  but when  they purchase the product they will become very sad.

Showing the product larger  or better than it appears is a very bad thing, companies or the agencies who are showing advertisement should be punished very severly.advertisement which  show false things make the public fools.

But due to the development the ideas of people also have been changed Now-a-days people dont believe the false advertisement which are shown in the television .

According to my opinion the advertising companies which shows false thing should be banned for ever for doing advertisiments. The advertising agencies dont have any right to make joke and fool the people.
  
According to me a commity shold be made so that every advertisment should  pass the test which the commity conducts i.e., the advertisements should be real (not fictious)
 
I totaly  agree with the statement Most advertisments make products look much better than they really are.
