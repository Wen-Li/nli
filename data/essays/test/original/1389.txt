Growing with the technology and the needs of humans,products are increasing day by day with tremendous rate.So in order to stand in the market the company start advertising their products in which they highlights their product special quality to attract the user.In my view it is acceptable to certai extent but not the whole.
By the increasing number of products now a days company have to compete with their opponents so they give advertisements in order to attract more and more customers.In this they display their special qualities of product so they try to put lot of things which is the quality of the product and some qualities which is not in their product so as to attract user.Lets take an examples of the early 18th century when the population is lesser as a reason needs is lesser and the products are also lesser at that time but with the growing population needs of humans increase tremendously and to fullfill that need products are increased.When their is only one soap available people go for that soap only but now a days with different advertising they go for the soap which his role model likes.Now a days people are not looking about the quality of the material but looks who supports that products.So its totally a  worthwhile.
Secondly as the media technology is increasing day  by day now a days most of the people have television at home and they always spend sometime time in that so people got through new products their and think that if the advertise is good they will prefer that product instead of concern about the quality of the products.
By this advertising the cost of the product also increase in large term as the company have to spend alot of money in advertising.As for the television advertisement, newspapers advertisement,and on hoarding.
Now a days company make brand ambassodors of the product in order to bolster their product so they too spend alot of money in all of this.The person who is popular in the recent time,all the companies approaches to the person and offered brand ambassodership for their product and the famous person demand a good amount of money to do all this.So by all this things i discussed above result in the increase on the product but the people are not concerned about that.
But on the hand when we look at the positive of this advertising that if the advertisement is not their how the people came to know about the various products, whtats new in market,what to buy or not.
In order to flourish companies growth the company start giving advertisement to attract people,this seems to be a well groomed reason to give advertisement of the product and bolster their product in order to strenghten its position in market.This is truelly a bussissen task to flourish their bussissness. 
In the end yes i agree about the statement  that most advertisement make products seems much better thatn they really are,inspite of some positive areas to it.Now the people have to become smart enough to go for the product or not to go with it.
