To achieve a progress in any field, one should try new skills which can bring a considerable positive changement to it. Doing the same thing in the same way all the time does not give you the opportunity to improve yourself. 
This requires the curiosity, the willingness to learn and to develop new ideas and also the courage to take risks. Noone can say that Edison was not brave and curious enough to invent the bulb. If he was satisfied just with the regular research he did at school, or with the simple work he did professionally, he would not have been capable to help the humanity by his invention.
If  a teacher is not willing to learn the new information on his or her field, he or she can never be helpful to the students. Staying behind the developments would not help people learn more and go one step forward.
Repeating yourself in a work or in a field not only limits your personal development, but also keeps your mind close to any development in the life. This psychological effect is maybe the largest effect of being a person who constantly does what he/she knows to do well, without having a look around to see the possible ameliorations that can be applied to that work; as the adoption of this manner is a kind of addiction to the laziness.
It has always been the creative people who had opened the gates for the development especially in sciences and arts. Even if these gifted personalities were not appreciated by people at those times, then they were well understood. This typical behavior towards renovations is also a point to agree with the statement which says succesfull people are the ones who try new things. As an example, Turkish poet Nazim Hikmet could be taken. He tried a very strange form of poetry which was not composed of the regular lines, but of some irregular lines containing the words that sound like the sounds of the nature, like running horses for example. This new form was able to give the reader the exact feeling thet the poet had while he was writing it. and also it let you free to imagine visually.
To conclude, the renovation and the development are brought to life by the craetive, curious abnd brave people rather than the ones who repet themselves and who get stuck in a limited perspective in their lives and in the work they have.
