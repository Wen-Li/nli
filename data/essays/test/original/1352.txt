The statment that only those people who try newer things and take risks are suceesful in comparison to those who keep doing whatever they do best, is something that I personally belive in very strongly. Infact I agree with it to the point that I intend to pursue my career oriented endeavours in somewhat the same way. The reason that my belief for this philosophy is so strong, is what I explain henceforth. 

    First and foremost, it is only because of such people who take risks and try out new things that we have achieved so much in the fireld of technology so far. Nowadays, tachnology is the backbone of whatever we do. And, had it not been the risk taking abilities of the great scientists of the yester- years, we would not have had so many discoveries and inventions that have led to a better present and a promising future for us. The one person that comes to mind in this case is the very well-known but often not very well remembered scientist Tesla, who is responsible for the alterating current that we use to drive and run practically everything around us- gadgets,machines, etc. Had it not been for his vision and his want to try new things, we would have been stil trying to find out ways to transfer the direct current over long distances and provide electricity to far off distances.Infact, I believe this desire to take the risk is something that drives a person to face adversities and come out fighting through them stronger and more determined. 

    Secondly, such risk taking and 'trying out new things' abilities helps an individual to somewhat define his own destiny. He doesnot simply sit back and enjoy doind what he knows best , but rather through hsi personified vigor, helps a larger part of humanity in a known or unknown fashion. Take the example of teh world's richest man Mr. Bill Gates. Just imagine a world without Microsoft and without windows.Frankly, it's quite unimaginable. Bill gates took the risk of dropping out of a comfortable college degree that would have ensured a good job, payed him good money and he would have thus lived "happily ever after". He instead decided to try out something new and venture into the little known  field of computer technology. The result is for all to see and admire. Not only has he made a fortune for himself, but his organisation employs millions of prople across the globe and hence he in in an indirect way the wage earner for millions of homes all over the world.It was his conviction and belief in his abilities that resulted in the 'tech-savy' world we live in today.

    Finallu, although there are many examples of such people who have drifted from the norm and come out victorious both for themselves and many other people as a result, the one thing that common to all of them is that they believed in themselves and backed their abilities to achieving greater heights. Eventhough they knew what they were good in, they did not rest on their laurels. Infact, they took risks and tried new things that resulted in the betterment of humanity as a whole. On my part, I aspire to one day be recalled as a member  of this league of wonderful people of vision and ambition.They have made the world a better plave for us to love in and have  shown the way. Try to succeed.
