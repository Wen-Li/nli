I completely agree with the fact that most advertisments are deceiving and give a completely distorted image of the product they are trying to sell. In fact the purpose of advertisment is not that of showing a product for what it is but rather to create the need for that particular item in a possible customer. 

In an advertisment, it's not just the product that's deceving but also the context in which it is placed and the sensations that it tries to arouse. When I look at advertisements about cars I ask myself: how come are they always pictured completely alone on a road set in an incontaminated landscape? Advertisments show you the bright side and don't warn you that the increase of the number of car enhances problems about traffic and pollution.

In an advertisment you never see all the features of the product, the advertiment's scope, in fact, is to enhance all the good qualities the item might have disguising all the bad ones. 

I once read an article about McDonald's which showed how the hamburgers looked like on the advertisements and when you actually got them. It was really hard to recognize they were supposed to be related in some way.

The worst advertisments are the ones for children. They picture toys so greatly that it seems that one couldn't live whithout them! And children, of course, don't have the experience to understand that they are falling in a trap and that's exactly the purpose of the advertisement.

Another technique used in advertising is that they make you beleive that if you have that particular item, a cell phone for example, than you will be the coolest person around. Every body will be looking at you and envying you.

Advertisments make you believe that you can by happiness. That happiness comes from what you have and what other people think of you rather than what you are.  Advertisments play with emotions, often you can hardly see the products they are trying to sell, you don't get any infomation about them... but somehow they make you feel like you will not be satisfied untill you have what they are picturing.
