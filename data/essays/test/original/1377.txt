    The issue at hand is, if the number of cars will be fewer in the next twenty years. I strongly believe that the number of cars , twenty years from now will be greatly reduced.There are numerous reasons as to why the number of cars should reduce.
    Firstly, as the prices of petrol & gasoline are shooting up day by day, it will become more difficult for a normal man to own a car.Therefore , economic strength will become a major factor in determining the ownership of a car & hence the middle classes of the society will leave their cars.
    Secondly , as many gorvenmental & non- govermental organizations are trying to reduce the number of cars to help safe guard the environment.They are promoting the use of more environmentally safe modes of transport & they will be successfull in doing this to some extent.
   Also,other modes of transport , such as metros, trains, planes etc. ,are becoming cheaper.Therefore, people will have better options to travel in, rather to travel in their own personal car. This argument is backed by the government moves to reduce the fairs in public transport to make it affordable & likeable by citizens of all kinds.
   Finally, it is a well known fact that the cities are expanding at an exhillrating pace, in terms of populatoin. This leads to the major problem of traffic congestion in cities. Traffic congestions are a major  'turn - off' for many drivers as they are simply a waste of time. I strongly feel that in twenty years from now, people will face horrible traffic conditions, which will lead them to give up on their cars.Thus this example also explains why  the number of cars will reduce in the next twenty years.
   Thus to conclude i would like to state that the number of cars will undoubtedly drop down by large numbers due to the reasons mentioned above.
