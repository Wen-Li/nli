I disagree with the statement that it is more important for students to understatnd ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts for the following reasons.

For the first, it is necessary for the students to learn the facts to feel wonder and interestrd in the subjects.
When I was a juninor high school student, I had many experiment in the chemical class. At first, I was just surprised to find the each chemical reactions, like chnagin the color or making fiber from the liquid, becasue they were hardly seen in the daily life. After I had experiment, I was very interested in the reasons and learned them in the text book as what kind of the concepts were. Also, in the mathematics class, my teacher taught us many facts and suggested the ideas to lead the mathematical rules. Instead of just teaching the ideas ot concept, I was very interested in the subjects throught the fact in the experiment, I could enjoy studing at the class and read the related articles by myself.
Secondly, it is importnat for the students to think about why  and looking for the answer by themselves.

Threfore, learning the facts will enable students to feel wonder and interested in the subjects. Also, it enabels the students to think themselves.

Therefore, for the reasons mentioned above, I certainly disagree with the statement that it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts.
