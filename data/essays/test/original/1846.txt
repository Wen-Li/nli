I agree with the statement but I do not think that this is a negative fact at all. When a company advertises a product its aim is that as many people as possible afterwards want to have the product. To reach this aim the company needs to show and describe the product in the most positive way possible. Therefore it is absolutely legal to them when they try to make the product look better than it really is. The people that are looking at an advertisment on the other hand need to reflect what they see. Adults are able do so. Over the years they have learned that not everything told in the television or in newspapers is directly the truth. Children may sometimes need their parents to figure that out. The companies try to make up as many new surprising advertisments as possible to convince the people so that they run into the stores to buy the product. When the companies extand the abilies of a product too much in the advertisment the consumer will be angry and will not buy the product again. Therefore the company needs to find a middle way between lying and telling the truth so that the consumer will not be disappointed and starts to buy is product regulary. This leads into a daily fight and there are even rules made up by the goverment telling how far the companies can go with their advertisments to make sure that some truth about the product appears in its advertisment. Sometimes it is even nice for the consumer to look at an advertisment when the company has made up beautiful places or funny situations to attract the product to the consumer. All together it is quite normal and important for the product that its advertisment makes it seem better than it really is and the consumers learn fast how to handle the wrong facts made up by the companies.
