I completely agree with the statement that 'most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are'. Advertising has now become a major field of study and there has been a lot of research in this domain of marketing. The basic purpose of advertisements is to provide a leverage to a product so that the product sells and can compete with other products in it's category.

      Advertising gives a product a platform to showcase itself in the best possible manner to the customers. The products shown in advertising are customized by the owner of the product himself or the team behind building it. The customization of products on screen adds to the visual appeal of such products. Lighting, color, size etc are generally varied by advertizers to increase the product's visual appeal. This intices the target customer and he rushes to buy the product only to find that their are many variations in the looks and the quality of the product as compared to those shown in advertisements. For example, advertisements of Titan watches show the products in life-size images. The watches are enlarged on screen, polished heavily and often are shown with beautiful packaging. When the customer buys such watches, first of all he might find the heavy polish missing. Also, the packaging and the life size image which attracted him are not even thought of while buying the product.

     Another tactic that advertising agencies use is the inclusion of celebrities in advertisements. If a well known celebrity endorses a product and promotes it, the customer interprets a different image about the brand and the item being promoted. The qulaity factor of the product is related to the celebrity promoting it. For example, Amitabh Bachchan has started promoting a hair oil from a firm which was never heard of earlier in the market. The effect of Mr Bachchan endorsing such an oil has automatically leveraged the image and reputation of the product, irrespective of it's quality.

    Gurus in the field of advertising do not deny the fact that almost on all occasions, the high quality advertisements are overdone and are not in accordance with the product's quality. But with time the customers have become more aware of the tactics used by clever advertisers and with the increase in incidences of disaccordance of the product quality with it's advertisement, the cutomer has evolved and there is an urgent need for new methodologies in the field of advertising that would enable the advertisers to send across the right message without using exaggeration.
