I agree that most advertisments make products appear much more better than they really are , i agree because every day we see alot of advertisements on t.v .s and read it in newspapers , it is actually apart of the marketing of the products  and we always go and buy this products according to the adertisements , some time we find it avery good products but so times also we found it moderate or bad but still not so pretty as showen in t v.s or news paper.

So advertisments is an essential part of marketing ,we see in each company a big sector for advertisments and this sector chooses avery creative people who can invent a succesfult advertisments , we see also the companies pay alot of money for aperson who give anew ideas oe designs  as we see it is very impotant for companies and their products.
For example certain company produce crackers ,usual crackers as all crackers in the market but it shows in the package spiderman pictures in his new movie and the crackers have spider man shape so alotof kids love spiderman, As aresult  they love spiderman crackers even they do not like the taste of it sothis company buy very much spiderman crackers as aresult of intellegant idea or design.
This for children but for adult it may be different , Adult can compare between product and then decide which is good and which is bad  ,For example all deteregnt advertisments show avery resistant spot or stain  before washing then but the deteregent and wash  the clothes then become very clean and brigt, so only womens candecide which is real and which is fake.
so it is amarketing problem but i thinkfor the advertisments to be succesful it must be near realityto convince the people and to be logic because we will by the product and decide if we will buy it again or no.,
