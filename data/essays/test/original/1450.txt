It's true that the youth nowadays is less sensitive to the problems of the society than 30/40 years ago.
You can see that in the disinterest that young generations have for politics, many youngs don't know anything about politics and what is happening aroud them.
While during the '60/'70 many youngs were involved in politics, they took part to demostrations, they bought political newspaper and they often discussed about the problems of the society to try to understand and possibly change them.
In those years there weren't so many distractions for youngs, there weren't video-games, DVD, internet and so on ... that nowadays fill entirely the day of youngs.
Nowadays young people don't spend much time with other boys and girls, they prefare to stay closed in home to play with their video-games, explore internet and other things of this genre that obviously don't give any help and improvement in their often empty life.
It's time that the youngs understand that and begin to switch off their TV, console and monitor, and go out to talk with people, like their grandparents, figures too often forgotten in our society.
People that have too much to teach us and that we don't listen enough.
It's time for the youngs to meet people, who hasn't been so lucky like us, people who live in the roads, who haven't enough to eat, who are cold...
It's time for youngs to understand that the world go beyond the last PS2 games or Bruce Willis's movie.
It's time for youngs to understand that an one moment they'll be called to rule the world after their parents, and certainly video-games won't be useful at this moment.
