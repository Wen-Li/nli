   In my opinion ther would be less cars in twentey. I see that because of tow main reasons that will affects all the countries in the world.

  The first reason is that the government of each country in the world espicially the less developed countries will try to reduce the number of cars on the streets because of the increase of the pupliation and the bad affect that cars cause it to the enviroment.The number of pupliation is increasin every year and the most increase is on the less developed countries.For that the govrenment of these countries will try to find a trasporttion way that will transport a lot of people in less space.Also the higher number of cars on the street the higher effect that it will do for the enviroment.So the govrenment of each country around the world will try to solve this problem by finding a transportation device that will cause less rush and less harm to the enviroment.

    The second and the most important reason that I thinck there will be less car for it is the price of gas. The price of gas is to high nowadays and how will it be after twenty years? of course it will be even much higher. For example i am from Dubai, UAE and i see the price in my country that produces oil is high and also i went to Austrailia at summer and the price was much higer than my country and the last example is that my cousin mum is from the USA and he is a US national and when I asked him about the price of gas in the US he said that i shoud sell my shoe if i had an egiht sylender car in the US because of the price pf the gas. 

  Finally these are the main reasons that I think that the cars will be fewer in the next twenty years the number of people and the price of oil.
