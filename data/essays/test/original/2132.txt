I do agree with this statement. Indeed, I think that the growing awareness of the harm brought about by cars combined with the new means of transport that are more and more used, there will be fewer cars in use in about twenty years.

Nowadays, there are a lot of city-policies that tend to limit the use of cars in the big cities. For example, in Paris, there are more and more bills that want to increase the use of the transports as busses or tramways and prevent cars from parking -and thus from being in Paris- by diminishing the number of parking places. In London there are also policies aiming at eliminating gradually the cars from the city. These examples can show the beginning of the political caution to bring better living conditions in the cities.
But what's really important is that politicians and citizens are aware of the harm engendered by cars over the environment by polluting it, and over humans themselves , provoking lots of deadly accidents. 

Moreover, cars can graudually be replaced by other transport means, as busses, tramways, trains, planes. Indeed, what's people want is to have comfortable and cheap travels. Driving is not really comfortable, and very expansive. Furthermore, there is a soar in the supply of cheap flights and people travel more and more by plane, that is more confortable and quite fast. And this supply corresponds to people's demand. Indeed, people now hesitate to take the car when it comes to a hours-lasting travel. That's why I think in twenty years, there would be more cheap and effective flights than now. 
But busses, tramways and trains can also take more place in our live and replace cars for two reasons : the policies that tend to eliminate the cars from the cities because of the pollution, and the place they take, and also because they tend to be faster and faster, with ways reserved to this means of travelling, and the funds allocated by the State.

Because the cars represent such disavantadges, I do think that people will gradually get rid of them and use other means that are not only more comfortable but also cheaper and faster than cars.
