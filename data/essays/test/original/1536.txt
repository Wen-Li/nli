Advertisements try to attract people so that they want to buy the product, because in their aspect they want to sell the product. That's why they try to make the product look tempting through advertisements. I agree that most advertisements make products seem better than they are in reality. The products that are shown in advertisements look awesome and cool, but they really aren't always what they seem. I have had several experiences that relate to this thought.
     Internet shopping can be an example. The products that appear on the screen are usually just the images. Through the advertisement, the vision of the product seems flawless. It looks so colorful and attracting. When I actually buy it and receive it through package mail, the color is sometimes different from what I had seen through the image, which is dissatisfacting. Also in hidden places there are scratches and places that aren't complete. Therefore, advertisements simply try to make the product seem tempting through the buyer's eye when they are actually not that perfect.
     Also, another example can be a food commercial. The seller on television makes exclamations about the product, of how delicious it tastes, and it makes me feel like calling the company. They emphasize only on the points that make the product seem perfect. When I receive the product that I had bought through home-shopping, sometimes the product isn't at all like it was on the television commercial.
     In conclusion, not all products are as good as they are advertisements. Advertisements only show the customers the good sides and the advantages of the product but not the downside. Looking at products at a criticizing point of view can be a good way of smart shopping. It's always important to think carefully before being convinced by an advertisement. That's why I try to seek the disadvantages of the product and the parts that I might be being fooled by the sellers.
