                   Understanding or learning Facts 

 When comming in to general openion both may have their values as the same.  But ,I  agree only with the words understanding ideas and concepts is better rather than learning facts .This is because understanding ideas and concepts is a practical one and a group operative one and facts reading is a theoritical thing which can be read .And we all well know practice makes man perfect . so understanding is more easier and  accurate one to follow

 When we go for an example to give strength to my point i say that if a student or a child is thought to read that fire is hot he might not consider it to most extent and he might forget that. But , when he has an insidence with fire he will well know and understand that fire is hot and he will not forget that in his life time because of what he had faced 
 And in another case if u try to teach driving to a person in a closed class room he will only know what is gear and what is stearing and  breakes and so called axelator. But when comming to reality he only can learn driving perfectly throuth through understanding through practice. with out that he cant go for a ride directly from a class

 I  with my views and examples, I conclude that understanding is the best thing rather than learning facts. Facts are true but they comes in to resemblence only by understanding. So, only understanding helps a man to remember that for a long time rather than knowing facts. Understanding is of most greatness than a normal reading or fact study.This is because of the greater friendly ness of understanding with human brain rather than  just studying the facts.Final but not the least one is," facts are the things which are faced and understood many times by our ancestors to guide us".
So i strongly disagree this state ment and support my ideas with the above examples and my ideas
