All around the world the schools educate students in terms of academic knowledge or the knowledege of the life which is needed for living.In this way students must learn and understand the ideas or the concept of a subject or information completely not just for learning some facts that they are interested in or they learn.
       At first i agree with that statement.in this point of view when the students get some information on a subject they dont try to learn it with all its aspects.they just learn it in order to spend the time that they live in.they must know that if you understand an idea you can use in every field or in every situation which you can encounter.if you just learn the ideas and concepts to learn some facts you can not comment or report on somehing about what you have learned. every teacher says that dont learn the information to use it in a short time of peroid, understand and learn it forever to make it useful for you. In addition to this, you can also be creative and productive with the help of this process.As i encountered in the lesson of histor before, many students learn some events and the happenings in the history lesson just in order to be seen like knowing those things.but when it comes to make a comment or create a situation by using the things they learned,they have difficulty in successing this. thats why understanding ideas and concepts by its all aspects is important for students.
   to conclude,every student must desire to learn the informations or subjects in order to understand them and in order to be ready for creating somethin and commenting on something.that is the important thing for students
