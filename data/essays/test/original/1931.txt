I strongly believe that the best way to travel is in a grooup led by a tour guide instead of going alone.there are various specific reasons why i agree this.

one reason , if you go on a tour which is unknown to you ,it will be very difficult for you to  see all the places  in that country.eventhough you have a chart of that country,which is shown you everything in detail ,may be some times you will face transportaion problems when traveling from one place to another place.

Another reason , it will be very difficult for you to find a proper accomodation facility available in that place.you will not get proper food so you will become sick .you will return back to your home as early as possible.it will not give you a personel satisfation of a tour which you planned.

third reason, you will come to know various cultures,the behaviour of the people in different places,religious notations,growth of the city ,electricity facilities,internet facility to show how the people are communicating with each other,education facility,job oppurtunities and so on.if you miss some where in the middle of the tour it will be very  problematic for you to  reach your  home if you went  alone.

fourth reason, how effectively they are maintaining their export and import bussiness with other country,water falls,deep forests ,historical places as well. you can enjoy all  flavours of the food items,juices which are available.the shedule which you prepared previously will become successfull instead of getting late reaching to your native place.

finally i conclude that it is better to travel in a group led by a tour guide instead of going alone.
