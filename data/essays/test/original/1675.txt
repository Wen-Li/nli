I totally agree that advertisments make products seem much better than they really are. Infact making the product more attractive is the main goal of a spot. I am conscious about that because I've spent few mounths in the marketing area of a firm and I know how it works.
First of all there are lot of researches beyond an advertisment; they try to gain as many informations as possible about consumer's attitudes in order to find an attractive way to present their product. After that, they try to highlights the best qualities of the product, sometimes telling lies, and to hide the negatives one. For example in a spot for an ice-cream you'll never hear: "the more you eat this ice-cream the more you put on weight"; it could be quite strange if it happens.
Second, sometimes big celebrieties are engaged as testimonial for a particular product. You could consider a product better than another only because George Clooney is spotting it. Let's think about cosmetics; how many times we have heard:" do you want to be like...try our product!!". It is clear that there is no relation between who sponsorize the product and the quality of it.
So it can be concluded that we should not  base our opinion of a product on it's advertisment while we have to consider its characteristics and if it is worthvalue. As we all know: it is not all  what shines!
