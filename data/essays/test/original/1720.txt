I agree that Most advertisements make products much better than they really are. I have a some reasons and they are following.

First of all, person who sell products they must be get many consumer as much as they can, because they want to get profit. Most of all sellers, they do not tell any lies, but they do not say bad aspects of the products. Of couse, they do not need to say them. If I want to sell something at the school festival, I mean When I want to introduce our store or products to others, I deffinetly say only good things. So, probablly, customer maight be seemed or discover bad aspects of our produsts.  

Secondly,  some advertisements are exassarate. I mean it is emphasized too much. It is also not lies but just too much. So, sometimes when I got a new stuff i will be dissapointed at it because I just follow that kind of advertisement. I think everyone has that kind of feeling sometimes.

I have a experience, as well. One day I watch the TV and they sold some food for diet. I wanted to loose my waight. And they said a lot of good words and also introduce someone who lost waight a lot because of that product. And I dont think that was lie, but now I know that the someone was just example. Of course I do not now all peaple who use that food to loosing their waight. Some could loose a lot, others could only 1 pound, I do not know. Finally, I bought the product but I fail to loose my waight. So I think someone could loose waight a lot, they did exercise and ate that product. Becuse I did not do exercise a lot. The seller just told the tures. So the advertisement is not bad. So what was or is the problem?

I think the problem is myself, at least in my case. I get influences of advertisements, easily. Now I know because of my imagination. When I see good words of advertisement, I never think about bat aspests of it and just thiknk about good ones too much. That's why I dissapointed sometimes.

In conclution, I still agree that statement. However, I thiknk it is not advertisement but our imagination is problem ,too.
