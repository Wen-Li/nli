I agree with the statement that successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well. 

One of the reasons why I believe this statement is true is the fact that although you might do well with one thing, trying out something new could get you results even greater than what you are doing right now. If you are e.g. good at baking cookies as an employee at a bakery, you can continue what you are doing and you will always do the same thing and probably earn the same salary. However, if you decide to let somebody else bake the cookies and you start your own bakery, do the admininstration, advertising, figure out the logistics, etc. you can realize that you're even as good as with the baking part or even better and you can increase your profits and be more successful. And later on you could start a catering service which uses your skills of coordinating a food business in order to diversify and get even more successful.

Another reason why I support this statement is that taking risks can provide you with more success than if you are doing the same things you are good at all over again. If you take risks you have the possibility of a great outcome, which is especially true in the stock market. If you are willing to invest your money in high risk portfolios, the risk of losing your money is great, but so is your chance of getting a very profitable return. This way you have higher profit margins and are way more successful than conservative investors who always rely on "safe" alternatives, with which they are doing well, but not as well as the first group of investors mentioned above. 

Trying out a lot of new things leaves people more flexible and gets them more successful this way. This way they can figure out how to best use their abilities. So if somebody is good at teaching, but after being burned out after several years of stressful teaching, she or he decides to become a children's psychologist, this can be a very succesful switch in their careers. So this person stays successful by trying out something new and taking the risk of the career switch.

The same is true when trying out new things people can be very successful as this allows them to adapt to market changes. One decade internet start-ups are very lucrative, but by being flexible and taking risks people can switch their careers to a different field after a couple of years and so escape the possible financial disaster right on time during the dotcom bubble.

These are 4 valid reasons why I believe that the above mentioned statement is true.
