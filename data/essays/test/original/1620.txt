For many people, especially parents, children or young people play a rather significant role in their life. But how high is the contribution of young people? In the ensuing essay I would like to deal with the topic if young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities. 

My answer is simple: I agree with the statement. Now I would like to give reasons which support my point of view.
Nowadays many young people spend a log of time in playing computer, using the internet or watching TV; therefore they haven't sufficient time to concentrate on their community. A few centuries ago young people had another role in their community. They had to work hard in their community because there was an interdependence between each member of the community. It was inevitable to interact with everyone. Nowadays the community has a different organization and structure. It has the semblance that interaction doesn't play such an important role like in the 18th century. That is why young people doesn't see the sense of helping their community because other people can do this job. Another argument which strengthen my viewpoint is the lack of interests in interaction with other people especially people from the own community. Young people have no interest to help other people because they concentrate on their own.

As a result of my arguments you can record the fact that young children doesn't spend sufficient time to helping their community because they are sidetracked by the media. The media like TV, internet or the computer are more attractive than than the community. The problem can be solved if the society concentrates on traditional values like respect, affection and loyality. This values should be maintain over centuries.
