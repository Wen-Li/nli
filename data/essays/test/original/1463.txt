I think that most advertisements make product seem much better than they really are. That is kind of lie. Most people belive the What advertisements say. However some seller make a faulse impression of thier product. I will explain the 2 episode about that.
 First, People belive What they see. Television is very good example of this case. When we watching the Television we can see easly commocial advertisements for selling product. It is wrap up differnt imformation unlike product. Customer belive that the imformation and than they buying that. They can recognize later when they sill see and use product. For example, When i saw the some commocial, i bought computer 2 years ago, the seller introduce to me this computer batter than common computer. It is fresh and made of new technology. But it is not. He and advertisement lie to me.
 Second, paper advertisement is good to lie for customer. Our world have a lot of product and make new product. Advertising is a way to sell to product. Company have to sell more and  more because of they want to survive that world. Faulse advertisement kind of their way to make it  more profit. 
 Many company cheat to customer. Beside they earn the money to useing the bad way. I hope so that faulse advertisement is get away from our world.
