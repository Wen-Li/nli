Yes i agree with the statement "Successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how well to do well". Here i would like to discuss about few great people in connection to this statement .
Let us take an example in the field of science & technology , the Graham Bell who is invented the telephone if he were not taken the risk of inventing the telephone we could not have been able to communicate and the field of communication could not have been so easy , it all depended on the amount of risk and time he dedicated we have the telephone now.
Let us talk about Sir Edmund Hillary if he were not taken the risk of climbing the Mt Everest in Himallays , we could have not known the heights of these mountains because he has taken such a risk now we now what is the height of it .
Even in the feild of serving we have the Mother Theresa who stands as a symboll of serving humanity she risked her life came from Europe to India just for helping the poor and needy in the strange and total different situation she has shown the world that without taking risk there cannot be success .
The people do get success in bussiness only after having taken some risk without that he cannot have success . If a child does not take a risk in standing fearing that he will fall , if he does not does such an action he can never stand and what to speak of runing or walking , so there is risk in all our daily activities also if we are scared of them we cannot have success, and people get successful only after taking risk .
