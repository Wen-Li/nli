 In a quite optimistic manner, I would personnally tend to consider that people are about to take into account the harmful and far-reaching consequences global warming has and is still triggering. An awakening seems to be unavoidable now, as whatever we do, we will not be able to make for the reversal of the order of things we have created. The quicker our reaction will take some concrete aspects, the more useful and efficient it may be.

    To achieve these hard-working aims, cars  are one of the most effective symbols of our desperate need to accept some crucial and meaningful sacrifices, to say the least. Needless to say, firstly that they are part of our daily life, which makes the decrease of their great number less likely. Yet there is no doubt that given the emergency, politicians will have to own up to their liabilities and talk people into reducing their gas consumption in order not to let the threat of the greenhouse effect worsen. If people do not act reasonably enough, I thing that it is up to governors to stand as examples and to encourage people to pro-environnement behaviours (as the inciting financial support offered to people who priviledge solar energy at home) Similarly, responsible citizens who refrain them from overusing their vehicles should be rewarded, whatever the form it could take. 

    Furthermore, in addition to these reasons, mainly based on a sense of community and the wilfulness of people, other parameters may interfere in the evolution of the typical profile of car buyers : actually, isn't the increasingly high price of gas the most succesful means of deterring people from driving? The seemingly promising introduction of green fuel, despite its environmental benefits will not solve this problem. To crown it all, car industrials are highly suspicious and reluctant at the prospect of making the access to cars working with electricity or renewable resources easier. Therefore, although the consumer may be well-intended by restricting his own consumption or making it safer, nothing would be efficient if constructors do not bother to hinder the inevitable decline of car selling.

Drawing the threads together, we can summarize reminding that some factors are radically refraining people to buy and use cars, either environmental ones or some others more matter-of-fact like prices.
