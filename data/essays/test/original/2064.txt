I agree that most advertisments make products seem much better than the reality are.  i have many reasons for that:

first of all, what is wrettin in the lable of the product most likely don't mintioned the disadvantages  or side effects of the product, in the contrary  we fined   unaccurte information about the component's quality, amout, taste...Etc.

The second thing  that support my openion, like in the case of medicine or pesticides, we fined some words or information that show the product  as the magic solution for the disese or the pest, more and more they use some religous articles to support ther claims, for  example, it is written in the lable of a particular pestcieds "if water esist ,then no need for  Tayamum" which is a relegous article that implies that now need to use any ather pestcides when this pesticide is exsist

The pictures which is used to be in the advertisment or even in the lable of the oroiducts in maney wayes show the product in a non real show or at least not the same as the product is.

i can say the producers  use advertisment to complet the missing values of the product by the un reality advertisents
