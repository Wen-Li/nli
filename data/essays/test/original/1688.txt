I do fully agree with that statement. From my personal experience as a consumer of products and of their advertisements, I can just underline this estimation. Since my father runs an advertising agency, I got some insights into the world of advertising and am even more convinced that products are in almost every case better looking on TV or in newspapers than in reality.
To start of with my personal experience as a consumer, I made countless experiences with products or services that were supposed to be a "revolution in their field", "the one and only" frozen pizza, cellphone contract, hair colour or whatever... and turned out to be as complicated, bad-tasting and expensive as every other product. 
By  working sometimes in my father's advertising agency, I took a look behind the scenes. Pictures of products are worked on with special programmes until the product or the model holding it looks perfect, important informations and conditions are often written extra small, so that one really has to look for them in an advertisement. Since I know now how that works, I know how to deal with commercials and announcements. But particularly children and older people might not consider advertisements as advertisements but as factual descriptions of products which is a problem. There are already numerous children in depted because of too much consumption. As to older people the increasing use of English words may also present a challenge for them to understand the features of a product. 
Although there are many negative aspects in this regard, I do also realize that I like to buy or have products which transport a certain life style - which must be great to hear for people working in the advertising branche... And this life style is very often communicated through advertising.
To conclude, I am of the opinion that it is important to know that the aim of a commercial or a nice picture is to make people buy the product and not to deliver pure and objective information. Especially children should be taught about that by parents and in school.
