I believe that the statement is true.The purpose of advertisements are to foster people to buy their products, and so it is understandable that the companies are making the products seem much better than they really are.

Take as an example,there are many advertisements about cigarettes.Many of them use young and beautiful models who are smoking and beautiful places like paradise.These images make us feel that smoking cigarretes makes the person seem cool and feel good.
But the cigaretts have bad effect on body and even if you smoke one,you would not feel that you are cool or good and smoking it does not put you in a beautiful place.

Another example is advertisements on food.In the commercials on TV,the models are eating the food as if it is the most delicious food in the world,and they are decorated in a very organized and beautiful way.
But when you buy the food in the real life,it does not look as good as when it was on TV and it could tastes normal or even bad.

As a conclusion,we are attracted by the images of advertisements which seems better than the real ones,and these make us buy the products.
I sometimes feel that it is decieving when the companies make them seem much better than they really are.
