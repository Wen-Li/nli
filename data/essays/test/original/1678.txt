Yes i do agree that most advertisements make products that seem much better than what they actually are . There can be many reasons for doing so , however doing this can be at times a disadvantage too

     From a company's point of view they have to sell their product and the only way they can reach every door and every home is through marketing their products .  Nowadays it has become a fashion to spend more money in marketing something that isnt much worth to do .  People also like such advetisements where the product is marketed in a grand manner . People get drawn to something that is more eye-catching than something that is really useful .  Everyone is more in to looks and color of the product rather than its usefulness.

    I personally feel that marketing the products that are not really worth , is incorrect . This simply can mislead the common public who have no idea of what the product is all about and what it can do . Its side effect can really be death threatening at times . Many products are made using harmful chemicals .  such products that can take a toll on someones life should be advertised in a proper way stating its outcomes in case of misuse etc and not just keep on projecting the good side to the product.  This is more common incase of  cosmetic products .  Products must be advertised on basis of what it really is and what it can do.  It is completely incorrect to advertise products in a wrong way .  . This can hamper the companys reputation but most of all this would prove costly to someones life which is more precious than anything else .

I believe that it is not proper justice to people out there who have no clue of what the product can and what it cannot .  It is only through proper advertising can anyone get exposed to the capabilities and limitations  of a product. Since advertisements are the only media that make these product reach every door step.
