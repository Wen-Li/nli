Taking risk, and new innovative thinking  is mandatory for success. The person who can't take risk can't grow well, and get sucess. Our history have plenty of examples that  every sucessfull person  have taken risk and thinked diffrently. Our resercher,Scientist  who have taken risk in experiment of failure or win, and many of then are sucessfull. Thomus Edison, if he hadn't taken risk and hadn't try new thing  then it would be difficult that bulb had been discovered. Newton if he had not think about whyn't apple fly up and came down then Newtons Low of motion hadn't discoverd. Like sciencetist, The businessman who have taken  risk and thinked diffrently  are sucessfull.   There are many businessman in the world but only who are sucessfull hav tahen risk and thinken problem in extraordinary manner. Bussinessman like Bill Gates taken risk, and his company Microsoft has become world class company, This is due to his innovation, thinking diffrently, even though he belong to middle class family. Like Bill Gates, Indian businessman Dhirubahi Ambani also think diffrently then comman people and his comapny Reliace beacome most reputed comapny of India, and his sons became most rich person in the world few time ago.

On the other hand comman people dosn't take risk so they are not much sucessfull. From this I doesn't mean that every people who will think differntly and will take risk will be sucessfull, on certain sage it depend upon one's fate as well. But it is ceratin that who will not take risk and will not try to think differnt will not be sucessfull.
