A lot of controversies exist over whether most advertisements makes products better. My view on this issue is that advertisements have effects to have the products better. It is related with the profits as well as company's image.

First of all, these days, many companys intrduce their products by using the advertisements. On this stage, they try to look better their products. Because, it is associated with making profits. For example, in Korea, one company selling the gum advertised its product using the exaggerated fact which is very effcient in prohibiting the cavaty. Owing this information, a lot of people bought this gum and then the profits of this gums were skyrocketed. Howerver, the fact that this gum did not have outstanding effects compared with other gums is revealed. However, regardless of the truth, thanks to the advertisemet they can get a lot of money.

In addition, advertisements have a positive influence on the whole company's image. That is, the more firms show good points of the products, the more  they get a lot of consumer's attention. It cause that the company could be more competetive than other companys. To illustrate, one paper company introduced that its product was more eco-friendly in the advertisement. At that time, the social trend was being a eco-friendly. However, not only the quality of its paper was the same as other papers, but also there was no reason calling eco-friendly. It is through the advertisement that this company could get a lot of favors from the costumers. 

All things considered, I firmly believe that advertisement have the fuction to make the product seem much better than they really are. Because it is connected with the profits and company's brand image.
