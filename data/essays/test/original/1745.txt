To learn a fact implies the full comprehension of the same. Ideas and concepts are helpful to achieve a true and real understanding of the things. 
I really believe that through the understanding of ideas and concepts you can reach the total knowledge and therefor, to learn facts. 
As an attorney at law I feel that I have an unique experience on that field. Many of my career teachers, generally the olders, used to argue that the only way to be a good lawyer was to learn by heart the entire mexican legislation. This is impossible in real life and the new teachers' wave knows that.
Law is a simple logical process. There is no need to learn the exact text of the corresponding article of the criminal code to know that it is prohibit to kill. It is clear that not every regulation is as obvious as the killing statement above but, every single law text has an idea, a concept, and a logic. 
As it is impossible to learn everything, it is much more useful to understand how to obtain the answer needed. I rather prefer to have the intelectual tools to know where to find the precise and accurate answer, having the idea and the general concept, to repeat without any understanding facts. 
Notwithstanding, I do believe that some facts had to be known. The foundation to understand those ideas and concepts might be facts that need to be learn. 
In general, my experience aside, I think that the scientist posture would be to understand ideas and concepts. This is possible in science because everything, or almost, is dedcutible and logical. However, the cultural (history for example) position implies to learn facts. It is not possible to understand through an idea or concept the general history of human kind. 
As per the foregoing I think that it is always better to understand ideas and concepts, with a few exceptions.  It is always better to think than to repeat.
