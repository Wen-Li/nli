I disagree with the idea that is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts.

The knlowledge of ideas and concepts in a student life is necessary, is just a step of the long life  that a student have. Knowing that a counscious student life begin in the elementary school , and some times before, the student must know all the thories, ideas and concepts that scolars has been stablished in the past. But no because that this step is important menas that is more important that the facts.

The facts in a student life is like stones in the river, you never know where will be placed, for some students will be later and some fo them before of the ideas and concepts were given to them. I will call facts as expierence, and expierence as student and human being is everywhere, in the family, with friends, not just in school and have no order in time.

Perhaps, there is a time on a student life to listen, and therefore arrive the time to speak, and that happens when ideas, concepts and facts combine. Usually in the students life it happens in the higher levels of a bachelor degree or in the masters or PHD, and here is when you really learn more about the facts rather than the ideas or concepts.   

I have many examples in my life that can support what a try to explain in this essay. For example, as a art student, i learned how a technic to paint, based on ideas and concepts, but I really never will prove it if I will not satrt to paint, and in the apinting I found the facts. Or in phyisics, you can learn a lot about the ideas and concepts of Isacc Newton but you can face the fact his first law if you grab some apple and let it drop from the fifth floor of any building, and like I tell before, 
you could realize about  the first law of Newton before knowing the idea.
 
In conclusion,  the statement that for students to understand ideas and concepts is more important than it is for them to learn facts is unsustainable. Both are important and necessary, they act like steps in students life.  Like happens in math, the order in facts do not misplaced the product.
