I am totaly a greed , the history is full of the examples which telling us that . we could think about the flying , using new medicens , etc .
But I think these charachteristics exsisting  not with every one , just some people who has such natures . To try a new thing . It,s to entry in a uknown world which could be a harmful and fatefull .
The entry to a new world needs to have a courage , not only the corusity .
We can think about the man who is the first one tried to fly ! he dreamed to fly , but that was not enough to dream . He decided to do , because as they say ( to dare is to do ) what made him a great man , The secerifice that he did to reach his dream.
OR that happened so often in the busniss field also , those people who,s taking risks in some positions , they can going very much longer than those who,s driving the traditonal or the well known dealing to them .
As the stock markets now , it debending pretty much on the risk in terms of selling and buying .
But we have to know also the risk and new things not always coming as a luck strike , if I am a risker thats mean I know pretty well that as I could win so I could lose .
The healthy society , it is that cocieties which has a people of the adventures and risks , cause such acts bringing alot of new experiences and aknolidges to the whole society .
