It is often said that advertisement is a form of lying, that most of the times consumers do not buy their expectations.  I do not agree with this assumption.  

First of all, advertisements are made by salesmen and women.  Their final goal is, logically, to sell a product.  In order to sell a product certain things are needed but the most important one is the envy of the customer.  A good salesman will present his product in a way that his customer will get the feeling that he needs that product more than anything else in the world.  Every good salesman has an ethical code and so is not supposed to lie to his client, but logically he will always emphasize the positive features of his product.
Normal salesmanship does not start with citing every negative aspect of the product.  

Second, I call upon the responsibility of the buyers.  It is very easy to blame advertisement for misbuys, but in this modern age information is everywhere.  Consumers can inform themselves about products in numerous ways and they always must take into account the point of  view of the advertisers, which is to promote their product.  When a consumer has not informed himself properly he must not play stupid afterwards.

Do advertisements make products seem better that they really are?  Yes, but everybody should take that into consideration when purchasing something. 
The rules of the game are clear, when people feel cheated on, they should reread their manual.
