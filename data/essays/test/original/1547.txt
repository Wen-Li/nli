Personally, I think I am a successful person because I am rich, I have a fantastic family, I have a lot of friends and a beautiful girlfriend.
In my view, I managed to have all these things because I am a person who loves risks. Therefore, I agree with the statement. In fact, if you want to be a successful person you have to take some risk and you have to challenge your destiny, abilities and luck. There are many reasons why trying new things and being able to take risks is important. First, if there is a risk in something you do there is surely a bigger reward. Secondly, to risk means  to have fun beacuse you never know what could happen. For example, I like to play poker, since I was only a child I have played this wonderful game and when I was only 16 years old I have won 1 billion dollars by risking with two aces in my hand. For all these reasons, I consinder myself an adventurous and successful person and I agree with the statement: try new things, such as new games or new jobs, and take risks is fundamental in our life. Trying new things is always a very exciting activity that make people very very happy of their life, while, in my opinion,  doing things they already know how to do well make people very very sad. Nevertheless, the use of your own 'know-how' in routine activities may present some advantages (e.g. a good perfomance or a save of time). But all these advantages are nothing if compared to that of trying new things.
Thus, I think all the successful people in the world is the people who likes to risk and try new activities and new ways of getting things done. In conclusion, in my humble opinion, trying new things and take risks  are the keys to be successful. Risk means nothing than success.
