Some people argue that understanding ideas and concepts is more important for studentsthan than learning facts. In my opinion, both understanding ideas and concepts and learning facts are of great importance. In the following discussion, I will illustrate my point in details.

There is no escaping the fact that understanding ideas and concepts is very important for students. Facts are facts, and they are not self-explainory. One of the purposes of learning is to teach ideas and concepts to students in order to make these facts more obvious to them. For example, why these things happen? How will they  evolve? How will they come to an end? Whether could make predictions about things? So, understanding these concepts and ideasis very important.

However, learning facts is also important because it can help students better understand the ideas and concepts that they have learned. I have such experience that if contents of the classes are all about ideas and concepts, students will have great troubles understanding them. First, ideas and concepts are quite boring. It is extremely hard for them to concentrate on the learning of ideas and concepts. Second, ideas and concepts are usually too abstract to understand. They may not well understand what these things are about. So, they need some some related facts to help them to understand. 

What is more, according to my experience, learning facts is quite interesting. Facts and phenomena can easily attract students' attention. First, they are concrete and easy to understand. Students will always be glad to learn something easy, perhaps the reason is their confidence may be destroyed by difficult things easily. Second, students will be happy to see that what they have learned are useful and can explain some facts. If what they have learned are not useful, it must be quite frustrating.

In sum, I think both understanding ideas and concepts and learning facts are indispensable in the learning process, and combining them will benefit students a lot when they are learing.
