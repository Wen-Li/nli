I think that the statement is very accurate to say that, and i agree that a successful person can see a lot of chances to increase their profits.Even though its kind of risky to do that, you can obtain several advantages.
The first reason it is that by trying new things can make your mind wide open to see more oportunities and defeat challenges that may present in your way, for example if we are investors for an especific property, we have to always consider the environment or surroundings of that house or building we have to make a reserch about the other properties in the neighborhood and see if they are better or not, its important to ask if they are better or what if i invert in this one.
the second advantage is that  we can developt a great source of creativity, when you are in serius problems or circumstances that requires to change you are more capable to face the situation and find new and better solutions for the problem, you become more active and possitive minded, let's take for instance someone who had been cheated for his boyfriend, she can stay there and cry everyday or moved on to new possibilities and find someone else.
Another reason is that only someone who risk can win, there are a lot of big enterprises that bacame so succesfull  because they tried new products or new advertisements to capture the attention of their clients, and when they know that a certain product is not selling they try new strategies. 
Daily problems help us to face the day with different answers and we are not going to find them by stucking in a hole, i believe that live has a lot of opportunities but you need to be aware of them and the best way to do it is experiencing new thing avery day.
