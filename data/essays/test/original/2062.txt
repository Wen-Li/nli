People can nowadays interest themselves and study whatever  subject they want, thanks to the internet. The widespread idea is that this is a good thing. But what about the academic subjects ? Do we have to try to learn a bit of the broader range of subjects or specialize our studies in a single way ? I do believe that we should try hard to have knowledge on several academic subjects.


Being a generalist allows you to make your future safer. Let's imagine that I have chosen to study nuclear science only and that, in ten years a world agreement will forbid the use of such a power- even if it is not about to become real at the moment. I will not find any job and I will have to go back to school to study something else or find a job with no special study level required.

Generally speaking, having a wide knowledge of several academic subjects proves that you are a curious person who is not afraid by finding out other domains and who is maybe much more flexible than the others. If you lose your job, you can even find another one in a branch you have studied before. 

It is a way of being well-more integrated in a society : you can talk to someone whose main interest is Formula One such as someome who is keen on the Renaissance period. Maybe, they will be both brighter in their specific domain, but to their contact you will continue to learn. And this is not the case for people who have a single subject of interest. They eventually are not so-well social integrated. However, we need them for jobs in the Research domain for example which demands a lot of them. But, I personnally could not do that.


 In conclusion, I need to communicate a lot and express my opinion on any subject, I am so curious that I could not stand specializing in only one domain. That is why I think having a broad knowledege of many academic subjects is better.
