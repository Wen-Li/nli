The statement, that young people do not give enough time to helping their communities, is a wide spread statement.
I think you should have a look at the timetable of a young people nowadays. He has to go to school or university, has homework or other work which cost a lot of time. I think young people have the right to meet friends and spend their freetime how they want. Some people prefer watching TV, other make sports and other help their communities. 
I think you have to make a difference, where the young people grow up. For my part, I have grown up in a small village. I have to work at home and I am in many sportclubs. Everyone knows everyone and we have an open ear for the others. If you need help, you will get help. But young people in a big city, they often do not know their neighbours. It is also difficult for them to integrate in sportclubs and other clubs. They have another social environment.     
Often you hear this statement from older people. They had another youth and have other experiences. Perhaps they spent more time for other people, but I think you can not say the young people nowadays don not give enough time to help their communities. The time changes end every generation has their own possibilities.  

I think you can not generalize this statement. Of course, there are  young people who don not spend enough time to help, but one such case has more impression than 100 other cases, in which people take the time for their communities. Many people see only the bad things.
