Today , people debat either important for students to understand ideas and concepts or to learn facts .
Some people claims that it is the most important things for students to learn facts because learning facts is basement .
However I suggest that it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts .
that is beacuse understanding ideas and concepts help them to remember more things and to encourage thier thinkings .

First of all , last school usually tought student the common fact such as history and principal theory of science and test for students to remmeber learnig things .
But today school teaches the reasons why the fact happens because it make students not only to know the fact but also to understand ideas and concept .
For examaple , I remmeber what principal 's graviety is .
My teacher explain it 's concept by using experiment .

Second , Understanding ideas and cocepts improve for students to have creative and considerable thinking .
If you spends lots of times to solve problems and to consider why facts happens , you could feel that your capability of thinking becomes better creative and considerable .

Thoes are why I claims that it is more important for students to understand ideas and concets than to learn facts .
I believe that student learn the facts by understanding the fact 's concept .
That help students to remmeber the facts longer and to understand other facts more easy
