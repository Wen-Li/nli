The link of successful people and people taking risks to try new things is not simply a connection .
It is a causality , which the following arguments are going to demonstrate .

`` New things '' , or , more eloquently expressed , innovations are in fact one of the main reasons for economic development .
In the past , society would never have developed the way it did without important industrial achievements such as the `` Spinning Jenny '' , the steamboat or the automobile .
Nowadays , the technological improvements are crucial for our current form of society .
All these industrial and technological improvements required courageous men , who had a vision of how things could work and who took a lot of ( often , if not always , cost intensive ) efforts upon them to make it happen .
although success was not guaranteed .
They were finally granted with huge financial success and renommation for their economically innovative courage .

However , successful courage for risking new things does not necessarily have to occur in an economic sector .
It can also happen in politics .
The European Union provides a very good illustration for this point .
After the Second World War , European countries were politically and economically weak .
It took courageous men such as the frenchmen Jean Monnet and Robert Schuman to openly express an at that stage entirely new vision of integration and cooperation between European countries .
Almost 60 years have passed since then and although the European Union still gives birth to a lot of criticism , its achievements and improvements concerning political importance and effectiveness of the member states , as well as a surprisingly high level of economic wellbeing and social contact between the citizens of the different countries .
The political figures which played a role during this development are still honoured today for succeeding in the risky tasks they took in their time .

Does trying out new things and taking risks automatically results in success ?
Surely , the answer would be no .
But the connection definitely works the other way .
Highly successful people , more often than not , have taken risky decisions in their past in order to implement new things they believe could work .
