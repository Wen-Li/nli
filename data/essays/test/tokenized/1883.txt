I disagee with the idea that in twenty years from now , fewers cars will be in use than they are today .
Rather , there will be much more cars in use in twentry years from now .
That is because of the population growh , economic development and technological advancement that we will be seeing in the next twenty years .

One reason for which I think that more cars will be used in future is population growth .
No doubt , the number of cars will increase in proportion to the population .
Moreover , as the population will grow , More land will be required to accomodate people .
The suburbs will develop more .
The travelling distances will increase , which in turn , will result in more use of cars as well .

Another reason is that , as the economies are growing , the standard of living of an individual are improving .
The per capita income of the nations is increasing .
In turn , the expending power of an individual is increasing .
People are more capable of expending for their needs .
Car will be definitely in the priority list of people who will be looking to improve their standard of living .

Lastly , as the technology is growing , we will see cheaper and fuel-efficient cars in future .
With the technological advancment , car will be more in reach of poor people .
Moreover , there will be no surprise if the cars will be running soley on electricity and the other alternate sources of energy .
In turn , the runnnig cost of cars will go down drastically .
This will make more people capable of buying and using a car for their daily routine .

In conclusion , there is no reason we will be seeing fewer cars in twenty years from now .
As the populations will grow , economies will improve , technologies will advance , more cars will be running in future .
