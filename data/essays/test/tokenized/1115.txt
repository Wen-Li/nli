Success is a very subjective idea .
People can feel successful when they are doing the things they like and know , but they are not improving the way of thinking or doing things .
However , what society will consider success is when someone brings out a new development that benefits many people .
This is the type of success I am going to talk about .

We all have things that we know how to do well .
And a good way to obtain good results is to exploit our abilities in the fields that we already know .
However , success is not only about that .
Success implies benefit for you and for the society as a whole .

It is logical to think that new ideas only come from takins risks .
People can do anything they like in a traditional way .
But this situation will never produce any improvement .
By contrast , when someone takes a risk , there are two possibilites , either he fails or he succeeds .
Yet , if he does not take the risk there is no possibility at all to improve .
Even though most of us fear failure at some point , the only way of creating a new approach is by taking risks .
The examples are found in any time and place in history .
Would Pablo Picasso had been that famous if he had not dared to change the traditional way of painting ?
Would Copernicus had developped the astronomical view of Earth if he had not dared to oppose to the Church ?
Would Pasteur had discovered the rabbies vaccine if he had not taken the risk of trying new methods ?

Take as a last example one of the most thriving companies of our time : Microsoft .
If Bill Gates had not dared to follow a new approach in software engineering , Microsoft will not be the huge enterprise we know nowadays .

Success is about daring to try new things .
Of course mistakes can always happen , but there is a big chance that in any of those tries , the light of success enlightens our path .
