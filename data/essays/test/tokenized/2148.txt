Education is a the one of the most effective source in a student life .
Learning is the basic structure of education .
Learning new information helps leads a student in to recivering great opportunity .
Understanding one idea is a form of eduction but it does n't lead to growth in a student .
Undrstanding idea is not as important as learning thos e facts .
Learning is more important because it helps a student grow , leads to more opportunity and has better advantages then understanding ideas

Fisrt , Learning is more improtant then understanding ideas because it shows groeth in a student life .
When you learn information one must be able to input that information in other forms such as a conversation .
Example learning statistic for a basketball game that makes the student smarter then he was before he learned it .
The studen can now take those statistic and use whne talking to friends about `` who is a better shooter iverson or Lebron ? ''
The student is also able to teach other about the information they have just obtained .
The growth seen in this period is a student moving froma student to a teacher .

Secondly , learning is more important then understanding because it leads to more opportunity the understand .
By a student laerning the basic fundamentals of listening in school and at home .
He has a better chance of making it in the workforce because he was tuaght thos basic fundamentals at home .
This does n't only benefit that workforce because the kind listen but it also benefits the parent becaus ethe child is more disciplined .

Last , learning also has more advantages the understandin ideas .
A student can understand how to use a computer , but over the time of trail and error the student will learn faster ways of typing or learn short cuts into a program .
Another Advantage would be a student can understand what the teacher is talking using a magnifer to see cells and demonstrates it on the board .
But it is not until he is taught how to use that magnifer and learns and see how all the cells are moving that he actual learns what that cells does and what the purpose of it .
Learning gives a student a better way of understanding ideas .

Growth , more opporunity and have advantage are the result that comes with learning facts .
By just following the basica fundamentals you can acheive so much .
Plus a student can understand anything but he knows more when he learns
