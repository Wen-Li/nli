advertisements these days are the main source by which a seller could attract the maximum intention of the consumer.a seller could grab the interest of the consumer through avertisement .
i agree with this statement that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .

seller these days spend huge amount of money in order to launch their product in the market in which their product image increases so they find advertisement as the best source .
as millions of people watch telivision daily so its the best way .
but generally most advertisements make a false image in front of the consumer .
they will tell us about its positive effects but will exclude its side effects as their poppularity of the product will decrease .
for example the advertisements of fair cream .
they will present their product in this form that it is the best of all the products and has no side effects .
they will not even tell us about the harmful chemicals which are added in it .
so by this meathod a consumer is cheated .

but some advertisements do form a true image in front of the public .
for example renouned brands such as nike , reebok , they have their reputition for their quality products .
they will exclude making false statement .
but most of the companies today dont care about the quality of the product and will tend making low quality products and selling them by making false image of their product through advertisements .
another good example of false advertisements is various schemes launched by the company with thier products such as if one buys thier product he or she will get a free scratch card by which one could win a handfull amount of money .
but all these schemes are shown in the advertisements in order to make thier product different and to increase the sale of their product .

so from the above examples i conclude that advertisements are generally preferd by the seller to make its products different and attractive in front of the public .
