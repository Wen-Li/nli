I strongly agree with the statement that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .
The reasons are following .
The first reason is that the pictures that on the advertisements are very attractive .
Most advertisements have some pictures .
That is very efficient for us .
The pictures are taken by photographer and maybe some pictures are created by computers .
I have an example of the attractive pictures that on the advertisements .
I want to say about foods advertisements .
When i choose resturant , i check the advertisement .
It shows what kinds of food do they have , or the looking of foods .
When i see the poster or the advertisement , I really think the food is same as the picture , but it is not same .
I have that kinds of experience .
The picture looks really delicious , but when i see the food it is not i expected .

The second reason is that the text that on the advertisements .
There are some comments and tells how the products are good things or some benefitable aspects .
The comments have strong power , i think .
People read the texts , and be attracted by the texts .
The people who make advertisements consider how people will interest in the products very well .
Therefore the making people use attractive comments and coustmer will believe that .
Even if the comments are not exactly ture , advertisements appeal that points .

The most important point of advertisements is that show products better than they really are .
That is third reason .
In the conclusion , i support the idea that most avdertisements make products seem much better than they really are .
I think the advertisements should be the idea , because that is the mostimpor
