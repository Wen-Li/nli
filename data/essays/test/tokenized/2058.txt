Advertisements are a tool of communicating with the people , the buyers .
Their main focus of making an advertisement is to bring profit , sell as much as they can and bring more porfit in a small amount of time .
Because the people tend to focus mainly on their purpose and their goal , most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .

The advertisers ' initial purpose of advertisements is to bring a great amount of profit .
And to successfully achieve their purpose , they need to put as much effort they can in to the advertisements .
In order for the increase in their profit , for them , they need to catch the people 's attention by their advertisement .
Therefore , they make products seem much better than they really are to buy the people 's attraction .
It is for their own profit to exaggerate to make the products look better .

In addition , they make the products seem better than reality since the advertisements are usually quick snapshots of that product or done in a small amount of time .
So , they need to get as much attention they can get from the audience in a very short moment .
Therefore , they are limited in time ( for T.V commercials ) and material ( for newspaper , paper , board advertisements ) to deliever the whole message of the product .
Thus , as they try to show the people everything beneficial and the good side of the products , it tends to get exaggerated than the real .
For them , it is also a tool to hide the faults of the product under the advertisements and to sell them out to the people .

In conclusion , it is for them to achieve their goal to increase as much profit they can within a limited time and material that they are given to adveritse that makes the products seem exaggerated .
Moreover , the advertisers usually put in all the advatages of the product without any faults which tend to give out a better product than it really is .
It is not an intended fault but since most of the advertisers are more for making profit than supplying the truth , the products tend to seem much better than the reality .
