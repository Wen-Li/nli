Success is an interesting but complicated issue at the same time .
The common idea of a successful person is often associated with being ambitious and take new risks and initiatives , expecially regarding one 's carreer .
On the other side , other successful people are the ones who can do very well one thing , usually their job .

In my opinion , success can be found in a combination of these two attitudes : it is a matter of ambitiousness and will to try new ways and dedication and passion for one 's activity .

It 's about improving what we believe it is our main quality , and at the same time , discovering new patterns to develop it .
But it could be sometimes hard to challenge one 's limits , as well as extremely rewarding , both emotionally and socially .

For example , there 's a huge company in my hometown producing clothes .
At the beginning , 30 years ago , it was only a small laboratory where two brothers , both tailors , worked producing shirts , and focusing on a high quality service for few , known people .
This small shop was very well known in the city .
This was considered a success in terms of fulfilling their dream to open a shop with their savings and reach a good reputation for their work in their hometown .

But after a decade , they decided to go beyond production , and started to design their own shirts : it was certainly a risk at the beginning , but it proved to be a smart choice after a while .
The two brothers ' company soon became very appreciated in the region and it 's now one of the country 's biggest fashion company , producing not only shirts but suites .
They also export and have many shops around the world , being one of the most famous brands in this field .
I believe this brief story shows how success is about accomplishing your goals but also risk and try new things at the same time , because you could find out new skills and habilities that you may not know to possess .
