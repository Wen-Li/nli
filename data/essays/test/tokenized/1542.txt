This twenty first century is the century of technology and now almost everything is so materialized and sophisticated with the help of machines that now hardly anybody have to do lots of manual work .
This is even proved with the invention of cars that are made many years ago and there is lot more to come , Think of the time when there were no cars or any other vehicle , then it will surprised you that how people used to manage at those times .
So , can you now think of life without cars .
I think its not practical possible .

Well , I think that now almost everybody wants to have their own car , so there is no question that there will be fewer cars than they are today .
As there are many advantages of having our own car , like one can reach on time at their work places .
People do n't have to wait for public transport to come and can manage to do their work in time .
Also there is no time limitation if one is moving by his or her own car and will go according to one 's convenience .
Moreover , people can go more conviently in their cars than in the public transports .

Even , there are certain places were their are no routes for public transport and people can only move by their convience .

Furthermore , with the advent of newer technologies various sophisticated models of cars are being made according to the peoples convience .
And i too personally feel that in this today 's fast life , anybody who is earning sufficiently will first try to have a good car for himself / herself .
Moreover , having car is also taken as a society symbol these days .

So , keeping all these views , one can say that there will be more cars in use than they are today as now everybody is working to make their life better .
