I agree completely with the statement that most advertisements provide misleading information on the products which relate to .

In addressing this matter , we should consider the fact that the advertising is playing a crucial and substantial role in the current and modern trade of goods .
Take the case of two similar products , one of which massively advertised , while the other one lightly promoted .
You can be sure that even if the latter has better feature or is for instance more heathly , it will face a number of sales lower than that the more advertised product will receive .

Since the companies are aware of how advertising the products influence the decisions of customers in choosing an item instead of another one , they are stimulated to present their products by showing off the positive aspects of the products and by hiding the negative ones .
In most cases , in presenting the products companies attributes to them qualities that they do not even have only for the purpose to increase the relevant sales .

How many times have you heard about people that want to return the products they bought or they complain about the relevant features expected in the products ?
I am sure that nearly all of us have experienced this situation .
Due to the high competition on the market , companies do not really care to be completely fair in presentig their products , they are only driven by the aim to reached the highest sales .

However , I believe that if in certain cases a misleading advertising do not bring any damage to the customers , on the other hand certain advertsements that submit untrue information about the qualities of a product may adversely affect a customer .
For instance , you can face this problem with food procuts .
Some people are pushed to haevily use a product beacuse of its supposed ingridients and qualities , but if the products does not contain the presented qualities it may really hurt such people .
One friend of mine was used to eat a special food in order to lose weight .
Unfortunately , this food did not produced the effects advertised , but on the other hand my friend by an hude use of this food has suffered other kind of damages .
