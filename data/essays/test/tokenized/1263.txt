I never reflect about this , before but it is a interesting question .
I agree more or less .
in fact undertand what we learn , and why it ' like that , it 's very important for student .

if the student just learn facts without understant ideas and concept they ca n't do them own opinion .
and this for all .
for economy , for history , for mathematic , for all we learn at th university .
it'very important to learn with intellgence .
udnerstand ideas and concepts has for consequence to have an opinion , own opinion .
necesseraly you juge what you are learning .
this very important because like that humans are not robots , they are hot scheep with the seme opinion .

for example on history if students learn fact whitout understand il , they ca n't see mistaces and problems .
they just learn .
it 's not in off for humanity .
we have to understand the word and what'happening .
we have to see , juge and do a own opinion .
if the student , taht 's mean , the future human , do n't udnerstand nazi and just learn the date of war , they ca n't see when people thing again , and begening again raciste .
if the people d'ont understand why the ONU is created , they ca n't understan why when a coutry take a decision even if ONU do n't want it , it 's not the possible .

it 's the seme for all .
in scientific facts for understand how is the word why he 's like that or like this , we have to udnerstund theories not just learn formules .

but , learn facts can be utile , because first you learn facts and then you try to understand ideas and concept .
you can do this without you did that .
it 's necessary to learn facts because like that you can udnerstand ideas .

understand ideas and concept when you learn facts , it 's the key to be free .
free in your opinion , free in your jugement and free in your life .
because when you undnerstand your word you 're not passive but active and that is the most important , to be active , to be unique by your culture , your opinion .
