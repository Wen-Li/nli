I do not agree with the statement , that in twenty years , there will be fewer cars than nowadays .
In my oppinion , it will be completely the opposite .
I think they are getting more important for the people .
The humans like to arrive everything quickly and also if there are other possibilities as trains , busses or plains , they will probably never reach every place in your country .
You have also to pay attention to the development of human behaviour , the people are used to get more and more as much comfort as they could have .
Many people do not like to walk very long , because they are already too lazy for it , so that 's why some people get also to short pathes by car .
Probably , there will be some people who will not drive anymore a car , because of enviromental reasons .
But I think there will be much more , who do not care about such things .
Also if the industry do not produce as much cars as it used to be , there are other reasons .
For example financial aspects , because people often buy used cars .
Cars are also not only practically for your movement , but also to transport things , for example if someone wants to buy food or furniture .
Another reason is , that some people use the car to go to their work , because it is the fastest and most comfortable way .

It is also important to notice the development in techniquesalways progresses , that is why there will always be new , safer and better cars and there will be a lot of people who would like to have them .

I think the economy will always support and influence the people to buy cars , because they also do not want to sell fewer cars and to earn less money .
In my oppinion , cars are very important for many people in many different parts of their life and so intergrated in their doings , that they will not miss or substitute it .
That is why I would not agree with this statement .
