Even though some people might disagree , I strongly agree with the statement that most advetisement help products seem better than real value .

First , I , recently , bouhgt a new car because its advetisement is very attractive .
I just wanted simple designed car which has only basic functions .
I did not need any music instruments in my car .
One day , I saw a TV commercial of the car I considered whether to buy .
In the promotion , one cool guy was driving very fast .
Soon after that , I dicided to buy it because I admired the man in TV commercial .
Even though my has basic functions that I needed , it looked very stylish more than the real car .

Second , I also bought new computer .
In the store , I talked with sales representatives about some kinds of computer .
He strongly reccomended to buy DELL one .
He appealed swift reacion of keyboard , high-speed access to internet , and light weight .
I recognized that other types of computers that I considerd to buy were not so much different from DELL one .
However , his promotion deipicted more multi-functioned and useful than others .
Then I bought DELL one .

In conclusion , on the basis of reasons I discussed above , I disagree with the statement that most adverstiesement make products look better than those of reality .
