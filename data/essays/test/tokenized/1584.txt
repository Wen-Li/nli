I disagree with the idea that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide .
There are mainly two reasons described below .

First , good things for travelling to me are knowing more about the places or the countries and knowing more about people from there .
For example .
I want to know what they usually do , eat and think about something .

Second , when travalling in a group , people are likely to talk in a group , not talking to people from the places where they travel except for only needed communications .
When travelling led by a tour guide , we can not go to places we want to go to .
Nothing we can do if we spend more time on the specific places and if we want to go anywhere tour usually do not select .

For example , I usually rent a car when I travel .
Driving around the city is such a fun and very good for knowing people from the city and even driving law in city .
For example , there is a round intersection in australia and kind of difficult for people from other countries to drive through the intersection , but once you get used to it , it is such a convenient intersection .
I never felt like that if I did not rent a car .
And also , when I have a problem , I have to deal with it by myself like asking someone for a help .
This is also a good example that I can not get something that I can never do from group tour .

But , travelling alone is sometimes dangerous for some people , so be carefull to choose the way to travel .

I think that the best way to travel in a small group by themselves for maximizing their experience .
