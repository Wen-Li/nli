I agree with the statement that it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts .
The reason why i agree with this is because without understanding the fact there is no use of learning it .
If you understand a concept you will find it easy to apply .
For example if you are taking a class and you will ge gven assignments .
If you just read the the textbook you can answer some straight questions but not the logical ones , for which you have to understand .
Suppose if you understand the concept you will be in a position to answer any type of question related to that topic because you know what is happening with that system .
For example take the functioning of heart , here the fact that we learn is the heart pumps blood to different parts of the body .
If you just come to know about that without understanding how it is pumping the blood it remains a mystery .
On the otherhand if you understand the functioning of heart you will have that picture in your mind .

Once you understand the whole concept of what you are reading it becomes easy for you to remember what it is and you need not spend much time on that subject because as you understand it will be saved as an imaginary picture in your mind .
Understanding the concept saves a lot of time during the final examinations as you dont have to struggle remembering that because that picture is already printed in your mind and you just have to refresh it which will take much lesser time .
Understanding the concept also helps for future classes because the higher the class you are going means you are going to read most of the known facts with an elaborated sense .
So if you dont get the concept in the earlier classes you will never understand what it is and you will be lagging behind compared to other students .
Understanding the concept influences the grade which is very clear .
So to be in competetion i agree that getting a concept is important than just learning the fact .
