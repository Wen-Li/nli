In todays , people are looking too much the outer than the inner side .
An ugly girl can be shown as one of the most beatiful girl by some makeup .
The advertisements are same as the make up used in the girl , it is not understood until it is cleared or tasted by some way .
Although some people can believe that most advertisements are trusthworthy , show their products as they are , I disagree with that .
I maintain that it is only a finger in the hand in amount because of the competition between producers and social results .

First of all , there is always competition between the producers .
In order to take a big slice in the corresponding area , they should advertise them as if they are the best in their field .
They need a better slogan , If you are in front of a tv and zapping the channels , you can easily see that all firms claim that they produce the most powerful product , no one mentions about the minuses they have .
The side affects of the products are not mentioned also .

Secondly , I was confronted too many feed backs in internet .
The consumers are applyin to the consumer rights .
such as that she bought the hair cleaner because it protects the hair but her hair becomes more unhealthy buy using .
The ads are not correct .

As a result , the advertisements are not showing how they are , in stead they act as how the consumer expects from them .
