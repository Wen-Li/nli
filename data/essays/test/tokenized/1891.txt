( Understanding )

Understanding is a way to use the brain to think about something to reach to the fact .
I gree with the statment that said `` it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts '' bacuse many reasons .

Firstly , by understanding we can argue and speak about any thing with any body and give our opinion .
Because if a person understand , this means that he will have alot of supporting idea which by it he can convience any body .
Secondly , by understanding we can correct any mistake that this idea or concept has .
For example , we heard alot about some theories which corrected and developed in the past like Bohr theory .
Finally , understanding is a good way to active the brain and makes it to work .
Because this thing increases the space of thinking and our knowledgment .

In a conclusion , I advise any person to think and understand anything he listins or reads because the understanding is the only way to learn facts .
