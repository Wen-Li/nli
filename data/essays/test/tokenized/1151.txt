In my opinion I think that successfull people try new things or take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well is correct .

People they are rich or have a good reputation , have a big selfconfedent .
So its is easier for them to try new things and take maybe risks .
I think they have the money and if they loose somthing , by doing riskfull things or trying new things , they take not so much damage as less richer people .
They have the chance to try out new things because , they are save because of their money or wellknowness .

A good example are actors like Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie they adopped children form fare countries , like Cambocha .
The risk is that these children have dangerous illnesses , or other people see this adoption as a bad thing .
So maybe some people hate them for adopting these children and so Pitt and Jolie get problems .

They can lost their good reputation and will maybe get in future not good actorrules .
An other example is Paris Hilton , she acts very provocant and a lot of people hate her because of her character .
She iss often drunked , or makes a lot of embarassing things .
So I think she dos this because she has the oppurtunity , she is rich , wellknown and has a big name .
But she could takes also a lot of risks by doing such provocant things .
People ignore her more and more and say she is crazy and did not want to see her .
So I think her reputation status will be more and more less .

In my view the rich and wellknown people can do such things , I stated at the top of my report , because they have the money and the reputation .
Their social live is saved and they will not get so a lot of problems like `` normal people `` if they fail sometimes .
