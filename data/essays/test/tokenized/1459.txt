Today in our day to day life we watch lot of advertisements in television , newspapers and magazine .
Advertisements have become an important medium for growth and raise of the certain product .
Advertisements tells us some different and unknown things of the product in an short time which usually sometimes we can do it by buying the product and understand the usuage and importance of product .
However some advertisements doesnt prove the product better than they really are .
I disgree with the statement , sometimes advertisements doesnt make products seem much better than they really are .

In the television channel we come across lot of advertisements about weight loss products .
They say that the person is going to loss 5 kgs in 1 week but it is not all happens .
For example , recently my cousin whose in suffering weight problems had seen the advertisement of weight loss product and she has taken the product and she started using it .
But shockingly she gained extra 4 kgs instead of loss weight .

The advertisements had misleaded her completly had made her attracted taken the advantage of people .

In the daily newspaper , recently i have read an article about an article its all about improve communication skills by buying books .
Theres and free gift of pack of CDS along with the books .
However when i went to the shop and asked about the books .
They said that the cds are not for free but i need to some extra 10 $ to get the CDs along with books .
The adverstisements in newspapers sometimes doesnt convey accurate and real message about the product .

Recently i saw an advertisements in television about the metallic guitar and thought of giving it as an birthday gift to my friend .
The advertisement has given orginal cost as 100 $ with taxes included for 1 yr warranty .
However when i bought the guitar and started practising it for few months i have foung its not working fine and one day the string of guitar has broken .
When i took this guitar to the shop the shop keeper has said the warranty has been as long and past offer given to customer and it doesnot exists anymore .

Advertisements must bring an postive approach for people to buy it and feel satisfaction when they really buy them .
It should not mislead the customer , which could cause bad reputation for the product and decline in growth of the sale of product .
