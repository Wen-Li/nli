It is almost impossible to disagree that the advertisements make their products seem much better than they really are .
There may be a lot of reasons listed to agree this statement , but the fact that they grant impossible things happening is more than enough to prove the point .
Furthermore , the importance companies put on and the percent of budget they spare for the advertisement departments also show that they might not manage to come up with a very good product , but they can still compete within the market by effectively advertising .
The temptation of the shiny products on most people is yet another thing to strengthen the statement .

First , there is the issue of impossibility of some of the advertisements .
One advertisement of Nike Air stated that it makes you jump higher and stay in the air longer than its competitors , using Michael Jordan slam dunking from outside of the three-point area .
The physical explanation to the ` staying longer in the air ' can not be explained by the power of the shoe , but it can be explained by the muscle power that is trained through years by the athlete .
Despite this fact , the existence of Michael Jordan in the advertisement made most people think that they can do the same in his shoes .

Moreover , another advertisement of a car manufacturer showed people that are not in possession of that brand were ashamed of their cars once the car of that brand was in the street , and tieing balloons to their cars to make them go away because of their shame .
This situation is impossible from many different angles , two of them being ( a ) people would not give away ten thousands of dollars just because their shame for their car , ( b ) it is not possible to fly a car with a few balloons .
However , especially the car of brand being too shiny and glamorous and other cars dirty and overused , the car seemed a lot better than the others .
The car was not the best in horse power , safety regulations , looks or comfort , but the advertisement made it sell the most within the market .

Second , the budget spared for the advertisement in most of the companies strenghten the statement .
One study showed that statistically more than one third of the budget of the companies in the top 100 list showing the most profit was spared for the advertisement department .
This collaboratively agrees to the idea that when these companies are unable to compete with the quality of the product of their rivals , they try to sell it with effective advertising .

Last , but certainly not the least , people buy some products just because they are attracted by the advertisement - even when they do not need the products .
The first item that comes to mind is the technologic products .
When something is new or in sale , there is more emphasis put on its advertisement .
When one thinks of the iPods or iPhones , the situation is clearer .
In my country of residence , it is shown by a reliable study that more than half of the iPods sold were to people that either barely appreciated listening to music , or the ones that are too busy to spare time to use to iPod .
However , they bought the item , inasmuch they saw it on TV or newspaper , probably either too shiny , or in sale .

As a conclusion , considering the budget spared for the advertisement departments , impossibility of some of the advertisements and the easiness of people to be tempted to buy products they might not need or use at all , I concur and claim that most products are overrated by their advertisements .
