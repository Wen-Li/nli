In the modern business world , many large companies , especially in the consumer goods industry , are marketing driven .
Marketers try to convince consumers that the product of their company is superior to all its competing products .
Our society is responding very well to promotions and advertisements and the marketing message behind it .
Trends are often developed by promises of a company in its products .

I agree with the statement that most ads make the products better than they really are .
Many advertisements show celebrities , sports professionals or other famous people using a product .
Companies want consumers to believe that using their product will make them equaly beautiful or successful like the stars in TV .

A good example are the Nike commercials with Tiger Woods .
He is playing around with golf balls and then hitting some shots .
At the end consumer should believe that buying a Nike Golf club will improve the score at the golf course .
Unfortunately , it 's not that easy .

The cosmetic industry for women is another classic example , how advertisements can mislead end consumers .
You see a famous and beautiful person using a certain cream and then the lady in front of the television at home thinks that if she buys this cream , she will look like Julia Roberts .

A more simple example are advertisements for food in the daily newspaper .
Supermarkets always show us the best and most beautiful pictures of vegetables and meat .
If you finally go their , the products will look a little different [ at least in some countries ] .

Sometimes advertisements even get a cult status and phrases are taken over in daily communication .
This proofs for a marketing agency that they were really successful and that they have reached their customers .
I often heard a person on the street saying - just do it - this was maybe one of the best slogans ever and for sure gives more attention to a sport shoe , then it deserves !
