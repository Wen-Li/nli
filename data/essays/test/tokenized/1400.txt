Althogh both learing by experience and studying pricipals of the subjects are significant parts of learn facts , I agree with that understanding ideas is more important for academic situations .

Fistly , studying ideas and concepts are effecticve for learing , beacause it support to distinguish the fact .
For examlpe , if I searched endangered alpine plants during hiking a mountain , I could not find which is the specific family of the plant .
Moreover , by previous investigation for the plant is anable to me where I should go .
Therefore , understanding the concepts should be centered .

Secondly , comprefension of idas and concepts are crucial for develop our knowlege .
For instance , when I research endangerd alpine plants without seeking information of the facts which already discovered , I would waste of my time and fureser reaching to consider the cause of extinction .
Because the fact is so largThus , understanding ideas is advantageous for learning , since this advanced study allows us not only recognize the fact but aslo make progress of learning facts .

Consequently , I definitely think that if it were not understanding fundermental of each area , the study would be insufficient .
