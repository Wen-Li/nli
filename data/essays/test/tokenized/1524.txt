What it is more important something abstract or something pracmatic .
That is a hard to answer question .
Probably some phd in education is able to answer this question better .
How a baby learn to talk , or learn the name of a fruit or what it is a car .
Babys learn with facts .
They start with the all or the facts and then go to the concepts and ideas .
Many of teachers are agree with teach based on facts , and examples .
In this way to teach , they want to change the traditional way to do it and they go into the nature essence of the human been .

Then after the student understand the meaning of the subject , the student now is capable to learn concepts , ideas , similitutes and differences of the subject .
For modern teaching improved with the experience it is more important to learn facts .
One example of this is the way to teach mathematics today in some places .
Today the student learn with real problems .
The student has a supermarket list , and he has 10.00 dolars for example and should buy different kind of staff .
With this exercice the student based on a real subject and a familiarized topic will learn math .
Additionally , the student learn thinks of the real life .
In the previous example , the student could learn addition , multiplication , and several mathematics tools .

It is very difficult to learn a concepts that the student never was contact before .
If one student that never read about a cell , should be easy to him , see the cell in the microscope before and then , understant the concept of a cell how the basic structure of the life .
Then the student can learn what it is an epitelium , an organ and the whole structure of animals , humnas , and plants .

I strongly beleave that the student must learn with facts , and then start to understant ideas and concepts .
