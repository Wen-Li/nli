`` Move fast everyone !
We have to hurry for the next courses to see . ''
It is common situation when we travel in a group with tour guide in the popular places .
In my opinion , traveling in a group led by a tour guide is not the best way to travel .
First reason is that it is time consuming .
In addition I can experience adventuruous travel when travel alone , not led by a tour guide .

First of all , when we travel with other people in a group , it is time comsuming .
Everytime we move to other places to see , we have to wait for other people who did not arrive at bus from the first place .
I had a bad experice when I traveled to China in a group led by tour guide .
The first spot we visited was Great Wall and next course was trying some traditional Chinese food .
However , there were some people who lost their way in the Great Wall and did not come to the place we promised to meet .
Almost one and half hour past , they finally arrived at the meeting place and we could not take the next courses and mess up whole valuable day for travel .

Moreover , I can have great opportunity to experience the unique and adventurous things at unfamilar places .
When we travel with a tour guide , they always offer us the perfect schedule for travel .
However , there are many people who want to experience special things and take some risks when they travel , not the formal courses that travel agency offers .
I went to Japan twice , the first time was travel in a group led by tour guide and the second time was travel alone , The first time was really convenient because I had to just simply follow my tour guide but it was not that intersting .
However , when I travel to Tokyo for myself , I have to find my way with maps and directions to get to the popular places .
It took more time to get there , but it gave me a lot of valuable experinces and I saw and heard much more traditional things in Japan during the travel .

To sum up , I think it is not best way to travel in a group led by a tour guide .
It can be time consuming to wait other people to move to next place .
Moreover , with the tour guide I can not have make my travel courses freely and can not get some valuable experience from difficulty or hard in travel .
I think travel have to give us feel of free , and great experiences of that country or places .
