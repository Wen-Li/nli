Some people talks that children nowadays do not give enought time to helping their communities .
Other people talk that children spend a lot of time to helping their communities .
I think that young people nowadays spend their time play videogames , to play football or basketball , to running , a watching TV and not helping their communities .
First of all young people nowadays think that communitiers are not important for their life .
In their life is better have a beautiful car , a good friends for enjoying , a pretty girlfriend , a great shoes and a lot of money .
Thus they are not interesting at helping their communities .

Secondy , children that next generation are most affidable and responsable for their communities .
For example they went to the church every sunday with their family .
I think that young people ca n't make decision alone .
Parents must be stay with their children because they are important for them .
I often help my communities because i love my community .
My community is very important for me .
I know a family that is not a very family because the father always at work and the mother is usually at shopping center .
In this family there are two children that are always at home .
They do n't have a friend and they not have a family with them .

In conclusion communities not pretended helping from young people today because children they have many problems .
However some people can helping their communities for helping these children that have problems .
