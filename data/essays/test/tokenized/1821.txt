I agree that successful people try new things and take risks than other people .
Without these kinds of people , our world will not improve so quickly .
In addition , we will not live in such a boring world .

Successful people creat new sight for us , and they provide new job opportunities , interesting life styles , and they overcome themselves .

First of all , because they like to try novel things and take higher risks , they might have great chance to discover new things such as more effective way to solve problems and the new bisiness opportunity .
These will provide us diverse job choices and the job opportunity .

Next , if our daily lives are all the same and unchangable , there is nothing fun in this world .
Also , the improvement wo n't appear anymore .
Could you image that you are now still living in the cave where there is no electric light ?
Due to these creative people 's credit , we can live more comfortable and convenient .
They succeed and lead us to a whole new world .

Finally , successful people they will get self-confidence after overcome themselves .
They prefer to take risks and try to find some approachs to overcome the problems , so they are more likely to get success .
If they just do the things that they have alreadt knewn before , their lives will not be completed and satisfied .

All in all , people who like to change will have easy access to the success since they do n't just do what they already know .
Compared to gengeral public , they are more willing to try new things and they welcome the challenge .
Thus , they are more probably to succeed in this competitive world .
With these group of people , our world wo n't be boring anymore , and we can live meaningfully and colorfully .
We will feel interesting and happy everyday .
