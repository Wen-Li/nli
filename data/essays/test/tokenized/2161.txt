I agree that the best way to travel with a group is useful than to travel by individually .
Because it is less expensive when compared to others .
The amount that you required to pay will be divided .
If you will travel individually then the money to pay for the guide is much compared with the group travelling .
Secondly whe we travell with group that will lead to great environment of enjoyness .

And the journey will also be enjoyable with others and we will never feel boring while travelling .
Actually tour guide will have the prominent place to make the tourists to enjoy the tour .
He should entertain the tourist people .
Some people do n't like to travel with others .
They think that spending more money is better than to travel with others .
But it is only partly correct .
That will be there own interest , depending up on the status that they have .
Actually rich people who have high status in the society do n't like to travel with others .
Middle class people will show much interest in group travelling .
But this statement is not totally correct .
Actually what would happend when we travelling with others is we have the possibility to know about others and to make friendship with them .
Actually tour means that we are going to enjoy , so with othere people we will have a great time .
So i really prefer to travel with others .
If there is no guide then there is no need to travel because , we do n't know all the places which was to visit .
So a guide ca
