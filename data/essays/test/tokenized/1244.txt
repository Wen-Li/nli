Knowledge is power and it 's playing an effective role among the world .
Without knowledge you can not think , learn and creat .
In my opinion It 's better to have broad knowledge of many subjects which make you more open minded and well done .
Some people prefer to specialize in one subject and some do n't like it dependes on the fields .
Some fields need to specialize and some no need .
The person who has broad knowledge and more experirnces , he is most wanted and accepted .

For example , the general manager who has MPA degree he knows everythings about the business and administration he can controls his the organaization unless it has many sections such as marketing , managing qaulity , advertising and others .
So the wide knowledge makes the person to be more creative and good decsion maker in his personal and work life .

Broad knowledge is giving you more background and ideas about your work and your life .
Other thing we have to invest our knowledge in developing and improving our country and socity to be the best among the world .
Knowledge is great thing we can consider it as the langague of the world and the progress of any country .
