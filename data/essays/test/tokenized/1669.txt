yes , I agree that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .
Advertisemnts are a great mode of propaganda of things of various kinds , ranging from food stuffs to high technology machines , like plasma tv .
With the ever increasing competition in the market , the manufacturers have diverted to option of advertisements .
But not everything shown in the advertisements are true .
This is true because every manufacturer tries to lure the consumer by branding his/her own product as the best in the market .
But a small market survey and a small study on the product would reveal that there are in fact many better product available .

Also the advertisers always depict the products very differently and in a graceful manner , as if it was the only `` rose in the garden '' .
This is done to make the product more and more attractive .
The advertisers also fail to indicate in what ways that product was different from the other one in the same category .
For example the contents and ingredients of a particular drink , or even its nutritional contents are not clearly expressed .
And even if they are expressed they are exaggerated to a very high level .

While advertising , there is a lot of technological assistance implemented .
For example a TV advertisement clip can be processed to increase the appearance and contrast of the clip .
Using various tools the saturation level of colours of the clip and its contrast can be changed to make the product look more colourful and more attractive .

Nowadays , there is a trend of having popular personalities in the advertisents appealing and recommending , the consumer to buy the product he or she is endorsing .
Movie stars , sports starts are commonly found in the advertisents .

These are several of the ways of advertising and an attempt to lure a person into buying that product .
I would like to recommend to buy only after true examination of the products and comparing them with the other products of that particular class .
Also since the manufacturers invest heavily on advertising , this adds to the selling price of the commodity increasing its value and becoming more expensive .
So we should go for quality of the product and not for the quality of advertisements .
The consumer should realize that it is always better to personally view the product and buy rather than to watch the product in the advertisement and going for it .
