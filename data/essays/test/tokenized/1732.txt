I do not agree with idea that the best way to travel is in a group led bty a tour guide .
There some reasons to oppose it .
First of all , travel is usually a great plesure for people .
They might have worked hard and saved money to realize the dream that they make a travel to where they want to go .
Therefore , they must eager to visit any sight seeing place or nature things such as revers or mountains and take enough time to enjoy attending the place .

Of course traveling in a group with a tour guide has a lot of advantages .
Once , I actually experienced the tour in this situation and spent a really nice time .
A tour guide can give us much information concerned to something they are going to see , so they can enjoy sight seeing thanks to the deeper knowledge .
Also , tour guides are usually very good at making people fun , attendants might have unexpected pleasant event .
However , traveling in a group doen not have only good points .
Precisely , attendants are not free to act .
They always have to keep the time given .
For exemple , if a man want to buy survenia to his family at the moment because the product is limited one , he would not be able to buy it because of the departing time of the bus .
When a man suddenly feel sick or feel like going to a bathroom , the bus will not stop in order to felp only one person because there are a lot of other customers .
Yes , the problem is it ; you are not the main person in the trip in spite of your feeling enjoying yourself .
You are just one of many customers to the tourism company .

Compared to it , how wonderful the freedom of making a travel without a tour guide is !
Travelers can go to everywhrer they want and take their time to do everything , They can conduct themselves as they like unless it makes surrounding people uncomfortable .
Happy go lucky trips will surely bring people precious experiences .
