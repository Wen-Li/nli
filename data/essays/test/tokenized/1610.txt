I agree with this statement for different reasons .
First of all , in order to be successful , we have to try new things and take risk because life is always changing .
What was true yesterday is not necessarly true today .
If someone wants , for example , to be sucessful in business , he would better take risks and adapts himself to the law of changes .
Indeed , during the industrial revolution in Europe , the ones who took the risk to develop their industry through machines were more successful than the ones who kept manual and artisanal way of working .

Even in a relationship , people who do only what they already know how to do well , get bored .
People needs are evolving through the different stages of their lives .
One have to adapt himself to the other people evolving needs .

According to Darwin , this statement is true even for the human specie .
The one who adapt to his environment survive , the others die .

When I was a teenager , I refused to see that I had to take risks in order to be successful .
I did never get involved emotionaly in a relationship because I feared that I would fail or get hurt .
This way , I was not failing , but also I was not successful .
Today , I take more risk in this area , and I definitely got hurt many times , but I had some victories .
The main one is that I am more opened to life .
Being successful in life mean also to be willing to take risk .

A president of the United States once said : It is better to see things in big rather than willing to achieve small goals and belong to the group of weak ' spirit people who do not know neither victory nor defeat .
I also hear once that the way to success is paved by mistakes and that nobody is failing , there are only people who stop trying .
