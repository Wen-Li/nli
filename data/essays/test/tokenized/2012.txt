Actually , I agree with this idea because many reasons .
First , i think when the student understand the idea and concepts the subject he will able to work well .
For example , the chemist , if he understand the ideas he could explain the chemistry .
On the other hand if he just learn facts about the chemistry he will not be able to explain .

Second , if anybody understand anything he will never forget it whatever time long but if he learn facts that will make him may forget it after long time .
And even if the one who understand forget , he wo n't take long time to rememmber what he understand .

For instance , you can see the scientests who very old can remmeber , explain and express many thing which young people ca n't mention it .

Learn facts looks like momerizing .
If there is any exption you will not be able to figure or distinguish it .

Understanding ideas make you able to solve or obsorve any quistion or problem you will face even it exption .

For example of this tow cases , we can take the mathmatics as example for subject .
Even you know all facts about it , and if you did n't understand it you will fail by any treky quistion .

Finally , i think learn facts is old method to study .
When the people did n't have the ability to understand things and many phenomna over the world may they have to learn facts as it as .
But today , I think we have the ability to understand and we have the book and many recoces we can us it to explain thing .
So , understanding is demand in this time and learn facts will not help peple to prduce
