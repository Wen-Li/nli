I strongly oppose the idea that '' Successful people try new thins and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well . ''
Because , In my opinion , if a person wants to be succesful , he has to concentrate on just one subject and has to learn all the aspects .
I am willing to discuss it by proposing two main reasons ;

One of the primary reasons is that people suppose to do the same things to get proficiency .
For example , suppose a person who has been playing drums for ten years , even if he tries new things and takes risks , he could forget what he knows in drum and probably could not be the one in his new field .
I am a determined person and I always want to be perfect in what I am doing .
Therefore , Being interested in one thing and focusing all the small details , makes an individual complete and more succcesful .

The second reason is that , when you are doing what you already know , you feel yourself more comfortable and relaxed because you will be more self confident .
Thus when you believe in yourself there will be nothing for you that you can not handle it .
For instance , my brother is a professional chess player and if he takes risks and tries to do other sports , I know that he can not be successful even it makes him unsuccessful person .
Because he knows how to play chess and he knows that chess is the most convenient way to express his feelings .

To sum up , I think people have to discover what they are capable of , and have to find out the ways of being much better rather than trying new things .
Because only by this way an indiviual can achieve his goals and can lead a successful life .
