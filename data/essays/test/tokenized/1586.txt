The question at hand is what helps students more - understanding ideas and concept or learning the facts .
Though I agree that mostly learning a theory is crucial to gain insights about any topic , however if it is supported by the facts , it expedites the process of learning .

To start with , in many cases a student can not visualize a concept unless a physical fact accomponies with it .
Imagine how easy it is to explain a kid gravity by showing its example compared to explaning it just in theory .
So a thoery with a fact is sometimes easier to grasp for a student .
Another example is subjects like physics and chemistry .
One can not learn these subjects just by reading books .
This is reason all schools provide practical classes along with lectures for these subjects .
Also , sometimes just knowing a concept does not help to gain the complete understanding , facts are required to complete them .

In addition , in certain subjects , facts play a bigger role than the theory .
For instance archeology , history and upto some extent geography too .
Archaelogy is nothing but facts .
History can not be explained just in theory .

Moreoever , if we go to the root of it , all ideas and concepts have been driven by facts only .
Each theory has been invented to explain a fact .
So in order to make students think beyond textbooks , it is almost mandatory to learn about facts .
Also , facts motivate students to find their interests .
For example , just looking at stars triggers some people to choose their profession as astronomy .

In summary , I disagree with the opinion that learning ideas and concepts has more value for the students than knowing facts .
To keep their thinking broad and comprehensive , students need to be taught both in balance .
