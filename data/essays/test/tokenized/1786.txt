`` the best way to travel in a group led by a tour guide. '' i I personally support the statement because whenever we go to a new tourist place we does n't know anyone there , and may face problems about the accommodation , nice restaurants , and may spend extra money forthings we buy over there as we are not familiar about the rates .

so , if our group is led by a guide he can help overthere .
As guides are local people can explain the his the history of places we watch .
we can enjoy the tour much more if we have a guide with us .
we feel more secureas he will be guiding us .
in a tourist place only some places are famous example in my citynamed hyderabad charminar , golconda fort , nizam palace , zoo park are famous .
most of the visitors want to visit only these places , but with these places the city have other places to watch like gandipet , ramoji filmcity , birla mandir , salarjung musium etc. if the visitors do not hav the guide with them they can watch the places which they heard before , they can not plan efficiently how to make a way to watch the places.a guide is very helpful to enjoy more on what we spent .
but choosing the right guide is very difficult task for the visitors , we have to first deside the character of the guide .
because he is the person we are going to trust , if we trust a wrong person then we have to suffer .
but only one thiong we miss if we have guide is that , we have to follow his instructions and unable to do anything we want .
I feel that if a guide is with us the reason why we make the tour can be fulfilled efficiently .
And for safe and secure tour a guide must be there .
and the guide should be enough good .

so , I personally agree with the statement given .
