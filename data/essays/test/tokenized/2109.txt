I definitely agree with the statement according to wich in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today for several reasons .

First of all , recent statistics have shown that the sales of cars have decreased these last years because the market is overwhelmed of concurrents and that the new cars become more and more reliable and can be used longer .

Secondly , there are a lot of efforts which are going to be made concerning public transportations almost in the great cities because it has become impossible to drive during the rushing hours ( e.g think about certain big cities like New-York , London , Paris , ... ) .
For instance , in London , a tax has already been settled for entering with a car in the centrum .
I 'm sure that that kind of solutions wll be soon adopted by other cities .

There are also many efforts which are projected in order to connect the cities located at the borrough to the centrum .
For example , in Belgium , they are going to build a RER like in France to connect Waterloo , Lasne , ...
( small cities which are about twenty kilometers from Brussels ) to the capital .
This will undoubtedly lead to a decrease of the numbersof cars because for the moment people are getting more and more bored with traffic jams and are waiting with happiness this RER .

Finally , another reason is that the price of petrolum has hihghly increased these last years .
When we know that the stocks are limited , we ca n't reasonnably imagine that the price will go down in the future .
It has already become a luxe to drive or having more than one car per household and I am convinced that in twenty years , things wo n't change . ..

Due to all these elements ( which for sure are not exhaustive ) , I am sure that the numer of car in tenty years will be less important than today .
