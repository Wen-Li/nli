people are different from each ather in trying new things .
However , there is a good number of people never try something alls if they know how to do that well in their own ways .
I am a gree with this statement `` successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing that already know how to do well . ''
Trying new different things and take risks are successful for me for severl reasons .

First reason , is will help me to develp my imgnation .
Not all the time when I do something new I will fell in it .

Second reason , doing somethings new and take risks for me is kind of exploer myself more .
For example , doing something new need sometime to skill .
By doing these gave a chance to Know what skills I have , I did n't know about it .

Third reason , a new experins .
I do n't like to make my life as a cape pase .
I mean by that i do n't like to do the same

Develop my imgnation is really good to make things I do more different .
Expoler myself make me trest myself more and more .
Having many expernes are going to let me know life more .
Even so all these , I never forgat be careful with what I am doing or what i will do .
