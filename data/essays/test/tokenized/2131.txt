Students must keep on learning and thinking .
Some knowledge that they gain are through understanding ideas , othres are from leraning facts .
Although both ways of gaining knowkedge is important , I believe that it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than to learn facts .
First , understanding makes easier to memorize things .
There are many things in the textbooks that student must memorize .
It is almost impossible to memorize the huge amount of information provided in the book without carefully organizing them .
Understanding ideas and consepts are the way to organize the facts you learn .
Second , understanding concepts enables you to apply your knowledge in a situaton which you have never been in .
Since ideas and concepts are not restricterd to a particular situation .
Ideas and concepts you have will enable you to analyse the situation and to make logical explanation to the incident , and finally give you the answer how to behave .
Third , it is essential to understand ideas and concepts to create something new .
Many innovation in technology came from the minute study of concepts and ideas .
For example , the invention of MRI would not have been possible wothout the understanding the concepts of quantom mechanism .
Understanding ideas and concepts are of great importance to students in helping them organize their knowledge , applying their knowledge , and to innovate new thought and materials .
