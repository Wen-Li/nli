The given statement it self indicates that the person is successful already in his carrer or in his profession .
I agree with the statement because the person is already got success in his profession he mite learn new things definately .

If a person is satisfied with his success and remains calm means no use he is already succeded thats why he should go for new things related to his profession and related to his views and etc .

If he does regularly what he knows is the worst thing , in the given statement explained that successful person tries new things and take risks rather than only doing what already know how to do well i agreed with this statement .

For example if scientist launched a new rocket called AGNI it targets or it covers a distance of 100miles then it got success .
Next time if he does the same rocket to launch no use , already he got success in that then he should go for better than that this time if his rocket tries to cover a distance of 150 miles its well and gud .

But these type of risks taken when he had sufficient amount of materials then he may go to take risk to do the risk and try for the better product than the previous .
But if in some cases if he fails he will get or the entire unit may get loss but the thing is he tried for the new thing thats more better if if got failure also taking some risks and doing the things is better .

In other case a person is a big industrialist his businesses are wide range if he stops working from that point then no success will gained if he runs same business for some time in the future he may get loss because of increasing technology , if he dont go for a new thing or tries to place other business its a very gud option .

Already that man had a wide range of business if he invents on other business or launches new products in to the markt taking some risks rather than only doing the same old business if get success in new business it is more useful .
If at all if if got loss also he can recover by the old business because its alreadyi n wide range .

Success is obtained in any case or in any field is more difficult task because losing or inventing money on other things is easy but not sure to got that back if a person is successful in his porofession then he should go for new things and new ideas , to work on the same field in many other ways and try to take some risks on that things is a good option .

Trying the new things is very big task if a person or people who are not successful in their profession they may not have a chance to take are risk the things or going for new things .
They may not risk are not go for the the new things .
Then they lagged by the people who got success .

Successful itself is the achivement then we can go for new things .
Its a very gud option to do or try for new things .
