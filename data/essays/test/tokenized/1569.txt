Nowadays we live in the era of the communication , and the advertisements are an important element in the communication .
Surely I agree with the statement purposed in the question : I think that it is true that many advertisements presents products better than they really are ; nevertheless , I would like to underline that , in my opinion , people know this process , and they do n't believe that the advertisements present the products exactly as they really are .
I would like to discuss this points to explain adequately my point of view .

According to my experience , there is no doubt that during a normal day we read , or listen , or watch many advertisements ; in fact , they are everywhere .
Surely many advertisements improve the imagine or the qualities of their products : however , I would like to say that it is normal .
Everybody knows that the aim of the advertisements is to increase the number of people that will buy a specific product .
Therefore , an advertisement must be interesting , because its goal is to catch our attention .

Therefore , on one hand I think that it is not important if an advertisement presents a product not as it really is , but , on the other hand , I also think that there are limits that must be respected .
In particular , I think that it is not correct if an advertisement deliberately presents prizes or payment conditions that are not true .
Thus , I consider negatively an advertisement if it tends to do n't respect the law .
For example , usually the banks presents their purposes not adequately , and it is a problem , because people can sign contracts where the financial conditions are written ambiguously .

On the basis of these considerations , I think that my point of view is clear : every advertisement makes products seem better than they really are , but , in my opinion it is a problem only if this process tends to not respect the laws .
However , today we live in the era of the communication , and we have to consider this risk and be careful about the content of the adverttisements .
