I agree with this statement .
It 's a common experience to buy something that reveals its real value just when you 've observed it with a little more attention .
The problem it is that usally you notice the real nature of the product after having bought it and the delusion that reaches you is propotional to the desire you have been feeling since that sad moment .

Advertisements obviously try to show their products better than they are and to make them desiderable , in order to sell them to the major number of people .
HOwever I do n't think this is always a good thing for every kind of product .
In fact there are things that a buyer needs just sometimes , and also if he is not satisfacted by what he has bought , probably the next time he will need it , he will not remember of his wrong chosen .

But there are also other products that are daily requested , and an advertisement that shows a false aspect of them maybe will move the interest of a buyer to another product .

On the other hand , I think that today people , in Italy , is less influenced by advertisements than in the past , becouse of the higher cost of life .
So also if a product is presented in a marvellous way , there is always an accurate evaluation of what someone is going to buy .
Today it ' not just important to show a product better than it really is , an important part is the thought to who will receive the message thet regards that product , that is to say for example , the importance of ouline the comparison between the quality of a product and of its cost .
