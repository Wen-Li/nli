It is questioned that students understand ideas and concepts is more importatn than for leaning facts .
I believe that understand the ideas and concepts is better for students .
In this essay , I will discuss why I support students should understand ideas and concepts when they are learning .

Whenever we learn anything , we must fist learn the concepts and the ideas of that thing .
That is the basic thing we have to know , to understand how it works and comes .
For example , if we learn mathematics , we have to first understand the basic concept of a formula .
After we understand it , we exert it and learn more formulas which is related to it .
But if a student does not fully understand the concept of the formula .
He will not be able to use it well and has difficulties in learning other formulas which require the understanding of the previous formula .
So it is improtant for the students to understand the concepts first .

Besides exerting , learning a concept can provoke people to think so that they may create a new concept .
For example , when a matheticican wants to creat a new forumla by using the preivious formula .
They will have to first comprehend thoroughly the concept of the previous formula .
Then , think about how they can amend the formula to a better one or even create a new one for different usages .
That is why people improve a lot from the past .
Becaus they understand and then they think and though creating something new which will benefict others .
If a student does not think , he will lose his creativity .

I think it is really more important for students to understand iders and concepts of everthing since there is a relationship between understanding and thinking .
