First reason of disagreement this statement is I can not decide to go some whare I want .
For example , when I was little , I traveled to U.S .
I had a tour guide .
And the guide decided to go historical place , famous park and so on .
I was so boring to go there because I was not interested in to go those kinds of places .
I wanted to go more exciting place , like an amusementpark .
This is the my first reason .

Secound reason of disagreement this statement is I have to travel with someone .
For example , when I traveled to U.S , there is a lot of people .
And there were so noisy and made me unhappy .
That was not good time for me .
So I do not travel with someone .

Third reason of disagreement this statement is the cost is more higher than to travel by my self .
For example , when I traveled to U.S , the cost was so expensive because the guide 's sammary is including in the our cost .
It is so cheap to travel by myself .
