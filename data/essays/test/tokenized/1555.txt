I totally agree with the view that successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well .

Human beings are social animals and most of the people have same knowledge and study same stuff .
Most of the people lead an ordinary life by doing things they are supposed to do based on the society in which they are living .

But few people races ahead in life , become more successful and famous .
The underlying difference is the attitude these few people have towards their life , The attitude to take risks and try new things , to rise above the level of commonality and ordinary things , the courage to be different .
Their want to challenge the set notions and ability to go beyond the ordinary makes them successful .

I would like to quote the examples of two great men who have changed the course of their nations by trying new things and taking risks .

Mahatma Gandhi was an ordinary laywer who studied law in London .
Like any other lawyer he went to south Africa to fight a case .
As the racial discrimnation was at its peak in South Africa , he was thrown off the train inspite of carrying a first class ticket .
The most convenient thing for him to do was to forget it like any other normal person at that time would have done .
But he took risk and tried things differently .
He used the force of non violence against the mightiest military force which eventually led to the freedom of India .
Not only he was successful in his times but even after his death people look upto him in reverence .
It was his attitude to do things differently and try new things that led him success .

Martin Luther King of USA tried things differently when he stood against the racial discrimination prevalent in the American Society , .
he formed the organisation and fought for the civil rights of the Black people in USA .
The discrimination was present in US society before him also .
He dared to be different and he succeded .

I feel that it needs one person in a group to try new things and take risks and the rest follows the person .
Thas how a successful person and a leader is made .
History is written by successful poeple and they change the course of civilization .
They are always remembered and looked upon .
