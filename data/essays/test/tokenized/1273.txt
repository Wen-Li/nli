I do agree with the point that successful people try new things and take risks rather than doing what they already know how to do well .
The former success fosters new ideas in the brain and also gives the push to intiate them .
There are quite a number of reasons for that .

First , the common notion says `` The success of the person increases his risk taking ability '' .
Suppose a person is well established in a business .
He has to his credit the goodwill of many customers who can buy his new products or suggest his products to the required people .
His current business qualilty assures the quality of his future products .
This proves that he has a better chance to succeed .
Higher the chance higher the risk taking ability .

Second , his prior success gives him the confidence to move on furthur .
The noraml tendency of human behaviour is to take up a task only if he is motivated to do it .
Success definetely gives that motivation to implement new ideas .
He knows the basics of managing things which has to be applied to a slightly different situation .

Third , diversification furthur helps him in reducing the risk .
A situation in which one business falls down , he has the other to depend on .
So there would be mutual support between the two firms .
So in a way by exploring new avenues he is reducing his risk .

The example of Mr.Dhirubhai Ambani proves the discussion .
He has started just with an oil refinery and then extended his market to textiles , communication and also domestic products .
This could be a good example of how success allows a person to start new things .

So it could be concluded that the more you dig into diverse fields the greater would be the overall success of a person .
This forms one of the basics of business rules .
