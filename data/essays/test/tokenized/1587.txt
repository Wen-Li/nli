Some people like to travel in a group such as a tour guided by a spscialist who knows a lot about the place , and some like to travel on their own .
If they do n't have enough time to travel , then it might be good idea to go with a specialist because they do n't spend vain time wondering or getting lost .
However , there are more good reasons why it is nice to go without tour guide in a group , and the reasons are as follows .

First of all it is because that tourlists can spend time as much as they want if they travel by themselves .
They do n't need to worry time or other tour members if they are by themselves .
On the contrary , if they go on a tour , they ca n't stay or visit the places even though they find on their own because they are always with somebody and need to follow the rules or time .

As a second , it is because that they have more opportunities to meet people or touch the culture there if they go by themselves .
For instance , tourlists are not familier with the place if it is the first time for them to visit .
So they need to ask the directions to the local people .
Then they communicate with people there using foreign language , which is great opportunity to feel the culture .
Also , it is common that people use tour buses if they travel in a tour group .
So , it is hard for them to have a opportunity to talk to local people .
On the other hand , tourlists use public transportations such as buses or trains if they go by themselves .
In this case , they can see the local people or even talk to them .
Nobody knows what happens in this conversations , maybe tourlists can get great information about places to visit , or some nice restaurants to try .

Finally , some people says that a tour guide has much information .
But there are many nice tour guide books which are avairable at book stores .
Those books are enough to cover this matter .
And moreover , it is easilly for them to get a map the place to visit .

Therefore , traveling alone has many good points , even concluding the good reasons of the tour .
There are limits about group tours with a guide , but not for tous alone .
