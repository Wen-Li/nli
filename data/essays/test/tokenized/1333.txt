The stament above refers to the issue of how advertisement presents nowdays the products in a certain way that makes people willing to buy it but not showing how the real product actually is .
I shall analyze this issue giving arguments and examples .

To analyze this issue it 's vital not to lose perspective and to remember the fierce jungle that the economy and business has become today .
It is clear that we live in a very competitive world where free economy is predominant .
If a product or a brand wants to survive and succeed , it has to raise the attention of the public presenting itself as something really amazing that is different form the rest .
That is the reason why all companies have a marketing department .
The main goal of an advertising prepared by a marketing team is to highlight to the public what are the best features of this product and why the consumer should inmmediately go to the next store and buy it or why the consumer ca n't afford to live without this product .
Of course the advertisment will not comment on the features that are not so brilliant or just a copy of the competition .
That is not the point why the advertisment was created for .

It 's a kind of a game the consumer and the companies have become used to play and they accept it as something granted .
The expert consumer no longer believes all that the advertisment mentions and , in the long run , he accepts it as long it has most of the things it said it had .
There is a room for disappointment that it is , of course , not accepted equally .
I still can remember the frustation that I used to have as a child when I received my Christmas presents that were not as exciting as they seemed in the television ads .

Last but not least , it must be remembered that , while this dissapointment is somehow accepted it ca n't evolve into fraud or bad intention of the company by advertising something that has nothing to do with the real product .
It is in this case where public authorities must look for the protection of the rights of consumers in order to avoid fraud .
