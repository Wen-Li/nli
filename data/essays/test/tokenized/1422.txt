One could think that in the future the using of cars will be increased , because people today become more and more lazy , so they buy cars and they drive whenever they are able to take the car .
And there defenitly are people with that opinion , but the prizes will increase also , so not everybody will able to drive by car the whole day .
So my opinion is that I agree with the statement that there will be fewer cars in use .
In addition I think there will be laws about driving everytime because the gas which is coming out of cars is disturbing the nature .
Politicians nowadays are discussing that problem and they are talking about a law that forbids the using of cars on sundays .

Furthermore the standart at trains and busses is getting more and more secure , comfortable , faster and flexible so there will be many people who decide to take the bus or train instead of an expensive car .
Although it is not really cheap it is cheaper than buying more and more oil for the car .
Another solution for that problem is that many people will build up driving-communities to divide their costs with other people .

I also think that the number of people who experience the results of the gases of the cars will grow .
There will be more and more people who will die in fact of getting cancer or else .
So there will be more and more people , who decide to `` forget '' their car , too .

I am a perfect example !
I started to learn for my driving lisence but now I do not want to get it anylonger because it is too expensive so I continue driving by bus or by train , not only in fact of the costs , but also because it is often faster because I can not get into a trafic jam .

To summerize my thoughts I finally say that I agree with the fact that in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today .
