Time is a limited resource and young people do n't succeed in scheduling their activities in order to have time enough to help the community where they live .
I remember that Don Milani , a famous italian priest of the 20th century used to say I care , instead Fascists shouted I do n't care .
I hope this example emphasizes how helping other people modifies our personalities .

Firstly this lack of love towards mankind begins since a child goes to school .
In fact parents occupy his life with school and many other activities , most of all sport activities , in order to keep him busy while their work .
Thus a young guy learns that is better to play football than have spare time to spend taking care of other people .

Afterwards he has grown up , he is involved in numerous activities , but even universitiy itself eats up all the day-time .
Nowadays doing a degree is really demanding , students loose their time because they have to attend class lessons and they have to study at home .

Furthermore society increases this attitude towards selfishness and television is transmitting everytime images of rich , proud , selfish people who are hailed self-made man , stating that people have to work hard to accomplish their goals .
This images have a bad impact on our society because everybody is striken by this and reacts by placing himself at the center of his life .

It seems to me that there is a sort of Big Brother who is trying to introduce a new Hedonism , a behaviour that seeks only for beauty and pleasures .
Maybe he is managing to do it because , if we consider everybody , both young and adult , we could realize that they prefer remainig at home to smiling to a poor guy , looking for someone who simply listens to him .
