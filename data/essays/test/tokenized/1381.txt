I do n't agree with statement .
Success does n't depends on trying new stuff .
It depends on how much effort that person put in .
Even if some people take risk all the time and try new thing , if they stop right there with just experience , and not study about it , that 's not going to help with their successful life .
It 's just wasting of time .
As I mentioned before , it depends on their effort .
Sometimes , people learn from taking risk , but not often .

Plus , people can be successful through discovering new things without taking risk .
People learns from past , including how to do well .
They learned from past first , before they take risk .
Let 's say I was reading art history books and find out how to improve my art project .
Then , that 's learning from past , not learning from take risk .

Learning from taking risk , could look cool or creative .
But is does n't always works that way .
If someone does n't have any common sense , and trying to find out new things , that person can end up die , not just taking risk .

Of course , it 's not healthy to do `` only '' what they already know how to do well .
But important thing is , they have to know things in the book that people from past found out for us before they take risk .

People call person , who takes risk and find out new way of something , `` inventor '' Inventor is only one form of success .
To be successful people , we do n't always have to take risk , but concentrate what they are doing , and trying to find the way from experience , not risk .
( Of course , I 'm saying taking risk and experiencing is totally different . )
Everyone has their own talent .
They should trying to find their talent before they take risk by trying new things .

We have to improve from things that already say how to do well .
Not starting over .
Taking risk could be starting over .
I disagree with the statement. ; `` Sucessful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well . ''
