I am agree with the statement cause i think that all the new tecnology and new discovers around the world are being made for people who try new things and take risks .

As a good example some of the cures to a dissease as malaria were inveted for a great colombian investigator whose name is Mauel Elkin Patarroyo this doctor with limits resources and a lot of criticals ahd the ability of discover a vacun against the malaria , this dessease appears most comon in african people cause they style of life .
Thanks to this discover people in africa could be able to have a solution to that terrible dessease .

After this Manuel Elkin Patarroyo becomes a great scientis and move on in new researh for dessease .

Other intrepid person was Cristobal Colon who was the discover of America , he tougth that it was arrived to Africa but as resolt of try to find another way to get there he dicovered a new continet .
Many people tougth he was crazy but at the end he got a lot of excellents rewords as gold and a new culture .

People who do not want to take risks are persons that thik that everything is done and that it is nothing new to invent o discover , This people are going to be unsuccessful cause they do not work for the progress of their counties or ther own lifes .
They expect that people who try new thing doing their job , then they can enjoy the new discover without an effort .

Some people tought taht if they try to do new things they are going to fall down , but if you do not take a risks you are not be sure if you work is good .
It coulbe as good as you can win a nobel price for it .

So take risks and discover a wreat world full of fantasy .
