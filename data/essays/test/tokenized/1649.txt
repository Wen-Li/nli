It would be tough to differantiate the products without the advertisements sticked on them .
This does not neccessarily mean that the advertisement make the product seem better , but it definetely attaches something that is not in and of the product .
That is to say , advertisement differentiates a product from the others serving a similar purpose with something which is actually not a part of the product .

The thing that is not in the product itself , the one that is attached to the product by an advertisement is everything about the product but it 's value of use .
In other words , a watch is to keep track of the time , but a `` Rolex '' symbolizes a status besides serving as a regular watch .
It is understood to be something more than a watch because the value assigned to it by advertisements .

Advertisement does not always serve for the much `` better '' image of the product .
The things that are attached to the products help them to artificially obtain different values than the one they hold .
Those added values are not neccessary for the `` best '' of the product .
The racist advertisements of soap during the Industrial Revolution era in United Kingdom did not change the view of the quality of the soaps , it served for the re-production of the emperial way of living and strengthened the belief on `` the burden of the white man '' to change the uncivilized .

Once a product can wear imaginary values and beliefs , it may well be used for other purposes .
Like the one mentioned above or basically the everyday-sexist advertisements visible all around the world .
The advertisements of `` For Him Magazine '' or `` Diesel Jeans '' are not there for the making their product better , they serve for the reproduction of patriarchal power relations .

Therefore , it is obvious that the advertisements make products somethingelse than what they really are .
But the new thing they become with these ads does not neccessarily mean they are better , it only means they are not what they were .
