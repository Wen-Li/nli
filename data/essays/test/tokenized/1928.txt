I strongly agree with this statement .
I have been thinking about that during studying any subjects .
Ideas and concepts are what I consider most when I face on something first time .
So I absolutely know how important they are .

To demonstrate , I should be a good exampl .
Becuase I have a lot of experiece about that .
I have been always confused in any ideas and concepts for a long time .
Actually , I was not very good at studying or understanding something when I was little .
I thought I was stupid .
I did not know how to learn and understand .
No one taught me how to do .
Even my parents did not .
I has been always taught just facts , not ideas or concepts .
For instance , I did know about '' + '' and '' - '' .
Oneday , I got 20 points at my math test when I was in the first grade .
I did not know what they are .
I was so confused between those two .
I did all of them wrongly .
I did not know the concept or principle of that .

In my opinion , facts are just facts .
They do not show any ideas or concepts .
They do not include any values .
Studying about facts is just knowing rather than knowlege .
In order to get more completed knowlege , students must understand ideas and concepts better .
That way can reduce the likelihood to misunderstand or to be confused .

To sum up , understanding facts can be sometimes important .
Understanding ideas and concepts , however , must be a lot more significant than that .
Especially for students , that is very important .
