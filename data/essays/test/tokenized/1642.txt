Averstising is nowaday part of our reallity : jingles , leaflets , eye catching posters , ...
All of them aims to make the consumers ( known as the target in the marketing vocabulary ) buy a product or a service , no matter they need it .
It noticable that advertisment do not show us what we buy , but more , going further than the utility of the product advertised .

Classic economy teachs that the offer has to meet the demand but more and more , this offer generates it 's own demand , creating new needs that cunsomers would not have had if they have not been brainwashed by all the advertisments they are subjected to .

The best example is the talent advertisers have to create and lay off trends : produces have to be held by people to make them fashion , but are quickly throw away for others : advertisements try to give a kind of obsolesence : forget the old , buy the new ( this adjectiv is maybe the more noticable in advertisments ) .

The second example is the way advertisers use to extand their product 's utility : what they sold is not a product , it is a way of life , a way to show who you are : belongings are to embody your personnality : you have got the last Ipod ?
You are obviously a cool and trendy person , looking for the best .

A cell phone is not a simple way to phone according to advertisments : it is the way to spread yourself to the world with an unlimited ( and most of time expansive ) access to all the digital contents you want : you are the new Samsung holder ?
Not only : you are now belonging the world , doing what you want simply with your mobile phone ( so wonderful is n't it ? ) .

Third illustration of this phenomenon : advertisers use more and more celebrities to promot their produces : beyond the produce you have , you try to reach the person shown in the advertisment ( for example , in Japan , Camerons Dias is the official face of DoCoMo NTT , the first Japanese mobile operator ) .

Advertisments less and less aim to show a product , they show consumers what they want to see .
