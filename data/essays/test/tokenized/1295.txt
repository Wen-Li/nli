`` The best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide '' yes i agree with the fallowing statement people like travel in many ways according to their taste some travel individually while others like to travel with other people this may be with knpwn once or unknown .

Takeing a tour in a group led by a tour guide gives us many wonderful experience we have a chance of meeting many new people and we have the chance to know the places better if we go with a tour guide because guide is a person who has knowledge of the place where we travel full of his knowledge if we travel in group which consists of different people of different location all togather is a wonderful experince if we tarvel alone or in apair if you are well informed about the place you can travel alone but many dont know and if we travel in group we have security and that too if today there are many travel agencies are available for us they are comming with different pakages which are effortable if we travell in group the expence will be reduced comparing to travelling alone i will an example of my world tour in last december i have joined the tour with the pakage offered by the country vacations in delhi the overall cost was just 70000 in indian rupees the pakage includes the tour to eight countries the group consists of 30 people from different regions it was wonderful moment for me to travell world with the people even i dont know thay were so friendly and the tour guide has shown us many places including many historic places like leaning tower of pisa in italy , statue of liberty and empire state building in united states if i travell alone i could have missed all the fun ans faced a lot of trouble .

I would like suggest people like this way which mekes us to meet new people and see different location with an effortable price and with social security and i am sure it will be a unforgetable moment of every one .
