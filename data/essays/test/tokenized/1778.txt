Is more advertisements make products seem much better than they really are ?
As companies spend astronomical amounts in advertisements , I would say definitely yes !
The main goal for a company to advertise a product is for sure to sell more of it , but first , it has to convince the customers of buying it .
They have to make them believe that they need the product , and once that goal is reached , they have to convince them that the product is better than the other comparables .
As I mentioned before , the idea is to increase sells , but a company wants to make profits , and this is done also by reducing costs .
Unless we are in a monopolistic environment , the competition can be very strong , as well as the incentive to make profit .
Due to a reduction in costs , the level of quality may seem alot better in the advertisement than it may be in reality .

The best example for me would be a cosmetic advertisement for a face or body cream .
The apparance of the young models seems so perfect , but in reality , does that cream make them look so young ?
The models do not represent the specific group of users of the product .
They are much younger and the photos are also corrected .
The intention is to convince the user that the cream is efficient as it looks like in the advertisement , but in reality , it is not .

An other example is advertisement for a natural supplement .
As it looks like , those products help you live longer , healthier , and it does n't make sense .
In my opinion , what makes you live that way is a healthy way of living , as eating healthy foods , practicing sports , enjoying life in general .

As I mentionned before , the main goal of companies is to sell more of a product , and unfortunately , this is reached sometimes by lying to the customer .
