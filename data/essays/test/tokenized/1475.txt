Sucessful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well , this is true and i support it as i do have somany examples before me in my life .

Me my self from an electric and with a good accadamics .
so , i am going to learn the software languages rather than improving my core subject .

Sucessful people has the eager to know each and every thing .
so they try to do or try to lear new subject and theories .

My friend too is a very sucessful person and he now doing in a software company but with a electrical background .
this is how we can say that the sucessful people try new things risks rather than only doing what tey already know how to do well .

If a person is sucessful then his mind just alters him from the present stream of work .
as he is sucessfull he too in a intrest to jump or take another project or field .

a man doing business in a field like eatable items and he is very sucess in that then after some years or months he just keep his investments in other business .
this is because that he is a sucessful person in his field and want to try his sucess in another field .
no man jumps or try to change his present stream of work unless he is sucess .
if he is a sucessfull person he he dares and try to do another business even .

These people even dares or take risk rather than only doing what they already know how to do well .
This is because of that the person is sucessful he dares to to the other work even with dare .

when we consider the example of Mr.PULLAREDDY who is the famous business men in Andhra Pradesh .
He is famous for his sweets and became very popular in india and all over the world this is due to his sucess .
And people like this can dare and run new industries and make them sucess under the risk even
