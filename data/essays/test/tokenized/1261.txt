When facing to this issued mention above , some hold the opinion that travelling in a group led by a tour guide is the best .
other people , however , have a negative attitude .
If I were forced to agree with one of the options .
My choice would be latter .

Why does a tour guide require during travelling ?
First , the function of a tour guide is that he/she will plan the travelling schedule for you .
In other words , you do n't have to waste time to do that .
Second , in my hometown , a travel agency provides a relatively cheap price package with a tour guide .

Although I agree that the advantages of a tour guide , I still insist that the disadvantages are far outweigh them .
For example , you may force to arrange a sightseeing where you do not have interesting .
Moreover , you can not spend more time to travel the place where you like .
Second , if you do not get along with the people in the travelling group or the tour guide , you have no choice to keep travelling .
In addition , you still have to pay tips for his bad service .
It is loss of meaning of travelling .
Thrid , you will always suffer from an unfriendly schedule .
For instance , you have to wake up early in order to comply the schedule proposed by a tour guide .
Furthermore , it is fun to arrange a travelling plan with your friends or family .
you can tailor made the travelling schedule yourself .
You can gain more memory experience during travelling .

Taking into account all these factors , it is believed that the disadvantages of a tour guide are obvious than its advantages .
It is sagacious that it is better to travel without a tour guide .
