I have always studied in schools which asked students to understand ideas instead of learning facts with no reflexion .
I am well-aware of the advantages in understandind ideas .
I can also imagine the advantages in learning facts .

There are strong advantages in learning facts .
The first point I would like to make is that it is an excellent way to get a large general culture .
Understanding ideas takes time whereas learning facts can be quite quick .
Thus people can learn more things .
Another argument is that in life , people do not need to prove exact information because it has been already proved and all they have to do is using information for a particular purpose .
For instance , in my schools , general culture and history tests were usually multiple-choice tests because knowning the facts was the most important point .

If there are strong advantages in learning facts , there are some even more compelling advantages in understanding ideas .
First , even if it can be long , people get a better memory of these facts because they have understood the concept and in the case they have forgotten the fact , they can be able to find it out .
Secondly , people can more adequately use these facts because they know how the whole theory works .
For example , I once had to cope with an intricate maths problem and I knew all the proofs and concepts for each formula .
Therefore it was very clear for me how to use them and I finally reached the solution .

To conclude , I think that it is far more important to understand ideas that to learn fact .
Learning facts gives a larger general culture but people will maybe not able to use it adequately .
Understanding ideas gives important assets to cope with problems , which is very important in active life .
