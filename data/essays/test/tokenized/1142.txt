Human being is very ambitous and creative creautures .
They always want to learn more and find new things .
if we examine the prominent people of world we can understand this more better .
for example let 's look at the life of Christoph Colomb .
he was a very ambitous person and he wanted explore the untouched parts of world .
for that he applied rich persons and kings to encourage them to support his voyage on the sea .
After support from one of them he started his great voyage .
Having poor navigation technology he dared to lethal side of oceans and storms .
but finally he realized his dreams and he founded new lands for human beings .
as we learn from his life to be a successfull person we must brave and ambotious .
but this musnt be bravity or risk of a stupid person .
first of all everyone must know what he wants and what he or she has for that in his or her hand .
so we must have a target and calculate how much risk for it and how easy ways to achieve this target .
on the way to the success we can have so much risk and obstacles but first we must be brave and creative .
If we think classically we can just survive our life as a normal people .
but if we merge our knowledge with creativity and behave brave we can be a successfull person and we can realize our dreams like Colomb .
when we choose our targets those must be reasonable targets not fantastic and unachiavable .
for that we must know our ability and capacity and then we must complete our lackings .
if we think conventinally we cant change nothing in our life .
but if we will be in search of new things and untried methods we can change whole of our life .
for scientists this is very important .
their success is related with their creativity and finding new things .
if they just do what they learned before they can be a good teacher but if they add something new what they learned before they can be historical person like EINSTEIN .
