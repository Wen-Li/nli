Nowadays , there are so many people who are well-educated and intelligent that it is difficult to compete with those people and to be suceeded .
It is quite true that a lot of successful people are well-known to the subject that they are using to earn money .
A surgeon is good at doing surgeories , a carpentor is expert at making funiture .
However , successful people are open to try new things and take risks rather than to do only things they know how to do because they are ready to do new things , and they know that new things can bring a lot of success .

Successful people are different from ordinary people because they are always ready to try new things that they had never done .
It does not mean that they have no fear .
But , even though they fear about what might happen , they have courage to attempt rather that to be afraid of it .
For instance , when Bill Gates was young , computers are totally new to people at that time .
However , Bill Gates did not fear of them but tried to develop them more and make them familiar to all other people .
His new idea of developing computers , brought him lots of success and that is how he became the world 's richest man .

Successful people are also ambitious .
They know new things will bring them lots of success .
The word `` successful '' can mean be used in variety .
A successful student can be good at studying .
A successful business man can make a lot of money .
But whoever the successful person is , the person will do new things in order to get more successful .
If it 's a student , he might do a research project on a hard and new topic that he has never exprienced on .
The project might go well and he might be chosen for a scholarship .
If it 's a worker , and let 's say he is a chair maker , he might get suceeded if he tried making tables .
Nobody knows , what the result might be unless a person tries and that 's how a person becomes successful .

If a person wants to be successful at someting , the only way is to try .
If it worked , it 's good , if it did n't , he can try other new things .
A life is full of new things and to try them out is the best way .
