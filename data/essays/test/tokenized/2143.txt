I think that the progress made by techonological developement and the need for more powerful means of transport will lead our society to use less and less cars to go from one place to another .

Governments of lot of countries tries to prompt the public transport ; for example in Italy there are a lot of advantages if you take ticket for buses and underground that last for month or at least two weeks the company that manages the transport make you pay less than the ticket bought every day .

But not only he convenience make you use the public transport : the fact that in large cities ( and in the future there will be more and more larger cities ) you can move from one side of the city to other staying only minutes on the underground ; you can imagine how many people will be around in the future ( we are 6 billions today ) and you can imagine what if everyone would take the car to go somewhere : everyone would be stuck in traffic all the ay long !
So it is reasonable that more and more people will use public transport to move rapidly .

Another important problem connected with the use of cars by everyone is that the pollution would became a menace for our health , what if billions of car would be around in a world that even today suffers from enviromental problems ; even today we experiece the consequences of air pollutions : increasing of diseases and lumb cancers .
Some intitution try to overcome this problems by stopping the traffic for one or two days but this is a remedy that is not sufficient .
The problem must be solved from the inside with drastic remedies .

The third reason is the thechnological development which in the last years has made giant footsteps : engineers will develop a fast , economic and respetful of the environment mean of transport to meet the needs of the growing society and replace the use of car .

So to summarize I think that future will be characterized by highy efficient means od transport like high velocity trains or something like that to move rapidly from one place to another respecting the enviroment .
