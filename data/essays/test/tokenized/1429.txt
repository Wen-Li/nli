I agree the statement which it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts .
The education polsy which I had passed in post graduated school of the university was to teach how to think about problems .
While I was post guraduated student , I could n't get new knowledges because professors teach the solution for ploblems I want .
Instead of answers , professors suggested the way to find hints to me .
Then , proffssors asked some questions for me to identify important things or not .
I have thought why they had not gave students for answers and facts .
After I graduated , I found the reasons .
In societied ; there are verious problems that I do n't resort easily .
If I can have abilities how to find facts .
I could be find th solution .
Thus , it is more important for student to understand ideas and concepts than get facts and answers .
Students must find solutions by themselves in order to adopt to the future 's troubles .
