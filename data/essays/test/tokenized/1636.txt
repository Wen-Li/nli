When you go to the University , you choose a way .
Sometimes more specific than another .
Some peole will say you it 's to specific , others not enought .
But which one is the good ?
Is it better to choose a specific subject ?
Or is it good to have many academic subject with less knowledge ?

It depends of what you want to do after .
If you specialize you in one specific subject , you can become an expert in this domain , and made research , which is very interesting i think .
You are at the point of the technology and you help your planet to progress .
I think it 's very well to know everythings on one subject .
But for this , you need to do some long studies .
The problem of being specialize in one subject is you have some difficulties to explain what you want to do easily .
Companies need people with very specific knowledge to develop the software , tools . ..
of us futur .

Furthermore , they need also people without specific knowledge , but with many differents academic subjet to manage people , give advice about the way to follow to create something .
In general , this people could n't realize themself the application .
They give instructions and manage that everythings is good during the project .
They made the link between the customer and the engineer .
They can explain easily , without technical words , to the customer what they do , give him some advices .
Then , they explain to their team what the customer wants , how to do it .

People with many academic subject and specialize people are both important .
We need them .
If we had n't the first one , customers and experts could never understand each other .
And if we had n't experts , projects could n't be realize .
Or they needs more times , and times are money for customers , so it 's impossible .
