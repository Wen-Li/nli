Some people think that to understand ideas is better than to learn facts for the student , However , I do n't agree with their 's opinion .
Ideas based on personal experiences , its come from our brains rather than the reality .
On the contrary , facts are what really happened , and it is more real than ideas .
Therefore , It is always true that learn facts helps people make futher development .

As a human , we curious about why things happenes and how its work .
Like the sun rises everyday and then disappears in the night , Therefore , people make guesses about what is happened .
For example , the myth .
Ancient people in Greece makes up stories about the nature phenomenons .
The stories are all about gods and goddess who lives in the heaven .
They thinks that gods and goddes build the world .
Actully , the fact is that it can only be explained by a scentific theoty .
However , what the ancient prople think are ideas .
So , we can see that ideas are not always right , just like the story or hypothesis .
If students understand and believe what the story says , it may become a roadblock for their life .

Another reason why is not improtant for students to understand ideas than it is for them to learn facts is that people are more likely to experience and to find the truth , Facts are all truth that we can trust and use in many areas .

If we just simply learn the fact , it is not enough for our development .
So , we have to use our knowledge to anaylsis things , in short , understand it .
If we only know what the fact is , how will we use it ?
The fact is that , ideas are different opinions .
Through both the views of others and the reality of an events , we can better understand the things aroud us .

All in all , learn things not only by understand ideas , but also by learn facts will certainly help students , not just students , develope their own skills and make a different in the whole world ,
