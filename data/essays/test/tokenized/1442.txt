From my point of view it is more importent to understand idears and concepts , becouse what can we do , if we do not understand things .

First , understanding is very importent , because without understanding you can not put a fact in anouther problematic situation .
Like in the biologie , there you must lern the mendelschen rools .
If you do not unterstand the rools you can not finde a answer of question in witch the teacher want to combine rool and situations .
If you only learn the rools , you do not know how to cominations the situations .
You only know that you need for example rool 4 , but why do you not know and that is not good .

Second , it is importend to combine situations .
With the learning of facts you can not write and essay , because you must combine it .
You must write a logical structure .
So that the reader understand what you are want to say .
Fact after fact is not interesting to read .
you must modorate the fact and if you do not unterstand it is very difficult to do that .
You need a reason to write about .

Third , in your life you will have new situations and if you can understand what is to do , you will finde your way .
People who only lerrn fact less the ability to handel situations .
Like the light who show that you can walk across the steet .
You lern if it is green you can walk , but what is to do , if the light is defect and you can not see a light .
That are a simple example , but it show what mean with new situations and the understanding what to do .

So I agree with the statement that it is more importent for students to unterstand idears and concepts that it is for them to learn facts .
