It is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject .

This helps you to know more about life and gives you more ideas and makes you think and explain things in much more and better way .
I agree to have many acadmic subjects this will help me to think and to look at things in much better way .

If specialize in one specifix subject u will just be good at one and you wont have any general idea about other academix subjects , that means you dont have good idea about things .
As far as you got many knowledge this helps u dealing with everything .

You help your self to give good thoughts about your future and how to think about it .
Like if ur not good in busniess knowledges and you didnt go for many academic subjects you will have only one subject that you can use in your life .

But if you went for many academic subjects help your self creating ideas about what you doing you can chage from busniess to something else other than sticking to busniess you give your self a oportiuntiy to face problems like this so i prefer that people should go for many academic subjects other than sticking to one subject because this may be trouble some for you .

People should know that going for many academic subjects is useful that would help that with their life alot if they faced anything with the subject that they are specific at help you dodge problems that you may face in future .

Thats why i say to everyone to broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject .
