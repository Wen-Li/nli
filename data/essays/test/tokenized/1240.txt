The idea stated can be very well concised to what is called as ` knowledge with width and knowledge with selective depth ' .

This question is very much fresh and dealt very effectively in many parts of society and academics .
From my personal point of view , I strongly support the idea of having a specialised knowledge in a particular subject .
That makes me a supported of the famous saying , ` A rolling stone gathers no moss ' .
The specific knowledge a person gains makes him stand apart from other individuals .
Let us elaborate this with the help of an example .
Let us consider the ` Nuclear Progress ' made by the various countries .
It was only possible because a person gained a knowledge in that very field of study which proved effective to contribute to the development of the most reliable and undoubted world destructors .

A common world example would make the said idea even more substantial .
When suffering from a minor fever or cold , a person can be satisfied by paying a visit to the town 's general physician , which definitely will not be the case when one suffers heart ailments and similar major complicancies .
At such point of time it is only the experts in the respective field can help a person recover it .

On the ither hand , the same principle is applied is also applied in the arena of academics .
Almost all the universities all world over offer specialisation in various fileds .
Why do they do it if it is not required ?
Why do they do it if they can not justify it ?
The answer lies in a ` No ' of the mentioned questions .
The various fileds of specialisation are required as well as justified .

Without specialization , the world will soon grow to become stagnant .
The progress would stop and the people will have no better tomorrows than the yesterdays they have lived by .
No ailments will be cured and people will continue falling prey to diseases that could have been cured if research and specialisation were given real worth .

Thanks to development in various areas , that we can now look forward to the unexpected .
Even today , we are able to carry the entire computer system in a palm or believe that we will be cured of almost all the ailments we will ever suffer !

Ask a questions to oneself , without studies advancing and you advancing with it , would n't you be still rubbing stones to light a fire ?
Believe me , you would be !
