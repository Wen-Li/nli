I agree .

Agressiveness on marketing have developed different technics or methods used by publicists that may confuse the consumers and lead them to a wrong purchasing decision .

Although they might be legal , not all consumers sectors are the same and big parts of them can misunderstood the messages of the advertisements .

A way how can consumers get confused by advertisements is by providing them uncomplete information , which I believe is the most common type of misleading buyers decisions .
A clear example are the credit cards , which at the time they are promoted do not explain all their disadvantages or restrictions .

Another type of advertisement that I am sure confuses most of people is the one that takes a simple information as a fact or makes a wrong statement , like saying the `` the best '' , `` the biggest '' , `` the cheapest '' , etc. or simply highlights an information , like an award got on a specific circumstance or by a specific group to label the product at thr sellers ' best convenience .
An example for me are the cars or automobiles .

On the other hand , communications are now specialized in modern methods , like photos , videos , sounds , that `` complement '' the real facts on which a purchase should be based on , but that I really consider as a distorsion or an intentional diversion of reality in order to create `` other attributes '' to the product that wants to be sold , like fashion .

I believe every people has to make some research before buying something .
This research should be as long and deep as the product values or is going to cost us , or really how important is for us .

I would promote the consumers organizations and regularly publish buyers opinions , specially of those who have tried the products already .

I would also promote a constant review of the laws on advertisements and general marketing methods , enforcing sellers to provide complete information on their products to the end consumers .
