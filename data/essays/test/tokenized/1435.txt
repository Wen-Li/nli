Telling if people are more likely to be successful trying to do new things or doing what they already know how to do well is an hard task .
In fact , a lot of situations and circumstances should be taken into account , then I think that each person must try to find out its own way for the success .
For some people , which can be called `` inventors '' , the success can be found only through the creation of something new , something that change the existing situation and the established way of doing something .
These people are moved by a wonderful mind and are able to get a lifelong or even longer success , like Edison and Leonardo , and their inventions sometimes are so great that are able to change entire aspects of the world .

Together with this kind of success , I think that there is another success that could be achieved also through the ability to be the best performer in doing something that already exist .
In fact , the people that are able to achieve this success do not invent anything new , but just do it better than their competitors .
On this topic a lot of examples can be given for this kind of best performers , bust one among all the others can represent them : E. Ford .
In fact , Ford achieved an incredible success thanks to its ability to project and produce a very cheap car that has been sold all over the world , but he did n't invent anything new , just did it better .

In accordance to what is written above , it can be inferred that , in my opinion , two kind of successes exist and each person should understand which one of them is the easiest to be achieved in accordance with the personal behaviours .
Furthermore , I strongly believe that everyone can achieve some success in his life , but this imply he would be able to understand on which he should focus his efforts , ability that is not so common .
