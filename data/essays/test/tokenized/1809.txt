Today few people spend their free time to helping their communities , and there are some reason that explain this situation .

First of all , modern life style is the most important reason .
Today each person must to do many things in their life , and there is many enjoy activities that people can make in their free time ( cinema , discos , pubs , sports ) .
If people spend a lot of time in this activities they have n't time to spend in communities or in other few enjoy activity .

Another reason is that some people do n't like helping their communities because they think that is not enjoyed , and that is not interesting for them .
They always think that it is difficult but , it is incredible , they never ask what or how they must to do !

In my opinion spend a time to helping communities is importan .
People can be necessary in a differente manner and I am happy if I can help someone or I can make anythings that can be useful for the communities .
