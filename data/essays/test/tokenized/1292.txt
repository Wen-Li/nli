A person like me who has immigrated to the foreign contry after living his or her most of lives possess their characteristics based on their culture .
It is the matter of nurture that forms invidivual 's cognitive thinking and understanding .
As we grow to live in the society , our knowledge and thinking are very crucial for lifetime .
Through the experiences I had in school , I have learned the importance of understanding the concept and ideas in order to be successful .

One of the big differences I have came to realize between United States and Korea is the education system .
Like in math class , for example , U.S education system make the students think logically not to memorize formulas like Kkorea .
In preparation for the exams , I have memorized the notes that the teacher has lectured on to receive a good grade .
The memorization of materials seemed to work for me and I continued on just memorizing .
Even memorizing the English words I just learned seem to work for the several months of living in the U.S .
I would write the word and definitions repeatly for numerous times like many others do .

The problem came when I entered the high school .
As I try to take more rigorous classes , there were just too many important facts to memorize .
I have spent most of my time reading and trying to memorize when I got home .
Unfortunately , my grades on the tests and quizes were dropping and continued failure in classes made me want to quit and drop out of AP classes .
However , with continued courage from my parents and peers I have overcame my hardships , tried to bring out my full potential .
I have started observing other classmates ' studying habits because it seemed to me that they do not study much as I do but still get a better grade than me .
It was frustrating but after observing and asking peers what they do to prepare for the tests , I have learned a lifetime lesson .
The understanding ideas and concepts have enourmous impact in acquiring knowledge .
