Why should people stop using their car ?
People are now used to using their care all the time .
They use it to go to their work , go shopping , spend a day in the countryside and so on .
The car is now an habit in our technological societies .
But what about the problems that cars can induce ?
According to me the use of cars is more likely to increase than to be reduced .
Nevertheless I would like to underline some problems that cars brings out .

It is unlikely to see the number of cars be reduced in the next twenty years .
First , western people have the habit to use it and it is also a very convenient way of transportation .
You are alone in your car .
You dont have to wait for the train or the bus .
You are asbolutely independent .
For example , I often go and visit my husband 's family in Italy .
If we want to stop to visit a city during the journey , we can do it while it is impossible when going by train , for example .

Second , according to me the number of cars will increase because cars will be also available in the developing country .
It is a huge market to break into for the car industry .
There are many people in the world that would like to benefit from such a technology .

However , there are plenty of problems with cars and the maim problem is connected with the environment .
Vehicles are not environmemt-friendly .
First the green house effect is increasing , created an important climate change all around the world .
The climate on planet Earth is becoming hotter and hotter .
Cars also bring pollution and noise pollution as well .
Even more concerning is the time people waste in traffic jams in the city .
It has been proved that it causes more stress for people .

Both governments and individuals may change the present situation .
More laws are necessary to control pollution .
Besides , people should be more sensible when using their car .

In twenty years there will not be fewer cars in use than there are now .
On the contrary the number of carrs will increase as well as the problems to solve .
