I think that this statement is a good interpretation of the reality .
A good advertisement has the great responsability to give the best image of the product that it is promoting .
Throught it , the consumer must be sure that the product that he is buying is what he needs .

Most of the advertisements are created with this kind of goal and to fulfill it , they also don ' t tell the truth about the really nature of the product .

When you see the Mc Donald ' s advertisement on the TV , they show you very delicious food !!
Everything seems to be very special and you want to taste it !
But when you go to the fast food you realize that everything is different and the food is not like in the advertisement .
The product that you saw on the TV was unreal !
The big cheesburger is not so good and the flash it ' s not so soft !

I 'm not agree with this kind of policies .
I think that when you buy something , you have to be aware of what you are spending money for .
I know that it 's impossible to pretend the truth cause business is business !
but at least , not to emphasize something that it 's not the best !
