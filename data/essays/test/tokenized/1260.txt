The easier way to be success is to use tested ways and tactics which the successful people give .
On the other hands , this is the easier way to be usual .
I prefer to create my own style to be successful .
The first reason to choice is personal improving .
The second is that wanting to get new things .
The last one is about being uni First of all , all the things we do for improving ourselves and getting new expereince day by day .
If I want to learn how the successful people had their success , I could figure them out in these people life stories .
And then I can use their strategies when creating my own style which is occured as a mix of them .

Secondly , If I walk the street which was walked by another , I will get same route and arrive same place .
But I want to discover new places and get new success about what I am interested in .

The last reason to prefer to try new things and take risks is about being unique and unusual .
Until keeping the key points of being successful , people use usual ways .
By the way , he failed because of these false tactis but do n't feel sorry about it .
He knows it is the experinces and pattern of the success .
After the all failed , he should ask what the problem about the problem and how he will solve this problem .
In end , all this falses and other successful people experince come together and the unique style will apper .

In conclusion , I prefer to get risk rather than doing something which already known .
It is about my personal improving in using others ' experiences and creating my own style .
After the years , only uniqies will be remembered .
