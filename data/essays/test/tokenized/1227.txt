I partially agree with the statement , but not completely .
Although different people might have different perspectives for it .
Some people prefer to travel in group led by a tour guide , whereas some prefer to travel alone or in group without being led by a tour guide to explore things on their own .

A tour could have different purposes .
It could be an educational tour or a tour in vacation with an intention to explore and feel the beauty of nature .
There are many literatures and book-guides available for well known places round the world .
A book written by explorers could help you understand the place of visit thoroughly than a tour guide could explain it to you .

It is worth spending after a book , though expensive but once , rather than spending out money for the tour guide .
A tour guide is a human being and we human beings are demanding bunch .
A group might have to spend a fair amount after a tour guide , whereas a book has to be bought only once and it could guide you throughout its lifecycle .

Interaction with a tour guide could be uncomfortable for few members in the group as the tour guide is an unkown person from the unfamiliar place .
Moreover , visiting a foreign place , to enjoy the company of a good tour guide , we might have to overcome the difficulties of cultural or linguistic differences .
Also , we could not judge what kind of person he is .
So it is always better to travel without a tour guide and try to explore new things and places on your own than to prefer to take risks .

Apart from the ambiguities that could be encountered in decision to take a tour guide , it could be beneficial to have a tour guide at few places of visits like forests , where there is an intrinsic chances of an attack by the wild predators .
A tour guide can warn you before entering a particular zone .
He can help you to understand what things are to be taken care of or considered before entering such areas .
But a tour to a familiar place like the United States of America does not require a tour guide .
There are many book materials available to understand and explore the natural beauty and cultural heritage of the United States .

So , I concur , without any ambiguities that , to travel in a group by being or not led by a tour guide depends on the type of place you are visiting .
