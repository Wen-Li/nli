Many people might think that traveling alone with out a guide will give them more time to examine the foreign country individually and thoroughly .
However , I do not suggest to do so because after it is hard to communicate easily one might get lost and also the guiders no much more about the famous places in that country .

Before traveling we usually buy a trip book of the particular country for conversation that might sometimes be necessary .
Sometimes like when we are lost .
Truely , when I visited France I once was out of the city where I did n't even know the name of and was terrefied of my curcumstances .
Well , eventually , by asking and asking several foreigners by teling them to show me how , and where should I find this place by body language , I was back to where I belong .
This really was a hard time for me .
I always imagine wheather if I had a tourist at that time in the first place I would n't have gotten lost and would n't have to be panic at that time , so on , I could have had a good time during the trip , then having a bad memory .

Furthermore , if traveling with guiders you can visit places that are famous and spend your time without anxious where to go next , because the guider will lead you to the next destination .
Also , as we visit ancient tombs or kingdoms , guider would explain about these monuments which gives you more comprehension to the country .
On the contrast , if you dont have a guide , you sill have to ask every person to go to a particualr place and will lose the opportunity to have a closer look at how the countries customes are about .

In brief , to travel conveniently such as not having any complex situations or having trouble to find any good place to visit following a travel agent is benefitial in time and effort and at the end one will have a pleasing memory of the trip .
