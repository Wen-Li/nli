There are many ways to travel .
One of these ways is called `` group tour '' .
I aleady knew this is one of the best way to travel .
I really love to travel in a group led by a tour guide .
There are three reasons in doing so .
The most important thing is that grouping tour allows me to save time .
For example , last year I went to Europe with my 13 co-worker .
Of course , our group has g guide .
We have a very tight schedule , and we are all stranger there .
If we have a guide , we do n't choose what to see .
Secondly , If we have a travel in a group , we would meet many people who have different experience .
We have chance to having a friends .
That the really important point to every person in the world I think .
We always share my thinking and opnion with my friends .
Having many friends will makes me happy .
Finally , traveling in a group allows me to save the money .
This is the obious thing in economics .
According to the economic book , When we buy something as a group , we alway have a bargaining power .
For instance , If I buy a airline ticket for traveling , I would buy much expensive than buying airline tickets by a group ( at least more than 10 person ) .
To summarize , I like traveling in a group led by a tour guide .
Because , it is saving time and money and allowing us to meet many people .
