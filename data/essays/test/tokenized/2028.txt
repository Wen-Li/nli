I do agree only partly with the statement that in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today .

Firstly I think that of course through consistent technolgy development , new ideas and ways of transportation will arise .
But I do not necessarily think that there will be therfore a significant decrease in car manufacture or car use in general .
As new technology is always more expensive than old technology .
Therefore I rather think that there will be an increase in cars , as more and more people will have the possibility to buy a car .
Because the prices of cars will decrease , when new better ways of transportation come to the market .
Then by looking at the financial situation of many German households , we realize that an average German family posses one car , but would need more than one car .
As when the father of the family is away with the car , the woman or mother needs for example to bring their children to school or get to her workin place .
But the mother could use other transports systems to do that .

She could use other transport systems such as trains , buses or bikes .
This would also have a good effect on the environment , as there will be less CO2 concentration in the air .
The pollution problem , caused mainly by the many individual cars , could lead to a decrease in cars in use .
Because the environment will be polluted more and more , the more people buy their own car , therefore could some people decide to switch to other transport systems , which are more friendly to the environment .
But not many people will think about such factors and prefer having their own car to be not dependent on times .

However driving with cars has also its negative aspects .
As trough the constant increase in the number of cars , the traffic situation on motorways or in big cities has become a big problemin our daily life .
Therefore many prefer using the undergroung railway system in cities and for longer distances will decide to use more often planes or trains .
As for examples flying had been becoming cheaper in the last years and you save time and time means money .

Therefore this could be a reason for a decrease in the use of cars .

But in general i think cars will reain in our s
