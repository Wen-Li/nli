I am agree with the statement as follow : In twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today .
Nowadays , there are more and more cars than before .
There are two reasons that I think support this situation .
One is because of the prise of cars are decreasing , many people can afford a car .
The cars are becoming a most common transportation every where .
The other is that oil and gas are cheaper and cheaper than ever before .
That makes the car market more poverish .

When Henry Ford made the cars came into vogue in the early 20 century .
People no longer take the cars as a dream that can never be reached .
However , as the population of cars increase day by day .
People have also awared of the bad side that the cars bring along with .
The most serious problem is air pollution .
Air pollution causes lots of diseases on human , which is endanger to health .
Take myself for example , when I was young , I lived in a small country where there are fewer cars than in a big city .
Afterwards , I move to a big city and found my lung was not as healthy as when I lived in a small country .

In spite of air pollution , the use of natural resource are limited .
If we do not cherish them , they will be run out in near future .

Seening these two serious problems , scientists have done research on develop other kind of transportation .
For instance , Mass Rapid Transportion system in most of the big cities around the world .
This transportation include two kinds of type , one is subway , the other is skytrain .
Also the High Speed Railroad is also underconstruction .
We can expect it in the near future .

Evaluationg to the cons of the cars and the development in mass transportation system , I thus inclined to say that in twenty even fifteen years there must will be fewer cars in use than there are today .
After all , all human beings are hoping a better life in the future .
