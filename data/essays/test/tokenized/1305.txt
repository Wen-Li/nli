The industry of advertising has developed so tremendously that advertisements and commercials have become an inevitable part of our daily life .
There is not a single day that we have not seen an ad on a billboard as we drive our car , or we have not encountered a commercial on television while we are wathcing our favourite tv show .
But , the question is that are the advertisements really decent and reflect the reality ?
Or are they simply the products of some subtle strategy to deceive us and make use of our money ?
I have the opinion that advertisements are really convincing us that the products are much better than they are in reality .

Firstly , the purpose of an advertisement is to persuade us to buy the mentioned product whatever the quality of the product is .
For this aim , it is very typical of advertisements to exaggerate the desired properties of the product .
It may even happen that the products do not have the marvellous properties suggested in the ad .
For example , I once saw a commercial on television about a shampoo claiming that my hair will be so soft as it has never been if I use that shampoo .
Consequently , I went to the market and purchased the product .
However , when I washed my hair with it , I saw that it was even worse than my ordinary shampoo that I was already using .

Another reason why I am convinced that advertisements are deceiving is based on my observations about the industry .
The industrial process of sales , which covers a wide range of phases like the preparation and the production of the item , the transportation of the product to several markets and selling the product , involves a huge amount of money .
Production and sales is an industrial process , and the unique aim of this process is nothing but making money out of it .
As far as money is concerned , the producers will do anything to cut down on the capital spent to prepare the product .
So why spend a treasure on the production phase to implement products of exceptional quality instead of producing something with just moderate features and being persuasive enough to make people but it !

These point bring me to the conclusion that the advertisements are not reliable and accurate enough to believe in them and plan our purchasing habits based on them .
We must not believe what we see and what they want us to believe , but we must behave according to our own reasoning when we are spending our money .
