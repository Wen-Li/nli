I agree with this opinion that says that some of the advertisments make many kinds of products seem much better than they really are because the people who make these thing want others to be sure that these products are excellents and they should buy these things because they are the best and they are advisable .

But the truth is that some of these products are not the same as we see on television , some times when we buy some of these products we discover that they are not the same as on television so these people lie to us they want us to buy their products .

A good example for this kind of lies is the advertisment that encourge people to buy special kinds of cigarettes , that everyone know that they harm out health and cause many kinds of deseases to humans .
Anothergood example is the drinks that contain too much sugar that we know that it very bad for health .
