Now-a-days for every person knowledge should be there in every aspect with out this we can not do any work .
depending on persons knowledge will be differ .
I prefer to have broad knowledge of many subjects than to specialize in one subject

To support my opinoin i have strong reasons and examples .
First if we have knowledge in only one subject then we cannoy score on other subjects .
At present competative world for the success of any person he should know every subject .

Second we can not get a rank unless we have to study all subjects .
If study one subject we will certainly fail in remaining subjects .
All subjects are important for a school student and a college student .

For example i have perosonal experience a week before i went to a entrance test for embedded course but i shocked by seeing the paper because in that paper vlsi subject also given even it is not necessery for embedded course .

Lastly from this i know we should have knowledge of many subjects instead of one subject .
And many great people say that it is better to learn more subjects then only we can improve our knowledge .
by studying more subjects we can know more information in different aspects .
For the better results we must know different subjects .

Particularly in academic subjects we must learn all subjects then only we can know lot information form it .
In my school days i learn all subjects so i got good rank in my class .

So , i think that many advantages are there in learning more subjects even it is strain to study all subjects .
For the better results of a student he must read all subjects which will increase his knowledge .
