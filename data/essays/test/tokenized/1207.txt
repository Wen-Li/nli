I strongly disagree , because the future of any community is based on it 's young people .
its simply as if we were talking about plant in we give good care to the plant the results we be so impressive and we will be glade with it also , but we have to moniter them and even try to edudicat them in special ways the help them to be a very active part in the society in good trend .

There is a lot of adavtages by giving the power to the young people .
First , in my openion youn people are more modernize than old people and they are thing about the future a lot whats make them more helpful to ther commumities .
Second , they are more educated and they have the chance to get more knowleage than what old people can do .
basicly because there ages awalls them to work more on there studies .

As there is alot of advantages some dis agvantages are exsit .
First , sometimes the system of there communities is too slow and they do n't have the choies to change it , because there are not in the envolve in this system .

second , sometimes the powerfull position are alwalled only for certen people and those people never left there position once they are in it no body can take him out untell he died .
so its really hopeless for some young people when they see this situation .

Third , sometimes every thing is ok , but the comunity does not have enough money to spend on them .
In conclousion , i storgly disagree that young people are not very helpful for there communities .
we should check the system and we should give them a chance and see what can they produce for there communities and even try to ease for them any dificalties that is facing them
