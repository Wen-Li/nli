The ideas and concepts and facts are both important tools that will be used to in education .
Sometimes , these two teaching methods are integreted in the class teaching , Sometimes , the teacher will more emphasized one tools than another in some particular subjects .
Which one is imporant is a controversial and complex issue , Different teacher have different views from their respective angles .
As is well know and often be advocated by many people , many people start to start from the concepts .
Many others insist that facts and examples are more effective in teaching .

I believe that in some subjects , facts will be much more effecitive to help the students to undertand what the teach want to expess .
For example , when I study in business management in business school , the teacher tell us that constant innovation is the most important factor to maintain success for a company .
To illustrate this point of view and ideal , he find a example of IBM .
The teacher told us , although IBM invented PC in 1981 , which is the first invetion of personal computer in the world .
However , because IBM do n't continue to put effort in innovation on design and technology for PC , IBM quicly loose the leading position in this market .
As we all known , IBM had to sell this business in 2003 to Lenovo .
From this example , all the classmates is very easliy to understant that constant inovation is very important .
Because from the story and fact that IBM failed in PC business clearly shows that even IBM is a huge and leading company in the world , but because they did not keep it up to constantly innovate , the big blue giant also will be deafeted .

In this instance , we can see , facts are more interesting , clear , impressive when you want to express a very complext idea and concepts , expecially the concepts and ideas in business management , human behavior , history and many subjects that people learn knowledge from observation and experiment .

But in some subjects , which is more abstract and need to use a lots of concepts , then use t be conluded .
Maybe , the first thing is to help the students to set up a deep and clear understanding about the concepts and ideal .
I remember , in the math class at college , at the beginning , we must understant , what is the real number , what is the absolutely value , what is decimal , and many other concepts firstly .
Then we can use these concepts to conlude some more complex conclusiont .
In this kind of subjects , all the concepts are created by human being , It is we creat the theory of algebra , geograpy and logic .
If we do n't understanf the basic concepts , you can not understand the more deep conhesive theory in the future .

All in all , n my point of view , I think this complex issue should be accessed under a case by case basis .
Which is the best way to decide which teaching methods should be used is highly related what the content of teaching is .
