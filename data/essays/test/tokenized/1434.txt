God is the greatest magnificantly greator .
Every one is different than the other in physical features , in genies formation , and even in learning and understanding ablities .
So i believe ideas and concepts that the humanbeing accepted or learned from other will make him / her a unique person .
This ideas will affect on every one personality , skills , attitude toward himself and the surrounding .

Formation of the personality is a very important stage in our life .
The personality of evey one affected by the input informations and ideas he gained .
This ideas allow us to improve our personality and detect our charcterized , and to be able to understand ourselfes as well as discover any mistake .
However learning facts ca n't do this advantage because it is fixed to every one

Innovation and inspiration skills enhanced by alot of informations , theories and hyposthises .
For example , discovering ultra sound machine to use as adiagonostic and therapeutics advice reguared alot of knowedge in math , biomecanics , and aso physics to achieve this invitation .

Solving problems tht face to any person in any area need alot of experiences and skills , which we learned in our life from books or from other peoples to handle this conflict .

In conclusuion , I would like to express the idea that God give us the ablities to think and learn in order to take our choice freely .
This opinion will help us to know ourselves skills , personalities , and also God gifts .
So we can use it to improve our life and our community .
