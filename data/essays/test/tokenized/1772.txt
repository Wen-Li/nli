I agree that the best way to travel is in a group with a tour gide .
I have some opinions to support my answer .

Firstly , it can decrease the waste of time for our sightseen .
the place we visit as a travel would be strange and there are many things we do not know about the place , for example , the direction , how to ride the local train or public cars and so on .
Then we can depend on the tour guide what we should do or where we should visit .
Moreover in the case of travel abrod , we do not have to worry about the problem of language .
Tour gide must be good at the language spoken in the country .
So we would not be panic because of the difficulties of the language .

Secoudly , it can be sure safe for tourist .
As the above the paragaraph , we do not be familiar with the place so we can not know about the dengerous spot where we should not go .
There are many cases that we can not find such places in the guide book by ourselves .
So listening the direntions from guide , we can protect our selves from unexpected acctident .
If , unfortunately , we meet such accident , for example , we lost our pasport or money by theaf , we can depend on a our guide what we should do to solve the problem .

Thirdly , we can get many knowledge from our guide .
For instance , in Kyoto in Japan , there are so many temples or shrines .
Then we can learn from him/her about the history of them .
It is too hard to do ourselves
