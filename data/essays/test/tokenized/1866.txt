I will become a manager , i 've decided to work in many differents structurs , with different people , so i agree with this statement for a lot of reasons .

First i 'm young and i do n't know what i will like to do in twenty years for exemple .
I do n't reckon we can kept the same passion during his all life .
So i prefer being generaliste than a specialist , because i want to be able to change my job when i desire .
Having the choice of our futur is essential to my mind .

Moreover in my point of view the society is very complex now .
Before we could be a specialist and sudy a probem with only one academic subject .
But now evry situations require different competences .
When i learned sociology , we learned politic and psychology too .
When a student today want to become a scientifics specialized in biology for exemple , in fact he must learn mathematic and other academy subjects .
The real question would be able to be : what is a specialist now ?
Are specialist exist really ?
I think not .
Besides the works in team , that increasing now , demonstrate the fact that we ca n't be only a specialist .

I would added that i reckon the specialization is an ennemy for the democracy .
In my point of view it can decreases the links between every citizens .
Because everyone close himself in a specific subject and forget other citizens .
Furthermore i think that we can forget the values of the other sciences , so we would criticised the works of the others .
In a world where the racism is so important , the links between each citizens is a very huge goal for our future .
