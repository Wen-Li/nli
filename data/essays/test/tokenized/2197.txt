I agree that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .
Advertisement 's object is to make its product good for saling purposes .
To emphasize it , product is shown as perfect .

There is a set-up what makes costumers think that the product is better than actual it is .
The set-up is made for a specific application .
The customer may think that it also works well other situations like in advertisement .
The actual case may not be so .
For example , a machine for apple cutting may be good for that type of apple shown and it may cut only apple .
When the machine is used for another type of apple or another fruit like orange , it may not work as well as in the advertisement .

Another thing makes products seem better in advertisement is the place where it happens or the person who uses the product .
To illustrate that , a banana advertisement happens in Hawii .
The weather is good , beach is beautiful , there are beautiful girls .
A man is seen as he is eating a banana deliciously .
Since there are many other perfect images in the advertisement , the banana will be like these , perfect .
In addition if a famous and attractive person uses the product for example a parfume , the parfume will be usullay sold at a bigger quantitiy .
Buyer of the product will probably estimate that the product will make him/her smell good and attracitve .
Since the player is famous , player will be dependable .

As a conclusion , the images used in advertisement affect the view of costumer about the product .
The product is not considered alone .
When it is used in real life , it does not work as good as it is on tv , newspaper , etc .
It is natural since there are no other imagesor other affects , there is only the product .
