I support the idea that succesful people try new things and take risks , becuase that the first step of success .
The first thing you need to do in order to begin something new it 's take the risk that comes with it .
The fear that the unknown brings it 's what hold us back in life .

If you 're not willing to take any risk in life you 're always going to be sure that nothing bad it 's going to happend , but neither something good and unexpected .
And you 're going to loose a lot of opportunities that involves taking risks , even simples thing like going on a trip , or buying something new and rare .

This fears can become a problem in our lives , and I experienced them , as I think a lot of people do .
You become afraid of what may happen if you do something new .
And that becomes like a habit and you just stop trying because you feel confortable in the world you live in , and any opportunity of changing you livestyle or anything in your life brings a risk , a big risk for you .
The reality , I think , it 's that what happen or if you get what you expected it 's not that important , what 's important is that you doing what you feel it 's right and can make you happy , and it may bring you a lot of new and good things into your life .

That 's why the people that take risks and try new things are more likely to experience a lot of different situations and learned from them and get a lot of succes , becuase they take the risk and they do n't stop if something goes wrong they just try something new !! .
I admire this kind of people and i 'm working on becoming one of them .
There 's nothing to really fear about new experiences , they mean that you living and learning , and after the time has past , all we have left it 's our happy moments and experiences throughout our lives .
