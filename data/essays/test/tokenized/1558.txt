We know that advertisements has been created for a psichological purpose : to convince consumers to buy something .
Since the consumer 's society has spreaded , advertisements are the bast way to have some product known and sold .
Groups of people , producers , experts are engaged for preparing advertisemens as well : one colour is prefered to another , a target of people is studied in order to know habits , desires ecc .
So the consumer , in the end , should feel as just as if the product he 's buying , belongs , in some way , to himself .

But we also know , in the same time , that this kind of operation is not always satisfying for the kind of product that it 's going to be sold .
Let 's think about food , for example .
If a meat producer gives me the idea that a kind of beef is better than another produced not in the same way , not in the same time , not with the same animal but less sponsorized than this one , it 's probable that I will feel in myself that , that product it 's better , even if it 's not .

Sometimes the countrary happens , maybe for some environmental conditions some people preferes not to buy the product that has much advertisements , but especially in the past , in the years in which there was the economic growth , advertisements played a great role .
People was fascinated by those colours on the streets , on the tv shows , and never thought twice about buying a thing .

Now , with new norms which regulates the market we have different situations .
TV , Internet , Phones have changed the way of creating advertisements .
We have nearly quintuplicated the number of them , but in the same time I think that much more information and consciousness has also given us a different way to approach the buying of a product .
Young people , both man and women think before they buy .
There 's no more just an economic affair : people should be sure of what is buying and most of all wants to be sure not to be buying a disposable good .
