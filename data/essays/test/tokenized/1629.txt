Nowadays there are many topics which are controversial , one of these is if students must understand ideas or learn facts .
Many people believe is better to have comprehesion abaout what you are studying .
On the other hand a lot of people prefer learn facts , maybe they have arguments to support their beliefs .

I am inclined to believe that it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them learn facts by many reasons .
I feel very strongly that with this method you can learn about the subject , you are creating your own knowledge of the matter and probably you will never forget this ideas you have studied , for example if you are studying business you will apply the ideas you have learnt in the future if you are working for example in a bank .
The greatest advantage of understanding ideas is you will have to memorize less concepts than if you are learning facts so you will work less , for example i am studying architecture , and many subjects like maths , or structure , or physic you have to resolve a lot of problem , and if you use this method , you only need to understand few ideas to do thousands and thousands of problems .
In my opinion this way to work is easier , more intelligent and also you will obtain better scores in your exams .
There are several reasons to support that this is the correct way , if you understand the concept or idea you could apply this concept to another subject if someday you need it , for example in my architecture studies if i understand a lot of formulas and concepts in maths i can apply this in the structure lessons in order to calculate buldings structures .
If you understand one idea you have the knowledge or the posibility to transmit this idea for example one person that study astronomy and understand the concept of gravity consequently he can explain you perfectly this phenomenon .

In my opinion i think this is the correct way to work and the people who learn facts is because of they want to work less , and they are do not mind the subject they are studying .
