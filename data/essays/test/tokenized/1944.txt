In my opinion successful people try new things and take risks in deed rather than remaining at their used things and behaviours .
There are several reasons for this view .
First of all , those people have earned enough money because of their success and so provide the main condition to trying something new .
The most people can not afford to speculate because they often have to care for a family which depends on a regulate incoming .
So there is usually no space for creating new and revolutionary ideas and making those real .
That does not mean that less successful people are not interested in alternative things , but they often have not the possibilities to live like they want because of different duties .

Secondly , it may be decisive that people who have experienced a great career only became successful in this manner since they tried new things or took a risk .
Without that behaviour in our times there is almost no chance to achieve your aims and finally succeed .
Perhaps it is a way of life they had choosen in young years and which helped them to reach their goals , therefore it is now one of their characteristic reaction to try something new .
Other people did not get this chance to experience the advantages of risks by their own so they are more frightened towards them .

Last but not least , successful people have already reached what they have dreamed of all the years .
So these people may come to a point where they have to decide about going on .
Because of enough money and their positive knowledge about those risks and new chances they will probably take them and set a new target to their own for what they can work more hardly than ever .
There are so many career men and women who can not live without working and putting everything behind that aim .
