Since the beginning of civilization man has been living in communities .
This was mainly because of the human nature to be part of a social structure and participate in activities as a group .
It also ensured help for the members of the community in times of crises .
Man has developed as a society .
From being part of households with 15 to 20 members we have now come to living with smaller , closely knit families in these modern times .
These huge families had their duties and responsibilities divided among themselves and this reduced the burden from being thrust on any one member of the family .
It also gave the families more time to participate in a greater number of community services like social gatherings , charity events and the like .
However with the growth of cities , children started moving away from their parents and forming their own nuclear families .
this added to the responsibilities of each of the family members thus leaving little time to participate in the community .

i agree that young people today do not give enough time to helping their communities .
however this is because of the fast paced lives that we all live today .
we have a lot of individual duties , careers and other work to attend to that helping out with our communities does not feature on our list of priorities and is often ignored .
as competition grows so does our work load and so do our expectations about ourselves .
we get involved with college exams , family functions , projects for school and other activities that we do not leave enough time even for ourselves to relax and enjoy recreation .

however in recent times it has been observed that the youth have been coming forward to participate in issues that they feel strongly about .
it could range from issues as simple as correct waste disposal at the local dumping ground to the more serious matters of student opposition to reservations in various policies .
the youth have been voicing their concerns more vociferously than before and it is about time that they were taken seriously .
however this participation is still in its infancy stages and requires organisation probably at school or university level .
this will enable students to decide as a group what they can do to help a certain project like an adult literacy program or plan concrete measures to be taken against indiscriminate deforrestation .

it may be the case that although the young people nowadays want to give enough time to helping their communities but just dont know how to begin .
it would help that like minded people come forward to form groups or organisations that could effectively achieve what one person may find it hard to do on their own .
this can be done by forming various societies in school and at universities to help students be work for a cause they really believe in .
