I agree with the statement , that successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well .

When people only do the things they already had success with , they can not get better .
In a dynamic environment like it is nowadays , with a lot of market changes , globalisation and internationalisation it is more important than ever to try something new .
If you do not try things out , you will stay were you are and the world changes around you .

There will be other people , who take risks and one day they will become better than you .

Of course taking a risk is not always easy .
It requires courage and you do not know whether you succeed .
There will be times , when you take a risk and you flop .
But this should not stop you from taking risks .

Taking risks is another meaning for taking a chance .
A risk is also an opportunity and out of an opportunity many things can develop .

When you look at successful people , you realise , that they have always discovered something new and invested in a field , that was uncertain .
Nobody became successful with old things .
For example the founder of Ebay .
Nobody would have thought , that a secondhand market on the internet would work out .
But it did !
This was a new thing and the company is very successful now .

I also always try new things .
While other students stay in Lueneburg to study , I did a semester in Finland .
During my holidays I go to other countries for internships , I try new sports or I visit friends abroad .
I have experienced , that when I try out something new , most of the time it was good and the others envied me afterwards .

And the few times new things and taking a risk turned out to be a failure .
What does it matter ?

Of course it depends on the kind of risk .
Taking a financial risk for a father of a family is something else , then the kind of risks I do as a student .
But overall I agree with the statement .
