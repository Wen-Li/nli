I completely agree with the statement shown bellow .
It is quite true that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .
I will continuously give my explanation and personal opinion of this agreement .

Usually , the places were you find the advertisements of these products are in the streets shown on billboards , the television , magazines and news papers .
Each and every add has the intention of giving the best impression to the society , or better known , the shopers , the consumers .

In some cases the advertisers exagerate the appearances of the products .
It is obviously their way of selling and catching inmensely the buyers attention .
It is true that it 's their way of selling , however it is n't the right one .
After buying a product that seemd much better on the add than in the reality , the person aquires a different view towards it .
For example , if you buy a shampoo in the supermarket , believing that it will supposely help to nourish your hair and to give more volume to it , and you do n't observe any difference or improvement , you will obviously stop buying it .

Lying with the function of the product may help the fact that people will buy it .
However , it wont bring an economical progress for the company .
This may provoque a problem with the consumers , because people nowadays are not sure if they buy the product or not .
By nature the human being is unconfident and this may cause a problem with the consumation .
People are no longer buying what they see on the television for example because ther are afraid that the product wont work as good as it looks on the TV set .

I personally believe , that the society has to change , so that this vision or belief that people have , becomes different , that is to say in a more positive aspect .
The function of the products should n't be a lie .
It defenitely wo n't help the company .
They should expose what is real to their project .
If it is n't quite good enough , then they sould simply work harder to make it better .
