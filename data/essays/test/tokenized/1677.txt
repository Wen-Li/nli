I disagee that successful people try new things and take risks .
According to the newspaper , the richest man in Japan was a man worked in the bank .
People often think that the rich man will be the CIO in the famous company or the owner of the famous company .
In actual , the rich man in Japan was the man worked in the bank .
He talked the reason why he could be rich .
The reason was that he selectes the safest way to live with working in the company and gaining his sarary .
Why did he introduce such as the reason ?

FIrst , I think that he might understood his limited power and try to do something new .
So , he thought that he wanted to be the CIO in the company .
Acctually , CIO can gain a lot of money but have the risk of the company .
If he deside wrongly .
his company will stop the business growth .
Thus , he wanted not to be CIO .

Second , I think that he might make a effort not to reduce his money .
He said that he tried not to use his money .
Thus he has been the rich man in Japan .
He did only usual way not to pay his money something .

I think that it is important for successes to contienue to do something .
Therefore , I think that successful people do not try something new and take risks .
