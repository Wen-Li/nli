yes i agree the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide onlly .
because we have went to the new place ever we have seen at that time we need a guide to tell us about that place and the important things and the history of that place and why it got the name for it .
for ex ample i and my friends have went to mysore and we have ever seen the place till now and we want the details about the palace and other details and why that palace had that much name so none of our fiends have no idea of that place and about that area .
so we have ask a guide to tell about that palce and show us the city which have been visit .

using the guide we can learn more things and we ca n't face any problems .
because the guide knows about all the places in that city and we can easily know all those and we wo n't miss the important places .
for example i will take agra we know that there is an tajmahal built by shajahan for his wife as a gift .
but the people who are uneducated will some times come for tour to visit at that time it is the best way to travel with the guide and even they do n't know how to travel also due to this we have to need atour guide .
ok it is no problem for the person who knows about the place they go with out the guide .
the guide will show us every part in that place .
even the guide some times will say lies but it is better with the guide .

visiting the tours with out the guide facing so many problems .
for example we want to visit the states like us or canada ofcourse we got an visitors vissa for 15 days or 1month upto the air port we can visit and after we ca n't vist any other cities .
and we have to return back from that airport only .
if we ask a tour guide with us means we can visit all the places we want to see by not asking the tour guide means we have to make an enquiry how to go to the place we want to visit and have to know about the local trains and the buses we have to face so many risks .
so the better way i prefered is to travel in a grouped by a tour guide .
