I agree that it is more important for students to understant ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts .
Understanding the ideas is the goal of the studying because if you understand the ideas you can invent a new idea , understanding the idea is the basic of any thing to be profissional .
However , just learning facts is not enogh to be creative or profissonal .

understanding the ideas is the best way to study , whatever you want to study .
By this way , you can learn anything .
For example , when a student wants to learn about a complex subject , he wants to understand the subject first and he will have a lot of questions , that is why understanding the ideas is very important .
if you pay attention in an acadamic class or in the school , the professors or the teachers always ask `` do you have a question , do you understand ? ''

Learning facts is also important but not as much as understanding ideas , learning facts should come after you understand the ideas , it also good for examples .
very rare subjects that count on learnig facts more than understanding the ideas .

All of them is good way to learn , sometimes student should make his own way to staudy and always try to know what is the right and the wrong .
