I agree with the statement that people who are successful are tend to try new things and take risks rather than not repeating same things what they know how to do it .

Certainly , it is much easier to follow the way of doing things what you know how to complete .
You just need to repeat the same step as you did before .
However , if you do the same things everyday , it is safe and reasonable but the way of life does not produce more than just a normal life .
To give an example , a factory worker may put two mechanic parts together as his boss told him to do so all day long , then he gets a little money .
It is very natural .
Easy safe activity makes only that much result .

On the other hand , I know how succesful people became so succesful .
They are not in the higher position only by chances .
A lot of those who spend a lot of time , got over many difficulties and sometimes might have been deceived by bad people , they came across the new ideas , helpful people and so on to be successful .
For example , they might have spent more than 20 years for experiments , bought expensive devices to create new products and they even threw away their happy family lives !
I am sure that successful people chose to be just successful by doing anything they need to be successful .

By doing things what they are so used to does not make a huge benefit , only those who try new things and have no fear to taking risks get a opportunity to be successful .
In this point , I agree with the statement .
