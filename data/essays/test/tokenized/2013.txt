Education is the most important for the human being , because it takes a lot of years to finish and you are getting prepared to the life at this period , nowadays , teachers of the new education system teach their students that understanding fact are more important than understanding concepts , however , we can see that is not succesful way to learn the issues .

First of all , there is no type of student , who can understand the facts before understanding the idea , you can not require the result , unless they have an opinion about the the concept , so that , you must teach the students main idea , this will improve their knowledge and they can easily focus on facts , otherwise you can not require them to learn details .

Secondly , it is obvious that students can not create solutions and improve themselves on new ideas and concepts without the facts , it is essential that the student learn the facts .
This debate will survive for many years because i think it depends on the student , some students can reach the idea from the facts , but some of them can not reach the idea from the facts , and we can see that ideas and facts are combined to each other , you can not seperate them , they are like a diffrent part of a same apple .

In Conclusion , Ideas are the result of the facts , the facts mean nothing only with themselves , I think this situation is not only for students , this is all about human being , teacher have to teach the idea deeply so they can find the answers for the facts .
