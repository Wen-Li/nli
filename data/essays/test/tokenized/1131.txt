Nowadays , it can not be denied that advertising is everywhere in rich countries .
It is also generally agreed that adversiting is used by firms to improve the image of the products they are triying to sell .
Their aims are to distribute their products and make profits on them .
In order to lead the market , firms could do almost everything .
Furthermore , they know that they need to attract consumers .
And one way how the consumer is going to choose your product instead of another is advertising .

We may now wonder if most advertisements make product seem much better than they really are .
This raises a fundamental issue : the respect of the consumer .
To answer that question , we 'll present on the one hand how adversitments could be untrue and on the other hand how to control this problem .

Let us begin with a description of the situation .
Today , we can find more and more advertisments on the subway , TV or Internet .
Moreover , products in commercials all look so good .
For instance , when you look at a commercial of a fastfood company , the products look really nice .
It would seem at the first sight that the burger is very tasty but in reality it is untrue .
There is also a seamy side of this problem : some advertisments could critic another product when this one is not allready good .
In a nutsell , we can see that there some difficulties with advertising even if it 's a very good way to promote your product and to save your company .

Secondly , to reduce this problem , rich countries have now institutions to control advertising .
In the past few years , there were too many lying commercials .
So now a commercial is controled before being launched in the market .
And if we learn after that the product is really not like the commercial , customers can sue the company whoc made it

to conclude we thaht commercial is part of the society but that a produc must not be really disconnected from its own commerical
