I hope that the number of cars that travel on our street will decrease in the future twenty years .
It would be better for environment and health .
Despite this I do n't belive that something like that will happen .
The real situation is quite didifferent .
I 'm not optimist about that .

There are a lot more cars today than in the past years .
That 's because in the richer countries and continents ( such as U.S.A. , Canada and Europe ) lots of families own more than a car .

Even though we know that cars need fuel , and that fuel is goin to cost more and more in the future because of the lack of new resources to produce it , we need cars .
Public means of transport are not reliable .
Till the public means of transport are not reliable people wo n't prefer them to their cars .

Apart from that there are a lot of countries whose economy and finantial possibilities are growing .
Also people that comes from countries such as China or India may want to buy cars and they are going to become cars mass producers and users in the next fifty years .
They are countries that are growing .
An example of why car will increase in number is the fact that from few years the GP is rode also in China .
It is a fututre market where to advertise the brand .

It is hard to say what the economically speaking growing countries will decide to do .
They may spend teir money to crate streets for lots of cars or spend those money to create or improve the public transportations .
If they decide for the second option maybe the number of cars will decrease .
But cars brings with them a lot of place of work and money .
It 's because of that that I think that the number of cars wo n't decrease in the future .
