I entirely agree with the idea that it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject for two main reasons .

In the first place I 'm conviced that it is really important to study many academics subjects in very different fields because it helps students to be open-minded with is an important quality for the present and the future .
Moreover if we learn Art , History , Music , which are subjects that are often outside our major field of studies , we learn at the same part a huge part of our general culture .
Thus , if we know history or Religious Science , it can help us to know where we are from .
By the way we can thus be more tolerant with people who have different culture and understand them better than before .
Philosophy is also a very important subject to learn even if it is not enough valorised in college .
If you study philosophy you get used to listening to different points of view which is not easy when you believe that yours is the best .

Secondly I think that it 's important to study many subjects because it can be useful later in our professional life .
It is true that we need to be specialized to get a job as doctor or lawer or every thing else .
However I would like to underline that today lots of people have to change of job in the middle of their life .
It can happen lots of time in a society such as ours where the sucess is synonymus to adaptability .
So even if you are a lawer you could have the opportunity to become a painting seller , for example , but this would be possible only if you have some basic knowledge about art .

In conclusion , I would say that a broad knowledge is a big gift
