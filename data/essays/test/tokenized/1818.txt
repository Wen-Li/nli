I agree with the importance of the understanding of all subject or topic .

I believe that is more imoprtant for a student to understand something that just learn it .
As an example , in a history class you will memorize , dates , places , number of individuals in a certain place , and that is right , but that is not the full concept of history , history is knowing how the things happend ? , why they hapend ? , for what reazons ? , all that kinds of doubts that you should be able to understand .
Another example will be mathematics , your teacher give you a formula for memorize and you will memorize it but if you dont know how to use it in a problem in a quiz you will be stock and you wont go any farther untill you understand it .

People need to use their brains , more than just saving records , dates and names .
Students need to start thinking , in that way they can develope better understanding towards any subject .

One great thinker in the history of human kind , Galileo Galilei he learned how the gravity works by understanding it spending time watching thinking over and over again until he figure it out .

A big part of our society relies in people that are able to understand things , like geologist with the global warming , they need to understand why the world temperature is increasing drastically , Detectives need to understand what happend in crime scenes in a way to catch the author of the crime , Scientifics need to understand why the things happen in physics , chimestry , biology and all kinds of branches that the science have .

My conlusion on this subject , is that students need to understand everything that is arround them in a way to develop more the logic behind everything .
