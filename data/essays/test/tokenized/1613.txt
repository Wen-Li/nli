For the development of our country 's economy , many people are richer than before , so travel is good way of consuming .
And it can take a lot of benefits , for example , it can release the pressure , and for children , it can give a lot of knowledge .
But I donot think follow a guide in a trip is good way in travelling .
There are some reasons for this .

I think , for me , travelling is not only the mathod of consuming , but also a communition with friends , When we start of work , there is limited time for me to meet friend , so in holidays , taking a travel with close friend is a very important way of keep in touch with them , I did not want someone else play with us .
so I did not need travel in a group .

Secondly , traveling in a group with a guide leaded may be a good way for some children and old man , because they need to take care .
But I think it is not nessessary for us , because we are not adolesence any more , we can take care with ourselves .
and follow a guide , she or he can is talk about the places where the person visited .
But we can go to the internet to download some information about the farmous place .

last and most important , follow a guide in the trip , had disadvantage for me , our plan is limited by the guide .
She or he do a lot of things for us , for instance book he hotel , decide which place to play in , by plane or by train .
These things I want to do it on my own opinion .
And a lot of famrous place like the Summer Palace in Beijing , the Great Wall , where we want to spend more time in , the time of the guide give is to limited for us .
If we wanted some place else to look around , this is not allowable because that could bring some other people waiting for us .

For all of these three point , travelling by our own is a suitable method , we can travel in the hignway in our own car , meet the people in my own ,
