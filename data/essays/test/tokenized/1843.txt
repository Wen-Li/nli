I strongly agree that successful people try new things and take calculated risks .
However they strive hard and generally continue doing what they do well .
I would say that the ability to take calculated risks is a trait of a successful man .

Successful people have the unique trait of taking calculated risks and learning new things .
A wider learning increases their horizons , leading to opportunities to grow and becoming more successful .
For example Richard Brason has been a extreamely successful man and he has taken immense risks both personally and professionally .
He started out in the music industry and took the Virgin group to aviation industry and now looking to capture outer space .
He took the risk of entering the aviation industry without training or knowledge and created a unique place for his group .
Personally he took high risk adventures like ballon flying without having been trained professionally .
However with determination and focus he learnt the tricks and skills to fly .

Another example of successful people and their ability to take risks would be Ratan Tata , Chairman of Tata Group .
Amid strong opposition and discouragement he led Tata Motors to take the risk of a making the cheapest car and successfully completed the project by creating the Nano , the cheapest car , costing less that $ 250 .

There are numerous business houses that have risked their businesses with calculated decisions and opted for the risky takeovers of companies for larger maginitute .
For eample The Tata Corus deal and the Arcelon Mittal deal .

Admittedly there are numerous successful leaders who continue to do what they do best and devote their energies to their core businesses such as technology , finance .
These industries sustain and gain a competitive edge in the industry thus requiring their leaders to take risks andsome tough decisions .
For example , Narayan Murthy the software tycoon who started Infosys a leading Indian software company focused on transperency and ethics in the industry .
He risked losing projects by going this way and has taken some tough stand to lay the foundation for these principles .

In sum , successful people always take calculated risks and learn new things and widen their horizons .
Some go further and diversify into other areas to grow their business while others grow leaders in their core businesses .
