The most important part in business these days is advertising .
Companies advertise ruthlessly to take advantage of the first mover option in the market before their rival company does and due to this there has been an increased role of advertising in making the end customers aware of the product .
In most of cases , I reckon , they succeed in doing so .

These days , the market being so competitive and ruthless , there are instances where in the companies try to potray their products as something else than what they really are .
Take for example the advertisment for ABC Cola which is being showed on National television and the print media .
The Cola company is potraying the ABC Cola has a thirst quencher .
This is not toltally correct .
As suggested by the independent reasearch done by the National Health Institute , it has been found that the colas actually do n't quench your thirst but make you more thristy later .
This is completely contrary to what the Cola company wants us to believe and the sad part of the story is that people fall for this and the sales of ABC Cola have been rising ever since .

There are instances where advertisers try to paint a rosy picture of the product working on the sentiments of the people .
Like those advertisments for La Fairness Cream that promises fairness in less than a month .
To worsen the problem , the rival companies often come up with a notion which is further preposterous .
Like the advertisment for the Fairy Fairness lotion that claims to make you fair in less than a week .
Reasearch on this has shown that fairness ca n't be achieved overnight by the use of such external applications but there are people out there buying these products .
As mentioned earlier , the competition in the market is driving companies into selling their prodcuts without paying much heed to the fact that they are actually duping the end customer .

All said and done it becomes the responsibility of the end customer to weigh their options well .
The good thing is that now the institution of consumer courts in well established in the society and the customer is aware of it .
It would not be too long when the advertising companies would realize this and would ensure that they do not hype their products
