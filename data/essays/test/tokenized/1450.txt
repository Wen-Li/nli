It 's true that the youth nowadays is less sensitive to the problems of the society than 30/40 years ago .
You can see that in the disinterest that young generations have for politics , many youngs do n't know anything about politics and what is happening aroud them .
While during the ` 60 / ` 70 many youngs were involved in politics , they took part to demostrations , they bought political newspaper and they often discussed about the problems of the society to try to understand and possibly change them .

In those years there were n't so many distractions for youngs , there were n't video-games , DVD , internet and so on ...
that nowadays fill entirely the day of youngs .
Nowadays young people do n't spend much time with other boys and girls , they prefare to stay closed in home to play with their video-games , explore internet and other things of this genre that obviously do n't give any help and improvement in their often empty life .

It 's time that the youngs understand that and begin to switch off their TV , console and monitor , and go out to talk with people , like their grandparents , figures too often forgotten in our society .

People that have too much to teach us and that we do n't listen enough .
It 's time for the youngs to meet people , who has n't been so lucky like us , people who live in the roads , who have n't enough to eat , who are cold . ..
It 's time for youngs to understand that the world go beyond the last PS2 games or Bruce Willis 's movie .
It 's time for youngs to understand that an one moment they 'll be called to rule the world after their parents , and certainly video-games wo n't be useful at this moment .
