Young people are very busy with buzzing job or academic schedules nowadays and hardly find time to help their communities .
The people are so much involved with the work that they hardly find time to attend their families even .

These busy bees mostly reside in busy localities or apartments where it would even matter if the person stops and wishes his/her neighbour leisurely and ask him/her about her weekend plans .
The work at the offices take place in different shifts which run aound the clock and they hardly find time to atleast see one another .

There are some kids who leave for school early in the morning and hardly find time to see their own parents .
The young people who study have their schools and colleges run for such long hours and also the growing competition in world compels them to stay way from the community affairs .

Each individual should firstly realise it by himself/herself that he/she is responsible about working and helping the communities which can include the grooming activities , cutting down costs on resources utilised by the community , spending time with the older generation , taking to them , learning from their experinences ; organising gatherings regularly , conducting games for kids , etc .

There are communities which organise some gatherings for these busy people on weekends .
For example they can organise some indoor or outdoor games for these people to relax and spend sometime together so that they can share some of their experiences , problems which can be resolved through eachother .

There can be mythological gatherings like in India there are festivals celebrated like Ganesh Chathurthi , Dusshera and Diwali many gathertings are organised in the holy name of God and people get sometime to spend together .

But one point should be highlighted that being , blaming the people completely for the busy schedule will not be fair .
As the competitive world requirements are soo huge that people try to work out everything in the 24 hour day and sometimes even use up the weekend to meet up the deadlines for their projects .
So , according to me its completely how we manage the show because nothing should be given least importance as everything comes up to give a wholesomeness or completeness to something important in our lives .
