I disagree with the statement , as some of my most valuable and unforgettable travel experiences are from travelling on my own or with friends independently .
Travelling in a group has its advantages , yet I would say that does not necessarily mean that it is the best way to travel .

For example , there are also great advantages in travelling independently , such as you are free to wonder around on your own pace , stopping at certain places that interst you most and improvise the route as you go along .
What I like about travelling is that you can see a whole different world , culture , life , language , food , custom and so on , that is completely different from what you are used to see or live in .
And it is usually in those small streets I went in wondering about when I meet the most interesting scenes of local life , unfamiliar things or exotic shops .

Also you tend to get to know more people easily when you are moving individually , which is another big purpose for me to travelling around .
Conversation with other travellers , local people , or even taxi drivers , meeting and getting to know what all the other people are feeling and thinking in their daily life is something I find very intriguing , as they often have completely different way to see things and open my eyes .

I see some benefit travelling in a group led by a tour guide , for instance to have someone to rely on when problems occur , or never to get lost or being in dengerous situations .
The tour guide can provide interesting insights about the places they go too , yet I am still inclined to value more the experiences you create on your own account , which makes the trip and experience you live really yours .

To conclude my opinion , therefore , travelling independently can be as great as travelling in a group .
Firstly because you are not restricted by the travel time tables made by the tour agency and free to spend as much as time you want on places that really attracts you .
Secondly , because you get to meet people from different background and people who you would never met otherwise more easily then when you travel in the group .
Although the guided tour can provide various valuable benefits such as safety and information , I think you can suppliment elements like information by joining a short tour in the particular spot , and you can always be careful and causious to not to encounter problems .
For those reasons , in my personal opinion travelling individually is more preferable than travelling in a group led by a tour guide .
