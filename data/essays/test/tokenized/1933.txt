Understanding ideas and concepts more important than learning to the facts for two important reasons .
First , student do not learn every details of the subject .
Secondly , they do not have success with the details and they do not easily reflect theirs abilities .
For these reasons , I supported to the understand ideas and concept .

First of all , when student tried to learn every details of subject they do not understant importance of subject .
Details restricted to the qulifications of educations .
In details students do not show the important points of subject .
When tehey related with unimportant point they do not completely understand next ideas and concepts .
In these days , every person related only with his or her work and education system formed according to this understanding .
This understanding related with work world and businessman want to profesional people who related only in his or her works .

Second and important reason is the students get in details or facts of subject they did not improved themselves and they became lost theirs concentrations .
Then , they onset to show less successfulls and do not reflect their skills easily .
This kind of education understandig led to students memorize everything , yet they do not reflect theirs abilities .
For these reasons , students do not see importance off ideas and concepts and then they became stay same position .
They do not illusturated and devoloped his or her skills .

As a result , I supported to the understand ideas and concepts more import than understant to the facts .
The reasons which I underlined them have vital role on the students understandings .
For these reasons , students would be understand subject and concepts much more than facts .
Education system will be formed according to this understanding for higher success in the education process .
This new understanding which I give details of its brings much more success for students .
