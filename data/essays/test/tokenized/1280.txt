It is often argued that which is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts or to learn facts .

i basically agree with the idea that it is more improtant for students to understand ideas and concepts becasue i believe that the concepts and understanding can give a students opportunities to learn responsibilty and big picture of the whole process of what they doing , the opportunity is a direction that teaches students by expericencing them to learn a creativity .

In a business manner , the facts are always very important more than it real works sometimes .
for example , Microsoft was ventured by few young people who were students by the time they started the business .
the two co-founders especially , the Bill gates has a whole understand and concepts for personal computers , even though he can consider a very skilled computer engineer , he actually created MS based on his belief and creating mind that both come from ideas and concepts of future personal computers time comming .

There were probably so many other people who know computer and have more skills on technology than that of Bill gates has .
but the real creative and the real revolution can be achieved by understanding ideas and concepts .

Examples to answer of the question given do not need to be compare big reputation company .
we can easily find a example of better understand ideas and concepts would useful than just learning facts .
i have 4years olds boy , Jun - my sisters children , and 5years boy , Sean - my friend 's children , the two childrens are have very different behavior in general .
Jun does n't read and speaking properly yet while Sean could read and learn many things since he was 3years .
but when they using a computer specially internet to search what they wanted to watch such as children program , Jun alwasy find his way to find what they want from internet because i believe that he knows what is the internet about even though he ca n't read .
