I agree with the statement because of many reasons .
One is , advertisements always exaggerate the qualifications of the product and causes people to expect miraculous results .
So , when the customers face with the unsatisfactory results they are disappointed and do not want to buy the same product for the second time .
In addition to these , people are more likely to buy the products they see on the tv and pay higher prices just because they like the advertisement .
It is a very common trick which is used by the brand owners .
Most of the time consumers pay a lot to low quality products because of the advertisments .
For example , my mother bought a shampoo which she saw on the tv and paid a lot more than usual .
After she used it she realised that her expectations were not met .
She wanted to have healty shining hair like the famous actress on the advertisement but experienced that this perfect illusion exists only on tv .
Moreover , some products do not contain the same amounts of ingredients as mentioned on the product and put customers health in danger .
This situation exist especially in the countries where chemical controls are not very strict .
Advertisments mostly emphasise the very special ingredient in their product and encourage people to buy it whereas most of the time companies refuse to declare the percentages .
Another negative effect caused by this general understanding is that people are more likely to think that the products which they do not see on tv are useless .
If a company does not spend huge amounts of money for advertisment and if a consumer does not know about the brand she refuses to try the product .
Here again we can see how influencial the advertisments are
