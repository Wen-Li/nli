It is not easy to say if in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use because main reasons will be the developement of the different societies and the economy .

In this times you need a higher mobility for work , I know many people which have to drive a long trip to their working place and tickets for busses or trains are still too expensive , so It would make no difference for them at the moment .
And of course it is more comfortable to ride the own car .

But the natural ressources get less and so we have to look for other and better possibilities .
I think in high economic standard regions like Europe or the USA will be fewer cars in use in twenty years , but in other regions where the birth rate is much higher and the economy is not so developed at all , there will be very very much potential car drivers in future .
One example is Africa , there are so much people without anything , but when the economy will boom , they want their own cars .
So even if the number of cars is reduced in some nations , there will be more cars over the world .

For discussing the reducing of the cars twenty years is a too small time period , perhabs in fifty years this will be the case .
But then perhabs natural friendly methods have been developed , we have to see .
So I do not think that we will have fewer cars in twenty years .
