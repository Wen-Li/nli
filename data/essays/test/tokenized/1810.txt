Where it was possible a few centuries ago to be higly qualified in several subjects it is almost impossible today .
Whether it is preferable to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects or to specialize in one specific subject is discussed in this essay .

Having a broad knowledge of many academic topics enabels people to think in a wider area ; an overal view .
This could lead to new approaches in finding solutions .
An complete overview is essential for a succsessful ending of missions .
An allrounder could take an important position in unifying a powerteam in order to increase the output performance of such a team .
His general view permits him to link unusual fields in order to combine their strenghts .
However , as he is familiar with several different fields he lacks detail knowledge .

Being specialized in a specific subject , on the other hand , allow peoble to understand little but important details .
So it is unsurprising that initial ideas are finaly developed by specialists .
One of the strength of spezialists is to analize a problem in its whole complexity .
Which is often the only way to find a highly vounurable solution .
Furthermore developing knowledge in a specific subject is only possible if one knows the very detail .

To sum up , I think it is difficult to judge this statement in general .
In research , however , I strongly believe that only somebody who is specialized in one specific subject can provide valuable results .
Since the complexity in resarch is enormous only higly trained people have the ablities to perform well .
A lack of knowledge in this field is equal with a lack oxigen in a body whitch results immediatly into death or unability to bring up important resaerch results .
