I agree with the statement that successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well .
In my opinion , people do feel bore by doing the same things what they alreay know .
I always try to learn to do new things and divert my knowledge in different things to improve my knowledge .

For example scientists , always try to do new things and implements new thougts to find out some thing new to this world .
I really like their hard word and during these processes they also face many risks but they wont give up their work and finallly they will acheive their goal .
If people going to scare because of the risks and if they follow the same thing that they already know then they would not go ahead in their lives .
We have to think a bit forward in this competative world and we have to prove our self , for this we have to do some thing new without scaring for the risks .

At present we are in a successful world and we are enjoying this one because of many peoples hard work .
Many scientists and many politians doing their best and introducing many things and pollicies which were helping us to live comfortably .
After learning one thing perfectly people have to learn new thing without satisfying with the single thing , then only we can able to elaborate our knowledge in different kind of fields .

Finally i conclude that people , in any field have to learn the process of exploring new things without satisfying with their existing knowledge , and in his process they could also face many difficult situations , many risks but they dont have to stop their work and finally they must achieve their goal and become successful people .
