Ever since grade school , teachers have taught us facts about many different subjects , either important historical dates we have to remember , basic mathematics that we will use for the rest of our lives or important aspects of nature and the places we live in ; all facts that we have learned by heart and that will never change , we can always relay on them .
However , what really influences and determines someone 's life , intelectually speaking , is if someone understands an idea or a concept .

Unlike facts , ideas are not always the same , they may vary depending on the person 's undestanding , compared to someone else .
The same idea can be interpreted in different ways , depending on many aspects , like the person 's education , his background , etc .
Facts , like dates , are not influenced by these factors , they remain always the same .

Concepts are also not facts .
They way people aply different concepts is never exactly the same , although similar , for example in art .
The concept established about a certain art movement is already determined , nevertheless , not all art works belonging to the same movement are the same , they each reflect the way the author thinks , his feelings and his perception of the world .

To really appreciate how much knowledge a student has , one must focus on the way they understand and use ideas and concepts rather than by testing how much the can learn by heart .
To learn a fact is merelly just to memorize and repeat something someone has already taught us , something that has been written .
Aplying an idea on the other hand is much more complicated than memorizing and repeating ; one must first understand the idea and then put it ` to practice ' , so to speak .
This idea may already be written , but that does not mean it is a fact .
The way one aplies or explains an idea , not repeat , shows if an idea was understood or not , thus showing how capable a student really is .
