Many people might say that advertisments are lies , well i see it diferently .
i think advertising something is selling it to you in a gold tray .
It makes people say that advertisers are selling something that does n't exist , but is not true .

People might think that this are a bunch of lies because making something prettier when its not and just doing it because you want to sell it means that the person that did the job lied , but almost every time , advertising companies do things that they believe .

Advertisements might some of the time make things look better , but they just give you a different , prettier , better idea and taste from the one you already had .

Advertisments usually represent what the person that did it was feeling or wanted to have .

In my opinion , advertisements are always to help you choose something over something else that might be better , or just the same .
but i always think .
the prettier the better .
and if companies put so much effort on doing it well , it has to be good ! .
