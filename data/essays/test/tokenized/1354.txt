Advertising is the new industry ruling our economies .
The technologic advances in the telecommunication and media makes the advertisements available to vast populatios , hence more effective .
Incredible amounts of money spent each and every year to produce and publish advertisements on newspapers , televisions , bilboards and so on .

This expansion in the advertisement industry is because it is understood by large firms that how easy it is to change the attitudes or demands of the peolple by use of colorful , interesting slogans and pictures .
Unfortunately , most of these colorful and entertaining advertisements are full of lies .

First of all the effects of the products are exagrated most of the times .
We see on the tv that a detergent can wash away all kinds of dirt and remnants with only submerging the clothes in to the water .
We get amazed by this news , run to a super market , buy a package of that detergent but eventually we are disappointed by the resulting stains on our clothes .
We understand that it is no different than other similiar detergents .
Ofcourse , they are not .
But the producers have to differantiate their products somehow and make the customers choose their products rather than millions of similiar products on the shelfs of the supermarkets .
This effort can be understandable .
In my opinion the customers have the responsibility to be aware of such possibility and be more concious .

On the other hand , the ingredients of the products are altered , too .
This is a much more important issue and very dangerous for users .
The effects can sometimes be exagrated but lying about the ingredients of a product can cause harm to users for example having alergies to certain foods or products .

Finally , legal restrictions and strict rules must be applied about advertising by the government to prevent the misleading information about the products in media .
The right of correct information of the customers must be granted .

In conclusion , customers should be careful about what they expect and what they will receive while watching the advertisements .
They should be aware that nothing in reality would be as attractive as on televisions or magazines .
