The statement is not completely true that `` young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities '' .
I am a very responsible person towards the society .
I agree that there are irresponsible people towards thier society .

Like for example , i am a member of a blood group camp which is held monthly .
I go to differrent places with the camp and serve many people who are in need .
And i donate my blood every month due to lack of avalibility of blood .
Mainly , students should feel responsible towards there country by helping people .
Due to lack of communication between the society and students , they are ignoring and unable to find the right needs for the society .
There are different communties by which people can serve there nation .
Like joining blood banks , keeping there surroundings clean and tidy , following traffic rules by preventing accidents .

And people dont want to come by themselves , someone have to start something .
Who will this someone ?
that someone have to be every individual in the society .
Some people wants to help the society they dont care whether they get any money or not .
But some are so concerned but there personal life , they forget the duities of a citizen .
Every citizen have to feel responsible and have to think in a postive way towards there society .
For example , in india people are not at all worried about the problems happening in and around us .
They think why should we care for them , as they are not my family member .
And people get corrupted for doing wrong things and they hurt the people living in the society and even they can kill a preson for the money .

So i conclude that young people are responsible but they have to be reminded by the society .
And the responsibility for the young people towards the society should not go down and they have the right to protest , if anything goes wrong and encourage the society for forming more communities to serve there country much better .
