It has been said that most advertisements make producs seem much better than they really are .
I agree with this statement for the following reasons .

First , the product company want to get more profit from their products .
The product company need sufficient profit from their product to compensate thier cost to produce it .
It is necessary for the product company to promote selling the new product .
Therefore , the product company have the advertising company to make an attractive advertisements , even if it contains the misleading statement .
I have worked for a Japanese advertising company for about 6 years .
One of our client is a pharmasutical company .
They produce not only the medicine but also the supplement .
The supplement is the top selling product that bring a lot of profit to the company .
The client always care about the sales of supplement and always says `` Make good advertisement '' .
This `` good '' means that they want us to create good looking advertisement to earn more profit .
Therefore , we sometimes create the advertisement that seems much better than the product really are .

Second , The situation that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are is caused by the nature of advertisement .
The advertisement has its own purpose to make the product more attractive .
Therefore , I think its even natural the contents of advertisement is better than that of real product .
When it comes to the reason why the advertisement need , there is no doubt that the product company and advertisement company want to sell the product more and more .
It is not the consumer who asked the advertising company to create the advertisement .
If the advertisement says that there is a lot of but points of this product , that is no longer advertisement .

In conclusion , the company pursue thier profit from the products and the purpose of advertisement is to make the apperance of the product good .
I definitelly agree with the statement .
