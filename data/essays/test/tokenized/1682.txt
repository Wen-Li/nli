traveling in a group led by a tour guide is not the best way to travel .
when you travelthe idea is to meet a lot of places anda have fun with new experinces and not have and scheduale that may not satisfy your expectations .

having a groupal traveling would be more sucesful by their own , and the reason for that is that they would take the time for meeting the places they would like to meet , for example it you are in a group led by a tour guide you would meet a lot of places but you should not enjoy them because there is not enough time to expend on the place you prefer or the experience you would take can not be tha wanted .

the scheduale planed in a guided tour can not be modify so you would not learn or have the chance to meet new cultures because the contact with tnatives would be none taking out the oportunity to enjoy the travel by knowing the normal life its live at the country you are in.for example when you travel on a guided group you usually would be acompain by people of you country , so you always are going having the same enviroment and probably you sholud nt have contac with others arround you .
