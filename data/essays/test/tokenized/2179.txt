Which one is more important for students ?
To understand ideas and concepts or to learn facts ?
According to my experiences as a student and my working experiences .
I will definitely choose the second one of more importance which is learning facts .

First of all , We need to discuss what is the basic mission of the student ?
For me , Getting more paritical knowledge and information is my basic mission .
Take my major as an example , my major is international economy and trade , I need to learn a lot of methods to handle international business in the real world .
However , almost all of the ideas and concepts in my major are not paritical or out of date .
On the other side , Our professors gave me a lot of real stories which happended in the bussiness world and Its benifits to me .
Why these stories and examples are so useful for me ?
It is truth and fact .
It gave me a best way to know about the bussiness models and bussiness methods .

Secondly , Why I hold that learning facts is more important than understand ideas and concepts is that some of the ideas and concepts in the text book or told by teachers may not right .
We can see a lot of ideas and concepts already been approved as incorrect ot limlited .
After the time pass by , there are many new ideas and concepts will be creat and raise out .
But the facts will not change so easily .
It has more values to be learned .

Thirdly , The process of understanding the ideas and concepts is totally different from the process to learn facts .
Students will use of their brain to think , discuss , develop when they learning facts sinice it will bring them much more spaces .
But when they try to understand ideas and concepts , They just persuade them to believe something belong to other people .
They will lost some power of creation and innovation which stdudents should have .

Based on below reasons , I insist that learning facts is more imporant than understanding ideas and concepts .
