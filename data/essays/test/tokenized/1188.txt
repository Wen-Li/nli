Do advertisements make products much better than what they really are ?
Yes of course !
I agree with the statement .
Let me line up the reasons and explanations why I agree with the issue at hand .

Advertisements in fact influences people to buy the products that are being advertised .
Moreover , these days in television shows or serials most of the time that is spent is for advertising the products .
Few channels are just for advertisements .

I do not really say that advertising is something wrong , but it should not exaggerate the real quality of the product .
Most of the people are unaware of this exaggeration shown in advertisements and would generally be tempted to try out the product .
But it is once they use it then they will know the real quality of the product .
By the time they realize it , they must have spend lot of money on that .
In case of rich people who just want to try out various upcoming products it does not matter , but in case of middle class families it is quite a waste if they spend on worthless product which has been exaggeratedly advertised as a very good and useful product .

Recently I saw one advertisement which I can say is the maximum of the exaggeration I have ever seen .
It is the advertisement whish uabout a teeth whitener , which shows the persons who chew it can go in to the darker regions without light , using their teeth as light and also they are showing these persons are used as street lights .
This is the exaggeration of what it really does .
It might help in whitening the teeth , but it can never be used as light as such .
My niece was asking me the next day to buy that product , so that we need not use lights and can go to darker places with out the help of light .
I struggled in explaining her the fact as she is too young to understand .

I can still remember that day when a person in our colony bought a juicer that have been advertised by some local company at very low price .
It has been advertised to have different kinds of aplications like cutting vegetables , making juices with all kind of fruits with out even peeling their skin etc .
But once he bought then only they came to know that it 's not that worth to spend that much amount of money in buying that .
They faced difficulty in using that juicer and moreover it is not the way they exaggeratedly advertised it .

So I strongly agree with the statement that most of the advertisements make products seem much better and exaggerate than what they really are .
