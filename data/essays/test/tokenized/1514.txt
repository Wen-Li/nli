First of all , I 'd like to say that I am a student , I am 22 years old and I consider myself one of the young people that I 'm going to write about .
I do not totally disagree with the opinion that young people today tend not to dedicate some of their time to helping their community , but I think that this happens for a reason .
The following reasons and examples support this opinion .

Firstly , I think that a lot of young people do their best both to be good at school and to do services for the community , but it is true that they also give importance to staying with their friends and having fun .
Maybe , something that differs from the past is the amount of time that is dedicated to this purpose .
Until a few years ago , there was no television , no videogames : the family and the community played a more central role in the everyday life of a child or of a teenager .
Nowadays there are so many leisure activities directed to young people that they tend to prefer to spend their time playing with their playstations rather than volunteering in an hospital .

Another point that I would like to make is that young people do have a lot of things to do .
For instance , they are expected to get good marks at school , to do well in their sports team , and often at the end of the day they prefer to just relax .
However , I see around me a lot of teenagers helping in activities such as entertaining the elderly , helping in keeping the neighbourhood clean , organizing activities for the community .
Recently in my town a group of youngsters has organized a little association that aims at helping people that want to stop using drugs .

Sometimes I think that adults ask a lot from young people of my generation , without realizing that they are already doing their best for themselves and to improve the world around them .
