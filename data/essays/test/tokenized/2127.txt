Understanding ideas and concepts are more important than learning fact for the students .
Why ?
In school , some students are very good at history or biology but not in math or physics .
It might be that the students like to memorize facts rather than understanding idea .
It is not true that people who are good in math , also are good in biology .
However there are some relations between understanding ideas and just learning facts .

I would like to give an example in my home country , In Korea , the students are good in math generally , and those students are good at solving tricky questions .
However , the students are good at only memorizing have very hard time in school or after they graduate .
In Asia , the teachers in school force to memorize the texts and formulas , then students have to memorize them because they should prepare for the test .
How about in western countries ?
Their questions are little different from the questions in asian school .
They make questions as students should think the ideas and concepts .

Therefore , the students learn how to think , speak and reach to the final answer .
If the students who understand ideas and concept meet unfamiliar problems , it is fine to them because they already learn how to solve the problem .

I was in Korea until grade 10 and came to Canada as a international student .
When i wasa in Korea , I memorized a lot of information in the text especially examination period and after that I forgot
