Generally speaking , there are two approaches to the learning process , detailed memorization of facts , and understanding of the ideas , concepts , relationships and consequences behind the facts .
Although both or valid learning methods , and even required methods , the most valuable learning experience , in my opinion , is the latter .

There are many reasons to support this statement .
First , understanding ideas and concepts requires the knowledge of the facts .
In other words , the second approach includes the first approach , although the emphasis might not be on the memorization .
Indeed , in many cases the details are important to draw general conclusions , thus , the ability to retain important facts is implicitely required and developed .
Secondly , it implies a broader use of intelligence , or the use of all the different types of intelligence .
Indeed , this method encourages critical analysis , creativity , assertiveness and sinthesis skills .
AlI this skills are relevant not only for the subject studied , but for any subject , in any environment , and in any stage of life .
Thirdly , simple memorization of facts is often a short term learning experience , because the facts are often forgotten within a very short period of time .
That is specially true in these days , were information is so accesible through different sources .
The understanding of ideas and concepts , on the contrary , is usually less precarious in time .
Finally , I can think on one additional very important , advantage of the learning process based on understanding ideas .
It is more fun for the students , and even more fun ( although more demanding ) for the teachers .
Not only the subjects are more interesting , also the teaching methods can be more creative and adaptative than a lecture aimed at memorizing facts .

In conclusion , learning through the understanding of ideas and concepts allows a much broader understanding of the subject , a long lasting knowledge of it , and the development of important skills that will be needed not only for a final exam , but throughout life .
