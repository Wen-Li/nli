What do people think of in the first place when they intent to travel ? .
Propably they think wether they sould travel alone or they travel in a group and have a tour guide .
In may opinion , traveling in a group with a tour guide is way better than traveling alone .
There are several good reasons why I prefere that .
First , doing so provied better opertunty to see as much sights as avilable .
Second , being in a group more enjoyable .
Finaly , we do not have to cry the responesablty of the traveling arrangment .

Having a tour guide who awars of the cuntrey landmarks , provied great chance to viste these places .
The tour guid can recomment the most popular and wonderful places in order to vist .

Moreover , you can benft from the tour guid experence to know where you can god and where is the best placce that suit your interested .

What about if you intent to travel alone without a mat , how could you enjoy your time ? .
Simply , you can travel with a group led by tour guide .
Furthermore , you can meet know people maybe from different cultuer and enjoy your time with them .
In this way you can make lots of relationship .
There are comman say that `` Traveling boarden the maind '' .
You can achive that by traveling with group from onther culture .

If you with a tour guide , you do not have to worry about the trips ' arangment he will do that for you .

All at all , what ever people say about enjoying the freedome traviling alone .
I recomment every body to travel with group and enjoy evrery single moment .
