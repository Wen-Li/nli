What is an advertisementds ?
What is adverstising ?
It helps companies to sell there product .
Thanks to this , there are able to compete with other firms , to battle against their rivals and show which product is the best or at least to make you think so .

`` Most advertisements make products seem much better thant they really are '' .

I will start my response by saying yes , i do agree with this statement .
Most commercial wants you to think that you will never find the same product anywhere else , that this is the one .
In order to make you think so they but an enormous budget into advertising .
To make it look like a movie for example where you could perfectly picture yourself in .
Lets take the example of a food product or a beverage , they make it look like it is a real extase as if you never felt such a sensation before .
The problem is , it might tempt you but i dought you will feel the same as they show you on an advertisement .

On the contrary i partially agree with this statment .
I think companies canot lie to the public , of course they probably exagerate a bit , sometimes a lot , but they have to sell their product .
That is the reason why i would say that they do n't allways seem much better than they really are but it 's just a question of taste .

Companies main purpuses are to aim a certain public that is likely to consum their product .
People who like a certain product and its advertisement will remenber it and in consequence buy it .

Therefore
