`` I 'm Loving it '' That was the slogan for the Mcdonalds .
On tv , in magazines , on Billboards all they showed was this slogan and how tastey the food looked like .
How yellow the fries were , and how clean there kitchen was .
But , what they do n't show is what ggoes on behind the scense .
What they do n't show is that the chicken burger is not just pure chicken from a breast or a thigh of a chicken but actually her beek and fingers and skin all mixed in together .
Mcdonalds is a worldwide community that makes millions of dollars each year .
The advertisments that are made about it shows it to be the most delcious , most water dropping meal ever !
It makes the person looking at the advertisment rush to the restraunt and order all the best !
One of the most important figures thatn helps with thier advertismnt with children is there famous clown .
Children can certanilly not read .
But , when they see a clown , like the one in Mcdonalds with colorful hair and a yellow jumpsuit , they get all excited hoping and wishing that he would be proud of them if they eat a meal .
Another product that makes you want to rush to the supermarket after watching the advertisment on TV is the Pepsi commercial .
It makes it seem like when a person drinks pepsi he suddenly is God !
With the energy he gest after drinking it , and the celbrities he meets after drinking , it certanilly makes it worhtwhile .
So , as i stated before those two examples clearly show and prove that most advertisments make products seem much better than they really are .
Unfortuantley , that is the whole point of advertising .
If a product looks exactly like the way it is on TV and in real life no noe will get juiccied up to buy it !
