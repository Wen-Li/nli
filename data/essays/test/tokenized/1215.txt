I completely agree with the statement .
There are numerous examples in history that show that successful people have taken risks to achieve their goals .

One prominent example is the development of air travel .
There had been numerous failed attempts by people at attempting to use objects that enabled man to fly .
But that did not deter the Wright brothers .
Inspite of the knowledge of the risks involved , they went ahead with their attempts .
They were ultimately able to engineer the first successful flight recorded by mankind .
That led to the development of the advanced system of air travel that we have today .
Had the Wright brothers not taken the risk there would never have been air travel .
And mankind would still have relied on the old and relatively inefficent mode of travel .

Another example that I can cite closer to my family is the success that my uncle achieved in the real estate business .
My uncle was an engineer and had a paid job at an engineering firm .
He was a good engineer but it did not satisfy his urge to earn a lot of money and be successful .
He started to invest some of his savings in the real esatate business .
Over a period of few years he was able to get a good return on his investment .
He figured that although he had benefited from the investment it would take a long time for him to earn significant amount of money by making such small investments .
He decided to take a big risk .
He decided to invest all his savings ( including selling some of his precious family belongings ) into real estate .
Many of his friends advised him against taking such a step .
However , he decide to take the risk and went ahead to buy couple of good properties .
Within a year he was able to sell the two properties from double its original cost .
Encouraged by his success he invested the entire money again in buy more properties .
In a span of 5 years he took major risks and made a fortune .
After that he started taking very calculated risks , making sure that even if his investments were not successful , it would have little or no effect on his fortune .

My uncle is now a very rich and successful man .
He would not have reached his current status if he had not taken risk and had continued with low paying job of an engineer .

The above examples prove without the a doubt the truth in the statement .
