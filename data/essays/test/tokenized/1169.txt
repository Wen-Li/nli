I 'm always amazed when hearing people claiming the significat advantages of travelling in groups .
Even one did not know much concrete unpleasure stuff accompanied by such way of travelling from his or her own experience , he or she could have deduced it from common sense .
Just take a glimpse at those people in goups , you may find all the defects related to this way of travelling -- terrible limitations , constant shopping and , inevitably , a higher cost .

I first went to London in a tour goup at the age of 9 , which was organized my school .
The trip was indeed exciting for a young boy .
However , there were still some unpleasant things which I 'll never forget .
Every morning , we were supposed to get up at 7 o'clock and get to the designated place in order to attend a ` tour goup ' even if we kids usually played late at night and hardly had any sleep .
But any concerns for our precious ` sleep time ' were neglected , simply for the reason , said the grown-ups , ` keep up with the schedule ' .
What a terrible thing it would be to ` keep up with the schedule ' when you were right enjoying the vast sight on the London Eye ?
What a vexing thing it would be to leave the Westminster Church only stayed for minutes in order to ` keep up the schedule which is often required when travelling in a goup .
I could have enjoyed more if I had travelled by myself .

In addition , travellers may usually get afflicated by the tour guides ' endless ` amiable ' suggestions to buy some ` unique ' and ` worthy ' souveniors which are ubiqutously meaningless and expensive .
Motivated by their words , you may easily begin the process that changing you should-be-happy trip into a shopping mall !
I do still rememble how many useless things I bought in Manchester and Leeds which almost got me crazy .

Moreover , it seems that the cost of a tour guide will never be cheap .
Regardless of the possiblity that you 're decieved , usually a tour guide will still cost a lot .
On the other hand , travelling by you self would help you to save up this cost and spend it where you like .

As the doubt of ` individual tour ' has claimed , we travellers can hardly enjoy those tourist points without the leading of an experienced guide .
However , they have neglected the pre-eminet use of the books and Internet .
Having read the maps and inroductions about the destination , one can boldly go to where he wants .
Perhaps the guiders may even know less than the books can tell !

Now , start a trip of your own , after having a nice search on ` Google Maps ' ?
