I agree with the following statement that `` Successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they know how to do well '' .

Firstly according to my opinion successful people are those people who have became successful by not just doing the same thing which they had already done or known to them earlier but by doing different , challanging and creative things which has made them successful .
Sucessful people always keep on changing their atitudes and sense of work as per the situation , their decession are not rigid they are very inspirastional , useful and motivative .

Secondly succesful people always have the thirst of doing new things and ready to take the task no matter the amount of risk involved in it because they always have an positive attitude towards doing new things and challanging tasks , they always come up with new ideas and things that can be used to be more famous and successful , they always keep on thinking of getting new ideas and startegy in doing a new task which will not only help others in many ways but also also help them in getting recognisition and more successl .

Thirdly successful people are intelligent and smart they think differently from others and are always ready to take up challanges that comes in their way and always keep a postive attitude in order to acheive them which helps them to become more successful , they are always ready to accept new and challanging task with an aim to achive it , they never use the same old strategy or ideas which they had already used but rather keep on getting new ideas and strategy that can used to complete the task .
One of the example is the Late Mr. Dhirubhai Ambani pioneers of Reliance Industry and one of the richest and successful person in India

The main goal of the Successful person is to keep on searching new things and ideas rather then considering the same old pattern which the had known earlier because considering new things and ideas will not only help them in various means but also to other which again in turn benfit themselves in return .

Thus accorinding to me Succesful people are always in a huger for searching new things ideas and ready to take risks to become more and more successful .
