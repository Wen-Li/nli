Human life has differnt stages .
Student life is one of the stages in the human life .
We can know about more things in this stage .
We can experience major incidents at this stage only .
The student life include studies , understanding the facts and understanding the ideas and concepts .
I Strongly disagree with the statement that states `` It is more importent for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts '' .

A fact is true statement .
Students should learn about facts .
I learned about so many facts .
Firstly i learned about earth rotation around the sun , This is a fact .
By learning about this fact i got some doubts in mind that How much time it will take to complete full rotation ?
and also i learned many things by this fact , for example How day and night are coming ?
and lot more .

Secondly i learned about a fact that `` energy is neither destroyed nor created .
Energy can converted into different forms '' .
By knowing this fact i came to knew that how thermal energy is converted into electrical energy and how mechanical energy can converted into kinetic energy .
I learned these pionts by observing electricity and various machines those are underwork .
This is the fact that thought me how to learn .

Thirdly i know the fact `` Light is one form of energy that can exibit several properties '' .
By knowing this fact i thought in such a way that what are the properties of light and what happens if light is projected on some reflective object .
I can get the properties of the reflective material by studying about facts on light .
I can know about opeque nature of light too .

In conclusion although students must understand ideas and concepts , the student must have learn the facts because facts teaches us how the fact is effects real world , weather in positive way or in negative way .
I strongly believe that students should learn about facts .
