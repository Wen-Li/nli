I agrees to the statement that `` Successful people try new things and take risks rather than doing what they already know how to do well '' .
There are various examples marked in history which establishes the above statement .
Trying new things open new horizons , one has to take risk to be successful and to minimise the errors old ways are always ameliorated or replaced by new things .

Trying new things open new horizons and with vast new horizon one has a better possibility to grow and becoming successful .
Take an example of cellular phones .
That was a new invention and a new thing for every individulal .
And now its an unavoidable part of one 's success .
The fastest access to communication provided by cellular panones created a havoc in business world , health industry & etc .
The organization which are entirely dependent on the old days phone system are deteorating simillarly people who have n't tried cell phones are lacking an important way of communication and hence are not successful .

Success is associated with the risk .
Even a s a child one has to take a risk to learn new things required to succeed in day to day life .
If I have n't gathered the courage of holding a bicycle I could n't be able to ride it .
The risk which I took at an early age helped me in learning car driving .
The racing car drivers are more popular and successful than me in racing world since , they took the risk of practising fast driving on race track .
Once success is directly proportional ti the amount of risk one is willing to take to acheive some thing .

Old ways are always not the best ways though , they are well tested and we followed them over a long time .
But to minimize the error in a process new ideas and things are always tested .

I will try new things and take risks to succed in my life rather than not taking and trying new things .
