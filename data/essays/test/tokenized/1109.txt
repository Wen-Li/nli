The education systems or education boards in most of the countries encourage ( most of the time without wanting to ) student to learn facts instead of understand ideas and concepts .
I strongly dissagree with that method of teaching students .
The student should be abble after graduating to use their brain to look at situations from another perspective and reasonably find a solution to a problem in the working enviroment or how I will call it `` the real world '' .
In the academic world with the educational system of the countries have the promote the students to learn facts of just memorize answer to pass the the test and the forget it all .

A person that it is capable to reason a topic instead of just memorazing facts about it , will have to study fewer time or prepare for a test in a more calmly way , whereas the one who just memorize the subject has to study a large ammount of time so his brain can storage the information .
Besides that employers will rather hire a employee whose grades were not that good but he can solve problems just by thinking throught it , that having a employee whose grades were excellent but he can not solve a problem as simply as the other one .

The real world it is much more than just facts , is using the brain and feed it with ideas and concepts and thinking about it through .
That is way I think the education boards on each country should prepare and give the student 's brain tools to really think and face the real world .
A change needs to be made if we want to have success people and reasonable person in our every day enviroment and it all beging whit the tipe of education we give them .
