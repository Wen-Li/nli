I disagree to the statement .
I understand that company watnt to get attension from many people to promote thier product .
Once they are in the mega competition .
They have to defeat thier rival to make profit than others .

If they fail in making profit .
The company will over .
However If we looking at consumer side .
I think consumer is usually little knowlewge about the product .
So it hard to understand about it perfectly .
These kind of advertisement cause misunderstanding to the custmers .
I therefore consumer should be give the precise information about any product to carry out thier consume effectivery with no trouble .

Accodding to this my oppinion , company advertisement can be restricted .
I want to add one thing , Althrough I mensioned about restriction of the company side .
It seems me that responsibilty is not going to only the company .
Even the consumer should have attitude to get ability of distingusih which information is right , once we are in huge information in the daily life .
Otherwise we can not point out the worng things with company .
Which means we have to clever to against commercalism in the business .
