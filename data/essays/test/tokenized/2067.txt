Some people thinks that it is better to have a broad knozlegde of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject .
As far i 'm concerned , I prefer the second statement , In my essay i wil begin to explain my opinion and its limits in the studies and then i will discuss this question in the daily life .

First of all , i have a such opinion because I exactly what I want to do in my life .
from the on , I learn all I can in the field and I do n't see why I 'm going to choose several different subject whereas i can focus on what I like .

Futhermore my field of interrest , which is biology , in very huge .
So I have a lot of things to learn if I want to know everything about it .
However , this statement have some limits .
Indeed , if a person if not sure about what he want to do in his life , he ca n't focus on one subject because , one day he will find his way and if he was n't in the appropriate field of studies , he will be very disappointed .
So to avoid this situation when you do n't know exactly what 's your way you had to choose the most general way .

In the daily life it is better , of course , to have a broad knowledge on many academic subjects .
As a result , your are more abble to help others people such as your children .

As a conclusion , I think that it better when you like something to do it even if you can be in the zrong way
