It can be interesting to try to respond to the following question : `` Is it better to have a broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject '' .
I ' ll try to give few examples of my personal experience .

One the one hand , I think it 's important to have a solid generalistic basis , because we are able to solve a great lot of problems and we are much more smarter .
Our jobs often demand us to have broad knowledge in very different subjects , so it is important to have solid basis in many academic subjects .

But one the other hand , it 's obvious that specialists are very important to our society .
The first example I will develop is the doctors .
Generalists are necessary to make a first diagnostic of what we suffer , but they are not enough qualified in many situations .
For example , when whe have auditive problems , whe have to go to an auditive specialist because the generalist can not help us .
It is the same for view or skins problems .

The second example I want to bring about is the teachers .
Teachers with a broad knowledge are very usefull for teaching the young ones in the beginning of their scolarity .
But since we decide to make long studies , we have to be taught by teachers which are specialized in a subject .
For example , a general teacher can not taught you complex algebra or differential equations because he does not have learn to teach it .
When you are studying in order to become class teacher , you are learning a great lot of subjects .
So you have not the time to develop a particular subject , such as partial equations in mathematics .

As a conclusion , I think that it is important for everybody to have solid basis in many academic subjects , but specialists are necessary in our society .
