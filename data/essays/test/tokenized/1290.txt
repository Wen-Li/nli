Some people believe that learning facts is more important , however I have a different opinion .
There are several reasons to support that understanding ideas and concepts are more vital to the studends .

First of all , Based on the ideas and concepts , they could figure out how to process in any field in spite of any fact .
Also they could get more specific information such as facts thorugh group activities like team projects but not alone because they hardly confer the ideas and concepts only by the facts .

In addition , those ideas and concepts make them understood not only in one field where those can be apply to but also in another one with the process of understanding .
Even they coud know whether it is correct or not by proving the the ideas and concepts in some group activties like discussions and arguments .

Finally , applying to other fields with the ideas and concepts could give them some ability such as imagination and creativity to develop new ideas .

Therefore I strongly agree the statement because it is necessary for them to learn more in any field .
Through understanding the ideas and concepts .
they could develop new , better ideas
