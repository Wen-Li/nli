Personally , i agree with statement that most advertisements make products seem much better that they really are .

The reasons for my opinion are several and i will attempt to explain some by means of examples contained in the subsequent part of my essay .

In general , the main purpose for an advertisement is to promote a brand or selling the particular product featured therein .
This motive might prompt the need to portrait a product in a way that will make it more suitable to customers ' interest .

In fact , it is not unusual to note that advertisements set a product in an ideal environment or situation .

Various advertisements employ notorious figures , for example a well know actor or sportsman , in order to put forward a positive image of a particular brand or product .
The host will naturally inspire confidence in the particular product and thus facilitate its purchaise .
Rarely such advertisements focus more specifically on the feature of the product , because the customers ' interest has been already solicited by the host .

The format of an advertisements can also be used in order to solicit the perstective customer 's attention or interest .
A simple example could be that of a TV advertisement featuring an anti-age cream , showing in rapid sequence the alleged beneficial effects deriving from the long term use of such cream without pairing it with a objective assessment , scientific or medical as it might be , of the effective benefit deriving from the use of the cream .

In addition , advertisements might also specifically target certain areas of the population or age groups .
An example in this sense could be that of a car portraied as being particularly fast and fashionable , thus attracting the interest of young people , while avoiding to focus on the vehicle 's cost or possible inefficiencies .

For these reasons i am of the opinion that advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .
