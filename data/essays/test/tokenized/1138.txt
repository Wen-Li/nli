There is controversy whether most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .
Some people disagree with the statement because they can get the useful information about new products .
However , I strongly believe that advertisements cause many harmful effects to consumer and nation for following two reasons .
First , many companies make their commecial fiction so exaggerated .
Also , those companies and advertisements stimulate people to buy the unnecessary products .

Above all , most advertisements give unaccurate information consumers .
Nowdays , many compaies would like to present their products more better than rearlity .
Of course , they make miss information and exaggerate in order to sale more their items .
People usually believe those advertisements without any doubts .

There are numerous kinds of commecial films .
Those films mostly show the good situation and advantages .
For example , the medicine advertisement stresses their beneficail effects .
However , those medicines also have many unknowalbe side effects .
Consumer are decieted easily and do not try to recognize these medicines 's other harmful influence such as get weight and skin troubles .
Simiarly , consumer shoud study and research products that they want to buy because , there are many misunderstand commercial films .

In this sense , a large amount of advertisements make consumer poor .

In additions , a great wealth of advertisements stimulate people desire to expense unnecessary objects .
Every people like to buy new products that they need .
However , thesedays , society are made over consuming by many advertisements .
Odds are that people consume and spend their a lot money without any thoughts while they see the advertisement on the televisions .

According to the recent study released by the Korean National Research center , more over two thirds of surveyed people respondence that they easily buy products that air on the mass media .
Based on the study they believe masmedia and their advertisements , so cost the price of products that they do not need .

This study points out that advertisemts motivate people 's mind to consume .
In this regard , advertisements cause people waste their money .
