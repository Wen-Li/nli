I do not agree with the statement that it is better to have a broad knowledge than to specialize in one specific subject .

On the one hand , it is really useful and reasonable to know something about everything .
We live in a society and an environment that we can not neglect .
Thus , everyone should have an idea of what goes on today , for example in politics or economics , but also what happened in the past , because that directly effects one 's personal life .

Furthermore , it depends on the particular person and his profession .
If you are a politician for instance , you are supposed to have good knowledge about everything , just to be able to have an opinion and to be able to find the right decisions for different problems with a good background knowledge .

On the other hand , you can not say that it is better to have a broad than a specific knowledge .
The reasons for that are abvious : First , during your life you are confronted with different problems and you automatically build up knowledge about the subjects that are associated with them .
You have to specialize to be able to cope with these problems .

Second , to become professional in a particular job you have to focus on a subject .
It does not matter if you are familiar with history when you stand in a laboratory and want to find out how a cell functions .

Third , I am of the opinion that people should concentrate on what they like and love to deal with .
They should not find out things just to know much about everything .
You have to enjoy what you do .
Besides , if you specialize on one subject , you have the ability to improve and get to know more and more and that is what makes life so interesting .

As a conclusion I can say that people should have both broad knowledge and deeper knowledge in specific subjects .
