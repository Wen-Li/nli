Being successful in our life is the most important thing .
Everybody should have enough power to try to do new things or to take risks .

First of all , if a person wants to be successful in his life , he must have interests and should look for new things to learn .
Being successful means being passionate about something .
You need to be attracted about new things .
A teacher in geography , for example , will need to be always interested in geography news but not just for himself but also for his students .
He will be successful and proud when he will know that he can answer to student 's questions .

Second , there is another way to be successful .
People have some goals and some projects and they need to attend them .
Attending his goals mean being happy but mean also taking risks .
For example , if someone is working in a company , since 7 years , and he is bored .
He should try to find a better and more interesting job .
He will take risks when he will change it but he will be proud of himself , and he will learn a lot of new things .
Attending his goals is the best grateful thing that you can do for yourself .

However , there are some negative things about being successful or trying to attend his goals .
First of all , you need to manage your knowledge .
It 's really good to be interested in everything but you have to try to not border everybody with your knowledges .
Second , if someone is taking risks for his goals , it 's possible that he wo n't be successful and it could be dramatic .
For example , if a person quit his job , it 's possible that he wo n't find something .
Therefore , peolple need to be careful when they want to take risks because it could be dangerous .

In conclusion , I think everybody should take risks or try to learn new things but we must find the correct way to do it but not over-do something .
