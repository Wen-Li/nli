From my point of view , .
the reasons for this is because it is easier to learn and specialize in one subjet rather than many different ones .
if you already know what area of work you would like to be working in the future than it would be better to concentrate on the particular subject that relates to it .
having a braod knowlege is good but not necceseraly usefull .
by concentrating on the specific subjet that relates to the area of work you will be in the future gives you a great advantage of learning everything there is to know about that specific subject and be the best at it .
Broad knowledge of different academic subjects is good and useful for during the eraly stages of your life .
when you are at school , you do n't have a choice of what subject you want to study .
you learn and study different academic subjects up to high school or up to the time you are really sure of what subject you want to specialize in and work in for the rest of your life .
having knowledge of many academic subjects , although not perfect in all of them is essential to specializing in one specific subject as every academic subject is linked in a way .
for example , you might know everything about geography but if you do n't know anything about maths then you wo n't be able to work in that area as it requires a certain knowlege of maths .
i would say that moderate knowledge of may academic subjects is needed to acheive a specialization in a particular subject .
