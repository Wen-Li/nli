in the live of every days most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .
today the people prefer to choose the product more beauty or less expensive .
the organizations sometime to raise thier money they sell goods and products which seem much better than they realy are .
indeed the important for many organization is not the quality of the products but only its cost .

For example , many organizations which sell vegetables and fruits use many no natural products to improve their immage .
These no natural products as all no natural products , are not safety at 100 % , but sometime this is not underline so the immage of the vegetables and fruits seem much better than it really is .

Another example is the selling of the cars .
Many companies sell cars which are made by no good components and they sell them as if they have made with good components .
Also in this case , the companies prefer to sell products which seem much better than they really are .

I belive that the main problem is the decision of the people .
Today the people do n't analyse the real value of the things .
In this mode the seller to try to sell products seem much better than they really are .
So is most advertisements make products no too good .

I think that the people should think and analyse the real value of the things .
