Nowadays , there are more and more people select travelling as their relax way , and the tourinism is greatly developed with a rapid speed .
Some people assert that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide .
However , I thinks this statment is too hasty to be made .
I think the best travelling method is various for different people .
During the trip , some people want to go alone , while others perfer to travl in a group led by a tour guide .
The choices is basned on their personality , experiences and characrastices .
As far as I am concerned , I prefer to plan the travelling by myself and go to travel using my own plan rather than to follow a tour guide .
My selection will be greatly substantiated by the following reasons .

In the first place , an important reason for me to choose this statment is that I want to plan the travelling by myself .
Usually , before the trip , I will try to find some introductions about the destination from labrary , Internet and friends .
I will learn which park is most beautiful in that city , which street have shopping malls , and so on .
I will even study the local weather , local culture and local special foods .
After such research work before the trip , I can draw a detailed plan based on my own perferance .

In additional , matching the personal travel plan , how to strenghten the personal skill during the trip is also a significant factors considered be me .
If I tavel with a group and am led by a tour guide , I will lost many opportunities to commnuiction with local people , because my activitiy scope are limited in the tour group .
However , I think talking with local people is more interesting for me than visiting some famous building .
I want to know the different life style of different location , and want to learn people 's think in diferent culture .
I think the living memory is more important the the photos which are taken in several famous architecturs .

Admittedly , it should be no denied that travelling with a good tour guide is also a enjoyable thing for me .
Acutally , altough I did many perparation work before the trip , I would probrarily meet some unexpected accidences during the trip .
If there is a tour guide with me , he or she can provide in-time help to me .
On the other hand , a professional tour usually have rich experiences in local , talking with the tour is also a interested thing during the trip .

In conclusion , I do not agree the statment that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide .
Based on the discussions mentioned about , I think I can safely arraive my conclusion .
