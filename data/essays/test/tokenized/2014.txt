as growing up the economical condition and development of transportations such as car , plain , ship , people used to travel where they do not have any experience .
and one of the most important things planning the trip is making their schedule .
however , it is really difficult for common person to schedule their sightseeing .
so many people who have plan to trave try to get a travel agency for grouping and leading by tour guide .
but i disagree with the statement that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide because it is possible that if someine choose group travel , they might miss what they want to do or where they would like to go .

admittedly , leading by travel guide is one of the best way to trip a unfamiliar place because travel guide used to have acquaintance with the cite where the traveler want to go to .
and the group traveling used to give the traveler some economic usfulness because of low prices .

however , it is possible that the traveler incount some problems caused by group traveling such as schedule of visiting place , entertainment at the cite and so on .
for examples , when i went greece and turkey , i led by tour guide with my colleage and my familly .
at then , i really want to fo to gafadokia where are composed by several hundreds of artificial caves because there is one of the seventh myteric remains in the world .
but i could not go there because even though i ask my travel agency and travel guide , they refused my request as a reason why other people did not have any curiosity about the place .

in addition , if someone goes to travel alone , he or she might meet unexpected delights such as new friends , strange experiences which others can not have .
i went to Guam island as honeymoon .
when we arrived in hotel , it was 4:00 AM. as it worse , the next morning schedule would be started at 8:00 AM. we never could not participate the trip even waken up .
so we are isolated from my travel guide and group .
and we went the downtown of Gaum island by cab .
we got a wonderful time which others are never have .
and the experience is one of the most expected occurences my life .

in conclusion , traveling in a group led by a tour guide is just one of good way .
