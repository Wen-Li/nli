What makes a person successful ?
I believed that a successful person is a person that has great a achievements in multiple areas , since a successful person challenges themselfs with tasks that they have n't complete before , for example , Sun Yet San and Jay Chow .

Firsty , Sun Yet San completed his doctoral degree , and was a mdical doctor .
However , he saw the problem that 's occuring with in the government , therefore he came up with several revolutions against the emperor Chin .
He is to be consider as a successful person , since not only he is a medical doctor , yet he is willing to see chance within his country .
Therefore he established revoultionary armies against the emperor , and on the eventh time he succeed .
In this case , Dr. Sun Yet San , not only completed his achievements in medical fields , yet he is willing to try new things and take risks against the emperor .
Therefore , Dr. Sun Yet San is a successful man , since he is willing to takes challenges and risks .

Secondly , Jay Chow , one of the top singer in asia is consider successful since not only did he had great achievements in the musical world , yet he is now challenging himself with movie actings .
He faces many difficult critiques , yet he is willing to overcome those negative comments .
His character had helped him achieve his goal and now not only his is an actor , a singer , but also a movie director .
Jay Chow is willing to take risks from failure but also have gradual challenges in life .
Therefore he is a successful person , because like Sun Yet San , he is willing to face difficulties and face challenges .

In conclusion , successful person all have the same strength to oversome difficulties in life , which help endure them to go through hardships .
However , a successful person will have the faith to try new things , because they are not afraid to face difficulties and in which they do , they overcome it .
Therefore a successful people always try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well .
