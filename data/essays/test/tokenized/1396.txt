The speaker contend that as the time passes the number of cars would decrease .
I agree with this statement and their are many factors which contribute to this .
For example shortage of petroleum , rising petroleum prices , pollution , rise in the rates of cars and materials used to manufacture a car .

The shortage of petroleum is the main factor in decreasing the number of cars .
As the economy of each country is increasing their is more demand of petroleum , and as there is only a limited amount of petroleum product in earth the day will come when all the petroleum reservs will become empty .
This thing also results in the price rise of petrol which is due to demand and supply principal , which can be easily noticed in NYMEX where last month petroleum was trading about 78 $ / barrel and three years before it was trading about 54 $ / barrel .
Scientist are also looking for alternate options such as natural gas which will also finish one day and ethanol which is not practical uptil now .
Price rise will make the people to look for other options to do their journey for example cycles and electric trains which eventualy will cause decrease in number of cars .

Pollution is other main factor .
Pollution has caused a major sense of worry to all the people of world for example Global warming , Poisnous Gases and Acid rains are very hazarduous and have a devasting effect of human being .
All these things have made humans bit cautious and they are trying to discard different bad things and car ( produce pollution ) is a part of that .
Due to Different institutions such as WHO , people now understand how the pollution will hamper them and their offsprings .
So , they will try to discard cars or at least limit themselves in using them .
They might use Cycle to do their journey which is also useful to the body .

Rise in the prices of cars has also limit the buying power of the people .
As the natural resources are becoming short day by day , the value of those resources will increase day by day for example iron , aluminium etc , that will limit the buying capacity of the consumer .
Furthermore , as the arrival of new generation we might see super trains , elecrical busses etc which are more conveneant and are cheap also .

In conclusion , the shortage of petroleum , pollution , rise in prices of cars , and advent of new generation with super fast trains , electrical busses has impede the potential customer from buying the cars and i suppose that after 20 years from now there will be no cars .
