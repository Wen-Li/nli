First of all , I think young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities .
There are several reasons that I support this idea .

One reason that I support this idea is that young people nowadays do not have interest in helping their communities .
Because in these days , the life is safe and people do not notice that they have to thanks for it , especially young people .

They do not know how to help their communities because they have been living in peace that there have been no need to worry about their future .

Second reason that I support this idea is that young people have more oppotunities of thier life than the olddays .
So they spend more time for themselves such as choosing the college , the graduate school and the job .
Therefore they tend to lose the time for helping their community .

Third reason is that nowadays there exist too much communities that some of them are even doing bad such as violating the law .
These problems are confusing young people and making worse that eventually they do not involve in thier communities .

At last , I think there are many reasons that young people nowadays do not give time to helping thier communities .
That is because , olddays were more simple and people were tend to involve in their communities .
