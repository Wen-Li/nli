I do agree with this statement because one can not apply facts to situations .
For that reason I consider understanding ideas and concepts much more important than learning facts .

As I already stated the major difference between learning facts and understanding concepts is that you can apply concepts to different areas while facts are only useful for specific situation .
For example if you merely memorize a math formula it will only help you if the teacher asks you to write down the formula .
On the other hand if you actually understand the concept of how the formula works you will be able to solve all kinds of math problems with it .

Another reasons I consider understanding concepts more important is that humans are only able to learn from concepts , not facts .
Let us take an example from history .
If one knows when the Second World War started and ended , who participated etc. one would not be able to recognize a situation where something similar could happen .
If one understands why the Second World War has started and knows the cause-effect-relationships this person is likely to recognize a similar situation .
And only if one is able to recognize a situation one can think about possible solutions to prevent it from happening .

The third reason why I believe that learning facts is not very important is that one is much more likely to forget facts .
If you memorize that the Boston Tea Party was in 1773 you are very likely to forget the year as time passes whereas if you learn why and what happened you are likely to still know the important things even after a few months .
That is because it is much easier for the brain to memorize cause-effect-relationships that are connected to knowledge you already have than to memorize mere data .

As I already said , the concepts are the most important thing because you can not apply mere facts to situations .
Therefore facts do not help you dealing situations which everybody has to do every day .
This is the reason why I think that understanding ideas and concepts is much more important for students .
