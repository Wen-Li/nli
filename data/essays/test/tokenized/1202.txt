In response to the question , I strongly agree with the opinion that it is important for students to learn facts than it is for them to understand ideas and concept .
There are several reasons that you would be satisfied .

Some people say that imagining things is good for children , and I can understand what they refer to , but I think that body action is better for them to memorize things .
For example , when you have to study for the exam , there are two types of people .
First , some people just learn in their hears vocablary , and second , others try to repeat writing what they should memorize .
I always do a second method .

Also , learning facts is good for people 's future because children can learn good manners such as how to eat a meal correctly , or how to respect seniors .
I guess that most people learned manners with body action by their parents , and parents did the same thing by their parents .
Manner might not be imagined in the brain , so we have to imitate what parents do .

In the conclusion , I agree that it is important for students to learn facts , and children have to know why understanding ideas and concepts is not better than that .
