I strongly agree with the above statement that is true that most advertisements make products seem much better then they really are If the product came into the light with more advertisement that enriches the quantity and quality

Firstly a normal product or a cheap product came in to the market , the cheap product means it has some flavours added which are not better purified so it will not be applicable to all the peoples that means that many not work effective that product also will comes with little influence .
For an example considere an axe deodrant and a local or home made scent , when the government issue licence to them only they will fix the rate to it because as they made which type of flavours which is worthful etc .
So the most of the people use the axe deodrent rather than local scent because of it effectiveness not only is effectiveness but also it is really seems better than advertisements .
So it is also true that the advertisements also moves to the better products ofcourse to fulfill their pockets also another reason .

Secondly a better brand and a worthful brand only comes to the market with highly influencial it is true that the statics always votes to the advertisement brand only i feel that is nothing going to ones favour , if it is so why many people turns towards the influencial product it is not only for their advertisements they are turning towards their quality .
For an example colgate paste we can see the number of advertisements regarding about that paste a day the most of the people in the country using thisbrand only apart of numerous advertisements this product is the better example to suggest that they are much better than really are , many paste came into the light with as influence as colgate paste but all can not stand before it .

And finally i conclude that most of products seems much better than really are .
