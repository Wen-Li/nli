People like to excel in different fields in their life becuase they want have a decent life , earn a great income and occupy a respectable position in society .
Therefore , broading knowledge of many acadamic subjects is better for many reasons such as gaining more creativity and having higher expectations .

A person who have a broad knowledge can be very creative because he can join between different subject to get to a new conclusion and it might be considered as a new invention .
For example , if a person studys as a doctor and a computer engineering at the same time , he will be able to use the technology provided be computers to create new tools that serves his needs as a doctor and helps him do his job more accurately .

Broading knowledge can make the person have higher expectation and makes him think about a brighter future .
Moreover , he can dream about a world of his own where he might need something that does n't exist in the real world so he invents it , and that 's where the creativity plays its part .
Imagine a world without creativity or ambitions , that will lead the world to a complete standstill .
That 's why there are people who dream to get a higher eductaional level and earn different majors because they want the world to stay vital and alive .

Finally , in my opinion , i think it is a good idea for the person to broaden his knowledge , not only acadamically , but also in the practical life because life is like a journey , you always learn from it .
On the other hand , a person should be aware not to get lost into his dreams and ambitions and he should always think about the real world for every person in this world has his own limits but knowledge is unlimited ; it is endless .
