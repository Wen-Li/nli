All advertisements no matter if they are TV adds or magazine adds have the same goal and that goal is to sell .
In my opinion advertisement does not make products seem better than what they really are , they just show the cualities of the product .

A marketing campaign has the objective of creating advertisements that will sell a product .
Therefore the product needs to have an image , a set of cualities that set it appart from any other product in the market .
This does not mean that the advertisement is not telling the true or miss leading the consummer just because it focuses more on its advantages than on its disadvantages .

It is also important to keep in mind that an advertisement is a reproduction of the real thing .
It creates an image of the product and it also allows the consummer to develop a relationship between the product and what he or she expects to abtain from it .
A good advertisement will not create false expectations , it will show what the product is capable of doing , but never what it will not do .

As I mentioned before a marketing campaign objective is to sell and the advertisements disigned for this porpuse are ment to create a need that did not exist before .
As a resoult of this there might be consummers that might feel that their needs are not being covered or that the product seem to be better than what it really is .
This does not mean at all that the product is bad or that it faild to do what it said it could .
What this means is that the consummer needed another kind of product to meet his or her needs .

I really do not think that all products look better on the advertisement than what they are .
Most of the products do what they sayed they could do in their advertisement , but in an open market like the one we have today it is impossible to control every advertisement and what it says .
But we can not make a generalization because of a small sample from a huge universe .
