Advertising plays a big role in business activity although it can be misleading in a way .
Businesses who advertise have an aim to make their product look best no matter what the quality is .
Due to all these attractive colors and the use of different media to promote it , consumers less reluctant to purchase it .

Consumers dont know the mistake of purachsing the product until they have used it for a couple of times and find out that the quality is poor although the price of it was made high due to the vast amount of advertising .
Through all the different kinds of advertising done by the business such as persuasive as well as informative advertising , the chance that the customer will buy the product increases and the business can then look forward to higher sales as well as an increased market share .

I think that the majority of advertisements made for a particular product of the business make the product look way better than what it really is for real .
When a business is advertising , it has one main aim in mind which is to increase sales as much as it can .
Through all the different techniques of advertising it uses , it can achieve its objectives and eventually cover the cost of advertising .

An imporatant disadvantage a business can face due to its misleading advertisements is losing its image .
People tend to purchase the product due to all the pursuasive advertising , but then they are not satisfied with the quality at all .
As a result of this the image of the business itself can be harmed which in the long run , may lead to a fall in sales and revenues .
beacuse the customers feel they were tricked .

In conclusion , businsses should try their best to be honest in their advertisemnts and not mislead their customers to prevent losing them as well as maintaining a good image of the business .
