I agree with the statement that it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn the facts because of the following points .

Firstly , to understand ideas and concepts help the students to know what is going on during the study .
One can do well and behave appropriately in the real life by using the knowledge he achieved before .
For example , when a student is asked to protect the environment by doing little tiny things such as throwing the dirties in the garbage box or picking the waste paper up when he is walking on the road , he should know why he needs to do such things instead of walking away .
In this way , a student will agree and know how to do to protect the environment more effective than simply doing it .

Secondly , to understand ideas and concepts allows the students to discover themselves and to behave well .
As a student in the primary school , he dose not know a lot about what is right and what is wrong .
He needs to model someone 's behavior who is around him .
But what if the model around him dose not behave right either , such as fighting with others or doing the stealing stuffs ?
Then the teacher has to tell them that the one who is fighting or stealing is a bad student because he breaks the moral rules in society and the teacher will also tell them that if they do what the bad student does they will be punished by society .
From this situation , we can tell that the students will keep in their mind that fighting or stealing is not right things to do for a good people .

Finally , to understand ideas and concepts provides more chances for students to serve in real life in the future .
What does it mean ?
Well , it means that if a student wants to become a psychologist in the future , she must learn the corresponding knowledge that connects to the psychology class .
She will have to be trained as a professional psychologist during the study .
For example , if the student has to earn practice experiences such as hypnosis and dream analysis , she can not do it herself by simply thinking .
She has to study how to do it , not only to see the fact that other people can do it .

To give an conclusion , I consider that it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts that it is for them to learn facts as my point of view because it lets the students to know what is going on , allows students to dicover themslves and to behave well and provides more chances for students to serve in the future .
