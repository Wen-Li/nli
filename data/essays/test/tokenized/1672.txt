Success is a thing that can be interpreted very differently , depending on people 's point of view .
My point of view about `` success '' is to achieve determinated and accurate goals , and always have an objective , both in private and professionnal life .
In my part , I do agree that successful people are those who take risks and try to develop new things and ways to carry them out .

First of all , people take risks because they want to go ahead to find a solution to improve their situation , and this desire of changement is reflective to a determined and self confidence , main points for success .
Then , the things that do not kill make us stronger .
That is to say if we fail doing something , as engaging with someone , launching a new business or choosing education orientation , we will remember our mistakes and never do them again .
We have to make mistakes to know how to do it in a better way , to improve our knowledges , and one day to be successful in achieving something .
In the business field , most of the time , managers who tried to launch their activity on new markets , but made a lot of mistakes due to their lack of experience , causing a bad situation in the company , are fired and replaced .
I think that it will benefit the companies which will next recruit these managers , because they should have learnt from their experience and will be able to act in a difficult situation , knowing what to do , in order to be successful for the company .

Finally , I think that it is important to have objectives in our lifes .
Objectives make us volunteer , engaged and involved in what we do , and without objectives , our life would be poor .
The unique way to have new objectives is to achieve the actual ones , and to achieve them , it is important to take risks .
People who only do what they already know are self satisfied , so they dont need to have any objectives .
