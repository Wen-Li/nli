It is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts .

I agree with the opinion stated above for two reasons :

First .
If you understand very well the ideas and the concepts then you will learn facts .
If they are talking about behavior and why we behave this way , first , they have to understand the concept and the idea of what is behavior and know the process to make a response and evaluate the behavior .
Then they will have examples and will know how we react in society , in school , in house , at a fight , and why we have this behavior , what is behind of ours acts and where it is come from .

Second .
More concepts and more ideas will take you to research more about the topic that you are on and then have a full list of concepts and research about same things and have a bigger criteria at the time of learn and interprete facts .
It is like the free opinion of the people about a car ; people know what is a car , what does the car do , and what a car has to have to be a car .
Then they investigate about more things like the motor , the type of wheels , if the car has features like air conditioner , electric windows .
etc .

When you know all this and you have your answer which you think it is correct or unique , and you start to ask more people their opinion and what they know or what they want for the car , you can see that theres a lot of different opinions about what is a car or how does a car function , or what they want to have the car .
You understood the idea and the concept , you wanted to know more and then you learned facts .

It Is hard to explain and put examples but one can only learn by living and listening what is happening around us .
Its the base for a good criteria .
