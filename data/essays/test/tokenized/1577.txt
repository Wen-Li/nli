Have you ever found that how dangerous it is to travel by yourself because there may be a lot of people steal or rob everywhere ?
Have you ever found that you save a lot of time if you know where to go and where you can have a good time instead of searching for interesting places ?
Have you ever found you may have an eye on more fabulous things and more knowledge when you are travell with people who knows the place well so that he \ she can tell you about the history of the place and where most tourists prefer ?
If you have n't , you will never realize what a nice trip you will get with the help and the guidence of a tour guide .

First of all , I commit to the notion that travelling with a tour guide is quite safe .
I usually spend my time on travelling , and wherever I go , I was worried that there is some people want to rob me since I am a stranger .
For the crime rate hase been increased day by day , it is definitely a fairly difficult problem to solve during the journey .
However , when I take the trip with a guide , I get a chance to put my energy on the sight and the magnificent tour itself .
Why ?
Because the guide promises me safty .
A good guide always concerns about his costomer 's-yours-safty problems instead of yourself .
The guide may tell you about how to avoid the potential dangers and take you away from the areas with high crime rate which you do not know before .

Another benefits will be the convenience .
Take Zhu fan , a great frien of mine , for example .
He got a chance to get to Hang zhou for his summer vacation for about one week .
The bad news is that he did n't know Hang zhou very much , and he even did n't have an idea about where to visit .
He spent three days in the hotel searching for a tourist site just because no one reminded him where the magnificent sight are .
After Zhu fan find a palce , three days had gone .
What a pity !
If , back then , Zhu fan had a guide with him , there is no way for him to waste any time on those dull things .
You should know , Hang zhou is one of the most beautiful cities in China , it is unimaginable that one can hardly find a place to enjoy the sight !
It 's all because lack of a guide .

Besides convenience and safty , a guide could also provide mroe fun .
A tour guide must have known great amount fo things about the site , including it 's history , it 's advantages and so on .
So this enables you to know a lot about the place you go , and make you have more fun at the fabulous sight you are look at .
For instance , a guide may tell you the story of a strange stone , but you will never even notice the stone without a guide .
Furthermore , a guide can tell you some interesting things about your forerunners-the people he \ she guided before , which will perfectly make your trip meaningful .
