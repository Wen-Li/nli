I disagree with the statement .
First of all let me explain what I understand about `` successful people '' .
Someone is successful if one reachs the goal for a certain task on time .
The goal can be either the same every time or something totally different .
It `` s the same with the task .
The tasks can change ore keep the same .
Let me provide an example to underline my thesis .
Someone likes to run a marathon .
That is the goal .
The task is to train for the marathon in order to achive the goal .
The training methods can be allways the same and just because of having an ongoing dialy training it can be possible to reach the goal .
On the other hand training methods might change and even with the changed training methods it is possible to achive the goal .
In both situations the runner is not certain because unprodicted situations might occure like an ilness , bad weather conditions during the marathon .

In case the runner decides to do a Iron-men he would change his goal from marathon to iron-men .
He could keep his training methods from the marathon preparation or change it to some other methods .

Trying new things the person has to get used to changes which normale decrease the ability of being `` good '' and `` fast '' After a replication of the activity the person gets more familar and the quality and the speed is increasing .
That means trying new things for the first time people are most likely not as succesful as peole who have done the activity more often .
Becaue of the fact that new things are of course not well known the person taks the risk in being not successfull .
