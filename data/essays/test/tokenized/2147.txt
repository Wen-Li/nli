I agree to the qestion which is `` It is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts '' .
Learn the facts is just memorizing something and they do n't get the cause of the fact .
Also it can be forget faster .
However understand the idea learn the cause of the facts or problem .
I know understand something is very hard thing to do .
But that does n't mean they do n't have to understand what they are learning .
Just learn the facts is easy and they can learn more faster however they will have a problem later .

For example , one student is learning a Math .
If he just learn the fact which is math formula , he can finish faster and he just need to memorize the formula .
But when he get different question that using same formula , he is going to confuse about the question that where to put the formula in it .
However the students understand how it work , he can be ready for any questions that using same formula .

It also cause a problem when students are grown up .
Another example that the students learn that do n't throw garbage every where .
Later if he get face on this problem , he does n't know why he ca n't throw the garbage everywhere because he did n't learn why .
but one who learn and understand why in this problem , he will know that throwing garbage everywhere cause a polution .

Like the exampleabove , just learning is good for now but cause a problem late so students need to understand ideas and concepts .
