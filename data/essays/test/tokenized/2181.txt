I think that this statement is only partially true .
If we look at surveys and polls about this topic may be we should agree with it but I know a lot of people who try to help the community as often as they can .

Actually surveys analyze wider samples of people and for this reason it might be more accurate than my `` survey '' but I prefer to believe that the person interviewed were the wrong ones !

I believe that young people today are very sensitive toward the problems of their communities especially because the mass media broadcast a lot of information about it .
To me young people are not the `` bad persons '' they are deemed to be by adults but , at least in small towns , the majority of them dedicate a lot of their free time to the community .
In my town , for example , on Sunday , instead of going out , my friends and I organize events for poor kids , as for example karaoke or dramas .
From time to time we go to clean parks around the town and we dedicate to old people who are alone and need someone who goes to take medicines or food for them .
I know a lot of boys and girls who do it , in other towns too .
This is not an attempt to elogiate myself and my friends but I want to demonstrate that young people take care of the community and care about the way it works cooperating to improving it .
Another way in wich young people spend their time in helping their community is working as volunteers for the local health assistance .
I have to admit that it takes a lot of time and I ca n't join it but there are a lot of young people who go there on Saturday night instead of going to clubs with friends , only to help the community .
In conclusion , In spite of the fact that surveys show that nowadays young people are careless toward the community my experience tells me something different .
This is the reason why I can disagree with it without admitting that surveys can be right .
