Yes I agree with the statement that successful people always take risks and show interest in new things .
The word success itself make a positive note .
So , a positive person will definitely dare to explore new things .
It does have some reasons to mention .
Abundant knowledge , confidence in the matter , desire to do something innovative , and experience make any successful person to try new things .

Knowledge is an ocean .
In this competetive and timeless world we are exposed to many things .
Though we specialize in one thing , we definitely show the interest in many other things .
We learn only a drop of the knowledge .
Yes , at a particular instance in our academic life we are sticked to one field , which later turnsout to be our career .
However , a successful person never feel enough with the knowledge he/she has .
They always have a desire for the knowledge .
And that thirst make them to learn or try out new things futher .

For example , Rajiv Gandhi , former Prime Minister of India , who hails from political background , initially took pilot as a career .
Later with the inspiration from his mother Indira , joined politics , which is a very new thing to try out .
Since he was successful as a pilot , he never stopped with that .
Then joined politics , became prime minister of India and stood as a role model for many people .

Confidence make person more energetic and daring .
Success definitely make people feel more confident .
Confidence leads to success .
Einstien called as father of science , experimented many things and was successful too .
Obviously his success brought him confidence and thus made him to explore new things .
He was dare enough to try new things .
Confidence adds energy to the people .
It boosts the person to think of many more things other than which he already know or is aware of .

Experience is definitely a source for exploring new areas .
Experience make us learn know our mistakes in the past .
Moreover , it inspires the people to take risks .
Knowledge and experiences are the two things which no one can take away from us .

Success brings confidence , make people think innovative .
Experience and knowledge make people to take risks .
