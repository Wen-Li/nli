Many people travel in a group led by a tour guide in my country .
It was more poppular than travelling alone about ten years ago .
However more and more young people want to travel alone because they prefer to having free time and to deciding by themselves when or where to go .
Even though I prefer to trvelling alone , I agree with the statement `` the best way to travel is in agroup led by a tour guide '' especially for first time travelers .

There are many advantages if we travel in groups .
First of all , we do not have to worry about the schedules , transportation , places to go and stay .
It is not easy to handle them .
The tour giude and company provide them in best ways .
They are professionalists of traveling and have a lot of experineces , so in many times they provide perfect schedules for situations .
And then safety is the most important factor that the beginner travlers are concerned about before departure .
They might be worried about the places where they are going because they do not knoe about them .
However , with a tour guide , it would be safe .
He or she must have experince and knowlege about it .
In addition , the tour giude can give a lot of information of the place to travel .
It makes the travel more valueable and exciting .
If we travel alone , we should study the places where we are travelling .
We should find out where to visit .
Some times the tour guide have various experinces and usually have great knowlege about the places , so he or she can explain other stories .

In conclusion , I think it is a good idea to travel in a group , especially it you are a beginner traveller .
When we travel , we can face various situations unexpectedly .
It might be stressful to slove them , so it is not possible to enjoy the trip .
It can be a waste of time and money .
Therefore , I strongly recommend trvelling in a group to some people .
After then , you can challenge to a travel alone .
It would be wodnerful .
