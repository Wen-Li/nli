The contention of this discussion is whether it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts .
I agree with the statement that it 's more important for students to understnad ideas and concepts becase of the following logical reasons .

I believe only learning facts does n't do anything in the real world .
Let 's say about the environmental problems .
Lots of disasters has been happening in the world including floods and haricanes .
We all know it 's not safe to live on the earth anymore .
Of course people want to live in the safer world but we did n't know why it 's happening .
Ten or more years ago we were getting to know temperature of the world is rising up .
We found there were some certain relation between them but we did n't know the foudamental things .
I mean we didnt't know why it has been happening .
We did n't know the foundamental reaon , so we could n't do anything about it .
This example show it does n't change anything you only know the facts .

Now when you understand the basic what can you change ?
Returing to the global warming , you can get to know the basic ideas and concepts of the global warming from news or paper .
Now we know it causes lots of disasters to human .
We also got to know since Industrial Revolusion the amount of CO2 has been increasing beause of our life .
You can get to know how to stop the global warming from knowing what 's being the cause of it and now we can stop it if we try .
It leads one conculution .
Without main or basic ideas or concepts you ca n't understnad the fact or detail of the fact .

Therefore it 's far more relevant for the sutdents to understand the basic than it is for them to know the facts .
Only knowing the fact does't do anything and solve the problems .
You can understnad the real fact deeplly only when you get to know the foundamental idea .
