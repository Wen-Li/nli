Nowadays , in many jobs , people become more and more specialized .
For example in medecin , there are more and more specialists who can just help a few people otherwise there is a lack of generalits , who are very important for litlle and frequents deseases .
Therefore , in my opinion too specialization is bad both for society and people themselves , for their life and job .

General culture is very important for everyone and for the society .
For example , if a person is very specialized in one specific subject and knows nothing about other topic , how can he have a good relationship with orthers ?
Therefore , in my point of view , pepole have to have broad knowledge of many topic in order to be able to speak with a lot of different persons about a lot of many subject .
Moreover , it can boring for someone to be interested in just one subject .

Secondly , I think that a good worker doesn ' t have to be too specialized to be good in his job .
For example , nowadays , a lot of doctor are very specialized .
There are some doctor who are pneumologist , one specialization , and specialized in one desease : tuberculosis .
Therefore , they have just patients with tuberculosis .
If a patient goes to see one of them for a little thing , as a pneumonia , he does n't know what to do !
He is specialized in his specialization and that is too much .
I do n't thinkthqt , even if he is very known for tuberculosis , he is a good pneumologist and at least a good doctor .

So , I think that is important , to feel good with people and in your job , to have different knowleges .
