In this text I try to essay whether I can agree or disagree to the given statement .
To evaluate this statement in a economical manner , it seems best to review history and form my opinion , based on exemplification , as far as this is possible without having any text-relevant information .

With the beginning of the industrialisation a shift of occupation was possible for the first time .
Before , people used to stay in their surrounded milieu and would follow to run , if available and possible , the families business .
But with the establishing of the capitalistic market and the end of large scale substaintial economy , high risk businesses for everybody were possible in a larger amount .
In fact it is true that high risk business are leading to more financial success than low risk businesses .
This , we can find at modern stock exchange markets for example .
High risk stocks are guaranteeing a larger profit .
But before the introduction of the market economy people were also able to do risky businesses , therefore we have to be aware that it is easier to start high risk businees nowadays , but that it is nothing unique .

The fact that the given statements is not only dealing with high risks in business , but also focusing on generality , this text must include more aspects for evaluation .
Risky actions in daily life , can cause injuries and a threat to health .
On the other hand it can cause attention of your peer group or your beloved .
But if you are not coping with the high risk actions but also take some less risky situation in consideration it becomes obvious , that sometimes it is needed to risk something to gain a new experience .
A child , for example , is learning by doing .
The risk to fail is high but probably as high as to succeed ( based on the kind of attempt and goal ) .

This failing and learning thing is probably maintained throughout your whole life and we would not increase in our knowledge if we only stick to our known .
On the other hand it is also the case that

Taking everything into consideration it seems that the statement is having a lot of truth .
I would not go as far as the idea presented in the statement , because its too strict and does not allow any space for the idea of being successful by acting from experience .
