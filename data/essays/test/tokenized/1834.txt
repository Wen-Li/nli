In the era of the modern world , where the society is controlled by media , advertisements shares a very important place .
Advertisemensts are done for almost every little things .
I strongly agree with the statement that `` Most advertisements make the product seem much better than they realy are . ''

The basic form of communication which is used here , known as advertisements , hides the negative aspects of the product most of the time .
They show the things which are alluring to the humans .
They try to attract the crowd by showing the attractive features of the product .
The advertisements generally covers up the negative part of their product .

A product might have some positive and some negative aspects , which a customer should have the knowledge before buying it .
But , these advertisements make the customer so blind that they do n't see the negative part of the product and finally face the consequences later .
Consider an example , where the manufacturer is selling a Mixer , which is very good to look at .
It even has some good facilities like automatic switching etc .
But this product has a negative point as when it gets over-heated then it fuses out .
As a producer , he would display all the good quality of the product and any normal person might go to buy that product .
But later , he would realize that he has been duped by the company .
Therefore , advertisements are sometime misleading .

Its an competitive world , so different company would try to bring out different methods to atrract people .
Nowadays , celebrities are used in the advertisements .
People being so blind that they just follow their role star and buy whatever product in which their role model has acted .
People do n't see that the negative things have been hidden in the advertisements .
They just follow the advertisements blindly .

It is always necessary for a person to know the in and out of the product he is buying which will make sure he is not in loss .
By simply trusting the advertisements , may affect them later , as advertisements are misleading and shows things which looks attractive .
