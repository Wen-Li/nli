I am strongly with the argument that assumpts most advertisements make products seem much better than they reallly are .
This is a strategy which I can not accept morally .

Advertisements are the tools for a product to be known better by public .
It has to point out the advantages of the product compared to the others in market .
So the consumer would make a proper decision on what he needs while comparing the items .
Also , to create a repetition and a popular name is not bad at all .

Nevertheless , advertisements go a little too far nowadays .
Developing into a big sector , the disadvantages of mass advertising can be uncontrolable .
The competition pushes the companies to glamourize their brands .
To replace them with some basic needs .

To hold their position in the market , they spend a dramatic amount of money for advertisement .
The sector is one of the fastest growing in all the world .
In the future , I assume that more adverisement companies will be active than their costumer companies .

These companies take advantage of all kinds of art , ideas and philosophy which is a misuse to my opinion .
They have bartered all these for money and market power .
This have resulted with not only a cultural degeneration , but also idolizing a brand to despise the consumers .
And this is just because of the starting idea of making a product seem much more better than it really is .
And this too is a dishonest and non - ethical action .

In conclusion , I think the advertisements should be controlled by authorities .
One of the most important priorities of the government should be protecting its people .
Then they have to take the responsibility in advance .
