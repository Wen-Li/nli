Success is somthing that all people in the world are looking for .
It is not something easy to success in the world .
Thus , people who successed in somthing may try new thing because they are looking to be successful in every thing .
However , I agree with statement which said that `` successful people try new things and take risks rather than olny doing what they already know how to do well '' for certain reasons that I am going to mention in this essay .

First of all , how did they success ?
When we ask ourself this question we will know that not all successful people successed because the know things well .
Some successful people successed because the take the risk of trying new things .
For example , a milionener in my home town maid all his miliones by taking risk when he bought a piece of land by all his money .
He kept it for some years .
Then , he sold it with miliones of dolars .

Secondly , some people who already successed in some filed love to try new thing in another filed .
Let is take an example the basketball player Miechal Jordon .
He acted in some movies in Hollywood and he successed in that filed .
He made miliones of dolars by trying a new filed .
Also some successful football players who started acting in some advertisements .
Of coures , no relationship between the advertisments and the football .

In conclusion , to be successful in one filed does not mean stop trying new things and depened on that filed .
No it is mean more than that .
It is mean that you are a successful person and you may success in a new thing .
This is my theory in this life .
By taking all the reasons that I have mentioned and my theory that is why I agree with the statementh .
