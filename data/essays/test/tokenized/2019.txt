In my opinion , most advertisements or commercials give a better image of the products than what they really are .
It is normal , because the aim of a advertisement is to sell the products , to create a desire among the population to buy them .
More the products will look fabulous , advantageous to the consumers , more the population will want to have and buy them .
It is particularly true , for instance , for washing powder , every advertisements say that their powder can wash cleaner than the others , and that all the dirt will go away easily .

This phenomenum increases because every company wants the best advertisement for their products , therefore will add some advantages to the product , that the product does not have in reality .
To answer to it , the other competitors will add new advantages .
Therefore , it is like a race between competitors to have the best advertisement .

But there have to be limits to this race , companies should not be able to say everthing they want about the products they sell , because then the advertisements become a false statement of fact and no more just emphasize of the reality .
Then there is misrepresentation and the advertisements become lies , and people without a lot of information or knowledge about the products will belive the advertisements .
That is the reason why I think some rules have to be settled in order to give a legal frame for the creation of advertisements .
The rules should be written by the Parliament , because it is a national matter , and the Parliament should receive advice from special comitees , which have more skills to appreciate the `` advertisements world '' .
In France , for example , there are a lot of regulations in this topic .
Firstly , it defines an advertisement , compared to a false statement .
Secondly , it establishes different actions in justice to claim for damages for the loss suffered by buying products at a very high price for a very low quality .

To conclude , I totally agree with the statement and because it is a reality , rules should provide ways to frame it , so the advertisement of the product remains close to the real quality of the product .
