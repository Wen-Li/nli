personally i belive it is better to stick with what you already know but i do n't belive you should leave it at that you should always trie to better your self at what you know , find the best and most ifficent way to do it .
Evan though this is the way i belive i should do it does n't mean i do n't think that doing differet things cant lead you to succes .
If you are a person that ca n't do one thing to long than you should try differet things , not stick with the same thing your hole life becouse if you do your not going to be happy and if your not happy your probably not going to be doing a very god job thus not leting you be succesful .
so i think you should sit down and think what kind of person you are .
I have witnessed both people seccessful that have done the same thing there hole life and people that are seccessful doing difrent things but i have alsow seen people fail in both , so personally i think you should figure out which type of person you are and stick to it do your best becouse success is n't going to come to you if your just sitting around waiting for it to hit you in the face , you have to fight for what you want and regardles of what path you deside to take if you work hard at it your going to be successful in life .
I found that sticking to one thing has been helpful for both me and may father so if your un sure witch type of person you are just look at people around you and ask them this mite help you with your desition and once your desided go for it and fight for what you really want .
