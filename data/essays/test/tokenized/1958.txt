Almost every one likes travelling .
Someone prefer to travel alone because they feel more independent and free , while others prefer to travel in a group led by a tour guide .
As for me , I think when people are going out for a trip , they should always be in a group and led by a tour guide .

First , having a tour guide can save tourists time and money .
Every one has experience that when one is in a totally new place where he has never been before , he may feel confused and do not know what to do and where to go .
It is the same for people who are on a trip without tour guide .
Though the place has attractive views , such as old temples or beautiful beaches , one may still can not find the right way to get there .
For instance , I once went to Cambridge in England and wanted to see Trinity School , but I just get lost on the way .
I spent 4 hours in asking people .
taking bus , and finally reached there at 5 p.m .
It is really exhuasting .
One can imagine if there is tour guide beside me , the situation will definitely change .
Furthermore , Staying in a group led by a tour guide will save one 's money .
In some sights , the tickets are much cheaper for group visits .
And staying with more people , most importantly with a tour guide , will make bargin easier .

Moreover , one can make friends when travelling in a group .
Sometimes , there are some interesting people in the group that one can talk to and make friends with .
I remember on my last journey to Beijing , there was a really humorous guy in the group and told so many jokes that made the trip relaxing and full of fun .
And we all became good friends after this trip .
Besides , one can always find some people in the trip who share the same interest with him .
During the trip , they could discuss movies they like , sport games they enjoy .
This kind of friendship will make trip never boring .
By contrast , if one travels alone , or just by several close friends , he can never have such excitement .

Admittedly , there are some advantages for people travelling without a tour guide , such as freedom and independce they can get , and he may schedule his time more flexible , however , I still think travelling in a group and led by a tour guide is good choice .

To sum up , travelling in a group led by a tour guide will save one 's money and time , and adds the chance to meet new friends during the trip .
Therefore , if I am going out for a trip , I certainly go with a group of people and having a tour guide .
