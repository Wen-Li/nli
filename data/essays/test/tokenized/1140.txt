I agree with this statementthat most advertisments make products seem much better than they really are .
There are two reasons to support my oppinion .
First , when we buy something , we tend to decide whethere we buy it or not by its image .
So the companies which made the products try to show their products more attractive and more useful and more availableand more high quality .
They make efforts to give attractive advertisements of their products to consumers .
They pay much money for the advertisements than the inovation the products .
But image is not which really it is in way of the function and the quality .

Secondaly , advertisements never represent their lacks .
They show only their good points .
Because of the reasons given above , I think most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .
