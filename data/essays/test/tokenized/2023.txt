Marketing is an unstoptable phenomenon which is everywhere and the most alarming thing is that the leaders of this subject do whatever they want to do .
One of many examples are the advertisement campaings which shows the product in an extraordinary presentation , so people go inmediatly to buy it and Surprise ! .
There 's no relationship between what you had seen on the advertisement and what you really get in reality That 's why I 'm completely agree with the statement that most advertisements make products seem much bette than they really are .

Although some products are not too bad in reality , they always confirm the statement , the advertisements are never realistic , In most of the cases this is because if they were realistic they would n't have the acceptance that they had , that 's why they have to implement these extravagant ideas to the product , the awful truth is that humans always have had the feeling that they need more , they are never conformed of what they have , as a result we have this campaigns which try to sell nothing but what the people is willing to have , furthermore they know that at the end , the products are not going to full their espectatives .

Actually , the current number of advertisements in the cities , for example in Mexico , has no limits , every little business tries to create their own campaing and sell it , no matter if its available , if it will be dangerous or cause damage to people in general .
Many years ago there was a medicine here in Mexico that created very damages to the people who used it , and it was after many people were affected that the company accepted his error and had to pay an exhorbitant amount of money to all these people who were affected .

To conlude , advertisements products are going to be much better thatn they reallly are , the only point that marketing companies should be aware of it , should be that the product wo n't affect the people wealth .
