There is a debate on whether it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts .
Some people say that learning facts is basic step of process such as studying .
However , I agree that it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts .
First , if students understand anything , students naturally would know facts .
Second , learning facts is limited that facts is not absolute and changeble .
I will explain these reasons in detail .

First , if students understand anything , students naturally would know facts .
In general , students is not understood the facts and they are not memorize concepts and not solve the problem .
Let me take my experience for example .
When I was first year of university , I was a member of club which is studying computer structure .
Naturally , I understood computer ideas and concepts .
My seniors always said `` Do understand . ''
So , I took the class of computer structure , I did not a lot of studying but my grades was A+.
For these reasons , I think that understanding ideas and concepts is very important .

Second , learning facts is limited that facts is not absolute and changeble .
The recent survey shows that comparing class of understanding ideas with class of learning facts .
The 74 % of women and 85 % of men prefer understanding class .
After take the class , contents of class is changing and take the class , again .
Result of second survey is changing .
Both of them , around 90 % , prefer to understanding class than learning facts .
This is because people who take the understanding concepts and ideas class not hesitate facts .
But , learning facts

As a result , it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts for these reasons .
First , if students understand anything , students naturally would know facts .
Second , learning facts is limited that facts is not absolute and changeble .
