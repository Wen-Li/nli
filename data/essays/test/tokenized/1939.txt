I do agreee with the statement that successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already known how to do well .

Successful people achieve their success througth their continued hardwork , concentration , commitment and facing risks .
It is hard to believe that people can achieve success with out taking risks .

Doing only what we know will never help in the long run .
It could make happy for a short period of time .
But , in the later stages we need to strugle for not trying new things .
For example if we do n't abreast with latest technologies and innovations we do need to depend lot on other people .
We need to spend lot of money for every function that needs new technology .
Similarly at the job we do n't get enough pay and promotions .
We need to work for the same pay and in same position throughout .

Trying new things may need to face certain risks .
They are all for a limited time .
When we started a new task we do need to face certain risks .
The tasks need more attention and time in the beginning to learn .
All this is just for a period of time .
Later , we are pretty much better at work compared to the others .
Get good positions at the job .

Trying new things help in growing mentally and economically .
For example , if we see the people like microsoft , google , yahoo .
Everyone was pretty good in their positions .
If they keep doing the same what they were doing they could not withstand in the market .
There is a lot of competition that comes .
New challanges needs to be faced .
If microsoft just thinks the windows is a user friendly software and there is no need to develop new versions and face new problems , we could not see any advancements in today 's windows operating system .
The competetors would have taken over microsoft by this time .
We know how the windows software developed .
First it started with just basic functions .
Then at the time of each newer versions there were several new functions added and new problems were started .
All those problems were only for a certain period of time .
Later they streamlined each version and made as the best software compare to the previous versions and the competetors .
Trying new things will always need to face certain risks but they are all for the good in the long run .

Therefore , I strongly agree with the statement that `` successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well '' .
