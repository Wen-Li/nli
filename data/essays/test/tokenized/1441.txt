I disagree with the statement ` The best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide ' .
Although a tour guide is helpful in some cases and it is true that this saves a lot of time and avoids common mistakes which people often make during the trip , I believe that travelling alone is a better choice which gives more freedom to people and is easier to get involved into the local enviroment .

Firstly , it would be cheaper to travel alone .
One of my friend , who works in a travel agent , told me that they charge differently to people in order to retain their profit at a signicant level .
He has calculated the cost for me once , the basic cost is less than fifty percent of what a customer actually paid !
What can you say more about that ?

Secondly , travelling individually can lead you to places where you desire to go , not places with full of junks .
Tour guides alway take travellers to places where are cheap or where they can share dividends from .
Regardless any meaning of the place , they often recommend travellers to buy some soverniers or local productions which is to be fake and much more expensive than anywhere else , just simply they can share a percentage .

Thirdly , an important issue of travelling is to see what people 's life like in the other side of the world , travelling alone has the benefits that where you go is where you have chosen .
For instance , you can walk to anywhere in a small town to see how people 's life is without any time limit , it gives much more freedom to you .

In general , although travelling alone has some disadvanges such as need more time for preparation .
I still believe it is the most efficient way of knowing the world .
