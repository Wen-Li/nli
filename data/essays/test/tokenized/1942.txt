to be able to understand what happpens around us. a person must always in touch .

to be able to know everything , people and especially student , who represent the future of every country must be open-minded to every kind .

to be successsful , the student must not only restrict their knowledge on the ideas and the concepts that they to learn but also they need to dispose on good knowledge about different facts that have happened in the past

i consider that both are necessary [ ideas , concept and facts ] for a student to build a complete educated person .
for example ; a student in a military school must not onlybe able to undrestand ideas , concepts and the stategies of the different war strategies but also have a knowledge about what happens when that strategy was put on practice . .

in addition , having an idea about facts , reality and the truth abut different element will make you able not only to understand the ideas but also the give some of it .

it is clear that the ideas and facts are not separate .
both of them is interesting for a sudent who want to be able to dispose on the ability of being convincing and persuasive .
