I disagree with this view .
On the other hand of developed countries which are trying to protect nature , developing countries are trying hard to catch up with developed countries .

To begin with , developing countries are developing lands , such as forests and farms , to be attractive .
So they build malls that have many places to play , such as shopping center , super market , cafe , and so on .
And usually , those places are made far from places people live .
That means , people should achieve at least one car per family in order to play around thier country .
For example , when I visited Honkong , it was not too much to say that I could see more cars than people .
According to an woman living in Honkong , people living there should have a car as they must go far places by business , as they should go around whole country a day .

Secondly , developed countries succeeded to make cars that use less or none gasolines , which move by solar system or wind or other kind of energieswhich use less sources than the usual cars used these days .
And also , government are encouraging people to use them .
Though the price of those cars are high , people started to be interested in them .
So if the prices got cheaper by having more technical people in the future , people who did not want to drive cars in the respect of protecting nature will try to afford cars .

To sum up , in the future there will be more people using cars .
