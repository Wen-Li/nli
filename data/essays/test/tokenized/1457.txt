At the begining , inventions like the radio , movies and TV were created to entertain people .
A dramatic evolution has been seen in the entertainment industry .
Now a days the industry has become almost purly a bombarment of advertisement .
Culture is now basically dependent on the media .
Ads often times use false statements and false images that will make their product look better than in actually is .

One of the most common advertisements that affect a certain group of people is when the industry is trying to sell beauty products .
Women in general , are mainly affected by the these ads , on what product they will buy .
Women are not just affected on what they should buy , but also how they should look like .
Most of the time the ad industries will air brush or cumputerize most of the ad so it will look amazingly `` real '' .
They will perfect their image as much as they can so people believe that the product actually does the change , thet the results are true .
Women are pressured to buy these product to fit in the social standars .
Mostly hoping that the product will give them the results that the ads say , but 99 % of the times it will bring dissapointment .

Another example of how advertisement makes products seem more powerfull than they actually are is in toy ads .
Children are fooled by TV commertials all the time .
Barbie commercials , for example , they move by themselves , they supposelly come with all these extra things , and they also promote that she can `` do '' many things that she ca n't actually do .
Children are brain washed by all the fake junk in advertisements .
They are told that the toy in the ad is the best thing that has been created .
The kids with their innocent minds belive this , and pressure their parent to spend the money on the toy that they want .
Many times you will have dissapointment in the children , but other times they would be so into their imagination that they wont even realize that the ad and the actions of the toy is fake .

The media has a huge impact on how society acts , thinks , and does things .
Most of the time advertisement is full of lies to promete a new item , just so they will make a profit .
Media brainwashes to make money .
