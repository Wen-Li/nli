Whether most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are is difficult to evaluete .
Some people thinks that buying a particular product only reling on its advertisement it 's completly wrong but other people do n't think so and they trust in what advertisements affirm .
Consequently if I asked someone if he/she agree or not , the answer depends on different factors such as the earlier experiences .
Before I decides I wuold like to consider both more closely .

First of all , when someone needs to buy a new product he/she should have consider the history of the facory that have made it , in fact some facories are more valuable than others .
For example if I should have to buy a new car I restrict my choose only on two or three nouns of factory such as Renault or Mercedes , because they make me more sure of what I 'm going to buy .
As a result advertisements have only a few part on my decision .

On the other hand , advertisements was born in order to highlight the features of a particular product especially positive ones .
Furthermore it 's quite impossible they could suggest that the product was worse than it real was or they could affirm that it could have a negative aspect .
However advertisements are very important because they permit people to know when a new product is turned out ; besides they have the function to keep well informed all people about new procucts of usual interest .

In brief in my opinion on one hand advertisements are very important and it 's just as well they exist but nevertheless , before buying an object with particular features that the advertisements do n't mention , the most important thing to do is faconsider the factory 's product and which features it have in details , in order to avoid bad surpises when I have just bought the object .
