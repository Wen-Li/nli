In modern society , students are required to understand concepts and learn facts as well when they study .
The two methods are both essential in mastering knowledge ; however , in my opinion , the former is more important than the later one .

The first reason to support my view is that conceiving the concept is always the first step and the base to learn any type of subjects .
Without the correct understanding of the idea of what the subject is describing , the further action towards analysis of the facts will be meaningless .
Take the study of advanced maths for example .
If a student new to this knowledge of advanced maths , he/she will be totally lost if he/she is instructed to learn the facts-the stactics and data at the beginning .
The usual procedure is that the teacher explains the model of this class , teaches students how to use this model and then asks the students to study the facts .

Second , students are more subject to put bias on facts if they do n't understand ideas and concepts , which will distort the facts reversely , especially when the students are not experienced with the knowledge .
For example , one of my classmates misunderstood the meaning of Human Resource Modern the professor taught us in a HR strategy class .
He missed the first classes about the methodology and only caught the one when we began to analyze the case .
The result was obvious-he misinterpreted the strategy adopted in a certain manufacturing company in the case based on the `` facts '' he assumed .
While the other students saw the fact that this company failed to executive its organization behavior and culture after we studied carefully according the ideas and concepts the professor delivered ( and it was proved a mistake after the development of company ) , he thought the company ran very well because he only focused on the fact itself .

To sum up , students should pay greater attention to understand ideas and concepts to find more in-depth message revealed in the fact .
