Tour guides provide a good organization and information to the person ( or group ) that is traveling , but it also has it disadvantages .
One is that a tour guide limits the options of places to visit to those that he/she think are more important for the tourist to visit .
It also limits the ammount of time that the individual ( or group ) can spend on a certain activity or place .

I believe that if the group planned the travel it will be better .
In terms of the organization , I think that the group have more flexibility for various reasons .
First of all , the schedule will suit the group desires in terms of which place to visit and how much time to spend in each activity ( or place ) .
For example , if a group is visiting Puerto RIco , the group can decide wheather spend more time in the National Rainforest El Yunque or in the historic fort El Morro .
Or the group can also decide not to go to any of those places and spent the whole trip period in the beach .

Secondly , if the group plans its own trip , it can be less expensive .
The group will not have to pay to the tour guide .
Also , it will be able to decide which place and which day of the week is less expensive or economically favorable to the whole group .
Relatively simple things , such as where to eat or which ground transportation to use , are factors that affect the total cost of the trip .

If the group plans ahead of time , they also can adquire the informational resource of the tour guide .
In the present , there are many book for travelers .
These book provide maps and historical facts of the place , providing the traveler ( in this case , a group ) a good deal of cultural , demographical , and historical information .

So , in the present there is no need of having a tour guide if the group plans effectively .
And most importantly , I think It will be more fun .
