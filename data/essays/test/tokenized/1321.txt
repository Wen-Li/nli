The communitiy is not an entity without its people .
People who live together , share the resources like schools , roads , sanitation , markets and much more .
To serve the communities has rather gained a backstage nowdays .
The worst thing is that the young people who are the future generation , are laking time and zeal to help their communities .
There are various reasons behind this problem .
Changing social values , pressure to excell in career and indifferent attitude of the youth can be considered as the few of many factors resulting in this problem .

Firstly , I feel that in many highly developed modern societies the social values have changed .
The people have become more self centred and they hardly care about the others .
They enjoy living artificial life .
As a result these values are passed to the younger people as well .
After all , an individual behaves in the manner what he or she sees .
This attitude is less prevailing in the lesser developed societies like in the developing world .
There , poeple are dependent on each other and still believe in serving their communities .

Secondly , the young people are hard pressed against time in their lives .
They have a tremendous pressure on themselves to excell in academics , jobs , sports etc and as a result they spend most of their time in working hard to achieve their objectives .
Helping their communities in activities like educating the street children , helping the old people etc. comes as a secondary priority for them .
Also not having any monetory benfits in return to serving their communities discourages them to work for the same .

Finally , one more point which I believe contributes to this problem is the indifferent attitude of the youth .
Todays youth has easy access to everything .
In wealthy societies , the youth has access to every luxories without having to work hard .
They believe that it is their birth right to have all the facilities they are enjoying .
They are so much involved in their fun related activites that they forget that every right comes with a duty in return .

So to conclude , I can say that it is important for the youth to understand their sense of responsiblity towards their communities and society as whole .
The can not live isolated from the problems of their surroundings .
Just a little caring attitude can do wonders for them and society as a whole .
