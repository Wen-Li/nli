The given statement proclaims that advertisements make products look better that they really are .
I agree with the above statement , that advertisement in fact projects the products in an unrealistic manner .

Advertisements are the most important way of marketing .
Every organization has a seperate marketing department dedicated to selling the products whether tangible or intangible .
Products are portrayed in a very gradiose manner in lot of advertisements .

Let us take an example of a cola companies selling their soft drinks .
The advertisements would have us believe that they are the end of all our problems .
Once we consume their product , we will be happy and live for ages to come .
Whether that is actually possible can be is not subject to debate .

In today 's competitive world , every body tries to make themselves look good while degrading the someone else 's image .
With so companies producing similar products and commodities , it becomes very difficult for them to reach the top and beat their competitors .
This leads an extrapolation of the reality , with each competiting advertisement putting its product as the best .
Things gradualy move away for reality .
In a bid to outdo each other , companies forget the real purpose of advertisements , which to give end-user a service or a product to make their life more convinient .

Marketing agencies have started following the policy of ` A book is as good as its cover ' .
Their only purpose becomes selling the product in whichever way possible , by hook or crook .
They dont mind lying about features the products in order to make it look good .
They are only concerned with how the product looks in the advertisement , rather than the quality of the products itself .

In the conclusion , I would like to re-affirm the above statement that advertisement make products seem much better that they actully are .
