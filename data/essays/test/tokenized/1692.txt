I do agree with this statement .
A general trend seen amongst people is that they tend to do what they only know how to do well .
To be lauded for this is a good thing but due to this people often get into a comfort zone .
This comfort zone is a state of mental satisfaction where people feel they have achieved it all and see no reason to improve .
It 's generally only a person who sees a reason to improve that tries something new .
Cliched as it might sound , ` Need is the mother of invention ' .
It 's common to see a great sportsman loose his magic touch soon after he is signed for endorsements .
He feels proud of his achievements and hence looses the fire inside to improve .

At the same time , it is not neccessary to try something new for the sake of doing so .
It is important to continue doing what one does well for sustainence .
At the same time it is required not to get too comfortable with the situation and see how the bar can be raised .
It is a fine line dividing a rational base and an adventurous will to explore .

A person who will stay ahead of the competition is one who will be able to reinvent him or herself .
It 's imperative to realise that times change and so should we .
If we get left behind , then one 's actions would be of no considerable consequence anymore .
This is getting pretty standard in business practices across the world today .
A company that will innovate and offer the customer the newest and best products they can have will be the one that stays ahead .
Similarly a person might start something new today , but it might become jaded tomorrow so he will have to reinvent himself .

Hence , I do agree with the statement but I believe it is those people with a mature mindset and a fervour for adventure who will be able to set and match ambitious targets .
Because trying new things does not make a person successful .
If so then any unsuccessful person can gain success with simply a change in profession .
But conversely it is chasing success that will make people try new things .
Stay out of your comfort zone , dream big , aim high and go for the kill .
That 's the formula to success .
