I totally agree with the statement that successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well .

The reason for the truth of this statement lies in the definition of `` success '' itself .
With `` success '' we mean that a person achieves things that are over average .
A successful person is recognized because this person has managed things the average person does not easily achieve .
Therefore it is a logical consequence that people who try new things and take risks are more likely to be the ones that are over average , because the average of people sticks to their well-known ways of doing things .

Trying new things and taking risks very often is related to developing new ideas as well .
And if these ideas are of a kind that fulfils the demand of people you can become very successful with it .
Look at Bill Gates for example .
He is the pioneer of the internet and computer industry .
Certainly he is a clever person as well , but what is more important is the fact that he had new ideas and found new ways in order to promote his ideas in a business environment .
And now he is the richest man in the world ( I think ) .

Yet , it is true that some people are very good in something they are doing , although it is not a `` new '' thing and they do not take any risks .
They might not be the most creative persons , but they are still very good in what they are doing , their work is clearly over average .
These people are successful persons too .

Still the talented people that do not leave tradtitional paths and never take a risk will not be as successful as the ones that try new things and take risks .
Because what somebody achieves by using new ideas will arouse more attention and earn more recognition than traditional ideas everybody can think of .
Looking at it from a business perspective new ideas are certainly more successful , because nobody has had these ideas before .
In addition human beings are curious and want to try new things they have not heard of before .

In conclusion , for the reasons stated above it is true that successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well .
