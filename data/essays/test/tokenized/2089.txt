Yes , I agree with this statement .
Products can be shown better than they really are by advertising .

We all know that advertisements are very effective in increasing the sell of a product .
Because by advertising , large amounts of people have idea about the product .
And we know that there is no bad advertisement , there is only unefficient advertisement .

For example , a kind of food or a kind of tool may be a part of our life by advertising again and again .
Repeatingly introduction of a product makes the people feel that it is a good product .
And this will provide of being used widely of that product .

For example , in our country , there are a lot of products only selling their names , not much more .
For years , we watch the advertisement of the same brand of detergent .
There are possibly more effective detergents , but when people went to markets , they buy the detergent most advertised .
This is not the result of being a good product .
This is the result of continuously advertising .

And , as a result , advertisement is the best way of gaining some money .
That 's it . ..
