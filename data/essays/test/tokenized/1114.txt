No one can deny the fact that in this present context that every person knows that travel playe an important role in our life , i think that the statement `` the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide , sounds very true .
the extent to which wecan enjoy in travelling in a group can not be otherwise .
the role of a tour guide is also very important when travelling in a group , a tour guide will be having all knowledge about the various tourist sites .
we can miss out some important places to visit without a tourist guide . a tour guide also recommend us to not visit some prohibited sites or sites which are not so good and by doing so a tour guide saves our time and energy .
moreover tour guide will take us to sites by a shortest waywhich may be unknown to us before .
travelling in a group is an adventure in itself .
one can never get bored in a group .
activities like playing games in a group and singing etc. adds a lot to fun and frolic ehile visiting some sites. a person can never enjoy as much if he is alone. a guide take us to sites where we can enjoy more and more spend time .
more over we can miss some important and interesting sites .
although some people like travelling plone , on the other hand according to me travelling in a group is more beneficial for the people .
it is said that great thinking attracts good results medicure thinking attracts bad results .
ultimately i would you like to say that my views are rather diferrent from other people .
i have contemplated the matter as far as the topic is concerned .
