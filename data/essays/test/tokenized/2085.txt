In daily life , society is divided on major issues involving konwing the fact or the concept .
As what has been come up with , when you have been brought into the problems focus that which is more important between the concept and the fact .
What is your opinion and what is your standpoint ?
With all aspects taken into account , I disagree the statement that understanding ideas and concepts is more essential than learning facts .
My reasons are as follow .

To begin with , an old saying that acions speak louder than words , that means fact in activity is much more important than thinking of concept on paper .
Giving a specfic example for this point , if students only learn the concept of ice , which is a special stage of water when the tempertare below the zero , however , they can not image what is the shape and color of the ice , in other words , in their brains do not a specific form of the ice .
So , fact is an indispensable part of our study , particularly in the science study , this is the reason why we have the lab experience .
For example , when we learn a new concept of work in physicse , we know there are two major conditions of work : energy and movement for a distance .
But , knowing this is not satsified , for we must get the fact of how work happen , and what can make energy , which is much more useful than having the concept of work .

Another reason cn be seen by everyone is that learning facts is more useful than having the ideas in the daily life .
As we know , in our life , we must maintain different skills for living , such as cooking , driving .
I once expericed a real about my classmate in the high school .
Every day , she read a cooking book for a long time , because she wanted to cook delicuous food for us when the new year comes .
In the end , she could not cook a meal , because she even though did not know what was sugar or salt .
This is a good example in our life , for many times we can the ideas about one thing but we connot do because we do not get the fact of it .
Actually , we often ignore the importance of the facts .

Every coin has two sides .
Some people claim the concept of an object is quite essential , because it ont onlycan provide a idea of one thing , but also can indicate us to perform actions .
However , as for me , when we get the right fact of one thing , then we can take action , otherwise it should be failed .
From what I have discussed above we can attain that learning fact is more important than having concept , because it make much sense in our life as a right indicator , therefore I reinforce my standpoint as learing facts as my choice .
