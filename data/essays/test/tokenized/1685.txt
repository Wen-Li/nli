traveling is a nice thing that u do in your a vacation and it would be nicer if it was as group not necessary to be led by a tour guide .
its very wonderfull to discover the place where u r going to alone without some one guids you .
in some how if u was with a tour guide you would probably stay with limits and timing and its somthing i realy dislike to obay someonse rule and goes on his restriction wether its on timing or on other things .

but if u where going to some where specific , for example a zoo you will need a tour guide to guide you and show you the place with introducing each place or thing .
some other reason not to use or hire a tour guide is financial and its not that important to have one , according to my example we could go alone as agroup and leading one another and sure at the zoo there will be maps and information to use other than useing a guide .

traveling in groups have advateges and disadvatges .
traveling with some one is realy intersting and it will cheer ur soul for not feeling alone we can say its a benifit .
sometimes it wont be as a benifit more than disadvatege , because some how it will be crowded and you wont have a chance to explore your soul and enjoy the vacation while you will be searching for others that would be lost and stay in agroup without moving aroung except in group .

in my point of view i rather travel alone than in an agroup and without a tour guide because i like to express my self in my way and explore the place with no timing and no rulse !
