Can this statement allow students to do n't study history ?
Or can it allow them to study just sciece which is more made up of concepts ?
As I could think about this questions , others can do it and if the answers are affermative , the school 's education can make a dangerous turn .
I do n't agree with the statement above , because studyng just ideas and concepts without facts , students can not see how people used them in the history and they become more exposed to make the same mistakes of the past .

At the same time studing facts each student can also improve his general culture which is very important to take important decisions in the future and makes your awarness stronger .

Moreover , I belive that the study of concepts , ideas and facts has the equal importance for a student 's mind : the flexibility of a young mind can improve thanks to different kind of studys .
We can easly see that studing alwas the same kind of things the mind takes an its own way to work about problems : for example everyone can see the difference between the mind of an architect and the mind of a person who makes scientific resources .
Giving the same problem to both we can have two complete different ways to solve it correctly .

So , for students is equal important to study ideas , concepts and facts to do n't make old mistakes , to do n't close their mind to a better flexibility and to improve your personal culture , which is very important for the futere career and life .
