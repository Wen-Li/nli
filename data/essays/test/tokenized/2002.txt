If it is important for student to learn facts , I agree to the statement saying that it is more important for them to understand ideas .

Facts can not be discussed or rebutteled .
Learning facts is the most easy thing that anyone can do .
By contrast , ideas and concepts have to be discussed and demand work to understand them .
It is not always easy to `` catch '' the ideas and concepts .
Thus , student should spend more time to understand them in order to understand the field they are studying .

While being in class , it appears that spending more time to explain ideas and concepts is more useful than focusing on teaching facts .
Indeed , the value added that a professor provides to his student is his explanations ; it is something that students could not get elsewhere than in the classroom .
Students can easily learn facts at home , by reading the supporting material .
My own experience shew me that it is more useful learning in this way .
A professor who only or mostly focuses on facts is `` useless '' ; it would be preferable to stay at home , at least it would not make any difference .
On the contrary , a professor who spends the most of his teaching time to express and discuss the different concepts and ideas makes his class very interesting and animated due to the increase in participation of students and the interaction with the professor .

I do not argue that learning facts is useless .
Sometimes , some facts are also useful to understand ideas and concepts .
Facts should be taught in class when they are useful to understand ideas and concepts .
The way of teaching should be focused on the most important things and the main ideas and concepts .
Facts have to be studied at home , but taught in class only when they support the understanding of ideas and concepts .
