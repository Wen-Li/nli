Advertisements are mend to make the products in the market popular among the societies .
Most of the advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .
I agree with the statement that the advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .

Advertiser are most concern about the money they get but not about the products quality .
The purpose of advertising is to get the popularity to the product , so they just advertise all the products without looking at the brand and the quality of product .
By using graphics and by some technics advertisers show the effect of the product .
The product does not work as it shown in the advertisement .
They just make to look the product better .

Earlier , the advertisements are used to bring the best before the people as their will be a number of products in the market for a single requirements .
The advertisements are given only by some brand products , but now a days every product is been advertised without looking at the quality .
The companies are more focusing on the advertising than on the product .

Advertising make the people attract towards the product .
For example detergents , which are very useful home item .
their will be a number of brands , but advertiser gives all advertising without looking at the products wok .

As the advertising show the products that are good and also bad but its the peoples job to go for the better one .
