According to the context , I could agree and also disagree with this statement .
On the one hand I agree that open minded people who try new things tend to be successfull because they gain from each new thing they try , namely an experience or a profession .
It is in fact important to have knowledge in many fields in order to work with people from different sectors .

Nowadays , in fact , in the labour market it is very important to have knowledge of several subjects , in order to be able to work at high levels , where a more general understanding of several aspects of a firm is needed .

On the other hand focussing on one subject , field , profession can also lead to success .
Being an expert in what you do , makes you valuable and able to work at a higher niveau .
Furthermore a deep knowledge of a subject/field/profession is also necessary to develop it and inferr implications , often very important and applyable in the practice , that a non-specialized person would not notice .

A person who does n't specialize in something never really knows the subjects deep enough to exploit its knowledge in a valuable way , and often does n't really know what he is really interested in .

Therefore , I personally think that both approaches can be positive , depending on what a persone really wants to reach .
At today I am still trying to understand what I would like to do , and I do n't know if it 'll be better to specialize in one topic or have a general knowledge of several subjects .

Nevertheless in my personal life I prefer to try new things whenever I can because I consider new experiences essential for my personal growth .
The best way to make new experiences for me is to travel .
Travelling in new places , with new cultures and different people in fact has always fascinated me , and helped me to strongly grow personally .
