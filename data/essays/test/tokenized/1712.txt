I do not agree with this statement for the following reasons :
First of all , there are regions and countries in the world today , most of all China and India but also other third world countries and regions , that have started to develop a rapidly growing economy .

These nations as a whole and also local companies in these countries start to establish themselves as major contributors to the worldwide economy .
Although the third world economies are dominated by the producing industries at the moment and thus the annual per head income is still very low , there has been a remarkable increase in this area ( annual income per person ) in the last few years .
As many studies suggest that the economic uprising of these countries is going to continue and that these societies will turn into well developed communities very similar to those in the USA and western Europe , this trend of rising salaries will most probably continue .
There are going to be more and more service related business and the annual salary of most working people will increase .
This will enable more people in these countries to access goods that have been unavailable to them until now .
Housing will be made more comfortable , technological products such as computers , Mp3 players and the like will be accessible to a greater number of people and , of course , cars will become more widely spread .
Many inhabitants of these third world countries are just waiting for the day , when they will be able to purchase their own cars .
If you now combine this idea with the fact that more than two billion people live alone in China and India combined and many of those do not yet own a car , this may show to you the probable increases in car sales in these regions .
In fact , nearly all of the car producing companies worldwide are already planning and/or establishing products perfectly suited for the markets in China , India and the rest of the uprising third world countries .

Given these facts , a drop in the number of sold and used cars worldwide seems very unrealistic .
In addition to that , I do not believe anymore in a decrease of used automobiles in the western world , namely western Europe and the USA .
Although there have been initiatives to enhance the quality of the public transport system in the past , there are recent developments that undermine these initiatives .
Formerly state-owned railway companies are being sold to private investors , and the first step these businessmen take is to decrease the number of offered lines and connections .
An efficient railway system that could compete with the street both on the sector of private car users as well as on the transport sector is just too expensive to be highly competitive .

All that said , I definitely come to the conclusion that there will NOT be fewer cars around in twenty years from now .
There will be even MORE cars .
