first of all i would like to point out the fact that there are already a lot of cars today .
as far as i am concerned i think that there are too many and i hope that there won t be more cars in twenty years .

on the one hand i think that there will be fewer cars .
in fact , because of the increase of technology , i am sure that other sorts of transports will be developed .
i am thinking about trains , planes , tramways , boats .
cars are very convenient but it is more and more expensive to have a car .
in fact we can point out the higher cost of fuel and petrol .
in addition to that , nowadays it becomes difficult to obtain the driving licence and there are more and more restrictive laws about car driving .
consequently i think that people will find and use other transports which will be more convenient , easier and less expensive .
and we can underline that the developement of technology will help them and will give them the opportunity to do that .

on the other hand i am not so sure that there will be much fewer cars .
in fact car is very useful .
nowadays you can go where you want with a car .
you can be totally independant .
it is a wonderful invention .
thanks to a car you can travel when you want , as far as you want .
in addition to that fewer car accidents can be noticed .
consequently that makes people more confident and so there is an increase of the car using .
government puts a lot of money in highways , car structures , roads .
that gives the envious to people to buy and use their car .
moreover , the technology enables cars to be more and more comfortable .
sometimes you can find all what you want in your car .
tv , cold drinks , food , very comfortable seats .
people can feel as if they were in their own house .
thus this develops the car market .
for all these reasons i am not sure that in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today .

to conclude i hope that there will be fewer cars in use in twenty years thanks to the developement of other tranports .
but i am not sure that will happen because they are very useful and comfortable and the car market is still developing .

but we must bear in mind that if there will be fewer cars , perhaps the other transports which will remplace them will be more polluting , dangerous .
so perhaps it is better that there will not be fewer cars .
