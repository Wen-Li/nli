I would not favorite a traveling in a group with a guide .
Once in my trip to Austrailia , I had hard time touring .
I could not look around the place I wanted to visit .
The guide also made me to spend money .
I would never go on such a travel again .

I did not feel free during the visit in the Austrailia .
In the zoo , I was not allowed to see animals except koalas and kangeroos .
We also spent only an hour and half in the zoo .
It was a little annoying that the guide tell us what to do or how to do .
Moving in groups was also uncomfortable .
I could not talk personally in the bus .
I needed to be quiet too .
Most of the adults were asleep while moving .
The sights of the Austrailia was beautiful and all .
However , I could not enjoy myself during the vacation due to the group led by a tour guide .

The expense of the traveling also increased .
According to a research done by Korean journalists in Josun Ilbo , the amount of money spent increased when traveling with the guide .
The reason is that the guide always temps the guests to by gifts or decorative things that are useless .
About 82 percent of the people responded that they bought a gift that was unneccesary .
This is all because of the travel guide , who is trying to gain goods by selling the gifts to the guests .
I had experienced once , and spent 50 dollars on a useless decoration .
So I did not travel with a guide while the visit in New York city .
And this time , I did not consumed anything unneccesary .

Traveling is to relax and enjoy themselves .
The vacation should not be interrupted .
Traveling in group may feel really uneasy .
I can not enjoy my private time .
Also , I do not need any travel guide that always require money , and temp me to spend some .
I would like a vacation for myself , that is not bothered by anything or anybody .
