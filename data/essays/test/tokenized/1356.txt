some people try new things and take risks in every step of their lives but others do what they knew .
I agree that taking risks and try new thing is good instead of doing what the knew .
In this assay I am going to give some reasons why I feel this way .

while trying new things , we can lean about new things and we can learn to utilise them in our day to day life .
Trying new things is risky but without trying we can not move forward .
we can not invent new things .
For example I learned computers seven years back and now also I am leanrning new software .
By using computers I am using latest technology .
I am searching internet to get information for my studies and I am talking with my friend in the forien country with out cost of single pennie .
Without computers it is impossible .
I learned typewriting 10 years back .
If I stick with that with out try computers , it is impossible to do all those things .

Learning new things will help us to build our career .
Technology is improving day to day .
So we have to be upto date our resume .
Without learning or trying we can not get jobs .
If we want to become successful we have to try new things .

We get confidence if we try new things .
Our personolity will develope .
Confidence is very important to become successful person .
We will become success in any field if we have confidence .
We do't know until and then we climb a mountain ; we can climb it or not .
So trying new things is good .

So in my opinion , people shoud try new things and take risks to become successful in life .
By doing new things we get confidense , in biulding our career and in learning newthings .
