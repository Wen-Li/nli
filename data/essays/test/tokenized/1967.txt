Nowadays media play a more and more important role in our daily life , as we are exposed to it almost all day long , whereever we go .
The economy of course makes use of this by trying to influence us with advertisements .
This however raises the question , whether the products advertised are actually as good as they are promised to be .

One might think that the quality of an advertisement reflects the quality of the product , because if the company has much money to spend on the advertisement , their product sells well and thus needs to be good .

This however does not necessarily need to be true , as one soon discovers a loophole in this theory : if a company for whatever reason has a lot of money in the first place and can spend much of it on an advertisement , people might think that the product is good when it actually is not .
And yet the company makes profit and can now spend even more money for advertisements for bad products .

The sole intention of an advertisement is to influence the consumer to believe that the product is good by praising it and hiding any facts which might hinder this effect .

But I think it is very well known that ads tend to lie .
Computer animation and special effects can easily be used to make a car appear shiny , fast and powerful , driving in a beautilful landscape to create the illusion that this car is good .

There are many ways how advertisements can create desires in us or let us think that a product is good .
For instance the usage of colors when advertising medicine : one would rather buy medicine advertised with white and blue colors , which makes us think that it is clean and sterile , than one advertised with dark colors such as brown , which one associates with dirt .
This however does not give any information about how well the medicine works and yet one prefers the first one just because of the better advertisement .

So in conclusion , I believe that the statement that advertisements make products seem better than they really are is true because of the many ways to incfuence the consumer without him noticing it .
