According to me it i agree with the following that successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they know what to do well .
as they are mantioned as successful people already they will be succeeding in major parts rather than failures .

As the people are successful , they can try new things .
i am giving some examples to support my view .
i have a persona experience with these type of people .
my father is the person i saw coming out every time with new ideas , but still he is successful in the major times .

Actually my father was a businessman .
he has started restaurants when he was young .
he succeeded in that by giving wide variety of food and good experience for the people who visited those restaurants .
at some time he recognised lot of bachelors living in one of the areas in our city .
he understood that those people can not afford more money for the food in the restaurants and started take away centres for them , in which there will be no section to eat .
so that it requires a small space and low budget .
he gave some quality food there at low price and all the people started visiting them and buying foods .
this is one of the risk 's took by my father , as that area is so costly many people advised my father to leave that idea , but he did not give up and succeeded in his own way .

Another example we can consider this may be in film making .
some directors make films which are different from their previous one 's but succeed in doing them and getting the acceptance from the audience .

One of the example 's i would like to give is that of a director named shankar in india .
his movies will be different from one another .
although if he follows a basic point which is important to the society .
his approach in the making of the film is marvelous .
he succeeded in all his eight films he directed .
one basic example to tell his risk taking is that his budget to the movies .
he directed a movie based on the public awareness of the bribe by keeping a sixty year old man as a lead role and budget of around hundred crores .
but he succeede in making that film and also that film has collected around 350 crores amazingly proving the talent of the director .

so according to me successful people try new things and also take risks to succeed further if also they already know how to do well .
because every person is expecting something new rather than the old one .
