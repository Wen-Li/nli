I agree with the statement that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .
Let me explain why this is so in the paragraphs below with reasons and then give couple of examples that I have faced myself .

Advertisers typically use a very high quality of presentation skills in all aspects .
Be it a radio/TV advertisement or large sign board advertisements seen over the roads , they try to capture the viewers/listeners attention very well .

A lot of research is done prior to the making of the advertisement as to how should the attention of consumer segment that they target for be caught .
It is now very well realized fact among advertisers that unless they have something novel presented , it may not be able possible to attract the attention of the consumer because of the over exposure of advertisements that a consumer is facing today .

Advertisers make use of the latest technologies and audio-visual techniques to display even extraneous actions that take place in the advertisement .
Because an advertisement lasts for very short time , it is possible to enact the scenes again and again till a very good presentation level is achieved .

Repeatedly showing the same advertisement also helps in making the consumer makes him listen to watch it is and typically he or she may be attracted to buy the product .

I can now provide some examples as to how an advertisement can make a product much better than what it really is .
I have been seeing advertisement for energy drink called Boost since my childhood .
The brand ambassador is Sachin Tendulkar hits good shots and then says that Boost is the secret of his energy .
It is quite unrealistic to assume that I will become as energetic as Sachin by drinking boost .

Recently , I have come across advertisement of AXE deodarant .
In it , lot of girls come from all over the places to the hero because they are attracted by the odor of the deodarant .
It is extremely unrealistic that if I use the deodarant , so many girls ( or atleast one girl ) will run towards me .

Finally I atttest to the fact that most often than not , advertisements will make the products better than what they really are .
