Advertisements basically are used to promote a product among common people .
Now it is very difficult for a Brand to compete with other brands selling the same product with little or no differences in the quality of products .
So whatever subtle differences that a product has need to be exaggerated to make it look different for the other brands .
In doing so , many a times advertisements make a product look better than they really are .

Yes , I do believe that many advertisements showcase much more than a product can do or better than it actually is .
Many companies rope in big celebrities or sports ' person for endorsing their brand .
It is not rare to see an actor sipping a cola of local brand on TV , which in real life he would even touch .
It is just a way to appeal to common man 's prejudice .
It is done in the hope that the common man seeing his favorite movie-star will also buy the same cola .

Lets take another example .
There in one commercial in which a group of childern are out on trekking and they encounter so called BAN MAN .
One of the group eats a chewing gum and turns into a superhero to fight the BAD MAN .
This obviously is just a trick to play with children 's imagination and lure them to but that product .

There 's one advertisement of a car which is trying to emphasize on its excellent braking system .
To demonstarte that they show the even while moving at 120 km/hr , the car can be stopped by applying breaks juss inches before the cliff .
Sure the car would be having a breaking system which is better than other cars .
But what the advertisement shows doesnt happen in real world .
If anyone was to try doing that , he would surely meet with a fatal accident .

Then there 's an biscuit advertisement in which the child is about to start a race .
His father comes at that very moment and makes him eat a biscuit , eating which the chils wins the race .
Its right that the biscuit is a source of energy but portraying that the child won only because of that single biscuit is kind of ridiculous .

Thus its very much true that many advertisements make products seem much better than they actually are .
