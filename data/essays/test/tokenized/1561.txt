Before planning a tour we have to consider many factors such as number of persons willing to come , places to visit , number of vacanies , route map , vehicle suitable to travel , weahter conditions of places , economic factors . ..
etc .
Considering all the factors a tour can be planned in a perfect way .

It is better to travel in group rather than travelling individually , as it will do many favours to the traveller .

Benefits of group travelling are , we may not feel bore in the journey and we can share experiences and views in travelling time , cost of journey may decrease and in group journey one can help each other in all aspects and can be able to solve problems such as language problems , food problems . .
etc In security aspect also there is more safety in group travelling than individual travelling .
Gropu travelling may provide a lot of fun and joy .
For a travelling guide also it is easy to explain rather than explainig individually .
So many educational institutions will try to arrange group tours where there is a scope to express views .

One important factor to be considered is ` Guide ' who acts as captain to the tour .
A best tourist guide must selected before travelling. `` travelling without a perfect guide is a ship travelling without compass '' .
As tourist guide is familiar with places to be visited he may direct us in a perfect way to travel in aspects such as direction to travel , famous places to be visited in the journey , vehicle suitable for journey . .
etc

So if we travel in group led by a tour guide , definetly that particular tour will give good results and all people in the tour will enjoy it .
So best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide .
