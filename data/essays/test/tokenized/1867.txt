I agree with the statement that in twenty years time there will be relatively fewer cars as compared to today .

The reasons for my agreement to this statement are discussed below .

First and most important reason is the diwndling petroleum resources .
Humans are already usurping up all the available natural resources at alarming pace and its pretty much possible that within twenty years we will exhaust most , if not all , of the available petroleum reserves .
The increasing cost of petroleum products reinforce it .
This will lead to a situation where we will not be having fuel to run the cars .
This automatically will result in fewer cars .

Second reason for fewer cars in future is that in future there will be development of many medium sized cities instead of growth of already disproportionately big metropolitian cities .
For example cities like New york , London and Tokyo are already so huge that it takes too much time to reach city center from suburbs .
Since medium sized cities will be relatively smaller in size , time to commute within it will also be small .
Thus people would prefer to use public mode of transport to commute then driving cars because of lower cost and lesser time required to commute .

Third reason is related to ecological and environemtal issues .
As we know cars are major source of pollution , government and other law enforcing agencies would find it prudent to limit the number of cars in a city to avoid further detoriation to our already wretched environment .

Last reason for possible fewer cars in future is due to increasing population we might have to resort to pedestrian way to commute because for such large populations cars for all people cant be accomodated even when fuel is available .
For example , already such a model is in place in few european cities like Amestradam .
The available space for any new constructions including parking is decreasing all the time .
Thus government agencies might choose to enforce legislation limiting the number of cars in a city to free up more space for housing .

Thus I think there are number of reasons to believe that number of cars is going to decrease in time to come .
