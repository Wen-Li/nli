Do you believed that there is a serious problem in our education that students are taught to the tests ?
Unfortunately , since our society has became so test-oriented , students nowadays are busy remembering facts instead of give their own opinions and ideas , worsely , they lack of the abilities of critical thinking .
As far as I am concerned , I support the idea that it is more crucial for students to understand ideas and concepts than learning facts , and the following are the reasons why .

First of all , I think that learning facts alone does not do any good for students , because students tend to forget those trivial details as soon as they leave schools .
I remeber when I was a high school student , I crammed a lot dates of history events and content in my textbooks in order to get good scores on exams .
However , I realized how useless those facts were when I found myself no longer remember them since I graduated and it does not affect my life .

Secondly , I think student should try to figure out solutions to problems on their own .
Developing such ability requires them to understand things from different perspectives .
Sometimes the idea can be so difficult that they have to work in group and it become a great opportunity for them to learn how to cooperate which teamwork is greatly appreciated in today 's society .

All in all , I conclude that learning facts alone would kill the creativity of students and restrict their thinking .
The successful education should teach students how to think not how to cram facts for tests .
