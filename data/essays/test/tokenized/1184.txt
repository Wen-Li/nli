In this period of rapid social and technological change leading to increasing the life complexity , the use of the cars is increasing a lot .
Many are advantages that these methods of transportation brought in this era , even if a lot of these turned out to be disadvantages .
In other words I think that the extreme growth in the use of cars influencing by new technologies had many positive aspects .
For istance , now in order to reach the work place we can take less time that we used to be in the past , because of speed of cars .
We have a lot of comforts like to not wait at the bus stop a lot of time , to take huge distances in few minutes .
Consequently because of some of these reasons other methods of tranpsort are replaced by car .
Although there are many very effective aspects that can help the human life , nowadays the use of cars caused dangerous disadvantages , such as more and more quick speed that causes a lot of death , emissions of vehicles that produces very negative enviromental impacts .
I believe that cars in use will rise in twenty years because nowadays we adapt ourself in this style of life and there are ways to riduce this use .
The negative effects , as mentioned above , don-t stop us even though surely they have to convince us to limite the use of car .
In addition many politicians established a lot of thresholds standards for emission of vehicles to protect the human health and laws in order to reduce the traffic and to not encurage to take car , but there wasn t very satisfactory results .
It is necessary to require regulations and programms in order to support a sustainable management of trasportation .
In conclusion I believe that the reasons for which we must to reduce the use of cars there are and they are very important for human life and living standards
