I agree with the statement that most advertisements make products seem much better that they really are .
This is because many companies want people to buy goods more and more , so they emphasize their goods 's aspects excessively and at the same time , they hide their disadvantages of goods .
These following three examples are often be seen and decieve peoples precise judgement .

The first example is about contact lenses advertisement .
the story is that the girls who were wearing glasses were always disregarded by men but when she changed wearing from glasses to contact lenses , suddenly the girs became popular among men .
Of couse , all people do not become popular when they stop wearing glasses and change to contact lenses .
this is kind of excessive advertisement .

The second example , in some canndies or chocolate packages , very fresh fruits are discripted but in the fact most of canddies or chocolate do not contain such real derisious fruits and instead , they contain psuedo-fruits taste .
that also tells a lie for consumers .

The thrid example is lottely CM that the man who was poor tried to buy lottely and then he got the No.1 prize and he became richer .
He now lives in castle and hires helpers and eats stake everynight claming `` I could become happier . ''
To tell the true , it is almpst impossible to get No.1 prize , but the lottely company exprain as if we can get No.1 easily .

In conclusion , I showed three paticuler examples but each field of company exaggerates their commodities in order to try to pay attention us and to encourage our consumption .
