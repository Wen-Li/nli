The above statement is completely true .
Advertisements do make most products seem better than they are ; but what else do you expect ?
Advertisements are made by companies to promote their products and convince the consumer to purchase them .
If this means they have to bend the truth here and there , they do not hesitate to do so .
A prime example of this is a commercial i recall from when i was young .

I was watching TV one day when all of a sudden i saw the strongest man in the universe and my personal hero , Superman ; flying thorugh the air in his signature red and blue attire saving the world .
But what was this ? ..
Superman was actually being beaten by an evil monster ! ..
He was ont he verge of death when he removes this energy bar from his pocket and takes a bite of it .
Instantly re-energized he beats the monster to a bloody pulp and saves the world yet again from the claws of evil .
On seing that 1 minute commercial , i went into a frenzy ; I had to get that energy bar immediately .
It had saved the life of my life-long hero .
I rushed out to the nearest grocery shop , only to find it filled with kids my age all there for that energy bar .
When i finally got my hands on it , i found that it was no different from every other candy bar i had eaten .

I was angry at the time about this incident but now that i look back at it , it was not the company 's fault ; but my own for believing everything that came on TV .
That is how advertisements work ; they make people buy the item ; that is what they are meant to do , and now that one thinks about it , that advertisement must have been one of the best ever made !
