I agree with the statement because i am a young person too and i know that i am not giving enough time to help my community .
Nowadays the young people is busy with their school works and entertainment .

In the old times the people did n't have much thing to do so they can give time for helping community even though they do n't want to give .
In old times , movies did n't exist .
there were restaurants but it was n't like today .
there were not so many music groups and concerts or luxery hotels to go .
There were no tv and computers .
Without these things there is not much thing to the in a day .
Because of this emptyness people improve their relationships with other people and with their enviroment , because of that they want to help their community .
In old days the neighboorhood were more important than it is today .

Nowadays people have no need to talk with the people who live in their community .
We have got computers , televisions , mobile phones .
We are always in touch with people we love .
When we go outside there are lots of things to the with our friends , because of that we are not interested in our community .
For example our school has a community service to help some undeveloped villages .
It would be very good to help those villages but nobody was intrested in helping the village because everyone had their own jobs to do with their friends or familys .
Young people decides to their houses rather than helping community because there are so many things to do .

To conclude , lots of things changed in the world .
The people does n't need to be in touch with each other .
They can spend their time by doing anything .
These are the reasons why i agree with the statement .
