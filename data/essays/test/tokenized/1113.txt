Whether it is more important that to understand ideas and concepts for student is important to learn facts ?
Difffernt people hold differnt opnion due to their differnt experice , In my point of view , I think that it is both improtant to abtain the ideas and concepts and to learn facts .
There is no one more important than the other .
In my following argument I will make some commend on the question .

On the one hand , it 's basically for a sudent to learn the ideas and concepts .
learning the ideas and priciples can let us learn the world more comprehensively .
All the later fumual and facts are relay on the basic concept .
Without the concept all the later experment and conclusion are unrealible .
For example , if a student dont comprehansion the theory of ` gravity rull for everything ' .
how can he culculate the speed of the thing drop from the air .
And haw can he find the outer space of the universal .
Ideas and priciples are really the basic theory of the more progressive inversitgation ,

On the other hand , it is also important that the students need to learn the facts .
To learn the facts really can deduce the time we need to explore the world .
There are so many facts and conclusion that had been find and tested for a long time , That the treasure that our presecor leave to us .
If we don'tn learn the facts , all the things need to be find for the individua himself .
It 's a such waster of time and energe .
And no one can make progress not bassed on the fact , For example , at the medical field , there are so many anatomy fact had been dissected and we students ca n't learn anything more without learn the fact , After gather the all the facts we can keep our reserch on humankind .
Then we can contribute to the socialty in our limited life .

So in conclusion .
it is no doult that student need to learn the ideas and priceples as well as the fact .
They are so important to let us know the universal quikly and comprehensively .
They are all the bases that we can excavate the universal more really to the reality .
