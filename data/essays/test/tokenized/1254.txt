I agree with this statement as human being living in this world of advertisements .
The advertisements are crucial for the companies .
In order to survive in this competetive world , they need to advertise their products and hence increase their sales .
But the competition in the world is incredible nowadays .
In order to stay on top and increase their sales the companies need to create new advertising strategies and new ideas .
These new strategies and ideas sometimes go beyond the moral ethics of the industry misleading the people about the products of the companies .
For example a child watching a TV advertisement of a choclate with the spider-man figure on it , can easily think that he can be like spider-man if eats this brand of choclate .
And also some other advertisements create such an image that if you eat or buy or drink that sort of products , you will be very happy , enjoy the life more that the others or suddenly discover the secret meaning of life .
I understand the intend of the procuders of such advertisement as an adult .
But I doubt this is valid for youngsters as well .
They are too innocent and they have too much to learn about life .
In our modern world , what they know about life is what they see on televions , in internet and on magazines .
They need guidance in order to protect themselves from the adverse affects of such communications means .
And advertisements are main parts of it .
But from the producers ' point of view , of course they are right .
They need to show the people that their product is better than the others and maybe it is the best .
But they need to be just and fair and they should not cheat the consumers .
