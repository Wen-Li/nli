I agree with the fact that understand ideas and concepts is more important than learn facts .
Even if learning facts is something important , undersatnd them is really more important and actually very more useful .

I explain , learning something is a processus that implies the activation of your memory , precisely , most of the time , your short-time memory .
Studies have shown that when you learn something `` by heart '' you will forget almost evrything after 2 weeks .
Except if you are very interested about the subject .
In that case , it assumes that you have made the second step . ..
: understand the ideas and the concept .
My opinion is that with the processus of understanding something , you will keep it in your memory longer and that is the most interesting thing .
Most of all it was proven scientifically .
For example , I remember when I was at high school , I hated the physic class because the teacher was n't very clear in his explanations , confusing , nobody could understand him , never .
It results in an exam where people just learned the sheets , by heart .
Finally , now , I do n't remember at all what was this class about .
I thing it is a shame , because if I had understood the purposes , I will first remember , at least some parts but also , I would enjoy it .
Because everybody hated this class and the teacher .

Conversely , I had a very hard and high level of Ancient Greek class , but with a nice and so great teacher .
He explained so well .
When I went out the class , I was able to explain everything to my mother .
For me , things seem immediately easier and more pleasant to study .
Indeed , when you understand what you are learning , it is easier to study it after the class , and to remember .

I really agree with the fact that understand the concept you are learning is very essential if you want to remember it .
I sustain it strongly and think that teachers who know that are most of the time `` good teachers '' loved by everybody , even if the class is difficult .
Learners must also know that because if they only study `` by heart '' they will not go far and are more susceptible to get what we call `` the gap '' during the exam . .
they will suddenly forget everything because of the stress .

I can conclude that understand what you learn is the key to pass the exam and remember it .
It is a shame to waste all these efforts to just forget it after a few time !
