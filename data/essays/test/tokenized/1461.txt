I do agree with the statement that `` Most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are . ''
Some might argue that advertisements merely educate the viewers about the availability of products but I appreciate the fact that advertisements also place the products and make them look better than what they are .
In fact the purpose of advertisements have graduated from educating the potential buyers to make the product look better and create a need for it .
That is exactly why there is a boom in the advertising industry as more companies hire professional advertising agencies to design their advertisements .

Let me consider an example of an apparel brands to establish the above mentioned fact .
An apparel company when advertises a shirt or an undergarment , employs a good looking model to wear and display the product .
It is quite obvious that the outfit would look much better on that model than it would look on any other common buyer .

Another example that I would like to use in strenghthening my point is of ` celebrity endorsements ' .
In the last few decades and increased number of companies have started to employ celebrities to advertise for and endorse their products .
Even in T.V commercials we often see sports or movie celebrities using or talking about a product .
This , is my opinion is an attempt made by the comapny or the advertising agency to make the prodect look better than it is , because it possible that the celebrity himself never actually thinks of the product as highly as he appears to in the advertisement and never uses it himself .
He is merely used by the brand to suggest the viewers of the commercial that the product is as good as for a celebrity of that stature to use it .

Conclusively , I feel that advertisements nowadays primarily make the products look better
