I agree the statement that most advertizements make products seem much better than they really are .
I think ads just need to introduce us how products are or how great product are .
But , it is true , almost all of advertizements are not perfectly true .
I think there are two reasons for using overestimated ads .

First , firms always use ads for selling more products .
For example , if the product is not good one , they can not sell a number of the products with the ad which tells us just how the product is .
But , if they use the ad which tells us the white lies for improving sales of the product , firms will get more money .

Second , all of us dont want to watch ads which describe how the products are .
For instance , if we need to advertize new products , we must not choose the ads whish just explain how the products are but the ads which are overestimated .
It is because such ads are often boring and old .
The ads customers need are like beautiful or brandnew ones we have never seen .

In conclusion , I think there are two reasons for using the ads with white lies .
We choose such ads because we always consider ads as device for improving sales of new products .
