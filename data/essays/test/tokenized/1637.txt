Nowadays , there is a big and important controversy centering on which is more important for students , to understand ideas and concepts or to learn facts .
A large proportion of people contend that the emphasize shoule be put on the ideas and concept .
Other people , on the other hand , argue that facts are more eccential .
Before renderring my opinion , I think it is more prudent and circumspect to take a look on the arguements on both sides .

People who advocate that ideas and concepts are more critical believe that without ideas and concepts nothing can go any further correctly and advancingly .
As we may remember , our test books abounds with a great many ideas and concepts which help us greatly in our future study or even career , such as the defenitions in our physical books .
In the construction , a bridge or building is built according to the defenition in the books .

People who are in favor of the idea that facts are much more indispensable think that if a idea or concept goes without a fact is totally nonsence , so people have to pay a great attention to learn facts .
It is true , the usefulness of things always come the first .
So sometimes the facts is in the first place .
Facts are the important basic of any idea or concept .
Statistic report has shown that sometimes a fact gives birth to a idea or concept .
If you can see that , you will have no problem to understand that facts have their own importances .

Consequently , taking into account of all the reasons discussed above , we may safely draw the conclusion that both the ideas or concepts and the facts are both of great importance , without any of them , nothing could be achieved .
So students should learn the conbination of both ideas or concepts and facts .
