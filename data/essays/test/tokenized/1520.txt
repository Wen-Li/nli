I agree that it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts .
why because understanding an idea gives us a practical knowledge .
it gives us the exact meaning of the idea .
we think that what information behind that idea .
understanding a concept means to know the whole information of the product or thing .

becuse one idea can change our life .
we all know that famous scientist newton , one day he was at the apple tree sudenly one apple was felt infront of him .
he thoght that why it is not going back to same place .
for this he invented an idea that there is a gravitational force on the earth .
today all people around the world accepting this truth .
this concept of earth gravitational force came from the idea of newton .

so it is important for students to understand ideas and concepts .

i disagree that it is not more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts .
because an experience will make you leader in the society .

great person mahatma gandhiji became the most popular person in india becuse of his experiences .
so many freedom fighters struggled hard for the society with revolution but failed to get freedom for the country .
for this reason gandhiji struggled for the freedom with peace and got freedom to country .

so by learning the things every child or person will become the good citizens to thier country .
so this is the best way of doing right things .

finally i would like to conclude that understanding ideas and to learn facts both are important to the students .
so students must choose the right things and give the good name to their families and for their country .
so we all hope that students will do the right things .
