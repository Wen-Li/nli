It is disputable whether it 's better to have a broad knowledge of many academic subjects or whether to specialize in one specific subject .
Both sides do have their advantages and disadvantages , however I think that specializing in one specific subject is better than accumulating broad knowledge .
Thus I disagree with the statement .

Having a broad knowledge means that one has a lot of information and education covering a variety of topics and that one is able to talk and work about these various subjects .

It allows to link various subjects to each other and hence discover relations between subjects or even discover solutions within other subjects that are impossible to find when one specializes just on one subject .
For example aircraft engineers should have knowledge on how a bird flies and on how to convert this information into an actual airplane , so by not specializing on birds or just aircraft , engineers found out how the bird is actually able to fly and constructed planes that are able to do the same .

However broad knowledge obviously means that one never really gets into the depths of a subject since there are just too many other subjects that require attention .
So one could say that a person actually has a lot of knowledge but does not know anything completely .

I prefer specializing even though it has one major disadvantage , one gets lost in one 's own subject and might easily lose contact to other topics and subjects that might be either interesting or important .

Nevertheless I 'd rather be an expert on one subject trying to really get into it and completely understand all sides of it .
I would be able to concentrate on that one subject and might even be able to discover new sides to it that others did n't discover yet .
In other words , specializing may allow for pioneer work , redefining a subject from it 's core .

A good example for this major advantage of specializing is research work which can only work when people decide to specialize on subjects and , once they 've discovered or developed something new , share what they 've discovered with those that work on other subjects .
As a conclusion , specializing on one subject and publishing information and knowledge means greater knowledge for all rather than just an average knowledge for everybody .
