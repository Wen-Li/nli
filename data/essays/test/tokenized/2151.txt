Concerning the written statement I surely agree .

I think that a person who has success must have a new great idea .
Starting from these he must take care to have the following things : First of all a good plan concerning that idea .
He has to choose the target and to calculate and prevent risks connected to the activities he will start .
He must be determinated in order to reach the final point and his determination must be so great to affect other people around him .
Last but not least , he must know very well the details of the field in which he will operate .
I think that a successful person should have those three charateristics .
And that is why I agree with the phrase .
Even if , as you can understand by the words above , in my opinion it 's a necessary but not sufficient , condition .

However I think that a practic example is better clarify the ideas written above .
If a person wish to begin a new activity ( for example a commercial activity ) he must sutisfact my three rules in that way : The purpose is to create a new product to sell .
In order to do that , the three points could be that :
1. he should find the better way to get the goods he 's decided to sell ;
2. he should be able to tell people why the goods are better and why people should buy his goods :
3. ho should know very well the standars of field where he operates and the rules of a good commercial man .
