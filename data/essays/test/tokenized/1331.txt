While I am a children , I was always thinking about schools and how unnecessary they were .
I think the reason that made me think this way was , I was memorizing the information that is tought me for my life .
I can still hear my ideas about my complaints from my childhood .
Now I understand better , I should learn , whatever I need , by understanding .

At first , we should know about that why we we are learning , why we are going to school or why we are sending our children to education places .
Are they , for our entertainment or in order to keep our children from bad habbits or hazardous things .
Absolutely no .
Of course our ideas base on knowledge we want them to learn or we want to know .

What is knowlege ?
The knowledge , information , is the things we experienced before .
We are learning because someone already discovered , found , experienced and lived .
`` There is no big stupidty , testing the things experienced before '' .
We are always providing better knowledge for our nations and generation to hepl them to advance to superiour and while we doing this we are racing with time even we do n't realize .
when we focus on our education and the way we learn also as a comparation to my childhood years we should understand ideas and conceps we learned .
When we understand something , it means to I consume that knowledge and digest and make it my part .
If learn something as a fact , it can change with another fact we met at the future and it does n't be stable .
In addition , it does n't help us develop our future .
we always play with same ideas because we we did n't learn it when we are suppose to .

Finally , it is more important for me to understan ideas and conceps than it is for them to learn facts .
It 's more helpfu
