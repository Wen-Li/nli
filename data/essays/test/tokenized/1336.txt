I agree that in a group led by a tour guide is the best travel for following reasons : tour trip by a tour guide is the most efficient travel and give joining travelers safety .

Firstly , tour trip is the most efficient travel because there is no vain having the schedule in tour trip .
In case of sightseeing , it is shortest time that travelers can watch sightseeing by my experiences .
For example , I want to introduce the bus tour by a tour guide .
I just ride the bus and I can travel in the sightseeing place .
I do not need to watch maps and to buy a guidebook because a tour guide can lead me to my destination .
Moreover , I do not reserve my seat for the bus and hotels because the bus tour is included .
I only join a tour trip and I travel efficiently .

Secondly , a tour guide give me safety .
There are a lot of accidents duing traveling , especilly abroad where I can not spoke a native language .
For instance , I traveled in French two years ago , when I had the accident that was broken my left leg durin traveling .
However , the tour guide brought me to a hospital and she told breaking leg of my circumstance to a doctor .
I did not speak French and know locating hospital .
She provided safety for me .

In conclusion , I agree that a group led by a tour guide is the best travel because the trip is the most efficient and give me safety .
