Successful people are the people who knows to dream and how to make their dreams true in the work they are trying to reach some success .
Therefore , a succesful person must have wide open dreams and always try to find new things , even it may be risky for one major reason : not to be bored of what they have already known .

In today 's world , business life has very hard and intensive conditions for a person to become successful in the work and spend time for other things , such as personel interests , at the same time .
Furthermore , although some famous and successful artists and singer stars look to have very comfortable life and do whatever they want , yet it is not very easy that they look .
Most of the successful people in both business world and famous people 's world do n't choose the way of doing new things , since they love to do what they have already know .
Consequently , there a lot of unhappy people , even though they are very successful people in their jobs .
What is more , if successful forget their early ambitions in their jobs , their lives begin to become very boring , since they give up dreaming and searching for new things .
For example , if a middle aged successful bussiness man spends all of his time for his job , instead of spending for some other hobbies or occupations of him .

As a conclusion , even though successful people know their jobs how to do well , they must try and spend time for other occupations by using their imagination to enjoy .
I hope , all successful people will know how to spread the success to their lifes as happiness in their shinny lives .
