Advertisers are constantly developing new ways to reach consumers .
At every stage in their life , individuals in Western societies are targeted by companies trying to interest them in a particular product and trigger a purchase .
But lately , consumers have begun to question the ethics behind mass-advertising , and advertisers must closely monitor the validity of the message they are conveying .

One technique constantly used by advertisers is to exaggerate the benefits provided by a particular product .
One Coca-Cola commercial depicted a young man with glasses and rather unstriking features suddenly turn into a tall , handsome , God-like figure after drinking a sip of the beverage .
In another commercial , a simple car ride was made out to be a magical journey through space .

These types of commercials are rather unsubtle , and can even be unproductive .
Image a child 's disappointed when they realize that buying toy dinosaur does n't transport them back to the Jurassic age ?
When consumers are disappointed with the services offered by a particular product , or feel deceived by a commercial , they are n't likely to repeat their purchase .

One text-book example is the American Train Company 's advertising campaign to boost train use about a decade ago .
The commercials featured a beautiful steam engine cruising through the snow .
Inside , a romance was developing between two teenagers snuggling in their luxurious seats .
Plane users were so excited by what they saw that they started using trains in massive numbers .
However , as soon as they got on board , they realized how far away the commercials had been from the truth .
They were so appalled by the quality of the service , that most vowed never to use a train again !

Advertisers are realizing that consumers do n't like being lied to .
Many are trying to run more ethical advertising campaigns .
Avis , the famous car rental system , was tired of trailing behind the market leader , Hertz .
Rather than putting out yet another over-the-top marketing campaign , they decided to tell the truth , and used the following slogan : `` We 're number two , that 's why we try harder '' .

An advertisement run by a recent French Internet provider , Neuf Telecom , mocks one of their competitors ' commercials , which features an attractive blonde female whose sole purpose is to catch the eye of males .
Neuf Telecom uses humour to show how irrelevant this is to what the company is selling .
Therefore , there is a growing trend amongs marketers to avoid exaggerating a product 's benefits .

In conclusion , alot of advertisement is still wildly exaggerated .
Many marketers still think that consumers will believe anything .
However , some have come to realize that once you lose a consumer 's trust , it is very hard to win it back , and are developing new methods of advertising that do n't over-sell the product .
