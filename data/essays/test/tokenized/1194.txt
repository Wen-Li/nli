Yes i agree with statement `` The best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide '' , this is because if we travel alone and with out a guide you will get bored and u will feel lonely in the tour .

And according to me , when i went to tour with my friends i enjoyed lot with my friends sharing the experience and feelings and make me more intresting .
The best way is to hire a guide so that he will explain the things which we are going to see and which we are watching , because none of us didnot went to that places and none of us known about the history of that palces .
If we hire the guide he will explain the history of the palces and play some jokes on that and make the tour more lively .
And when i went to the banglore city alone for some purpose i have to saty alone for 2 days and i was pretty bored on 2 days .
If i went to banglore with a group so , that my two days will more enjoyable .

Lastly , i would like to conclude that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide , so that the tour will more lively and tour guide will explain all the thing about the tour and the site which we are going to watch and the tour will be well planed by guide and all the time schedules and all other things will be seen by the tour guide .

And by using the tour guide there is no problem of missing the site seeing places and wounderfull things because the tour guide is the professional in that .
So if u travel in a group you are going to make the tour more enjoyable and gives ur most unforgatable experience with your group .
