I agree with the statement that in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use then there are today .

The first argument for the support of statement is very obvious .
Everybody is aware of the present oil crisis .
Due to the depletion of the major oil fields the cost of oil is rising at an ever increasing rate .
And there is no reason to believe why this trend should not continue .
In a few years time access to petrol and diesel will be limited for only the elites .
And presently , the technology for drivivg cars is based on the petrol and diesel engine .
So if there is no oil , there would be no cars .
After some time only the rich will have the priviledge of driving a car .
Cars would soon be objects of museums .

Of course one may argue that by 20 years , technology would have advanced and there would be no need for cars to run on oil .
We would have cars which run on solar power .
Yes , technology would have sure advanced a great deal by then .
But if the tecnology will advance to an extent where we 'll have solar cars , we can also argue that by then man would have produced solar planes which will be within reach of common man .
And obviously solar planes will have many distinct advantages over car .
First , it will be a lot faster annd safer .
It will also solve the traffic congestion problem due to the availability of vast open skies .
Moreover it will aslo help to lessen the great problem of availaibility of space due to the population explotion .
Obviously , the vast amount of space used up for construction of roads can be used for other purposes .

Therefore , if you believe that technology will not develop then also we will see fewer cars on roads , and if you believe that technology would advance , then also we will see fewer cars on roards .
