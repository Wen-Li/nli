If I were to answer to this question before I attended the university , I would definitely have answered yes .
However , in course of time , my judgements of advertisements became more strict and as my understanding of advertisements have changed in considerable amounts .

Back then , I assumed that advertisements , no matter what their level of quality and sophistication are , could warrant that a product would look better and be sold immediately .
Think about it !
At the time , you see the product being advertised , you get influenced and are convinced to buy it .
However , what if the way the product is made look better than it actually is , is totally silly ?
Would it not fail to

Now that I think about my previous thoughts and try to answer the question above , I realize how wrong they are .
As a more critical consumer , I believe that the advertisements aiming to fool consumers by showing the products better than they are , do not go unnoticed by the consumers .
In other words , consumers can easily recognize when advertisers are exagerrating the features of a product .
Then , the reaction to the advertosement would be : How silly is that !

In order to prevent such reactions , the advertisers , especially the ones that are expilicitly tried to fool the consumeres , should take the consumers ' intellectual level into considereation .
Maybe , they manage to make the product seem better , but they forget to pay attention to the attidute of consumers .
As a counter reaction they might reject to buy the product not anymore .

To sum up , my insight into the advertisements is that they try to make he product look better than is but most of of them fail to succeed to convince the conscious consumers .
As a result , the product would seem exagerrated and some consumers could reject to buy it .
