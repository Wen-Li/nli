How the successful people to be success ?
It is because they try new things and take risks rather than only doing what already know how to do well .
Why I agree with that ?
This essay will discussion my reasons in more detail below .

First of all , when we try new things , it means we have a new challenge .
New things are what we did not learn it or know it before , so we will have a wish and confidence to do it .
For the new challenge , we would try to use different methods to achieve it .
During the process of trying different methods , we learn somethings new and get improvement , and become success .
For example , Edison was a population sciencist who was the first one to made of electric light .
No matter others say that was impossible , he tried to achieve it many times and never give up .
Therefore he is succesful and make a light for everyone from now on .
Without his trying , we could use the light to do everything anytime .
Our society will not improve and new technology will not occur .

Moreover , people who try new things and take risks are always success .
Let me show an example for me .
Mary is a top student in my class and she got extremely hihger marks in every exam .
All my classmates did the review of the books only and which we supposed to know as well , but she got some more extra practises for the test .
Some of the questions was found outside from the school book , she would like to do them and ask to the teacher .
Because she tried many new things , she got a higer result int he examination .

In conclusion , if we try new things and take risks , it is more easier to achieve successful .
It is because we try to do new things , it is a challenge for you to get experience and improvenment .
Solving all the new things and risks , you will be a successful people .
