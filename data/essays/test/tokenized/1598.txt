I disagree with the statement that it is better to have broed dnowledge of many academic subjects that to specaileze in one specific subject for many reasons : well-organized for the main subject , avioding students from what they do n't like to study , and other academic will be forgotten .

Initially , if a student studies only the academic subject which he likes , he will definitely be creative in his subject .
For example , I have a cassmate who adores chmestiry and gets a very high marks in chmestiry .
Unfortunately , he has to study biology which he really does n't like , He failed in the foundation year in the university because of the biology albeit he got high marks in chemistery , As a result , he could study only chemstery and pass the foundation year ,

Second , if a sudent study only one subject , he will definitely be a well-organized in this subject , In addion , he spare their time doing the same subject and have extra informatoin about the only subject which he chose to study .

Third , the extra academic subjects , which are not used during the jod , will be forgotten , So the students do n't need these academic subjents which , in my point of view , waste of the student time .

From the infomation given , it 's not true that a student can have broad knowledge of many academic subjects if he studies many subjects because students get bored of the subjects which are mandatory to study in the university and we can aviod them from failing in the couses which they do want to take .
In brief , we can make better and creative students if we let them study the subject of their faild .
