I disagree with the statement , and think travelling without tour guides is better .
I have travelled with my friends a lot , and I was in a group led by a tour guide for several times , and it have a number of weak points , while travelling without tour guide have strong points .

There are two noticeable weak points of travelling with tour guides .
First of all , the quality of explanation of tour guide is not good .
I compared the explanation of tour guides with the explanation of a local person , and the explantion of the local person was more interesting and had more details .
Second , tour guides have strict plans .
While travelling , we may have some spots that we want to visit .
However , the tour guide only visits some landmarks of the area , and we may miss some spots we want to visit .

In contrast to travelling with tour guides , travelling without tour guides have two strong points .
First , we may visit where we want .
For example , we may visit places that no tour guides visit .
Next , travelling without tour guides is more likely to have our own experience .
If we use tour guides , the experience that we have may have several similarities to other people who have used the tour guide .
However , If we travel without them , we may have our own unique experience .

In conclusion , I travelled with tour guides , and they have have two weak points , while the opposite case have two strong points .
If we travel with tour guides , we have to listen to low quality explanation , compared to explantion of a local person , and we may miss where we want to visit .
In contrast , if in the opposite case , we may visit where we want , and we may have our own experiences .
I disagree to the statement for the reasons above .
