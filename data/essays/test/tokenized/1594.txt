Students study in school just want to learn more and new knowledge and experiences .
Some people think it is important to understand ideas and concepts while studying , however , some people do not agree with it , they think it is more importan to learn facts .
In my opinion , I prefer the first idea than last one .

Firstly , students understand ideas and concepts can imoprove their intelligence .
They can know the knowledge clearly .
People who study only want to learn the facts , mybe , they do not know the profound of the concepts that will preseven the students ' development .

Secondly , students understand ideas and concepts will make they go on to futher education more easy than some one who do not .
Because they can know the knowledge clearly and develop the it in a high lever .
Futhermore , they will advance the some aspects in the word after they gratuated from the shool , such as industrial , medical care system , secience research and so on .

Lastly , students who understand ideas and concepts means they know the essential of the knowledge .
Thus , they can passed their knowledge and experience generation to generation .
Therefor , our culture will be consevation .
All in all , students to understand ideas and concepts is more important than to learn facts .
Not only in the people 's intelligence but also in the future of hunman 's development .
So , as my respect , it is impotant to students to understand the ideas and concepts while studying the knowledge .
