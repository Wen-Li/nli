People might think commercials are relyable and that ; s because many people buy their objects by means of advetisements .
Or maybe , there is no choice but to believe in ads because it takes too much time to get true information about every single of goods people buy .
How it is , I can not help agreeing with the above-mentioned statement , `` Most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are '' ,

As long as people do n't forget the basic , most ovious purpose of the advertisement , it 's not an astonishing thing to confirm that their daily consumptions ca n't satisfy them often .
I mean through the TV ads or paper publications , people get the information of such and such things , but people frequently become upset with what they really got to have .
In other words , advertisements are bound to atrract people , they have to make people to spend money on what they are showing .
That 's why they use big stars , fliry comments , shining packages , and so on .
These things cleary show what the ads use tricks to make their prouducts a lot better that they virtually are .

Thus , there are many Consumer Center as well .
It seems sudden firsthand to talk about Cunsumer Center here .
But , honestly , it really stands because of this problem ; people get disapointed with products which are viewed as totally different from what they saw through commercials .
Center deals with these happenings .
They typically try to protect cunsumers from being deceived by conmercials which make products look `` too '' much better than they are in reality .

Taken in this sense , product ommercials make up their goods in purpose .
