`` The best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide '' .
I partially agree with the above statement .
Every individual have their own opinions and their own intersts regarding the tours .
Some people dont feel comfortable in a group and some feel more comfortable in a group .

People who wants to know everything about a place would prefer a travel guide with them .
For example , some people feel to explore the historical places .
They may be interested in knowing the history of the places and the myths behind the constructions and the monuments .
For such people , a travel guide would be much helpful .
He would help the tourists to know the significance of the place and also the story behind each construction .
This helps the tourists to gain the knowledge regarding the art and culture of that place .

The people who travel with their family in a vacation for a limited period of time would mostly prefer a tour guide .
They feel that they have less time and should explore the whole place without wandering unnecessarily here and there .

Some people like to know the places on their own and explore the finest parts of the place .
They feel uncomfortable in a group .
The person may be interested in some place and the tourist may explain less about that place .
Sometimes the person may feel to enjoy the beauty of the place and would prefer privacy .
But the group tour doesnt alloe it .
The tourists may also get bored on listening to the words of a tour guide .

Some people may travel to the places very familiar to them like devotional places and the places near to the residence .
This kind of travelling does not require a tour guide .
Its just waste of money .
