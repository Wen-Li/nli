I agree with the statement that successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well as the following reasons .

First , trying new things and taking risks give us new oppotunities to success .
For example , when I was a senior student in Waseda university , a private university in Tokyo , Japan , I went to Yeonse university , a private university in Seoul , South Korea for study for a year .
At that time , economy in Tokyo was not so bad and I had some chances to get job instead of flying to overseas .
But I did not enter the company in Japan and visited Korea because I wanted to learn korean language and culture very much and expand my horizen .
Actually , that was very risky for me , because I did not have any preparation after I graduated from Korean university .
However , I have never lose my job since I graduated from the university .
Additionally , I found my wife in Korea too .
If I would have not been to Korea , I could not have gotten such a happy life .
So I believe that trying new things and taking risks is important for being successful people .

Second , trying new things and taking risks can be a chance to find people 's own preference .
For example , I have changed my job three times .
This is not a commen in my county , Japan , at my age 30 .
But , finally I can say with confidency that I could find my best job that I would do this job until I would be able to work .
So , I believe that if people want to success , they need to try new things and take risks .

In conclusion , I strongly believe that successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well .
I will try to enter MBA course next year .
This would be a risk .
