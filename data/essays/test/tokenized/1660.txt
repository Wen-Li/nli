In my view , i think that advertisements are always make products seem much better and more benefical than they really are .

First of all , what advertisements really want is to show the importance and the effect of their products in peopl 's life so they can sell it easily to them .
sometimes they may lie to their customers just to let them buy it as quickly as they can .
it 's like a great movie that they show the most beautiful sceans and forget about the rest of it .
Therefore , advertisements will display what is good and positive about their products and put everthing is bad and negative a side so buyers will not figure it out until they try it by themselves .

Moreover , advertisements are carrying about the money and the profits of their products more than the product it self .
In addition , they dont care that much about the people needs or what they really want .
Thus , they will focus more often on their products profits than its benefits .

In conclusion , advertisements are a way to earn some money even when it 's wrong and untrue .
