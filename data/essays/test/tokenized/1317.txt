I agree with the statement .
Because if you worry about to follow the way everybody does , there were not improvement of our life .
The great inventor Thomas Edison always thought about new things and expalimented his ideas .
He exparienced lots of failures .
Young Edison burened out his fathers shed .
His inside train labatory cut fire .
Most of people laughed at him as a idiot .
But his motivation to charange new things would not dry out .
Now we enjoy lots of gift from his invention .
Without stable electoricity , telephone system and more , our everyday life would be tougher .
Not only edison is the new starter , there are many businesses came out and make our life delightfull .
For example , Starbuck 's coffee is the good examlpe .
I can not imagin if there are no coffee shop like Starback 's .
Many people start the day with coffee .
The cup of coffee often makes people 's spirit up .
When this business first started , maybe there were risks of failure rather than success .
Because of the new business , nobody know how well to do .
But now , nobady doult its success .
So I agree with charanging new things and making new world .
