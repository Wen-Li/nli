Advertisement has taken an important role in modern society .
Nowadays you are confronted with advertisement in all kinds of media : you hear it on the radio and you see in the newspapers , magazines , on TV , the internet or just if you are walking around in the streets .
There is advertisment everywhere and for example some TV-companies are financing themselves only by advertisement .

But are those colorful shining products which we see on TV also the ones we get for our money ?
Or make advertisments products seem better than they really are ?
In my opinion , in most cases , the actually do .

First of all the modern means of technology give the creators of advertisement huge possibilities .
For example all advertisment pictures in magazines or newspapers are corrected by computer programs and it is the same with advertisement films shown on TV .
Sometimes even advertisments for food are completely produced with the computer .

A second reason why I am thinking that prdoucts in advertisments are shown better than they are in real life , is that you need to overemphasize when you want to draw people 's attention to something .
For example if you want to sell your newest car model you will not say : `` This car is cheap , but you do not get the standard comfort . ''
You will always try to make your product look as great as possible .
So in the given example you would therefore say : `` Besides all the comfort you expect an automobile to have , you save the most of your money if you choose this one ! ''

So you can see that every sellsman will always try to point out what makes his particular product so special and why you would have to buy it .
Moreover I think that a lot of people even like it the way it goes .
Because people do not want to see just the realistic life sometimes ; they want to see a little bit of a more glamorous and better world .
