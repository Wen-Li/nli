Whether most advertisements make the products much better than they really are ?
Some people may hold the view that davertisement really do some exaggeration to the products , but other people may donot agree with .
From my point of view , I really agree with the statement that most advertisement do make products much better than what they really are .
The reasons for this point are listed as below .

To begin with , the first reason for my holding this argument has do the fact that most of advertisement just give some introdution to the good respects of the products , but never mention the side-funtion of the product .
For example , you can never find the defeats of the computur though the advertisements of the leveno 's computur and you will be told that some kind of nutrion will do some benefits to your health , but you will regret until you bought them .
So , this kind of advertisments make the products seem much better than they really are .

Another reason for my considering the adertisements always make products seem better than they really are is that the advertisement always exaggerate the quallity of the product and give us some faulse expression on the product .
An apt illustrion of this point involves the car industries .
Some of the advertisement make promise that their products will never have a question and the will always give nice service when there is some questions .
but what the fact is that many bright brand of cars has questions and they are not be found until the accidents happens .

Admittted that the advertisemnts refects the real aspects of the products to some extend , especially for some famouse componies but this can not change the nature of the advertisement .
As we all know the nature of the advertisment is to encourage the consumers to buy the products , so if the advertisements can not change the expression of the peoples ' attitude to the products , this means the products are not secceed .
So , to achieve the ideal effection , most of the advertisement broaden the adverantages of the products and diminish the disadvantiges of the porducts just throuth the artifical methods , which always make the products seems more better than they really are .

To sum up , from what we have dissussed above , we can draw a conclution that most advertisement make products much better than they really are , not because they the nature of the davertisement , but for the reason that most of the advertisment just give some discribe of the good aspects of the product and to somewhat exaggerate them .
