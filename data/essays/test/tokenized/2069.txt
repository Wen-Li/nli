I must say that I agree with the statement .
The students have to understand ideas and concepts when they study something .
I have several reasons why I agree with that .
If you understand the ideas and concept , you can expand your acknowlege , learn the true meaning of the fact and memorize longer .
I will illustrate about that in detail .

First of all , you can expand your acknowlege if you understand ideas and concepts .
For example , here is an word , ` outdoor ' .
When I was middle school , I just memorize the meaning of the fact .
However , if you understand the concept of each word. ` out ' and ` door ' , the word , ` out ' means outside of home and another word , ` door ' means home or inside , you can expand the word outgoing , outsider and something like that .
You just understand the each concept of words and then you can also understand other words that has similar pattern .

Second , when you try to understand ideas and concepts , you study much more a lot .
That will simply be explained because just learning facts is easy .
However , It is really hard to understand the inside meaning of the fact .
You have to look up the internet or books at the library .
That means you should do researh more on that and also you can learn more .
Through the this time , you can exactly know the fact .

Finally , you can keep something that you learned much longer in your brain .
Through doing research on it , you may look the fact many times and ponder on it .
These things make you think and last something you learned .

In conclusion , I totally agree with the statement that it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts .
As I mentioned , the reasons are that expanding your knowlege , learning the true meaning of the facts and keeping the knowlege longer .
I really want student to study and understand ideas and concepts when they study .
If you do that , I 'm sure you will be more logical person .
