A very important question for people whose have the opportunity to travel is how to do it ?
In a fixed group with a fixed program and a tour guide or alone .
Each answer has its owns possitves and negative things .
To analyzed them and after decide which is better ( actually , I will give my personal oppinion , which does not mean it is the correct for everybody )
I will first described the two options .

When you travel with a group and a guide , you have the opportunity to learn some things that the guide knows .
For this to be true , it is very important to get a good guide , because if you do not get a good one it will be a waste of time and money .
If the guide is very , but really , very good , you will go to places otherwise you will not have the opportunity to know .
Other benefit is that you will be with other people and maybe it is possible to find some new friends .
For this , it is important to try to travel with a group composed of people you thing you will find identify with them .
The negative part is that you will be fixed to a schedulled , that probably you do not like it completly , and will not have the opportunity to make some changes at the act .

If you travel without a guide and alone or with a known group , you will have the option to do whatever you like at the time you like and the rhym you want .
In the other hand , it is possible to do not learn a lot of intersting things and visit some places .
But , all this could be fixed if before the travel , you make a little bit of research .

I think is better to travel without a guide ( to have some liberty ) but with some friends cause , it is always better to not be alone .
But it is very important to know , before the travel , something about the place that is going to be visited .
