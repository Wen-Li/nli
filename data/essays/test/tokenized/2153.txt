In my opinion , it is more important for a person to have as much extensive knowledge of a variety of academic subjects as he or she can because of two good reason .
Firstly , it could be considered to him and others as his background knowledge and experince of life .

Secondary , some knowledge of everything is preferable that one might somebody by in need of the use of the type of knowledge , and employ it in his or her own life .
One the other hand , being especialized in only one subject and forget about knowing alittle from there might make someone ignorant when he or she is exposed to situatiions where he or she is required to give an answer to general knowledge question .

Our lives are not limited only to what is stated in books and what he or she is specilized in .
For example , when people gathered at my sister 's wedding , they discussed the effect of droughts not only on land and animales , but also on economy as a whole , althou the national product opf saudi Arabia has nothing to do with rain .
People were ionterested in the subject because it will definitely affect their every day life .
For example , their prefered diets will ; be negatively affected .
This has nothing to do with what is in books but rather to their general knowledge about how things are complicated in a way that they may seem not so .

Another example is that when we have a broken car .
We may run to call the car agency or someone who might be able to repair it even temporarily .
On the other hand , if we had that little knowledge about how the system of a car functions , we might be able diagnose the problem and have some .
