In my country , Korea , students are busy memorizing all the numbers and other specific information .
It is , however , now changing and people give more credits on creativity because creativity is necessary to succeed in the global society .
For creativity they should have open-mindedness and for this , students should know the ideas rahter than facts .
I agree that it is more important to get the idea of concepts that to memorize facts , because ideas results to innovations , and they can be remembered for a long time .

Nowadays , it is a global trend of education to try to make students more creative .
They stimulate children 's imagination and make them become more innovative .
In order to do this they teach general ideas and background knowledge that would be fundamental for further imagination .
Edison was n't an well educated man , but still , he could invent more than 1,000 inventions .
He thought if he would be able to transform sound into physical form , and this made the phonograph .
He did n't know specific details but he had some basic knowledge for creativity .
He had the concept of what he should do .
Moreover , he found out facts , and did n't learn them .

Facts such as numbers or years are easily forgotten unless it 's repeatedly memorized .
Whereas ideas stay in the memory much longer .
For long term consequences , it would be better to know the general concept not the specific facts .
The facts can be found through researching , instantly through the Internet , as long as you know the what you should look for , which is the idea .
Once , I had an important math test .
I tried to memorize all the equations which was nearly impossible unless I 'm an I.Q. elevated person .
Instead of that , I tried to know the concepts , not the facts for a few days before the test .
During the test , I could find out the facts as solving the problems , understand how those equations came out more detailed and also recall them longer that the other times when I tried to memorize the specific details , Through my experience , to know the idea seems better .

Knowing the concept is the same as being able to see an entire maze and knowing the fact is the same as just looking at a wall .
To come out , you should be able to see the whole not a part .
As far as I 'm concerned , I believe that to have the knowledge of the idea would be more beneficial .
