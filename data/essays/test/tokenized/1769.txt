I think everyone could be `` the world 's master '' , or at least he has the qualities to gain that title .
What is the meaning of this phrase ?
It is easy : I think people often give up for varied reasons .
Sometimes there are no way to overcome the difficulties , sometimes they have fear and create a lot of thoughs to justify themselves the absence of tries .
Often men need a justification .
For instance , now I am fighting to realize a dream .
It is the same reason why I am here now , answering this question : I need Toefl certificate for sending the application form to Chalmers University in Sweden .
Yes , it could seem easier to rest here in Italy , with my habits , the italian typical food , the brilliant sun and so on . ..
but at Chalmers there is the master 's programme of my dreams : `` Bioinformatics and Systems Biology '' .
The laboratories , the subjects and the teaching way I would find there are impossible to find in Italy .
And the snow , the long artic night , will be not so terrible , al least I hope .
Now I am trying . ..
I think there is a bit of bravery in everyone . ..
but we need to find it .

I am so resoluted because years ago , after my high school degree I made a big mistake .
I did not try the admission test for Medical faculty : that summer was terrible , my dear aunt was dying and so I did not want to live in future other similar situations in hospital with an ill man/woman and his/her family .
So I decided to attend Telecommunication Engineering faculty .
After three years , my medical interest came back and the unique possibility to do not loose the exams I have done was to change to Biomedical Engineering .
Step by step I am correcting my mistake and I am putting my life on the way I desire .
If it is right or not I do not know , but I will check , you can be sure of this .
