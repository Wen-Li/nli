Maybe most of people on this planet will agree with this statemant .
Because nowadays thare are too many environmental probrems in the world .
Many different countries have many different problems .
But each country has each problem .
So I do not think that if in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today , it is so important thing .

If in a country , there are not so many cars in use , in this case maybe this country is worried about other kind of problems .
For example , water polution .
Because of the water polution , in this country , maybe people can not get safety food as much as they want .
But people have to live .
Therefore they might eat foods which are not sure these are safe or not .
And also adults give children such foods .
For children , such foods are very dangerous .
If they are onle little boys or girls , they may die because of the emvironment .
In this case I do not think the number of car is important thing .

Besides , lately , people care about the number of car .
Therefore we people already did make some kind of solutions for this problems .
And this solution is not so difficult to solve .
Now , what we have to care about is relationship between countries .
Our planet is getting smaller , the ties of countries have to be cared more than the use of car .
We have so many smart people who could solve polution problems or car use .

Therefore basically I agree with the statement .
It is already started and not a big deal .
I think if it will be inconvenient situation , some ideas will be comming up .
I believe in that we have more things to care and we should .
Otherwise in twenty years , we will get a huge serious problems .
