I disagree with this statement and am quite sure that the number of cars world-wide will even increase .

One plausible argument against my assumption could be the energy resources of the world , especially the currently main resource for running a car , oil , is running out in the future .
But this objection can be easily wiped away with the argument that the oil resources will definitely last longer than only 20 years .
Even when the consumption of oil is rapidly increasing currently this wo n't lead to the drying out of oil wells within 20 years .
Big oil companies invest a lot of money in detecting always new oil fields .

Now as this objection to my statement has been discussed I would like to sum up some reasons for my supposition .
In the industrialiyed countries mobility is a decisive factor for people to get a job .
Without a car the job search is nearly impossible nowadays as mobility is a capability which is expected from all job applicants .
As wife and husbond often work at different places there is a basic need for both of them to be mobile and therefore even in the industrialized countries the number of cars will even rise .

But when I am thinking of a rising number of cars , in the first place I have countries like China and India on my mind .
Both countries have booming economies with record profits each year .
This will automatically result in growing incomes and growing prosperity of their populations .
Chinese and Indian people who will have more money will definitely feel inclined to spend their money on luxury goods they were not able to afford a few years ago .
That people in these countries behave like this can even be seen nowadays .
The booming economy has created meanwhile an upperclass which spends its money on luxury goods .
Cars belong to these desired luxury goods also .
When the booming industies of both countries will go on like this with yearly economic growth rates this will generate higher incomes for more and more social classes in these countries .
These people as well will then be proned to display their newly won prosperity with a luxury good like a car .

If we consider the gigantic populations which both states have , we can be very sure that the number of cars in the world will certainly rise very quickly .

Even when this behaviour will certainly result in more air pollution and the running out of resources , this will be a fact which will be disregarded by most people .
To appeal to the reason of people will be useless .
