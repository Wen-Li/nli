I agree with the statement and beleive that successful people try new things . ..

Let us see how successful people are made .
No ones born a millionare .
People have to work hard use their brains , realise their capacity before they venture out into anything , ofcourse there is also luck which plays an important factor in everyones life .
People might be all of the above but yet not as successful as them , the reason well simple plain luck .

When somebody starts out with a business , they have to understand and know what and how things in their respective business is .
They cant start off with loads of businesses right from the word go .
They have to be focused on a single thing in the start and then if they are successful , venture out into other areas of expertise .

One such person who comes to my mind would be Mr. Vijay Mallya , Chairman of Kingfisher brewries , Kingfisher airlines and a whole lot of other organisations .
It wasnt as if he was successful right from the start .
He was 28 years old when his father had passed away and he had to enter the family business without quite a bit of knowledge .
His company was in a loss when he took over and he made it worse as soon as he took over but he hung in there and made a profits after profits every quarter , he was convinced , passionate and had a goal in his mind and it was due to these factors including luck that he is where he is today .
He learnt the hard way and became one of the richest men in the world .

Mallya initially started off with beer and water .
He saw that since he was earning so much why not expand like any other businessman and thats what he did , he acquired reputed alcohol companies throughout the world .
After this came spirits , his company is the world 's third largest spirit company in the world .
Being the successful person he was he wanted to take a risk in the aviation industry .
He started his journey in this industry with Kingfisher airlines which today is one of the largest airlines of India after it bought shares of Air deccan , another player in dat industry .

I woul like to end by sayung thta looking at him u know wy u shud take risls
