Different people have different ideas about the following statement .
Some people believe that the statement is true , so they follow the statement and lecture students .
Others believe that students should know what happens in the world or lives today .
Personally , I believe that students need to learn facts about many things for the following reasons .

First of all , students need to know true things and think about genuine .
If they only understand ideas and concept without thought of genuine , they may produce worse wepons , or they may hurt someone by products which they make in the future .
Therefore , students should deeply think what people and the earth need .

Second , in addition to thinking about genuine of matters , they have to pay attention to surroundings .
They understand why ideas and concepts need for people .
If they can notice why people want the ideas and concepts , they can learn facts and never hurt their families and friends .
I believe that students can change the world better and better by thinking and learning facts .

Third , ideas and concepts should not make students understand .
Students should be satisfied with understanding ideas and concepts .
If students enough learn facts , they can be satisfied with facts , and after that , they will be satisfied with ideas and concepts .

Therefore , I believe that students need to learn facts .
In conclusion , some people do n't agree with my opinion , but I believe that students think about facts more than understanding ideas and concepts .
After that , they can get good understanding and plenty of emotions , and they will never hurt around people .
