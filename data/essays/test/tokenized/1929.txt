Nowadays we are confronting the many advertisement from television or the printed media that make us get much information of many new products .
Some people say that the advertisements are very useful because they gives many information to us .
But I absolutely disagree with that because advertisements make a distortion in order to sell more products .

Two months ago I bought the new MP3 player that I had seen the advertisement of it in television .
The actor was using it very easily and he said that the MP3 player had many new funtion and have a easy user interface .
I believed the advertisement but it does n't take a long time for me to understand that I should n't have believed that .
it was difficult for me to handle the player and the menu system made me complexed .

In addition , a few weeks ago I saw the advertisement of restaurants in local newspaper .
I pick one restaurant that make a delicious food in paper 's photograph .
I choose the PAPA 's pizza restaurant because the pizza in the advertisement 's photograph looked very delicious .
But I received the different one from the photograph 's when I ordered .
That 's absolutely different .
I complained it to the owner of the restaurant .
but he said that the difference was normal situation and I would have same situation even if I went to other restaurant .

In conclusion , I do not believe the advertisement because of this kind of experiences .
I often tell my friends not to believe advertisements .
