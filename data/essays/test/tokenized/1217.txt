I am disagree with the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide .
I do not think the statement by two points .
That is travel in a group and led by a tour guide .

Frist , I do not like to travel with a tour guide .
I think one of the exciting things on travel is planning , but led by a tour guide means almost all of the travel plan is made by a tour guide .
Flight is decided , hotel is decided , schedule is decided , rest time is decided , sometimes suvenier shop is decided !
The only thing we choice is where we go .
It is never joyful because everything is restricted .
Although travel in a group is not so bad , led by a tour guide is so bad .
I feel I am robbed my pleasure .

Next , I do not think travel in a group is the best way .
The reason is I want to do everything freely in the foreign country .
I enjoy what can I do in the foreign country , so I do not want to use mother tongue during the travel .
Furthermore , the most exciting thing for me is `` no plan '' .
I am a backpaker .
So , when I am tired I sleep all the day , when I want to move I go next country or back to home .
I go somewhere I want to go , I stay somewhere I want to stay , sometimes I stay sobody 's home .
These things can be made by traveling alone .

Because of the two points , I do not think the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide .
The best way to travel is `` alone '' .
