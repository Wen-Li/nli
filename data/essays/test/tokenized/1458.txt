Most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .
I agree with this statement 100 percent for many reasons .
` If there is no advertisment there is no life to the people who work in centres and stores , And also for many companies and buissnessmen ' .
Why do i say this ?
Lets think about this example ; if a copmany produce new product , how it will let the people know this product supposing if there is no advertisments .
It 's not important this product is useful or not , the fact is on how much money do the companies lose if these products would n't bought .

Now , what is the onther advantages of the advertisments ?
When all watch the advertisments on tv or on newspapers , we will hurry to markets to buy this product .
And by this way ...
if the product which we bought is really useful to us , that 's mean we will buy it whenever we want and not search for onther one .
From this the advertisment is n't just help the companies to advertise their products but also it will make us more comfortable and wonderful .

What is the ways that can help companies to advertise their products ?
From my point of view advertise their products by make an agree with one of the favourite channels that many people watch it is the best way to do so .

On the other hand not all advertisments we watch is tell us the truth about the products , but when we watch it on the TV , we will be eager to know and buy the product and then the companies will be gained .

Finally if i were in buissnessmen position , i would make sure that all my products will advertise in many diffirent ways .
Because this the only way will make me gain a lot of money .
