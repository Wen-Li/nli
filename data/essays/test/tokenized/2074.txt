Traveling in a group , a group led by a tour guide is the best way a person could travel .
He is assured to have fun as the hole trip will be planed out by the guide leading them .
Thier is also the idea of making new friends , and that if you did n't like on of the people joining you on that trip .
You can always talk to someone else .
It is also benifitial because a person can share his ideas with other people instead of keeping his thoughts and wonders to himself .

The tour guide will be the main leader of the trip .
He is suposed to have thought of every step ahead , and concidered all the possible places to be visited in a certain country of city .
He should take his group to all the artifacts and all the interesting places to go in a certain place .
So traveling without a guide could be very boring and could reach to the point where it is dangerous .
For example a group could end up sitting in a place that turns into a biker boy bas night or they can end up getting mugged or robbed .

While travling in a group is most important beacuse a person could really enjoy his time comunicating with others and learning interesting things about people that he had never met or had n't known much about .
this could also help a person work on his people and comunicating skills .
Traveling in a group with a tour guide is also very benifitial because you can join you thoughts and ideas with others .
While travling alone coud be very dull and boring since you have to keep your thoughts for yourself .

That is why the best way of travling is traveling with the leadership of a guide .
Someone to help you find the rite places to go and to guide you through the beautiful wonders in each and every city in the world .
While the group is to help you enjoy your time , and have some company with you in the trip .
That is why the best way of traveling is with a tour guide and a group of friends or even strangers that you can later on get to no .
