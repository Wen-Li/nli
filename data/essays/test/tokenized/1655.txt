Nowdays young people give enough of their time to help their communities .
Todays world is totally dependent on the youngsters if they stop helping their communities , it would not be an easy task for government to do whole lot of it .

It 's the youngsters only which come out to help on a single call for it .
once when in my colony the conditions started becoming worse to live because of the smell of the garbage collected .
Due to strike of the local government , no official help was availible .
At that time it was youngsters who came out to help and clean all of it , making the place possible for living .
they did a team work which also showed their co-operative power .

Many times young peaple are missunderstood because of the generation gap .
elder people dont like their rash driving , their excessive smoking or drinking , but this has nothing to do with social work which young people do , and should be appretiated by the elders .
I remember the time when the Kargil war was going on between our country India and neighbour country Pakistan .
At that time it was local area youngsters only who helped the soldiers in the war .
they served them food , medical aid , and many more needfull things .
take them on strechers or even in their arms in emergency was something which old people failed to do because of their physical weakness .

On the other hand , young people have always given their best to help people building temples or mosques .
they are the one who collect funds for it .
they also take the full resposibility of building it .
supply of water , cement , bricks all is done by them only .

I would like to conclude by saying that there was a period when young people did n't use to give enough time to helping their communities but nowadays it 's not so , they help their communities , participate in solving relevant problems and give their hundered percent .
