Knowledge is an enlightment on a dark path .
It is good to have knowledge of varied fields .
But , today , its not an era of ` jack of all trades and master of none ' .
One is identified with his profession .
It depends on the stage at which one is , whether he should have a broader knowledge of many academic subject or specialize in one .

If in a school , definetly , one should have a broad knowledge to many academic subjects .
It wil help the student to decide , what subject he is actually interested in .
He can identify his apptitude and choose a field of study accordingly .
This will help him folllow the path which leads to his carrer .

But , if we stress on people in college , i believe it is better to specialize in one subject than to have knowledge of many subjects .
Once a student reaches in college and is out of his teens , he knows what he expects from his life .
His goals are set .
He takes every step carefully and make sures that these steps lead him to the doors of success .
If he tries to study different subjects all together , he might not be able to master in any .
He will be confused with varaity of subjects in his hands .
And what if he is not interested in many of those ?
If one is an engineering student he can not handle subjects like accounts or political science .
A friend i know was practising medicine , it got difficult for him to attend even his music classes , which also taught the history of music .
How could he study medicine and something else which needs him to know its history ?
He finally gave up music .

Thus , if one tries to hold many things in his hands at one time , he might land in a situation where he will have nothing in his hands .
Students in school can handle different subjects but at college level , its not an easy task .
Knowledge is something that is justified , true or believed .
It would be not feasible for them to look for answers to all those justifications .
