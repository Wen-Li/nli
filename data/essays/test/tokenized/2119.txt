`` Imagination is more important than knowledge , '' said Einstein .
He was probably referring to the domain of science , where every trailblazing discovery seemed to be the brainchild of a creative and hardworking genius .

There 's no denying the fact that imagination is more or less useless in the absence of knowledge , because people need a basis , a ` pedestal ' on which they will produce their ideas and test their assumptions .
When saying that he was able to see this far because he was `` standing on the shoulders of giants , '' Newton probably illustrated this fact .
However , what makes Newton the evergreen genius he is , is that he dared to challenge the conventional way of thinking and he changed the scientific paradigm forever .
To achieve this , he studied and thoroughly analyzed the conventional approaches in physics and mechanics , yet he also understood when the old conception needs to be undone .

Let 's hold for a moment the opinion that knowledge is the factor underlying development and success .
In this case , it would be normal to expect that the most successful person of each generation and each field would be the one who has the widest knowledge .
Yet , the story of science and arts challenge this opinion .
For example , the first radiotelescope and cosmic radio waves were discovered by a nineteen year old boy , while playing with a radio in the garden .
The greatest works of art are not always produced by tutors or professors of art and not every art student makes a good artist .
In Turkey , for example , the majority of the acclaimed writers are not formally trained in literature .

Creative thinking and risk taking set the people apart , because conventional visdom is easy to earn and apply .
This results in large masses of people , stuck with what they know and completely unanimous .
Think of it in terms of business , would a businessman have any success without having an experience of entrepreneurship left behind ?

All these evidences lead me to think that innovation and risk taking are the key skills to success .
Otherwise no one would bother doing anything new and we would be stuck with what we have .
As a saying goes , `` Do not be led to think that a group of creative and risk taking people will not change the world .
In fact , that 's the only thing that ever has . ''
