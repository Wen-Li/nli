I agree with the statement that successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well .
On one hand it might seem to be a better strategy for a person to stick to areas that they already know well .
After all , success is usually measured by the person 's productivity , by his or her contribution to the cause he or she is working for .
Taking risks , trying new things may cause a disruption in a person 's productivity for an unkonwn amount of time .
But on the flip side , there are limits to how far one could go by only sticking tho the things one knows best .
Firstly , even though for a short while the person can sustain high levels of productivity , there may be a point in which the products produced using the old skills may become obsolete , they may not be sought after by people anymore .
And at that point it may be too late for the person to try new things .
Secondly , toying with new ideas , trying different things enhances the person 's creativity .
For example , one can combine new ideas gathered while working on a novel technique with his or her former better established skills .
In short the person can gain a broader view in life .
Consider great scientists .
How did many of their great discoveries came about ?
Could Einstein establish the general theory of relativity had he just stuck with the laws of classical mechanics ?
Or could the continent of America be discovered ?
The names we remember today belong to those who took risks and tried different things in their lives .
Einstein took a risk , he could have failed , but that mattered little for him .
He had a vision , and against all odds , given his strong will , he proved he was right .
