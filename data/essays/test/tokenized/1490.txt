Once upon a time , a man said that the earth is not the center of our solar system , but just a planet orbiting the sun just like the other planets .
Now we know that it is the fact , but for the time this idea was presented , it was n't accepted that easily , as we now think of it as a daily fact .

Facts are there for us to realize , but the ideas are the ignition model for them to be realized .
I remember a story about a native shaman , showing the habitants of an island a ship coming from far , the citizens do n't actually recognize , or even see , the ship first , because they do n't have the concept of a ` ship ' in their mind .
The shaman is the only wise person that is guiding the community to realize a new fact .

As this is a story whether true or fabricated , i think that the ideas are really important for students , as much as facts .
In the means of further earning a life , students ca n't actually make a living out of ideas , but they are the things that provide success for their works .
Think of a physics student ; in school , he or she learns concepts , notions of the natures laws , and then cooks whar he or she learns uses this as a basis for understanding mathematical models of the universe we live in , and applies this information to older models to investigate the world we live in further .
After many years of research hard work , eventually , a fact like gravity , or little particles called atoms comes into the focus of the science field .

Without an idea of a ` city ' , i think that the theaters played , or the roads we walk would n't be around .
The important thing is to understand concepts , i would probably agree with that ; although the fact that i do n't have any money to buy tickets for a movie that i definitely want to see .
