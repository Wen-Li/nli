Some people agree that most advertisements make products seem much better than their reality .
However , I strongly disagree that products are advertaised with emphasis for the following reasons .

First , many companies have to inform reality for customers .
If they emphasize their products through advertisements , they should pernished by not only law but also society .
For example , there are many incidents about unfair companies .
To lie about many things where their products made in , when their products made , What they use in their products , and so on .
These behavior destroy their credit from customers and clients .
After incidents , almost companies could not recover their credit and drop out .

In addition , many customers understand what products wiht high quality .
Advertisements give customers only first impression about products .
It is important that customes buy products repeatly .
For example , in my company , oil company in Japan , we do not have many advertisements .
We think that advertisements are not large influence for customers .
We strongly believe that the quality of products and service are more important .
Many competiters use much cost for their products using famous person .
In my opinion , they have to use their cost for developping their new products or quality of products .

In conclusion , I definitely believe that most advertasements make products better than they really are .
