In the following essay I will deal with the question of the development of car sales within the next twenty years , for it has been suggested that , in twenty years from now , there will be fewer cars than there are today .
In the process , I will touch on such issues as environmental polution and technological inovation .

In my opinion the idea that there will be fewer cars in the future can not be seriously entertained .
On the one hand people keep getting more and more convenient .
Despite rising costs for oil and petrol , people tend to go by car even if they are just going around the corner to do some shopping .
Of course gas is becoming more expensive every day , but recent polls have shown that this does not prevent people from riding their automobiles .

Another reason for my thesis is that especially in the western world the car has become a symbol of status and money .
Families tend to possess two or three cars , one for every member of the family .
Also the period of time a car is used by a single owner is becoming more and more brief .
Money is lacking everywhere - but there is always enough to afford a new car .

Of course one may argue that there is a new awareness about environmental polution caused by cars and motocycles .
But , in my opinion , there is always a difference between what people say and what people do .
It is understandable that everyone wants to preserve the environment of our `` blue planet '' .
But most people tend to point the finger to their neighbors or fellow-citizens instead of changing their habits .

New technological inovations might help to preserve the environment .
But that does not necessarily imply that we will see fewer cars in twenty year 's time .
On the contrary , the amount of vehicles driven through the streets of the big cities of this world will increase .
One only has to look at the figures of the population growth the United Nations anually presents .
Whereas the population in Europe and also in North America seems to stagnate we witness an explotion of Asia 's and Africa 's populations .
China alone hosts more than one billion people in 2006 , with a growth of 2 , 5 children per woman assumed for the next couple of years .
As an emerging economic super-power the standard of living in China will rise over the next years as well .
The implications of this development will be far-reaching , though they can not be grasped in all their impact , yet .
But it can be easily imagined that the new millions will want their fair share of the world 's prosperity .
It is only a matter of time until the will long to possess their own cars and vehicles .

In conclusion , it can be assumed that in twenty years from now there will be more cars carrying more people through steadily more crowded cities .
