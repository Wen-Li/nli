Nowadays , in our society , some advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .
Generally it depends on what the product is .

Some products can be made to improve our way of life , like new technologies .
As a matter of fact , some products are not absolutely needed .
For instance , the new apple technology called ` Iphone ' is a new type of phone we have never been using before .
It proposes new functions and this phone is the first of his kind .
Thus , the Iphone would be able to give us new `` thrills '' .
In that case , the person who will receive the Iphone will not be disappointed by the quality of the product because obviously , it would be the first time he sees something like this .
Overall , the advertisement will not be an over `` quality maker '' thus , in that case , it will not make the Iphone seem better than it really is .

However , some advertisements can confuse us .
Actually if we take the example of school 's stuff , it is not always as nice as we thought .
Sometimes the advertisement says `` umbreakable ruler '' whereas it is false .
For example when the children are told that the ruler is umbreakable , they will obviously want to make sure it is true , and oviously , they will break it .
This kind of products do n't make our life level better .

As a conclusion we can say that advertisements generally make products seem much better than they are when the product is useless .
Furthermore , as it does n't raise up our way of life , or does not give new `` thrills '' , we always get to the deduction that the advertisement made the product seem better than it reaaly is !
However , new technologies wich has just been discovered will always get our satisfaction as it is something new .
