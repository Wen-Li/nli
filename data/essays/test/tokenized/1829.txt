Travelling is one of the main source through which we can replenish our feelings .
The best way to travel is to travel with a group and also led by a tour guide .
Travelling and visiting new places is the best recreation time for anyone .
And so it should be justified with endless fun and entertainment .
This is the reason which poses a condition on the way we travel .
Travelling to places alone does not make the right sense of enjoyment .

I would like to explain the reasons for my opinion in detail .
To start off when we visit places with a group we get to know more people and thier behaviour , thier lifestyles , thier likes and dislikes .
This makes the best time pass in travelling in a group .
Also we need to learn a lot about the outside world which is possible only when we travel within a group .

At times of rest or liesure many games will be conducted and lots of competetions are put forward which are the ultimate sources of fun and entertainment .
Also a tour guide plays an important role in such tours .
Without the guidence of a tour guide we may not know all the best places which are worthwhile of visiting .
A tour guide gives a lot of information about the places we visit which includes the details of the place 's history .
As such we gain knowledge about the famous people involved in the construction and development of the monuments .

In most of the tours , those involving waters and greenery give us immense pleasure .
The sight of such places create deep impression on our heart .
One such place is the kodai canal .

Thus i would like to conclude that travelling in a group with a tour guide gives us the most valuable experience which remains everlasting in our memories .
