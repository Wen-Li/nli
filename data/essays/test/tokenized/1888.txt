I agree with the statement .
When we participate in a tour , we do n't need to get a lot of information by ourselves .
It is n't necessary for us to buy guidebooks since the guides will teach us about the history of the place or tell us what kind of food is good .
So we can consentrate on enjoying .

In addition , we do n't need care about food .
I mean when we do n't have any ideas about where we should buy food , we will be uneasy .
But of course the tour guide know where to eat and how to order .
I give you an example .
I am a Japanese and when I went to Canada by myself , I had a lot of difficulty in ordering at a restaurant .
It was not only because I am not a native speakers of English and they could n't understand what I was trying to say , but also because I did n't know the way people living there pay .
The way they pay was really different from the way of Japanese .
It is really difficult for us to know the customs the people living in the place we visit first .
So it is important for us to be able to depend on the tour guides who know almost everything about the place .

And , by participating in a tour , we can make friends with people who also participate in the tour .
We may send e-mail each other after returning to our own houses .
My mother keep in touch with an elderly lady who participated in the same tour .
Their relationship is really good .

Moreover , participating in a tour is much safer for travelors than traveling by themselves .
It is often said that travelors are thought to have a lot of money and they are likely to get robberd .
For me , being able to have only a good memory during trips is most important .
If I get robbed , I wo n't feel go there again .
I am planning to visit Italy this spring .
People often say that there are a lot of robbers in Italy .
I want to enjoy visiting beautiful buildings there and eating delicious pizza .
So I will travel ib a group led by a tour guide .
Then I wo n't need to take a dangerous trains or taxies .
