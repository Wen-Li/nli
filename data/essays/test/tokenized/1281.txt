Ever since man has evolved he is in search of acquiring knowledge and adapt to the modern society by making use of technology which is underdevelopment .
Technology is again classified as various forms and aspects depending upon the application .
In the race of earning money man has acquired businesses and developed products and in order to sell these products in the market he made use of technology in the form of advertisement which is an effective means to sell the goods and products to the consumers .

The advertisement is usually meant to attract the consumer by various means and convince him to buy the product .
As goods have been developed in plenty amounts by various companies there is a need for advertisement which are in competition so that the producer can make maximum profits out of the goods produced by him .
For example there are products which make use of the human emotions because they are developed depending upon the societal needs and the culture of the society .
say for example in a country like india where the people are emotionally bonded so the advertisement industry has to make an advertisement keeping this in view .
whereas , in a country likeUS the people are more practical than beeing emotional and look for technology which is involved in a advertisement rather than the people who are involved in a advertisement .
so , in order to make the products more appealing to the consumers the advertisers make products seem much better than they really are .

On the other hand if the products are more appealing to the viewers through advertisements and they buy the product then it may make money for manufacturers of the product but the buyers are not satisfied upto the level as it was showed in the advertisement .
The above context may even offend the viewers and they may stop purchasing the product based on the ad it showed .
so in this case the advertisers so make a point that they should not show too much about their product than it really is .

Thus , we can conclude saying that advertisers should not show much about a product than it really is because it may offend the viewers and they may stop users buying their product .
so the advertisements sometimes show much about a product than it really is
