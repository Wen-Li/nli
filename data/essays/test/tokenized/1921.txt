Do young people have nowaday fewer time to sacrifice to their communities ?

I deeply think that the response to this question does not depend on the age of people but more on their origins and on the country they live .
For example in a country like the United State people who earn a lot of monney are more likely to give a big amount of their salary to their communities than in Europe .

In fact in the United State people are willing to give money to association because they feel obliged to help when they can do it .

Nevertheless it is true that before people were closest to their communities than now .
Indeed because of lots of thing like the globalization or free markets for example people tend to work more than in the previous year .

Therefore they do not have as much time as before for their communities despite that i think that they don not deslike them .

In my opinion elderly people give more time to helping their communities than young people .
The reason is easy to guess , they stoped working so they can give their time to helping their communities .
Whatever they do they are to me less usefull than young people but their without their help their communities do not work well .

In a word i assume the fact that nowaday young people do not give the same amount of time to helping their communities but there are other parameters like the country they live or the job they do to consider .

Indeed someone who works twenty hours a week is more likely to help his community than someone who work eighty hours a week

That is my point of view
