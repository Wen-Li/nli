I prefer to go by myself .
I like to advance .
I want to go somewhere alone and have special experiences .

If I go to travel with a tour guide well . .
there is no thrill .
It will be more comfortable with a tour guide .
Because New place will be strange .
I might not know where hotels are or how much the bus fee is .
Then a tour guide can tell me how to do .
But I want to figure out by myself you know .
If I do not now I just ask to someone .
I will talk with new people .
That is the special experience !

A group led by a tour guide usally visit only few places .
And they have limit time to enjoy themselves .
So people can not enjoy everything .
When they bigin to feel excited , a tour guide say `` Time to go ~ We are leaving now ~ '' It is not good .
But if I go alone freely I can go wherever I want and I can stay only a hour or all day long .

People have to pay for touring guide .
But if I go by myself I dont need to .
I do n't have to waste money so I can save money .

If I have a opportunity , I want to go to somewhere by myself .
hum . .
then first , I need to save some money for trip .
I want to go to new place and meet new people .
They can be my friends .
How nice !
And I like to take a lot of pictures .
It will be good memories .
