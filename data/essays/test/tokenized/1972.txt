I completely agree with the idea that people who take risks are more successful than those who do new with old .
It is possible to justify this idea by using the example of the music business .

Indeed , whenever a song becomes number one of the charts , it is mainly due to the universe of the singer , the way he writes or sings the lyrics , or it can be due to the introduction of a new feature or style in a current style .
All innovations are sources of success if they are well managed , organised or promoted .

A perfect example of this argument could be Mickael Jackson .
The reason of his success resides in all the risks he took by introducing a new style in pop music , and also by inventing dance steps .
He completely changed the vision of pop music and the way that music was done .
Plus , he introduced the concepts of musical comedy in his video clips .

All the actions he did were not predicted to be successful , but he took his chance and his risks were worth try .
I do not think we would have been so important today if he had copy previous singers .

Today , it is impossible for someone who wants to succeed in the music industry to do what Mickael Jackson did .
In interviews , new famous artists of pop say that they were all inspired by Mickael Jackson , and the reason why they are successful today is mainly due to the fact that they used some of Mickael Jackson 's talent and innovations which they improved and combined to their new features .
All these combinations are risky , but as the statement says `` Successful people try new things rather than only doing what they already know how to do well '' .

Few people in the music industry do things that have been done in the past because they already know that customers want news .
Even if singers sing old songs , they will always try to put new style into it in order to innovate by remixing the instrumentals or modifying the text .

As a proverb says `` Only those who take the risk have a chance to succeed '' which goes in my argumentation way .
