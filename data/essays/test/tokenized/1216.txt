I agree with this statement that successful people take risks and try new things rather than only doing what they already know how to do well .
Then why only successful people ?
I think this is the point I want to discuss on as a main reason .

What makes people possible to try new things and take risk ?
My answer is the capability .
For example , if you are a poor casher at a grossery store and have limited money for living expenses even though you keep working hours and hours everyday , you would have no time to even think about doing something new or creative because of the everyday 's routine and also financially you would not be allow to take any risks because it is not affordable for you .
Therefore , to make people try new things and take risks requires the person 's affordable financial situation , the person 's flexibility to be creative to try new things and the person 's successful background to be brave enough to do something his/her do n't know .
The successful background here means by the area of cultual and academic education because otherwise you would not be able to imagine that something worth to take risks will exsist in our unknown world .

Considering these reasons , I will agree with this statement .
