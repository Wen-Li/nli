L'oreal , Coca cola and nestle 's procucts are under the control powerful structures : advertisememts agencies .
Those agencies spend their time and money studying our tastes and desires , what we need as opposed to what we want .
Do they usually success in their job ?
Do the advertisement make products seem better than they are ?

At firs sight , I would answer that I trully believe that the statement is true , that those products are not as good ad they looked like on the press add or in the middle of the TV show .

To illustrate my point I would argue that agencies that create those advertisement actually know what we want and when we want it .
They perfectly select their target before creating an advertisement and choosing the right time or place to show it .
Have you never have wanted this chocolate bar so much that you finally decided to go and buy it even at minight on a rainy december night ?

But the question is ...
were you deceived or desapointed by it ?
The product could be less good than it seemed but was it because of the advertisement ?
As far as I am concerned I would answer that all is not of the advertisement 's fault .
However , really good advertisements or misleading advertisements make the product seem much better than they really are .
Everything else is somehow due to the consumer 's mentality or desapointed desire .
In the end I believe that the two really different types aforementionned of advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .
For the first category , the really good advertisements , either funny or beautiful , there is quite nothing to do except maybe trying to change the consumers ' mentality , which means the human mentality .

For the second category , the misleading advertisements , rules are now setlled and countries have to respect them on a national and a European level .
As a consequence , advertisements will not be abe to lie but only to play with your desires , which can be controlled and limited by yourself .
One should realize that advertisements are made for creating desire ,,,, and spending money
