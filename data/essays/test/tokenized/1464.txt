I compleatly agree this sentence .
Maybe there are many reason why young people do not give enough time to helping their communities .
One reason because young people do n't spend much time to helping their communities could be that they have to do so many things in their own life , so they have n't too much time to help someone else .

Young people have a lot of things to do in their life .
First of all they have n't so much time to spend out of the school .
They have to do homeworks , and than they often make some activity out of the school like playing some sports or they take lessons about singing or acting or somethingelse .

Secondly I think that when you are young you do n't think people needs your help .
When you are young you do n't want eny help , because you think you do n't need it .
This could be a reason young people do n't help their communities .
Finally it 's correct to say that there are also many young person who help thier communities .
But maybe they are less than who do n't do it .
