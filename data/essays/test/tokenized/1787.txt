I agree that understanding ideas and concepts is more important for students than understading facts .
There are two reasons to support my opinion .
I would like to show in the following statement .

First , study of ideas and concepts lead for students to the ability to adoped to the various situations and fields .
Although facts are important , it tends to be in the limited areas .
Students have a lot of possibility of work places , jobs and careers .
They have to strengthen the ability to adopt to anywhere .

Second , current society becomes specillized in the quite extent .
The materials that student have to study lies in the broad areas .
For example , all the student needs to know the facts of nanotechnolgy ?
On the other hand , the time for student to spend study is limited .
Although there are a lot of graduate schools for higher eduction and it extend the time to study .
Yet , they still have to utilize their time effectively .
Therefore they should focus on the common materials including ideas and concpets and give them priority .

In the concluding , I agree that it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts .
Althougn , facts are also important because they consists the basis of every study , research and so on , I do agree the importance of understanding ieas and concepts by the before mentiones reasons .
