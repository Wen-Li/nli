I love to shopping with Internet .
It is cheaper and more convenient .
However I sometimes get bad items from it .
It makes me really mad .
Not only me but also other peple who do Internet or TV shopping will have same experience as me too .
I believe that companies have to advertise honestly .

People buy things on internet or televisions too .
TVs and Internets advertise products like they are perfect .
However it is not .
It is waste of money if people buy that things , because if we want to return it to money we have to pay extra money to express sorry to them .
It 's unfair .
We wo n't have to be sorry because they did wrong things .
It hurts many people like poor people .
They buy in the Internet or TV because it is cheaper .
However they delivered bad things and then they have to return it with paying extra money .

In my aunt 's case , she bought expensice Mink Coat on television .
It was 1,000,000 won in Korea .
It was too expensive but the advertisor said it is perfect and they will give back our money if we do n't like it .
My aunt belived it , then she purchsed it because she thinks it is easy to get back money if she doe n't like it .
However the coat was awful .
Aunt purchased gray , but they delivered white one .
Also the coat was teared !
She called that company again , but they said it 's not their fault .
They said TV programs which sells the coat have fault .
So she called that TV programs again , but they said aunt is donig lie .
My aunt ca n't return it to money back still now .
She got really hurts .

Like this , advertising better have to be banned .
It is obvious lie .
It hurts people to and people spend their money to purchase bad things .
It is waste of money .
Therefor I disagree that advertisements make their advertise too much exaggerate .
They must make their advertisements with hinesty .
