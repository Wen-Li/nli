Succes is tometimes relative to .
If we take a look in society we will find that successfull people are very different , they have all become successfull in many different ways .
You will find people who have worked very hard all of their life , and on the other hand you can find people who just fell into success .
The people who work every day , they do not take much risks , they preffer to acomplish things doing what they know how to do well .
You study hard when you are young , you attend to a good school , you graduate from college , and you find a good job .
You become succesfull in 10 years after you started working , this is the most comun formula to be successfull .

But there is another formula to successes , it is risky but it is a good one .
Many people do not go to school , do not graduate from college , and they find good jobs , but it is not that easy because the higher the risk the higher the fall .

We all have to work very hard to be succssesfull , and we all must take some kind of risk now and then , some of us take big risks and some take small risks .

You can not say that one is right and the other is wrong , because success happens to a lot of people in many different ways , under very different circunstances .
What I do know is that success is someting people work for , it is not somenthing that you can buy , it is someting that you become .
