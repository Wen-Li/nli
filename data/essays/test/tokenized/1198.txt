While some people say that successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well , I strongly believe that successful people do not always try new things or take risks .

To begin with , some people succeed because they have creativity or imagination a little different from everyone else .
For instance , 10 years ago , there were a lot of social networking service companies in Japan .
In that situation , no one could predict which company would succeed because there were not any difference in their business .
Among them , a company , Mixci , became only on successful company in Japan because its advertisements way was a little different from other competitors .
It targeted only young Japanese people .
There was not any drastic difference between the company 's ad way and that of competitors .
The difference was in its target .
In view of this , I believe creativity a little different from others are the most important factors to succeed .

Furthermore , some people succeed by utilizing risk sharing methods .
To illustrate , in business some entrepreneurs begin and succeed their business by the help of venturer capitalists .
According to the survey conducted by a famous Japanese newspaper company , about 80 percent of the start-up companies listed in Tokyo stock exchange were helped by venturer capitals or other investors when they started their business .
In view of this , taking risk does not always lead business to succeed .

In conclusion , I strongly support the thought that successful people do not always try new things and take risks .
I believe that successful people have creativity and imagination a little different from other ordinary people .
