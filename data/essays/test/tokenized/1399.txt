On the television , on the radio , newspapers , magazines , billboards , in short everywhere we see the advertisements .
Companies are spending incredible amounts of money to advertise their products and when doing this I believe that most of the time they exaggerate their products .
I do strongly agree with the idea that most advertisements show products much better than they really are .

In most of the advertisements , the thing that is shown or said is not incorrect but incomplete .
For instance , there is a prophylactic vaccine which is against cervical cancer in women .
Cervical cancer is mainly caused by a virus called HPV .
This virus has several different types .
The vaccine , Gardasil , prevents women only being infected by two types of HPV .
On the advertisement , it is expressed that Gardasil provides a hundred percent protection .
This is not false but of course leads to misunderstandings .
When my mother had seen this advertisement she , just like most of the other people , thought that vaccine is preventing completely against cervical cancer .
However , in reality , vaccine is only preventing completely to be infected by those two types of HPV .
Those two types cause approximately seventy percent of all cervical cancer , not the hundred percent !

In some other advertisements , they try to show how effective their product are .
For example , they say that their toothpaste provides you white and shiny teeth in a sort time .
During this , some thing that is written in a very small font passes through the screen very fast and nobody can read it .
It may be written that the product gives the result after 10 years of use !
It is appearent that some words like `` short time '' can change from person to person .

In conclusion , in most of the advertisement they try to make the customers perceive the properties of the product as they wish .
Customers needs to be very careful about what is being shown or said in the advertisements , and even search for the details .
