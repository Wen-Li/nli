For many years the people believe , in old statements about education , they never thought about the real education is .
The learning of a person is based in his experiences and in a estatic system to observe phenomenons , but not really to try to understand them .
The nature are full of this kind of situations , but know , the education tryng to explain them in a flat way , avoiding important and subjective developments and supressing topics .

The real problema about education , it is about the emphasys that it takes in the facts and not in the concept , I mean , you can see the fact , maybe you can taste it or smell it , but , What is behind this fact ?

An experience , off course , the facts are important , because they mark a situation , they are the practice and the complement of the ideas and concept .
However , the concepts and the facts are mainly important , for the education , it is obvious that 2 + 2 = 4 , but exist a story and observed tasks for get this solution .

All the problems originated a solution , it is not so simply , inasmuch as the ideas are the conceptualize of everything in the whole universe , but they are just theory , they have to be supported for something , that is the paper of the fact , a solid development for ideas , we can represented the worl of ideas and concept in our mind , when you think in something , you just need to close your eyes and imagine , but , Why you have this image in your mind ?

Its because you had a experience with this object or thing , the are many abstract things , that you just ca n't conceptualize , but you have a especifically situation , experience or fact , that support the existence of this thing .
The facts an the ideas are very important for education , because , they keep all the knowledge of the peole .
