The best way to experience the world and learn about other countries is by travelling .
When the word `` travel '' is mentioned , there is a word that pops in your head : tour guide .
A tour guide is essential when travelling for it is like a bible in christianity ; he or she knows everything about the country , when you know nothing .
Tour guides are necessary especially when travelling to countries you have not been to .
They are almost like a god guiding you to go to places .
They know it all and they will make your trip much easier .

Tour guides are mostly known to be people that take you to the most impotant and exciting places of the country .
Most tour guides will ask you about your interest and will come up with a place that relates to your interest .
It would not be too ideal for a tour guide to take travellers to take them where they have no interest in .

Another reason to need a tour guide is to be able to use him as a translater .
It is likely that the country you are visiting do not speak the same language as you do .
This can be the most streeful experience , for I personally had to go through at this .
Simply not being able to communicate will result in confusion and people looking all incoherent .

Tour guides know it all .
They are there to ask any questions you have .
It is safe to say that they would not have became tour guides if they do not know literally everything about the country .
It is their job , and duty .

Having a tour guide almost always means that other group of people are there , also .
This will give travellers a chance to develop relationship .
The more people you know , the better because connections in society nowadays matter significantly .
Therefore , next time you travel , make sure to have a guide with you instead of walking around not even knowing where you are .
