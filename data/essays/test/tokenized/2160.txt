Nowadays , It is a sets of shared beliefs to think about our planet as a place impossible to live and to breath .
The main cause is , without a shadow of doubt , problem pollutions that enviroment produces .

Cars seem to be in everyone 's immagination depicted as one of the prime cause .
In my opinion I think that our society will not be able to reduce the number of cars for so many reasons that it would take much time to describe all of them .

First of all , among all these reasons there is a particular way to consider cars themselves .
I believe that car have convey special to people .
Nowadays , cars are become more than the function they absolve .
It is common of every one to think about a car as something that exeeds the function to be a mere way of transporting people .
Cars seem to resamble to an object which convey to other people something more .
Cars show to people who we are .
An example of this is certanly represented by showing our economical possibilities .
Thus , it would be difficult to depict the next future depriving people from this particular and pleasant object .

From the stand point I am adopting I believe that the more will we will have to follow fads spreading throughout the world the more cars will have being produced in order to belong to a specific current of thought or fad .

On the other hand , I wish that those caratteristics that cars are made of will be substitute with some others that will allow us to breath clean air avoiding health problems .
I read an intresting article about new sources for supplying the next `` petrol desmise '' .

These researchers have dimonstrated that alternative clean sources such as rewable hydrogen will be able to reconvert cars production in a way sustainable for people 's health .
The problem , fron this point of view , is not to be concerned about how many car our societies will have in the next future .
I believe that the real problem will deal with which materials and which energy they will use .
