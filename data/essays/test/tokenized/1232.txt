Success is mostly based on money and fame and it can sometimes drive people to madness or just simply to curiosity .
In this essay I will attend to explain why I agree with the following statement .

Firstly , a successful person is someone who has reached a certain level in social life , it is often linked with wealth and fame .
Just because a person is famous does n't necesseraly follow that he or she will attract attention in trying new things ; however , some world-known artists among other things tend to take risks to regain success .
In this case I could write about Britney Spears as a perfect example seeing as she cut all her hair in order to become a headline in the newspapers again , as she one was , before a sharp drop of her popularity .
It is pivotal for some artists to make flabbergasting things in order to refocus attention on them , and thus , make more money or just regain fame .

Secondly , I think that some successful people want to try new things and therefore take risks because they simply want to change an aspect of their lives and do something else for a change ; doing the same every day can besome borring and mundane after a certain time .
On top of that , some risks are worth it .
For example , if the rock group Radiohead did n't change their style of music some years ago , they would n't be at the top of the ladder now .
Nobody knew them when they were playing folk music at the begining of their musical carrier , and nowadays they are world-famous .
Some people like artists or even politician need to change an major aspect of their carrier to have a better start .

To conclude , in my view takes risks in day-to-day life can mostly be positive and creative , and for successful people it is sometimes crucial for them and for their fame .
