Risk taking and creativity are considered among the most pivotal qualities that make a manager or an enterpreneur succesful .
I completely agree with the statement that succesful people should try to do new things and take risks rather than doing something already well known for two main reason .

First of all the world is changing , people change tastes rapidly and fashon is always developing .
For this reason one should emphasise on doing new things rather than the same things to achieve success .
This assumes that one should take some risk .
The biggest example that comes to my mind is Steve Jobs , the CEO of Apple who took the risk of investing a large ammount of money on the I Pod project , that later turned to be a great business .
If he had continued simply to do computer he would have not invented this new successful product .

Secondly , the success is something difficult to control .
One needs also a large part of luck to reach the success .
But if one do not expose himself to new project or new idea , he or she will hardly catch the moment that might change his or her life .
For example in China , after Mao period a lot of people found themselves without a job , so they had to try to do something for surviving .
Those same people that tryed to do something new , thinking about the needs of a country that is developing so quickly are the same that now have the greates business of the country .

One need determination , luck and a sort of talent to achieve success , but the most important thing is to be brave enough to take some risk and try to introduce something new .

In conclusion I think that since the environment that surround all of us is always changing and doing always the same things taking risks and introducing new ideas to the world are the most important elements that need to become a successful person .
