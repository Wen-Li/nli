I most certainly feel that having broad knowledge of many academic subjects is far more beneficial than to specialise in one specific subject .
According to me gaining knowledge is an ongoing process .
To restrict oneself to a particular sphere would encourage ignorance .
For example , being a law student if I restrict myself to the study of criminal behaviour and its impact on society I would totally be ignoring the vast field of civil laws which contribute greatly towards the well being of the society .

Let me elaborate further , while I was in my first year of law , we had Sociology as a compulsory subject .
All of us failed to understand how Sociology could be connected to law and we were anxious to get over with the course and move on to something more interesting .
It was in my second year of law that i realised the significance of what i had studied .
Sociology provided the basis and the reasons for why the various laws were initially framed .
It explained how the needs of the society gave rise to the collective will of the legislature to frame certain laws .
Without understanding the basic sociological concepts I would never have been able to understand the logic behind law .

As a law student I have come to embrace research .
I have time and again come across legal problems of varied nature .
I have always built upon my basic knowledge of law and substantiated it with concentrated research over the area related to the particular problem .
But without the basics of every subject it would definitely be impossible to give the client a complete and well informed advise .

In this era of globalisation and knowledge sharing it would be highly disadvantageous to close doors to any academic sphere .
I feel that it is a must to have broad knowledge of many subjects to be successful in any career .
