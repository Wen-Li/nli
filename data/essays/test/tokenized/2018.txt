I mostly agree with this statement that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities .
This kind of i dea is said at everywhere and becoming a huge problem .

The reason I used the word `` mostly '' is because I used to give much time to helping my community when I was in elementaly school .
I participated in a lot of community events such as valleyball games and road race by the sea and the volunteer recicle and so on .
I had so much fun at the time , and I think I was somewhat helping the community .
But since I became a junior high school student , I get not to participate in any community events , because I get too much work to do for myself rather than for my community .
This can be said for everyone else .
And I also have other reason for making this statement more reasonable .
As long as I know , there is no interesting information about community 's events .
Nobody would even know how to help community .

I previously wrote why I think no young people give much time to helping their communication but now I can put some example for what happened in result of the little or no help for communication .
The first one is at the disaster such as at fire or some scientic erruption .
The result of young people 's no help made disaster more terrific because they have the most strongest power .
The second example is what happened in my city .
Since they do n't participate in any events which community held , the most events became only for elder people ; this led less young people participate in .

From these fact and example for the result , we can see that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities .
