It is a controversial issue whether having travel in a group led by a tout guide is better that travel alone .
Some people might agree with this statement because it is cheaper and convinient with regular schduel .
However as far as I am concermed i stronly belive that having a trip alon is have more advatages in that it enables one to evoid controling and to schedule by one 's intention .

First of all , having a trip alone people allows them to enjoy thier free time .
Taravel with ldeing by a tour guid demends some rules to travelers such as when they have to wake and have a meal and it sometimes very stressful .
Forexample , my brother Jun Kim traveled Japan last year whith tour guide .
First , he enjoy that time because he do n't worry about his destination and time , however later the guide let him get up early and even when he waked up late the guide did n't give meal .
It proves that group travel with team requiered following their controll .

Inaddition , individual travle lets people have a chance more think about themselves .
The real meaning of travle is taking a break from routin days and have a chace to reschedule .
For instance , I travle to regularly alone whenever I think I need a break .
last year I fired my jop so very depressed .
However throug my travel ma gain my confidence and could found new jop .
It is due to the individual travle whidh give me a thinking time about my past , now and future .

In brief , I think tarvel with leding by a tout guide is not better than having a trip alone .
First , individual trip lets people avoid conroling by others .
On top of that it makes people take a chance to look back and reschedul about themselves .
