`` Flights of fancy , my senses reel '' ...

In twenty years time - let 's see - would we really have to look at the amazing inventions of Diamler and Benz as a `` species going extinct '' with the throes of time , or would be see a revolution in man 's concept of the `` car '' ? !
We are heading into what many people would choose to call `` The Space Age '' ; numerous inventions the very concept of which might have been considered ridiculous in the distant , or even the recent , past have been beholden to men over the recent past .
At the same time , however , the Earth is crying out as natural resources are declining .

The typical car that runs today uses gasoline for fuel - this was how cars started .
Slowly , as time moved by , gasoline started turning scarce and became expensive , and a novel idea was to run cars on natural gas instead !
- it worked out extremely well - allowing people to have the option to actually switch over to natural gas as opposed to gasoline ( petrol / diesel ) - though it did not see the glamour of popularity because natural gas can be a dangerous explosive , and people do not like to drive when they know they are sitting on a potential bomb .
Also , both of these are but natural resources , worse that they are usually found together , and the fate of such cars is solely dependent on their availability - they are formed by chemical processes that take place over thousands of years , and consumed at a pace maddeningly faster ; so that sooner or later , they are going to `` run-out '' , and we are going to be left with a LOT of cars that are but mere relics of the past , devoid of life - like dinosaurs , or the dodo for instance !
Hence , it might seem that in twenty years there shall be fewer cars than we see today .

But . ..
but . ..
but . ..
Lo and behold !
Necessity is but the mother of invention .
It was man 's idea to use gasoline for fuelling cars ; it shall be man 's undaunted resolve to survive in a hostile world that shall lead him to circumvent the limitations nature imposes - for after all - nature is not just gasoline !
Man has been exploiting the ubiquitously available resource of sunlight - which it is to the point of omnipresence !
There have been built cars that can store energy from sunlight in cells , and release this energy in the form of electrical energy for running them !
- Completely cost-effective , and remarkably ingenious !
It is only a matter of time before these cars become commercialy viable - as the current trends do impose , the cost of a technological innovation always goes down with time - because the demand increases , allowing mass-scale productions to become cheaper .
Such cars of the future shall completely replace cars of the past , and as the number of the regular gasoline-cars declines and they proceed to join antique collections , the number of these `` tech-savvy '' cars shall go up ; even if the cost of production is large , such cars are in the long term going to be an extremely profitable possession because they can be recharged as soon as the sun rises !
- virtually maintenance free .
Moreover , these cars shall last till the end of time for us - that is , till the day the sun finally swells up into a red-giant and engulfs the Earth , so worries about the future are going to be a thing of the past !

There have also been steps to somehow utilize sea-water as fuel , and since we do not have to worry even remotely how abundant THAT is , there 's our sister option !
Both the ideas of using solar energy as well as sea-water are going to completely do away with bothering about `` running-out '' .

Hence , even though the number of gasoline-cars are no doubt going to decline over the next twenty years , the technologial star shines bright , and foretells that the number of cars on the whole is going to increase - rather exponentially once mass-production begins , and the faith of the people in a new technology has been secured .
