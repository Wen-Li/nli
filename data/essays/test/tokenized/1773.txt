As a tourist who has traveled several countries , travelling should be guided by tour guide .
So that , I definitelly agree about this topic .
Especially , travel to abroad needs guide for several reasons .

First , giude knows which place whether it is safe or not .
If I travel by myself without a guide , I might have lack of knowledge where I 'm traveling .
For example , walk street alone which is known as much thiefs actively move or travel a mountain known as bear appears often .
To prevent this happening , guid should follow us and lead us safety region .

Second , this is the strongest opinion why I suggest hire guide .
My family usually go abroad in vacation .
We used to accompany with a guide .
One day , to save the cost of guidance , my mom decided to travel ourselves .
My family tried to indicate important place for visitor .
Moreover , we tried asking tourist center to get information about the places .
After the leisure period and get back to home , we noticed that our travel is n't that satisfactable .
We watched toursit channel that intoduces where we 've travelled ourselves .
The program showed us amazingly beautiful places that we 've never been or heard .
Since we did n't hire a guide who knows the place as much as resident .

Third , new comers do n't know the cost in another country .
They even do n't know they are buying meals and goods with higher price .
To avoid wasting of money by buying things with more expensive , we have to follow with a guide .
Then I 'm sure we can enjoy shopping with proper price .

Someone might think travelling with guide is useless .
However , I think going somewhere with a guide who knows the place well is not wasteful .
To make the travel enjoyable , memoriable and valuable then go with guide .
They will lead you to unexpectable wonderful place and
