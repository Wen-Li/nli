I really do agree with the statement .
It tells that ` ideas and concepts ' - so the matrix of an subject-are more important to be understood than learning details , numbers and facts .
My agreement is easy and logic to be explained .
If a student understands the structure , the base or the pattern of a problem he will fairly can develope his own ideas and thoughts about it which actually wil help him to understand the world in its completeness .
Surely he will get a better mark for writing down all facts and numbers in an testpaper but this is only a very short lasting success .
A long rewarded success would be his comprehend of the content of all the numbers and facts .

Let me give you one example : A student learns about the governement .
He studies all the names of mebers in the parliament but does neither asks himself nor the teacher for backround information .
For hidden connections which can reveal very interesting or even worrying aspects of our democrazy .
If there were not those people who always ask for more information , for the sources and of course the concepts behind everything cases like the Nixon-affaire would have never been uncovered .

Let 's come back to the student who unfourtanetly has got other motivations for his actings .
To be curious is one part of the learning progress and this curiousness brings different ways of making things memorable .
Facts and details surely will make someone know about something but it wo n't make him understand it .
For me it is much more important to get the idea of something because with that idea you are able to think about it yourself .

I will shortly explain what I mean by that .
If you for example copied an idea directly into your mind and you really understand every thought behind it you will be able to convert or make use of it concerning topics that differ from the original one .

This means you may will find better fitting areas which for example can be more profitable .
Maybe you will find aspects that can proove and idea at another time or another place on earth .
Imagine a simple constellation : Someone somewhere found out that wood can be used to build boats .
He found that while being in europe but you life in the US .
You and a friend hear about the findings of this person .
Your friend just saves the fact in his mind that you can use wood to build boats .
You yourself are a bit more curious than your friend and you ask yourself some questions about the principle that stands behind the fact .
You-at the speed of light-find out that wood in its natural state is able to swim .
Now you are able to use your knowledge about the idea of the other guy in addition to the concept you learned and you-at least theoretical-are able to build up your own boat companie .

So after writing this essay my opinion remains the same > learning the concepts and ( main - ) ideas of something is better than just keeping facts and details in mind for a long time with no practise use of it-except knowing them .
