Since thirty years , the number of car increase all over the world , but is it true to say that in some years there will be fewer cars in use that there is today ?

Firstly , the real problem today with cars are the petrol and his pollution .
Yes , the level of petrol decrease quickly and some scientists say that we have petrol still for 80 years .
If I stop my reflexion here , I can say the number of cars will decrease in the future because people will can not use theirs cars .

We must to find new carburants to succeed petrol .
We have found it , and we call that Bio carburants .
they are clean for the earth .
Today they are not ready to use , we need to improve research and development because cars have n't a long autonomy .
And it 's expensive to make this carburant .
We need a big place for the cultures of plants .

With this crisis of petrol a lot of people take care about the environnement now , and change theirs behaviours .
The town of La rochelle in France is a good example .
You can find a free acces of bicycle .
So , a lot of people use it , change theirs behaviour and stop to pollute the environnement .
Even it 's easier for people to take theirs cars for going somewhere , a lot of people ( in france ) are ready to use Bus , Railway , Plane , Boat , Bicycle .

Then a car is practical but expensive .
Before the price was cheaper than today and everybody used cars even for make a short travel .
Now it 's different , petrol is expensive .

To conclude , it 's hard to plan if there will be fewer cars in use than there are today because all the time we need car 's .
In france , maybe we can say yes because politics are developing new ways of transports in towns ( ralyways ) and behaviour is changing .
But in china , for example the market increase all the days and they use all the years more cars than the last one .

Human needs cars because now he need to move all the days .
I do n't know if the numer of cars will decrease but I am sure that pollution cars quality 's will increase .
And it 's the most important .
