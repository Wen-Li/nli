The statement was made as , most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .
I agree with the statement mentioned .

Many companies try to attract the people by making some sort of advertisements when they newly introduce the product into the market .
As the product initially may require some sort of increased populartiy and to be wellknown to the people , many attempts will be made to get into the market .
In this process , the products will be prepared in a careful manner and will be shown in a better way .

For example , a perfume made by a company attracted me a lot by the advertisement made in the TV shows .
Really impressed with the advertisement , made me to buy the product .
But later on when I started using the product , it was found to be less prodcutive as I thought to be and less smell i thought to be .

Another instance , where the clothes looks very attractive at the store seems to be good but little attention is needed in looking at the quality of the cloth made .
The companies try to make a better quality of products in the beginning used for the advertisement but may not be the instance when it actually comes to the market .

Generally people go by the way it was shown in the advertisement that appeals a lot .
The products may seems to be in a better way as it is shown in the advertisement infact it may not be true when it is really concerned .
The companies put an extra effort to make it more alluring to the people .

Finally the statement mentioned above abruptly concludes me that advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .
I prefer to make a careful review of the product when you actually wanted to get that product .
