Diffrent people have differnt idea about the statement that traveling in a group a with tour gide is the best way .
However , I disagree with this idea because traveling alone gives you more experience and traveling in a group led by tour guide will force you to visit places where you do n't want to go .

To begin with , if you travel alone anywhere , you can experience many things from start to end .
While traveling with tour guide needs you to prepare just extra money and time , traveling alon makes you learn many things about the places that you want to visit .
You have to find a flight ticket , hotels and information about the places .
For example , when I traveled India , I planned by myself .
To prepare for this , I had to book a flight ticket , find a youth hostel to stay and search information on the web .
It took my time and was not easy , but a good experience for me .

In addition , traveling in a group forces you to visit places where you do n't want to go .
Because you have to keep to a schedule and keep up with the pace of a group , you can not enjoy the time enough .
Also , traveling in a group is usually cheaper than traveling alon because of commition , so if you travel with tour guides , they usually bring you certain restaurants which give commitions to guides .
For instance , my mother visited china two weeks ago .
When she came back from the trip , she was so angry because waiters in restraurants she visited required too many tips .
In this respect , it is hard to think that traveling with a guide is a the best way to travel .

To summarize , traveing alone gives you many experience and allows you to visit the places where you want to go , so it is better than traveling in a group led by a tour guide .
There is a saying that a jouney makes people grow up .
What can you learn from traveling led by a tour guide ?
