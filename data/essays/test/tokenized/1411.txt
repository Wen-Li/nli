I 'm absoloutly agree .
Only people that try new things and take risks will be successful people .
I think the best example of this stament are scientist .
They spent their life to search , study , and try new laws .
Gaglielo Galilei is one of the most important and relevant scientist of ever .
He obviously take many risks , but without experiment he could n't find the success .

A successful people wants to do always better in its life .
He 'll try to do always new experiences , to meet new e different people , to study , to invest money , time and energy in a new project of work or life .

He risks but he do .
You can have success only if you do and risk .
People that do only what they already known will remain always at the same position .

For example , we can still see fantastic engeneering structures of ancient Romans in Italy , like colosseo or pantheon .
These are great bulidings that have passed century of time .
Maybe who project the pantheon before made other buildings that fall down .
He risked , he had n't success but he could see were he was wrong , until has the capacity of made something wonderful like pantheom , that is still on after more than 1000 years .

But not only scientists and engeneers can find the success .
Every people in its life or work have to try to find the way for the success .
Altought this means hard work , less time , less money , we have to try every day beeing a successful people .
Try new thinghs is the best way to known .
We could make mistakes , but surely we will find the success , more than who do what already known and no more .
