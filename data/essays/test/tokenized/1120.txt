Taking risk is the very instinctive human behaviour that defines us as humans .
We take risk to prosper and find new opportunities by facing new challenges .

To succeed in todays life , one has to have a wide scope of imagination and innovation .
We can not just rely on what we already know how to do well , we need to try new things in order to advance and create change .
We as humans do not like to abide by routines our entire lives and so we look for change .
Yes we have to have the expertise to succeed in whatever we 're doing , but we as humans never stop to learn and it is through learning that we can take the risk and try new things .
For example , if I created a new product that I want to sell and I want to make my own business the first thing I would need to do is learn how to operate a business .
In that sense , one can not proceed into new things without knowledge .
Before we endulge in risks such as a new business we have to carefully assess all the aspects that this new innovation might bring along .
On the other hand , if I 'm not brave enough to take the risk , I wont be able to advance and I will be stuck with the same old job for my entire life .

Taking a risk can be looked at as a trial and error experiment because even if you do n't succeed you learn form your mistakes and try again .
Trying new things and taking risk can lead to success but it can have negative consequences if irrational decisions are taken .
It is true that Knowledge is power because ultimately a risk is called a risk because we can not possibly know or predict exactly what will happen but we can at least come close to it .
