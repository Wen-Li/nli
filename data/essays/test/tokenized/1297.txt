I agree that generally advertiments make products seem better and more desireable than they actually are when you buy them .

Of course this is no wonder : for each product there are tens or hundreds of people who work just to make it look better than it is , and many of them are good at doing their job .
Exactly as with any other profession , they have been trained for the purpose , and know many techniques to convince people that their product is particularly good .

A fact that supports the view that the advertised goods are often much better than the real ones is thay many countries have regulations concerning `` deceiving advertisements '' .
This is beacuse soon it was realized that many advertised products were so different from the real ones that consumers were , in fact , completely deceived .
Nonetheless , generally advertisers know the law and can therefore succeed in emphasizing and over-emphasizing the quality of their products without breaking the law .

The law , however , is not so strict .
For example , as far as pictures of food are concerned , often the advertised product is presented in a wonderful way : one instance of this could be some kind of cheese with lots of vegetables around it , which make the cheese look very attractive even if it is rather the dish wich is .
In this case , regualtions in many countries barely demand to write in rather small type `` suggested preparation '' .

Even so , l'Oreal has been quite recently condemned for advertising in Spain a kind of mascara with a picture of Penelope Cruz wearing fake eyebrows ; this way people were induced to believe that they could use l'Oreal 's mascara to obtain such long eyebrows as in the picture , while actually they could n't .
But even with a revised advertisement , the mascara will of course look better on Penelope Cruz than on the mean Spanish woman .

In conclusion , I believe that advertisers are usually quite good at doing their job , so that the products look way better in the ads than in real life .
