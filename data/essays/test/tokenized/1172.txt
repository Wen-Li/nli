Travel is a quite wonderful way to relax for people live in morden sociaty with a lot of press .
However , if one would travel , he or she must decide where and how to travel .
For this situation , many travelling companies have the programme that enable people be a group and let a tour guide lead .
Then , travelers can just have fun without the worry about where to live , what to eat or how to get .

However , I disagree with the statement of travelling in a group led by a tour guide is the best way .
Firstly , travelling is quite a personal thing .
Travelling by ourselves , we can go anywhere we want to .
But many tour guides have their owned routes , and they always take travellers to those places which have been famous or crowded .
It is hard to have enough time to breath the fresh air out of cities .

Secondly , with a tour guide , if you don not like the tastes he or she ordered for you , you have no other choices , or you have to pay more to get some food agree with your stumacl .
Meanwhile , travelling by yourselves , you can have more local taste and much cheaper than the meal ordered by the guides .

What 's more , travelling in a group led by a tour guide , the time table always have been settled and you have to follow it exactlly .
If one traveller want to take some more pictures at the places he loves and take a little longer time , the other travellers who does not like the place may be unpleasured .
So it is quite a big problem that make everyone in the group have one opinion .
Travelling by oneself have no worries about these problem .
Wherever you like , stay here for several days to enjoy and take as many photographs as you like .

All in all , I don not consider travelling in a group led by a tour guide is a good way .
I love the way that travel much freely and cheaper .
