In my opinion , I agree with the statement ` It is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts . '

First and the foremost , facts sometimes change over time , but the basic theroies do n't .
For example , in the past , according to the classic physics , the earth is the center of the space ; however , scientists discover that the earth is a part of solar system and is not the center of it .
Likewise , many observations and technologies currently teached in school will change .
For instance , the appliaction of computer in two decades ago is so different from today .
Yet , the basic theories are the same .
So , understand ideas and concepts can train student 's ability to adapt the future .

In the like manner , reasoning and critical thinking are the essential skills for students to succeed in future career .
The real world have so many unexpected things , that can not be learnt from the lessons .
Without the understanding of the basic concepts of the surroundings , it seems not possible to deal with the change in the real world as well as future career .
In particular , the business world , nobody can tell the best way to do things .
There is no book can teach the facts for solving problems , because every problem is unique .
Students have to apply the skills they develped in school .

Last but not least , basic theories and concepts are the root of knowledge , they are imperative for development and invention for the new techologies .
For example , no medical and biological concepts , people can not invent new drug .

In short , understanding of the basic theories and concepts not only can train citical thinking and reasoning skills of students , but also can help them to prepare their future career .
So understanding the ideas and concepts are more important in the education .
