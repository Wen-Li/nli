I would tend to agree with the statement above mentionned .
I have three reasons to take this position , and shall discuss each one of them successively .

In the first place i think that reducing cars does not mean cutting the number or the flows of transportation means available .
Cars have been a major tool of the 20th century , and has been promoted by giant industries .
However it is challenged by virtually any more convenient or less expensive personal transportation means .
I believe that within a twenty year period , a brand new sort of vehicle which would not fit within the definition of a car is likely to arise as too serious a challenger .
As a result the number of cars produced and sold could drop dramatically .
I still give some sympathy to the argument that technology could be used to improve cars instead of shifting to anothetr object .
And all efforts at making it more environnement friendly , faster , etc do have an impact .
The question is to determine how long lasting they will be , how much additional years crumbling auto companies such as GM or Ford will be able to hold and foster useful investments before going bankrupt .

Moreover , this evolution seems all the more possible as cars no longer enjoy the sexy and attractive image they used to benefit from .
A quick thought at the status cars enjoyed thirty years ago is enough to build a pessimistic picture of the future of cars .
They are doomed to be replaced since people do not dream about cars anymore , they find it expensive , express growing concern as to its environmental impact , have already found alternative ways to travel .

And governments are already taking serious measures to this end .
The governor of california has recently considered a tax on all car holders as if owning a car could be seen as a crime .
In Europe attempts at drawing innovative urban spaces all praise the same elimination of cars within cities .
Not to mention London s tax on inner city drivers ; cars are pinned as one amongst serious public ennemies .
They are living their waning years and recent initiatives pave the way for further measures towards their reduction .
