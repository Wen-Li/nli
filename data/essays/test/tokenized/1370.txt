Advertisements make products seem much better There are many reasons , aspects and strategies basing on which a coustemer decides to buy a product .
And these aspects or beliefs defer from person to person .
Of all such aspects surely advertisements play a major role and this is the reason why many companys invest enormous funds on advertisements .

What ever be the opinion of the general public to these effects of advertisements , I strongly agree with the statement that `` advertisements make a product seem much more better than they really are '' .
The advertisements are so craftily designed that people presumme that the product is best of its kind in the market .
Nowadays companies are turning to brand embassodors who are mostly public icons , these people really have agreat effect on the sucess of the advertisement .

For example , consider a product Y of a brand Z.Suppose that the product is released with out any advertisement into the market , what is the amount of turnover does one expect ?
It would surely be a succint number .
Now if the same product is launched in pomp with an pompus add by a celebrity , the sales would surely steep up , in no comparision to the previous sales .
This is only because the advertisements show the product being used by their icon stating and demonstrating that it is the best of its class .
Now when we buy the product assuming that it performs excellently as seen in the advertisement , then you would be totaly fooled .

It should be accepted that advertisements help people learn the uses of new products and also provide a clear picture of the market .
And basing on which a person can know his needs in the technologically sophisticate world .

As most advertisements are designed to show that they are better products , which is the sole purpose of an advertisement to market a product .
It is the responsibility lies of customer to be aware of such marketing strategies and be wise enough to make a productive decession while buying .
