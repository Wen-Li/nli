Now , I am thinking that the young people do not spend enought time to help their communities .
reraly the youngs people work for upper the livel of their communities .
What is the rison i do n't have a very concreting idea .
There is so much time to spend but the they prefer to stay at home to do nathing ( to spend time for play wich computer of on the internet not always is good spend time ) .

Maybe the question is `` where are the parens ? ''
.
Often the kinds competid ingored the problem .
It 's the parent .
Nawadays all the familiars are having time only for their jobs ( one or more ) and the kids problems are not interesting .
Same parents have only one problem , the sport activity .
Father or Mother are tired only the fisical education of their children .
Give time to halping their communities , is my opinion , is a upper education .
It is n't easy but to learn than their communities is important .
An a possible examples to support my answer is the teacing all the religion , halping their communities .
all us forgotten that is jast to do when we live wich
