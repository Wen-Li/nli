I agree with the statement given as `` successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well '' .
The reasons for holding such an opinion are given below .

First one is , if a person succeeds in doing a thing newly for the first time , he is called successful for the first time .
But if he repeats the same thing for many times , he may not get recognition or appreciation as he got for the first time because it is usual for that person to be successful in that respect .
For example , take cricket .
Rahul Dravid is a good technical batsmen .
When he first arrived and displayed his skills in batting , he got huge recognition and appreciation from the greats of the cricket world .
It became casual and very normal when he batted nicely because it is the same thing he has been doing from first .

Second one is that we must keep trying new thing to be called successful by all the people every time we succeed .
Succeeding in doing a new thing instead of usual one brings a huge reputation , recognition and admiration .
For Example , take the above example of cricket .
Rahul is a batsmen .
Its common for him to bat nicely every time .
But when he decided to keep wickets and succeeded in doing it , he gained a lot of admiration and recognition from the entire cricketing world .

One more reason for supporting above argument is that even though , a successful person does n't become successful when he tries a new thing , he gains some recognition from the world for atleast trying a new thing different from routine .
He may be appreciated for the effort he put into in doing a new thing .
This may not happen if the person fails doing a same old thing every time .

For example take movies .
If a director fails in bringing a new view of an already known point or a new point , he gets recognition from the people for his efforts .
But he fails in doing the same old thing , his position will be very adverse .
