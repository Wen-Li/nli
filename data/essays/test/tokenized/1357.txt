I do agree on the statement that most advertisements make products seem better than thez really are .
The reasons are easy to find : the persons who work for a certain company as the administrative for its advertisements are very well informed about the psychological processes in people 's brains when they encounter certain stimuli .
With this power the influence the costumer and make him or her want to by their products .
These stimuli are very often visua : if you want to sell baby nuture successfully , all you have to do ist to show a happy baby with its mother advertising it .
Another way is to only list the positive features of the product , such as its low prize , all its extras etc .

If the companies did not use advertisement to manipulate their costumers , the would have much less profits then they currently have .
Sometimes it is very useful to hire popular stars , such as models or musicients .
One example for that would be the advertisement of Mc Donald 's in Germany .
Here , the supermodel Heidi Klum goes to Mc Donal 's and orders a menu with chips and a salad .
She even bites a bit off one chip to demonstrate that it is completely okay to eat at this restaurant .
But they do not show is that she never swallowed the chip .

Another example is the advertisement of Deichmann shoes in German tv : In this little film you see the international celabrated so-called Pussy Cat Dolls dressed in their usual style of clothing and walking on a stage , pretending to be performing .
They all wear the latest shoes that one can find in the named shoe store .
And even if they look really fashionable , this doe not change the fact that these shoes are highly uncomfortable and of a very low quality .
But this fact is not very important to the girls who admire this group and who now seem to see a possibility to be like their idols .

Summarizing , I am of the opinon that advertisements present a product as something which it is not in order to make sure that the consumers will buy their products .
I think that one should have a critical attitude on advertisement in general and to create one
