I am not very sure that it will be really so .
It depences a lot even by the area that we considere .
If we look at the cities , this statement could be true , because several people that in past preferred to move by their car , today try to use more autobus , train , ecc . ..
This is possible nowadays thanks to the new technology available that makes train , plane and autobus faster and more secure .
Many cities have spent a lot of money to power their services of public transport .
In other areas where we can see a less density of people , and where train and autobus lines are not very efficient , the number of cars is not decreasing for my experience .
With a car anyone is able to arrive in the right place without the risk of rain or traffic that he can meet on foot from the station to the right place .

We must considere too , for my personal thinking , that the rate of young people who become able to drive is greater than the rate of ancient people who lose their ability .
The modern culture , and probably more money available today , bring a father to buy a car for every son .
So , probably , in same cases the number of cars on the streets is increasing , a behaviour that I see everyday on my town .

Even if I hope that it was only a my own impression , because I think that 99 % of our cities ca n't satisfy the increasing requests of services from the drivers .
