I agree with the statement that most of the advertisements represents the perticular product as the better one among all others .
As advertisements main motto is just to aware people about the new product and to advertise the best pat of it and lastly how it can help anyone .
But now due to very high competetion in the market advertisements are doing different job .

My preferrence is better as now a days advertisements shows many things with their product .
which many times looks like evevn unimaginable .
For example i have seen an advertisement for a deodrant .
In which when one man sprays that spray on his body hundreds of girls just started running towards him .
In this way it misguided many youngesters perticularly .
As that advertisement is targeting youngesters .
In the same way for the beauty creams .
In the advertisements they shown that just use this cream for seven days and you will become beautiful .
But according to expereinces of people it only works 20-30 % also depends on circumstances .
It also makes advertisements unreliable .

Secondly , many times for advertisements company using big stars .
Perticularly those who have great fan following .
In that way also misinterpretations occurs by the fans of those stars .
Like in an advertisement Arnold is doing his jim from a perticular product .
So after seeing that advertisement many people interpret that by using that machine only they can build muscles like Arnold .

In the last many times people influenced with the advertisement of perticular product buys that .
But after using that product for some time , came to know that it is not fulfilling the need or because of bad material used in it , product damages .
Like you buy a Motorbike of perticular copany without doing proper research for it but just because of its rough tough advertisement .
After some time you came to know that its parts are not working properly , its average is also low .
Because in the advertisement they shown the average with small sign for ` condition apply ' .

So in this way I can say that my preference is the better one as compaired to the other as due to very high competition in market , the advertisements are made just to give maximum profit to the company not to people thats why they represent product much better from what it is .
