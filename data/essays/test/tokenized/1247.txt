Tourism means visiting to different places where we can see so many different places and different cultures which will be a joyful moments in our life .
Tourism had so many ways of travelling .
Travelling by plane or travelling by train or travelling by bus or motor car gives different kinds of affection and different kind of ideas to think and we can gain ample of information on tavelling which will be a cardinal point in our life .

I strongly agree with the statement that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide because if we are travelling to a different place where we dont know any thing such as their culture and the language and the places which are not before seen and which are not familiar to us , so in this situations tour guide should required who knows very well about the different places and different languages and the culture and their living style as well .

Moreover travelling in a group gives a diffrent kind of thrilling and joyful time while in a group we can enjoy alot we can express our views to each other and we can pass the time by chating with our firends or with our group members .
But we have some advantages and disadvantage of tavelling in a group led by a tour guide .
Firstly we will discuss about the advantages of travelling in group .

- Travelling in group gives lot of happyness
- No fear of theafs
- It feel like we are travelling in a family
- We can gather ample of unknown information from the guide
- The guide will teach every thing individualy about the culture or language .
Similarly we have some disadvantages of travelling in a group with a tour gide , for example a newely wedded couples can not move in groups beause they need privacy from others beacuse they will have their own view and affection towards each other .
Some disadvantages of travelling in group which are as fallows :
- Travelling in group with guid my loose you privacy
- Travelling in group you can not move to any other place by leaving your group
- You can not go beyond your limits with the permission of the guid
- Time maintainance should be there
- And for seeing every historical place certain time will be permitted to see you can not visit or see as much as you want .
So at last I strongly agree with the statement that travelling in a group and that to with a guide will provide more knowledge and it bring more happy and joyful passtime wh
