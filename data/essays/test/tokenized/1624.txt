A difficult moment for a professor , when he prepares his lesson , is often to choose whether he will be more attentive to teach his students a particular fact or a general ideas .
I am conviced that the main point is for students to understand the ideas and concepts .

First of all , a particular fact always contains particular pieces of information that are not necessary to understand one fact , and risk to make trouble in a student 's thoughts .
For example , to explain the concept of legitime defense , it is always difficult to find a perfect example because facts can be interpreted different ways .
On the contrary , the idea itself contains the essential that must be kept in mind , without perturbating elements .

Moreover , a concept allows a student to get a more general knowledge ; free from particular circumstances , he can use his new concepts and adapt them to what he sees .
A concept gives a general informaFor example , he can recognize a case of legitime defense more easily while comparing a precise event to the definition he learned , than while comparing it to another particular event , that could have differences or similitudes that have nothing to do with the point .

This example can be generalized not only to justice , but also to mathematics and physics , that must be conceptualized to be understood .

Of course , a concept is less easy than a fact to understand , because it is more abstract .
But a student should know how to use his knowledge in different circumstances and how to adapt all he learned to what he is confronted to .
Therefore , facts can be a good way to understand concepts and ideas , but they are not the most important to be remembered in the end : they are just a step in the learning of concepts , that allow us to really understand phenomena .
Once understood , an idea is more powerful than a fact .
