i totally agree on what the statment incoluded , to have knowledge of many academic subjects is always better than to have of one .
everything that has more roots to it is always better , to have knowledge in a couple of things is better than just one thing , because sometimes what we know in other subjects , may link to the subject we are seeking as well and give us hints of what we are focusing on .

for example , if i go to collage and think of studying only math , well if i study finance , accounting or any other business major , i could get to study math and learn more than one subject at once , so what would be better to learn one subject or more than just the subject im focusing on ! ?

the answer is always yes to more than one , it gives us more than the information that we seek and gives us more knowledge on to our reguler life , and makes us know more .

if i choose to focus on just one subject , i cant have different goals in life , but if i set my mind to acheive more than one thing , the chances of me getting one of the goals i set my mind to is high , so why just think to myself that im planning to study one subject when there are alot of doors waiting to be open , and i could acheive many things if i set my mind to it , because having one goal somtimes fail , and if it fails , what is a person to do in a situaion like this , its always better for a person to think of having more than one goal , unlike having one goal and failing to it , because if i have more than one goal , i would not be disapointed if i failed in one , because there are others waiting to be acheived .
