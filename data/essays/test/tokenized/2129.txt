Time is the most valuable resource that people have in present world and young people do not stand different .
To some extent I agree that young people nowadays are not able to devote time to their communities .
One of the most important reason is that they are overburdened with the ever increasing quantity of educational material in their colleges .
They are always loaded with the course work , assignments , tests , etc and therfeore they do not find enough time to be devoted to their communities .
During my college days it used to be difficult for me to attend community functions because studying used to take a lot of time and i was seldom left with the time to devote to such functions .

However on the other hand , I would like to add that studying never discourages young people from participating in community work .
Infact education makes them more aware of what sort of community events are required to be conduted ?
Young people have more enthusiasm and so they tend to participate community work with more zest .
Any community work becomes a success only when young volunteers particpate in it .
Young people organize events for the benefit of whole community .
Plenty of blood donation camps becomes a success because of young people themselves donating blood in huge numbers .

Some social organizations are run only with the involvement and support from young people .
Evening educational classes for old age people are generally organized with the help of young people in their community .
Young people go on touring in their community and encourage old age people to come in greater numbers to such classes .
Similar classes are organized for people who want to learn a particular instrument or are interested in any other art form .
Young people organize community events where they can educate their community of the latest happenings aroundhtier locality .

Young people during their school often tend to join Scouts and Guides .
Scouts and Guides is a well known oragnization for the young people and they are invovled in hosting a range of community events , conferences and camps round the world .
Participants in this group organize anti-malria campaign , AIDS awareness program , etc .

So in my view it will be wrong to comment that young people do not give enough time to their communities .
I support the statement that young people tend to be more inclined towards community work .
However the nature of involvement has shifted from only local to global .
Nowadays young people are better aware of matters of global interest and therefore tend to work for issues of larger concern rather than the local ones .
