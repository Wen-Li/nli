In most cases , essays start with stating that the answer for a discussion is not unique .
This is due to the fact that the life is not so simple in most cases and any question may have more than a single answer in most cases .

This is true even for a simple yes or no question like :
Do you agree that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities ?
The critical words in the question are :
1. Young people
2. Nowadays
3. Enough time
4. Help
5. Community
So , I would like to review these critical concepts first , in order to comment on the reasons of the final answer .
How will we define the young people ?
It will not help a lot if we define only by the corresponding age category .
It is necessary to consider the social status and occupation .
A student , an early starter for the professional life and an unemployed young person will not feel the same even if they are at exactly the same age .

How will we define nowadays ?
Is it this year ?
The last decade ?
Or more ?
What is the measure of enough time ?
If one has nothing to do , spending a week for helping the commuinity may be very normal for him .
But a 10 minutes spent by a hard worker of 60 hours per week can be more valuable .

What is help ?
Is it just giving some money or going and working for some activities ?
And finally , how will we define the community ?
Is it correct to ask young people to accept the general values of the society and existing communities without questioning ?
I believe that the comments made above already have the answer in .
I can not agree with this statement .
Most of the young people I know are trying to find ways to understand and express themselves .
Some of them are more lucky .
They have good relations with some people who can help them to improve themselves in this difficult period .
They find plenty of ways and spend much time to help their communities .

Some of the young people are not as lucky as the others .
They can not even think about the problems of others .
They have their own problems .
But this is not their problem and it is not a general case .

So I definitely disagree with the statement given above and say :
`` Young people give as much time as they can to help their communities ! ''
