Do you believe that successful people try new thingd and take risks rather tan only doing what they already know how to do well ?
Some people love to try something new and enjoy creation .
Some other love to do what they already know because they do n't want to take risk of fail .
From my viewpoint , I think that people can success because they try new things and take risks .
I will argue this issue with the fellowing reasons .

First of all , I think that dream make people great .
Children have more possibility because they love dream .
For example , a child dream that he want to be a baseball player .
He may has no idea how he should do will become a good player , however , he will try to reach his goal .
If a child do n't have such a dream , he will never success .

Secondly , I find that these successful people have one character .
They love to solve the problem .
For instance , My father is a professor .
I always find that he love thinking .
He always try to solve the problem in his resurch .
Not like me , I always hope someone will help me to solve the question .
So my father can become a helper , and I always depend other people help .

Thirdly , I think that creativity will make people success .
Sometime people have some new idea , some people will do it , some people do n't , Then those people who love to try their new idea will give them chance to success .
Maybe they have a lot of bed experience during the process , but they learn more lession .
So this knowledge and experience help them success .
If people would n't tp try , maybe we still think that people would never fly in the modern age .

In the summary , I believe that people will success because they will learn more experience and knowledge , and they hope to solve the problem .
And the most improtant thing , they have dream to try that they don , t konw about .
So these people will success .
