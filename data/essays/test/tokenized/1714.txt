I agree that most advertisments make products seem much better than they really are and this is very famous trick to attract customers to buy their products by making huge announsment in magazine , news paper , and TV shows and giving free samples for customers .

However , some products are not getting good advertisements but in reality these products are excellent .
So advertisements are playing a big role in saling products .
For example , i used to buy anti dandruff shampoo it was good and suit my haire then i saw a big advertisement for another shampoo when i use it i was'nt good .

in the other hand , some advertisements reflect a good image for the products and the others are not , so it is depend on the company and how much money they have to spend ot for this advertisement .

In my opinion we should not look how much the advertisements are big but we should know the quality of the products .
More than that , Avertisements are very importante in producing the products and producing the quality of these product so it should not be exagurated or very simple but it should reflect how much the products are useful and good for customers .
