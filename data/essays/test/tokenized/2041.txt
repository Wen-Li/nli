Have n't you ever bought a product that you had no idea but it looked nice on the screen ?
You came home and used the product or ate it and got totally disappointed .
Have you ever thought why you had bought it ?
The answer is so obvious , ofcourse because of the advertisements .
Advertisements usually make a product look much better than it actually is .
There are several ways to persuade the potential consumer for bying the product ; making famous or estitacally approved people to act in the advertisements , employing good directors to shoot the video and using some sociological tricks .

First of the reasons why the advertisements are so convincing is the people who act in them .
Those people are either well-known or more beautiful or handsome than the average .
Imagine an advertisement for a gilette company introducing new technology gillettes , always there is a topless handsome and ofcourse muscular man acts in those ads and guess what after he shaves a very nice woman comes and kissed his smooth cheek .
And now imagine the man is also a famous one so is the woman .
The possibilities of this propduct 's being pruchased would get higher .
This is just beacause the famous people or the estetically approved people are more likely to think and decide much better than us .
The ad 's message they already chose for you which gillette you should use shaving .

Secondly , a good director is a crucial part of an effective advertisement .
This is because what a director 's job is to be your eyes and ears , in other words to see and hear for you .
People 's opinions intend to change in order they are looking at an issue , it could be rather good or bad .
So what a good director was able to do is to show the nice point of view of a material , to show such a perspective that people had no doubt to purchase it .

Lastly and in my opinion most unethically , using some sociol values .
Since humanbeing is a social animal , it has to accept some things given by the society in order to live in peace .
For talking more specifically in Turkey you should get married after some age , have children , be a family and in short words to live just like how other 's are living .
So how they could use this kind of tricks in advertisements , the easiest way to show a happy family in a good economic situation , with one or two smiling children , a selfsatisfied wife and a newspaper reading father .
This formula is going to work for any product because the message is you just like to be us why do n't you join our happy family club buying this product .
So in this case the advertisers happened to use the social pressure on individuals to get profit for the company of the advertised product .

As a conclusion advertisements have a great influence on people since they have the ability to manupulate the audience .
while that does n't mean that every product is n't worth buying or not well-qualitated just because there was a famous person acting in its advertisement .
but what i like to imply here is the market is so big and with the globalization a lot of new companies coming and coming into the market to take their share and not all of them are producing good products but surprisingly all of them want to profit .
So what they are doing is not bettering their products but publishing really attractive advertisements which lead people in the markets to buy the better looking than it 's indeed product for trying .
Moreover if not so why the ads even existed .
