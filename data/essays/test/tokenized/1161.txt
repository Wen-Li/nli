In Korea , there is saying that neigbor is closest causin .
It means that every communities have close bandage for themseleves and easily cooperate each other , and it is not exceptional to young people .
However , things are changed as time goes by , and I firmly agree that young people nowdays have less concern to their communities .
I suport my idea by two main reasons which is the matter of individualism and quality of community .

To begin with , I strongly beileve that the reason of less concern to communities is high individualism .
As industrialization develops , many people started to concentrate on their own time and life , not on their communitie .
They even do not recognize what their communities are doing .
For example , my friend has no concern and does not want to involve in her community .
She has her own job as a university student , and there are so many things to do .
She even ignores the things that needs her help .

Secondly , I confirm that it is because of the communities ' misworking .
They underestimate the importance of young people 's concern beacause they are interested in only benefits of welfare to elder people who usually concern with them .
In that sense , communities are obsessed to get elder 's high reputation and concern .
These make young people to be sick of doing something for their communities and no advantages for helping communities .
Those events that communities holding are not attractive and even boring .
This is the major reason why young people do not give concern and help their communities .

Consequently , I agree that young people nowadays have no concertn to help communities in the name of high individualism and the quality of community .
