well , `` most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are '' , i am gree with this statement for the fallowing reassons : some companies try to sell the producte maybe giving a impact in the client , like puting a powerfull color , maybe the brand 's name will be tagged from a popular person , and making such a expensive comercial and even paying people to talk about how good the product is .
well this can have a good impress in the poeple but what about when this productes has a while in the market place and everybody is using them ?
if the producte does not satisfide the client the prestigious of the product and the demand of the product will decrease .
wich means lost of money ( for the comercial ) and expensis and the product soon wont have demand at all because of the unsatisfied client which were consuming them .

But if the producte is as good as the advertisements , so this productive will last longer term in the market bacause in the beguining people will be atracted by the propagands or the nicely of the productive , people will start consumed or buying it because looks very good , and when they start using them one after another they will see how good it is and they will keed adquiring them because this producte it is useful .
So companies wich really wants to investement in bussines and growit in they schould think about it .
companies schould think farthermore .
If a make a deficient producte the clients will consume but just at the beguining and later on they wont be satissfieded with it .

I think most of the poeple will agree as me in how advertisements make products look like .
because of many things that peple adquired but they are not satisfied with it .
and do you know what they will do next time ? ...
they will not get the same stuff or things .
so this should be a warning for companies before they put their product in the market .
