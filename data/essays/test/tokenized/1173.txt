The car plays a significant role in the development of what is called the `` American Dream '' .
Having one 's own car symbolizes the freedom and liberty to choose what one wants to choose and to go where one wants to go - independently and easily .
Certainly , there are many developing countries , that try to adopt the American way of life .
Ca n't we therefore easily conclude that the number of cars worldwide will significantly increase in the next - let 's say - twenty years ?

In this essay , I want to shed some light on this question in order to provide better arguments on whether we will have more cars on the future or whether we wo n't .
My position will be , that we will definitively have more cars by 2026 , but that there are also good reasons to doubt a rapid , extreme growth .

Firstly , one of the most important issues of international politics calls car-production into question : Cars pollute our environment massively .
Therefore , there is and there will also be in the future a strong movement against the use of cars and in favor of public transport .
This argument in certainly true , but nevertheless I believe that technological progress will allow big corporations to create cars , that pollute the environment less and less .
Although some people will avoid cars and although their number might increase , I do n't believe , that this policy can significantly lower the number of cars world-wide .

Furthermore , the econimoc growth of developing countries mentioned above mates with a second factor : their rapid population rise .
In the coming decades , there will be more and more people on our planet , who all want to participate in the Western game of capitalism and democracy .
And these will certainly also want to drive cars .
Probably , cars will even necessarily be a part of their Western-oriented way of life .

But thirdly , one could argue , that the growing population and the restriction of space on our planet will lead to very large towns and cities , cities for example as big or even bigger than today 's `` megacity '' Mexico City .
Cars , this argument goes , would just hinder the traffic in such places and could be gradually replaced by better public transport .
This is again an argument with a great plausibility .
But still , I ca n't come to believe that the number of cars will fall in total , because at least in the upcoming century there will always be places , where there is no such strict limitation of space .
Today 's cities already provide enough room for cars with all their roads and highways .
And this is very unlikely to be changed at all .

Finally , there is something in many Western people , that can nearly be called an obsession for cars .
They belong to the Western way of life , they are goods of luxury and of status or sometimes even playthings for grown-up boys .
This attitude towards cars will certainly stay to be part of our culture for quite a long time .
Strikingly , such an attitude is even enforced by the industry , their advertisements and their production .
These companys need to create and maintain a market for their cars and - as all corporations - they expand .
How could we believe - or hope ?
- that cars will become less popular due to these circumstances ?

To sum up , there is hardly any striking evidence for the idea , that we will have fever cars after the next twenty years .
Rather , all the arguments for such a position and all the problems about cars I pointed out , can be accounted for in a larger picture of our planet 's and culture 's development .
And in such a picture , cars will definitely maintain their place during the next decades and possibly even centuries .
