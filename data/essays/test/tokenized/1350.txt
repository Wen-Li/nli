i agree with the following statement that itis more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than itis for them to learn facts .
the reason i thought that , this is more easier than it is for them to leatn facts , and also that can be using time wisely .

first , it is more easier than it is for them to learn facts , because if i understood what teacher saying , and after the school i come to my house , and studyed myself easily , when i was kids i do not understand what teacher saying and this is hard to get what is teacher saying .
so i have to ask my parents and my fiends .
if i got it before this , it was easier than asking my parents and my friends .

secondly , i can use time more wisely .
because we can get more time to study for the other subjects and also we have more free time than that .
for exampl one of my friends , he was always getting hundred and good at p.e. and i thought if i something like him , i could get better grades .
but he do everything the other student does he played and also studyed .
and i got he were understood teacher saying and he just need little time to memorizing them .

in conclusion , it is more important for studends to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts .
because it is more easier than that and also we could spend the time more wisely .
