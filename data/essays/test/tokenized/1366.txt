Is it more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts ?
I personally believe that the answer to this question is , yes .
I agree that understanding ideas and concepts in class is important and more helpful than remembering facts .

As a young student as myself , I have experienced both methods and found that understanding the ideas and concepts more effective in the long run .
During a lesson , for example a geography lesson , I would be more interested in the concept of glacier formation and with interest I would be keen to understand the process rather than the facts .
Understanding ideas has given me a better view in a wide range of subjects and helped me remember the process , for example the glacier formation , easily .
Learning facts can be very boring and quickly forgotten .

I believe that being a good teacher , is to be able to explain and intorduce new ideas well .
Good explaination and understanding not only helps the student achieve better results in class but also helps the student in the future .
Everything that you understand from the teachers or fellow classmates , will eventually connect with topics that will be taught later on in class or at University .
If a student just remembers the facts early on , it will not help the student with the next topic that requires understanding from the previous topics .
For example in chemistry , I would n't be able to understand acid-base equilibrium today if i did n't understand the concept behind equilibrium which was taught last year .

In addiction , students who just remember facts in any subject will have difficulties to imply them in everyday life and conversations held between other students and professors .
It is a shame to see how many people do struggle with this .
I know many people who would just remember facts and be stuck in an awkward situation with other students as they did n't quite know exactly what they were talking about and could n't show his or her interest .

Finally , I conclued that understanding ideas and concepts are more important for not only exams but in the long run , as it gives an advantage in future studies and is kept in the memorie for a longer period of time .
