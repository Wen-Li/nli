The issue stated that will their be fewer cars in coming twenty years from now .
I disagree with the staement .
I believe their will be an increase in the car density on the roads twenty years from now .

The first reason why do i believe in this is that increase in the employment oppurunities in the country .
As the country is progressing or developing there are lot mulitnational companies coming into the feild which give lot employment , making person sound financially , as a consequence people can easily afford cars which will further increase the car popullation on the raods in near future .

Secondlly i think competitions between the banks , which provide loans for the cars on easy installments that will also encourage the people to buy more cars .

Thridly i think the people density is increasing in the metreopolitan cities therefore people donnot get jobs in the vicinity of their home and the jobs that are available are far from the home , therefore they require their own private vehicles like cars to reach on time and cover up distances from the homes to the work places .

Final reason for my belief for increase in the car density in coming twenty years is the competition between car manufacturer .
To promote the sales of their company cars , they are currently coming with slash down rates .
This tempts people to buy more cars .
As i look back over the decade the car density has increased ten times and according to the news reports these companies are coming with new straegies to promate their sales in coming few decades .

I conclude my opinion on the above statement by stating that the car density will rise because of easy loan facilities , for convience of people and coming uf strong copetitions in car maufacture market .
