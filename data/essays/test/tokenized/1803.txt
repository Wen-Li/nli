We know a saying that `` getting a idea , getting three facts '' in the China .
The ideas and concepts are the cores of the facts .
We can learn more and more facts by the ideas and concepts .
So to the learning facts , I prefer the understanding ideas and concepts .

Firstly , the ideas and concepts are the cores under the surface facts .
For example , we know the clouds can brings us rain , also you can find the water dropping from the leaf in the moring .
How could we relate them .
If we undersand the concept that either the rain from the cloud or the water in the leaf are the some .
Both of them are the result of the cold tempture making the water occuring .
If we get this idea , we can remeber facts for ever and never to make mistakes

Secondly , if we understand the ideas and the concepts , we could learn facts easily and fast than we only get the facts .
While you know the heavy and small objects have same speed when they fall from the high place and the object is moveing more fast on the smooth surface than on the rough surface .
And further more , if you get the ideas and concepts of the things that they have the same ideas , The Force Law , you can tell you friends easily and fast how the object moves in the world for you have the cores which makes you to undersand the same topic facts .

In addtion , should we only learn the ideas and concepts ?
I don not think so .
The learning facts can help us understand the ideas and concepts more better .
We can think the ideas deeply when we use the ideas to tell why the fact is this .

In conclusion , it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts .
But at the same time , we shoud use the facts to test if we fully understand the ideas .
