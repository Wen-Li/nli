Most products are overvalued in their advertisements as most advertisements lack comparison and proof .

First of all , it should be noted that most companies do not rely on technical facts during their adverisment preperations .
Most of advertisements we see on TV are non-technical and solely profit-oriented shows .
A women shows ahead and talks about the product for minutes .
The product may have a few notable qualifications , or at least none at all .
If there are some , they may be repeated many times during the advertising process .
If the product does not posses any differences that makes it better , the woman may have already been told some artifical ones to impose .
Ironically , these false attributes may be crappy most of the time .
They will probably be claims that are either unuseful or the ones that can not be proved .
For example , a schampoo company advertisement may suggest that the company is number one in terms of hair health .
How can it be proven ?
If it is really true , the audience should be provided a proof such as a research conducted by the firm and an institution or a university .

What about the comparative ones ?
They are even worse then the former ones .
Let us discuss an advertisement of a firm that produces cleaning powder .
One may probably see the screen is splitted into two or four , for the rival firms to show up .
Ethically - or because of the issues that are discussed above - other fims are censored .
What we see is the domination of the advertising firm over the unnamed companies , the ones who have accomplished no cleaning at all .
How come these companies do contribute the cleaning powder with their non-cleaning products is another issue .

The last but not the least impotant thing is , those advertisers who want to rely on pseudo-technical data , might use exeggerated techniques which would make a clever man laugh .
Those ones may employ a supesonic microgranule , simulated through the dirts .
That is a
