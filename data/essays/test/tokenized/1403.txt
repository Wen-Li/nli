I disagree with the statement mentioned .
You should not compare helping in the community and helping in the family .
in former times it was tradition that the children live together with their parents and grandparents and they helped each other .
today it is not like this anymore and therefore many people think that this generation does n't care about social life .

This is not true , because there had been never so many organizations in the world which helps depressed countries or transfer money to disabel persons or spend money for the reaserch of methods against cancer .
This shows that the people nowadays are interested in helping other people .
Perhaps it seems that young people are not so interested in the community because they look more to the problems of the whole world and not only on the problems in their city .
This ca n't be seen as a negative point , instead it is a positive achievement due to the globalization of help .

Additionally , i know many people who work in organizations or elderly homes to help there for no money .
People who have no time to help personally because they have to much work to do by their own , mostly spend money to those organization I mentioned above .

Another point that emphezis this opinion is that nowadays the boys prefer to do a sozial year instead to go to the military a year .
Today the boys can choose if they want to work in a sozial organization like elderly homes or hospitals or to go to the military .
I knew more boys who prefer to help other people , although this type of work is harder and although this is more work than to go to the military .

Thus , it can be seen that there are many people who give enough time to helping not just their communities , they wants to help out by problems which occures over the whole world .
