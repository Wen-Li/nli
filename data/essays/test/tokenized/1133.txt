a first and foremost quality of the human race is ominpotence

In this world of fusion , communication and progression , I firmly believe that a persion with the possession of a wide spectrum of knowledge overtakes the one with only a specific knowledge in only one field .

Research in this currently advancing world requires us to have a broad range of knowlege .
As we can see in the case of Newton and hook , it is Hook that raise the discussion of universal gravity , while Newton is the first person to give the mathematical proof .
Hook is only a empiric physicist , which contribute to his narrow-mindedness in his field-he do not own the same mass volume of mathematical knowledge as Newton does .
As we can perceive in the history book , Newton utilize calculus in completing the proof , which make him a great difference in the science history .

A second requirement derives from our own self .
For instance Boethius , the catholic sentenced to death by the Theodoric , innovate the neoplatonism and brought forth the traditional `` Liberal Arts '' in the medieval times .
Liberal arts conduce to the holistic development of a successful individual , at least in his times .
Even universities in middle ages are based upon that idea .
According to his works , the realm of knowledge can be divided into the tier of theology , philosophy and science .
Let 's take a switch from late antiquity to modern times .
It is already clear that Einstein 's innovation in the field of physic has much to do with his music training and philosophical thinking , through the careful anatomy of his brain .
A scientist , especially a scientist in the field of theory , share the basis of creation with musicians and artists .
That is the hominine essense within human-beings .

Then what is hominine essence ?
We human-beings are distinguished from the brutal beasts in that we create with intent .
This creation , if viewed on macro-level , including all aspects of human knowledge .
It 's a splendid star with the combination of art , history , science , mathematics , philosophy , theology , et cetera .
Therefore a representative of the human race should possess all aspect of human knowledge , with nothing omitted .
To be one member of the human race , how can one person only possess a limited amount and a narrow range of what is essential in the foundation of hominine essence ?
Therefore he or she should get accoutred with anything , or any aspect that characterize the whole human race !

Whether considering the respect of research or pondering the aspect of hominine essence , a human-being , if he is eager to become a member of the human race , should equip himself with a wide spetrum of knowledge .
A man , by definition , is the master of all existing arts per se .
He , without any doubt , should be omnipotent .
