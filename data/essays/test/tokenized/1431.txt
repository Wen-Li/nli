To be realistic , I truly do not think that the number of cars will have any prospect of decreasing , ever .
Indeed , the need for short range transportation in everyday life make cars a nessecity .
Many worldwide trends also indicate that continued increase in car usage really has no currently foreseable return .

The most intuitive cause is probably the ever-increasing prevalence of the privately owned automobile .
As growing nations , China for example , eventually fully modernize , with the average person gaining more economic wealth , the consumption of cars will just continue to grow with even more rapidly .

Maybe in some countries , regulations on automobile use and ownership , possibly out of environmental concerns , may curb car use slightly .
However , newer technology : efficient diesel engines , oil-electric hybrid engines , etc. all alleviate this issue .
It advance technology propogates , environmental concerns on car use more even someday subside completely , becoming a historical issue .

Of course , too many cars , thus too much traffic , is an issue in every major city in the world .
This is why construction of modern public transportation systems seems to be a must-do item for any metropolis of considerable size .
The implementation of such public systems will certainly lessen the need for private cars , but it seems that most people still have private vehicles , either for use under emergency conditions , or even recreational purposes ( e.g. the weekend countryside picnic , no metro system will probably get THERE ) .
As for a solution for too much traffic , I believe that in the future , modern wireless network technology might be added to cars , and with appropriate infrastructure , efficient metropolitan traffic control and management might be possible .
For example , computer scheduling of car flow may avoid much traffic congestion .

In summary , I simply think that the car is too much a nessecity of modern life , such that other issues , although important , really can not dwarf it .
I think that mankind will find ways to solve the many problems of car use , both comprehensive and pragmatic , that will make this aspect of everyday living sustain its function well into the future .
