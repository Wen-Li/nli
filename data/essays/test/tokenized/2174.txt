I agree with the idea that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are for the following reasons .

One of the purpose of the advertisements is to stimulate people to buy their products or so if the advertisements is less atractive than the real products it is meaningless to spend the budjet on the advertising .
Do you atract the advertisements such as not so beautiful colored cosmetics or not sizling beef steak picture in front of the restaurant ?

In addition , other important purpose of the advertisement is to aware people attention to their brands .
Recently in the market there are many many products appealing to consumers it is so competitive in the most industry .
Your competitors also should provide much attractive advertisements to attack your products so you should create attractive advertisements to compete them .
To make products seem much better is very important when we think the purpose of the advertisements .

Consumers usually learn from their past experience that the advertisements emphasis on too much benefits which they really can provide , so they tends to judge the advertisement severly .
Many people knows if they succeed to lose weight they need to reduce the amount of food they eat and excesize regurally , they realized that only taking supliments or having cream on their body do not effect .
However they need to have a dream by the advertisements which provided positive image for their diet life .

To think the purpose of the advertisements and consumers behaviour it is unavoidable that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .
However we also should keep it mind that sometimes too much decolated advertisements might loose consumers trust then lead your business failure .
