Advertisements are everywhere .
We are constantly surrounded by thousands and thousands of product advertisements , and many times we do n't even notice them .
This is why most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are , so that you can notice and feel attracted to them .

In the product market , there are many factors that would make your product popular , but the most important one is the advertising section .
Nowadays , there are many products of the same kind that are in constant competition to win take the market , and , as in every business , there 's many things in play , like money for example .
Some enterpices , wo n't care about not being honest in their advertising campains and probably lie about their products .

Advertisements should make your product look great to people , and sometimes even some exaggerations are made to win the market .
An oustanding product will have all of its qualities in the top class rank .
If you have a very high quality , innovative product , but you lack of good advertising , it would probably not sell .
In the other hand , a product which has a quality deficiency , but has a good looking advertisement , may capture your attention .

Let me use an example .
There is a very common alcoholic beverage that is known by everybody , called Bacardi .
Bacardi is one of the lowest quality roms that are in the market of alcohol .
In spite of this , Bacardi 's bottle presentation and TV advertisements , make the product look nice , elegant , a top class beverage , even though , in my opinion , its not true .

Professional people is often hired so that they make an advertising campain , in order to raise the product status , but leaving the quality of it as it is .
Those people know all the market , what people like , how people think . ..
And using some techniques , they can make people be attracted to the product .

Nowadays , quality standards and regulations are being applied to many companies , so that products that are currently in the market , would have all the same quality .
I thing applying these regulations makes all products better , and advertising campains will be made in a more honest way .
