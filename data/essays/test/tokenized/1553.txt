Today advertisement is a typical way to support your product .
But this do not always mean , that you make products better then the realy are .
The advertisement is to convince the consumer that this produkt is the right for him .
This could be for several reasons .

One possibility is , it was mentioned bevor , that you convince the consumer by making the produkt better than it is .
So the person buy it becaus he espact a very high return to his investment .

Television spots for cleaning products are a good example .
In this spots it is typical that advertisements describe there products as very affective .
Possible more effective then than they realy are .
It is shown a very dirty clothing and when you use the advertised product , your clothes are cleaned completly .
This may not occour under practical conditions , like in normal houses .

For me , this is not the right way of marketing .
This could effect to an angry consumer .

An other , in my opinion much more important function is , that you inform the customer .
There are products , that have to be introduce , because the are new and unknowen .
If you do not get to know the product by advertisements , you would propably never have heard from it .

For this point of view , it is important that you look on advertising not like forcing the people to buy .
Normaly a product should have a recognizeable value to the consumer and for that , you realy want to buy it .
Now it is clear that at first he needs to know the advanteges of this special produkt .

To conclude , I would not criticize advertisements in generally .
You have to look behind the reasons .
In some cases it is an usefull instrument for boath sites , the producer and the consumer .
