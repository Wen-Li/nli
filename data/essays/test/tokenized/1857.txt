Although some people may say that having only one specialized knowledge is helpful , I believe that having broad knowledge is better .
It is because that the wide knowledge can be useful on people 's jobs and even creates a new field .

The first reason is that people may adapt the broad knowledge into their own work , so the work can be done effectively .
For example , one of cousins had graduated from a medical shool .
However , after the graduation , he realized that the one thing he truely wants to learn was music .
Therefore , he reentered the university as a music major .
He enjoyed the music for the campus life , and when about to graduate the university again , he worried about his career .
Every musician close to him suggested him not to be a just musician because musicians do not earn much money in a reality .
Therefore , he decided to be a doctor again .
Other friends said to him that he wasted time on music .
However , he became a doctor who works in musical clinics .
No other doctors could know about music better than he could .
Thus , he is a number one doctor in musical clinic now in my country , Korea .
The music which is very different from medicine helps the diffent job .
As I explained , much knowledge can be significantly useful in any other field .

The second reason is that even a new field can be created by a person who has broad academic knowledge .
Mr.Dalson is a famous artist .
However , even 20 years ago from now , he was a mechanics .
He always wanted to become an artist , but reality does not let him be .
One day , he quit his machanic job and started his art work .
According to what he had done for his whole life , machanics , he combined those two works , art and machanics .
No one supported him and said the creatures are wield .
However , now , he is considered as a artist who created a new artform `` Machanic Art '' .
As Mr.Dalson did , different academic subjects can combine and be a novel subject .

Having broad knowledge is not only useful on one 's work , but also creates a new field .
