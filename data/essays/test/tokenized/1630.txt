Helping the community in which we are living , is a curicial component of being a society , I belive .
When the people are sensitive to eachother and try to improve the quality of life of the others as well as him/herselves , a better society forms .

In my opinion , young people do not give enough time helping their communities .
There may be several reasons for this .
One of them may be is that , time is precious nowadays .
There are lots of activities to join or lots of documents to read which help the improvement of the person himself .
Therefore , I think young people concentrate more in improving themselves .
Both the education system and the requirements of today 's world reinforces this behaviour .

I am a member of a socal club in my country , in which we organize some activities .
Although the actual aim of these kinds of clubs are personal improvements , they use some of social activities as a tool .
For instance , members go to House of Elder People or they organize a concert and give the profit of the concert to the Homeless Children 's Hause .
Among these activities , it is obvious that , organizing a concert is more rewarding in the aspect of improving personal talents and gaining experience than visiting old people .
The second one actually , is more like an advertisement of the club .
The members are more willing to participate the activities and shoulder responsibilities when arranging a concert , like finding sponsors or signing contracts with the concert places .
The attandence is usually below the expectations when visiting old people .
Young people do not seem to be intrested in the happiness they will create .

As a conclusion , I believe that , young people do not give enough time to helping their communities but mostly are interested in helping themselves to increase the quality of their living .
