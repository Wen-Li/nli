I agree with the idea that advertisements sometimes mislead people or cause them to misunderstood the features of product .
Mainly , advertisors used lightning and camera techniques , relative size technique and attractive scenery for that purpose .

In advertisements , workers often use technologically improved lights and cameras diffrent from the ones we use in our houses .
Thus , these professional equipments show everything shiny and beatiful .
Even a sewer can be presented as a prosperous liveplace .
For example , the advertisements about the cars will be misleading generally .
Because , in these types of advertisemets , the cars are always presented as shiny , with a smooth and gently curved surface .
However , if you stop by an automoblie gallery and see these cars , you will think that they are not as attractive as they seem .

In addition to camera techniques , producers advertise their product by using relativly large or small objects in the advertisement .
For instance , if they want to sell a mobile phone , which is expected to be small , they prepare an adversitement with a tall people , whose hand is absolutely larger than ours , then we can think of that the mobile phone is really small .
You can think this small mobile phone is attractive and suitable for you , but that is not the case .
Or , they can want to sell a relatively big car and want to emphasize that it is big , they prepare an advertisement with full of little children , instead of driving in vast deserts .
Hence , a person which like bigger cars can be misleaded by this advertisement .

The size is one aspect of scenery ; however , not completely .
The colors and shapes of surroundings are also used as a technique .
For example , one company wants to present its new product which is a candy .
They can advertise it by putting into a colorful and round shaped surrounding ; hence , you can think that it is tasty and sweet .
However , after buying these candies , most probably , you do not think about the candy as you did before .

Consequently , advertisors and companies are using several techniques to make the products seem attractive ; however , it is misleading generally .
