In my opinios , I prefer having broad knowledge of many academic subjects rather than to specilize in one specific subject because of importance of academic ages .
There are several reasons .

First , a narrow knowledge field may occur of narrow seesight .
The man who know only one field called `` L '' typed human .
vertical section of `` L '' shows various field , and horizonal field shows are amount of knowledge .
Because the `` L '' typed human does not know another area , they cound not work another area .
It may be a extremely penalty .
I recommand `` A '' typed human or `` H '' typed human having two or more specialize skills or has not only specified skill but also related skills .
These tyoed human can adopt every position , and may found their new potential .
For example , I majored computer science , but I alwals has a question about another potential .
I studied various subjects , as a result I could cook , actor and master of Takwondo .

Second , as you would like to become a specialist , you should know about all the fields related to your subjects .
For instance , if you like to become a best network engineer , it is impossible to know about the networks .
For the efficient transmit/receive mechanism , you should know the hardware architecture ; for the reduce of problem such as bottle neck , you should understand not only memory architecture but also operating system ; if you get a software showing gool performance you does not know about network , you should know software engineering .
In addition , if you would like a good project conclusion , you need to know the activity as a team management .
If you does not various field , you could not lead your team composed psesons having various skill .
All clues written on upper thesis must study at a academic ages .

In academic ages , it is a best ages to study abroad , so all students in a university does not lazy to studying an abroad subjects .
You had better having a broad knowledge of many academic subjects .
