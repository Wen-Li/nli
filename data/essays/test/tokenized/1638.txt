I agree that people who are successful take risk and try new things .
It is not a coincidence that it exist the saying `` who does not risk , does not win '' .

The world is always changing and there is always the need of something new and different and if we only do what we know well it can come a moment when what we know is not enougth and we need to learn something new in order to stay in .

Successful companies are those who take risks .
lets take the photo industry as an example .
When the digital camera came out , not all companies new well how to do this kind of technology but they took a chance and tried it , If they had not done that , they would still be selling regular cameras and would already be out of the market .
because the needs have changed .

The same situations happens with people .
It is true that we are usually afraid to try new things and get out of the routine , it is maybe because we feel more secure and confortable with the idea that we know exactly what we are doing and that we are doing it rigth , but we migth come to a point where we need to change , to evolve , to look for new horizons .
I say this because if we take and example of a person who works in a company , he knwos well what he does , but he does not have the posibility to grow in the company anymore , he has two options : Stay there because he already knows what he has to do , he already knows the people and the system and he does not have to change anything .
Or , look for other options , it can be risky , different , new , maybe he is not going to know exactly the job and will have to learn new things , but maybe he can have a better chance of success .

Take risk and try new things opens new doors for the present and the future .
