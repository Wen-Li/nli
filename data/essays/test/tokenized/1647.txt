That 's a really true statement .
Advertisements has now a days become the way companies can manipulate human beings .
Most of the advertisements we see appear to be what we had dream of .
Advertisements has become the way companies can easily get us to buy their products .

When a man sees an advertisement of any product and a nice pretty girl advertising it , he becames crazy for it .
We can see the example of `` Axe '' .
All its advertisements are with a lot of beautiful girls in tiny skirts following a man that uses this product .
Me like a man , the first time I saw it , I run to buy it .
I ca n't deny it smell good , but you ca n't pretend that all the girls run after you trying to get an appointment .
Most of the times this is what happens , companies exagerate things making us believe that we will reach heaven if we buy all those things .

But that is how the economy moves now a days .
Companies need a way to sell their products , and there 's no better one that advertising it .
But advertising it with a bunch of good things .
Companies have found out that we , as human beings , have emotions and feelings and we dream to have things we wo n't get so easily .
And that is what companies advertise , all those dreams come true by buying one product .
It 's disappointment to find out that all was a lie .

People must learn that nothing is like they paint it for you .
The only way to find out what 's good and what not , is proving it .
So do n't be so fool to believe that your dreams will come true just because an advertisemnet says it .
