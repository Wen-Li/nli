I agree that it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts .
Many students learn a lot like math , literature , language , and so on .
When they learn something , they need to understand how it makes or can be like that .
According to a book which I did not remember , a child who learn and understand ideas and concepts is more smart than others who do not .
Thus , students should understand those .
There are two reasons for the statement .

To begin with , it may help students to make another new ideas and concepts .
For instance , when students learn math how to calculate , it depends on how to do .
Some students learn facts for math .
The students just memorize math forms .
However , the other students understand concepts .
The students understand how math form is and why it does .
They do effort to understand principle .
It helps a lot for students .
Additionally , their brains active more than other students .
Thus , they think very well so they make another way to solve math form .
At first time , it is very difficult , but the way is easier than other way later .

Furthermore , students achive a lot of knowledges .
When students understand ideas and concepts , they look for other facts and also understand about that .
When I was a middle school student , I just memorized facts
