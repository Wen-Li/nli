I agree to the statement and disagree at the same time , because it depends on the place I 'm travelling to , and if I have been there before or not .
The statement is correct in a way , but also wrong in other ways , if I weighed the pros and cons of travelling in a group led by a tour guide , I would say that I would agree with the statement if I 'm visiting a new place that I do n't know anything about it .
On the other hand , if I 'm travelling to a place that I have been to before , I would prefer to travel alone .

Travelling in agroup led by a tour guide will give me the privilage of feeling secure , this is very important when it comes to places I do n't know .
At the same time I can rest assured that I will see all interesting places and sights of that place , without missing anything .
This way I can truly live the experience and enjoy the trip without worrying about money arrangements , hotel booking , airline schedules and other things that can really ruin the pleasure of the trip .

But if I 'm travelling to a place I have been to before , I will definitly prefer to travel alone , this will set me free from being tied up to a group all the time .
Thats because I know the place , I know where to have fun and I know what is interesting to do or see , so there is no need for the commitment to a schedule .
Furthermore I can enjoy a specific activity more time than another one if I would like , but this is a pleasure of freedom that comes with a price , as I will be responsible for all the arrangements of travel , but it is a price I 'm willing to pay for that freedom and pleasure I 'm looking for .

To sum it up , I 'm willing to put more money and effort to travel alone if I can handle the risks involved in that , but I would absolutly travel with a group led by a tour guide if the risks are vague , because uncalculated risks can cost me a lot .
