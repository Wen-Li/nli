The main issue of advertisements , in my opinion , is two-fold .
On one side there are the economic interests of the company which is selling a specific product , on the other there are the interests of the consumers which are to be granted .

It results clear that a company , in order to survive within the market , has to sell the grater possible amount of its products .
Many are the instruments that can be referred to , although the major one , and the more strictly linked to the topic of this essay , appears to be marketing .
This economic tool has its main focus on how to improve sales by taking into account consumers preferences , the impact of the image of the product , the pricing and so on .
All of these factors must be considered and contribute to the creation of an advertisment .
It can be easily inferred that an advertisement will concentrate more on the benefits that the product confers to the buyer , without drawing too much attention to its drawbacks .
That is why , to me , advertisements make products much more appealing than they really are .

There are some limits though .
During the past , the field of advertisement was a kind of a free zone , with no rules that regulated its market .
In modern days , instead , a growing awareness of the risks of a misleading advertisement has triggered a counter-reaction which the naissance of authorities that defend customers ' rights is the result of .
The behaviour of a company is now strictly observed by such authorities which have , also , the right to impose precise standards requirements for an advertiesment .
All the details of the products must be easily comprehended by the buyer .
For example , following a resolution by the European Union , a product which does not contain cocoa butter , can still be defined as chocolate .
The producer is to specify , though , the ingredients enabling , in such way , the consumer to evaluate properly which kind of product he/she is about to buy .
