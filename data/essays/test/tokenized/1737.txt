Nowadays , there arises an controversial issue about whether to learn the ieads and concepts , that is to say , the soul of the something , or the facts .
Different people with changing circumstances will difinitely bear different opinions as the two options both have their own advantageous aspects .
Insofar as i am concerned , i will chose to learning the ideads without hesitation for the following reasons .

The first element fact which pushes me into chosing the former option is that i can learn their ways of thinking by understand the key to the definition of a book or a new thing which i am accepting because when i get the ideas of the book , it is equal to , to some extent , talk with the author , namely , get the soul of the meaning .
And in that way , I can improve my ideation and embodiment my personal ability .

The second sensible reason is that i need not to charge more details .
Instead of put the energy on finding the facts , i should concentrate on the ideas which the author has stated and try to thingking in a more logical way , in other words , reading a book is to find out my problems of thinking and find out the plot in a book .
Thinking logically will virtually bring benefits for me inasmuch as i am seeking the sequences in the reading passagge , it exerts a subtle influence on me in terms of spritual aspect .
And in that way , i can look at something in an objective perspective .

Even though the previous reasons sound reasonable , there also appears some merits in the opposite side .
It is a contestable fact that i will get some useful imformation when i am learning facts or details .

As a consequence , judging from the previous part i presented we can easily draw the conclusion that understanding ideas will obviously outweigh than learning facts .
