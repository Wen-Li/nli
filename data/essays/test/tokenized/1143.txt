Yes , I do agree with the statement which says `` Successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well . ''
Successful people by nature and riding on the back of his or her previous achievements is more likely and inclined to try out new concepts and venture onto new and unfamiliar horizons .
And it is more likely and logical that a successful person will try new things than a person who has previously tried and failed .
For a person who has failed earlier is usually hesitand and has very low level of self confidence .
He perhaps suffers from bitten then a twice shy syndrone .

A sucessfull person will probably be one first one to try out new and risky things .
`` Like everyone else spend some time and tinking about why some people are more succeful in life factors that are in success that are under more personal control then others '' Sucessfu people might be integent .
or have had socially wel connected up bringings .
Are e naturally energetic and open and positive .

Let us take an example of a game that some one is good at .
Lets us say that these individual has masterd this game and can play it so wel .
That his selmdom ends up on that lossing side now let us imagine the amount of satisfaction it would bring to do this individual who has `` PLAYED `` and won this `` GAME DAY '' in and day out .
I would assume he might not be all that thirlled on winning it .
Since he has already done it on `` NUMEROUS OCCASSIONS '' he wuld not enjoy because now the gamehas chessed the boos any real challenge .

He might and probably would end up taking some thing that appears more challenging to him some thing he can stick to .
something he can succeed at .
