The main topic is that it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts .
I agree with this statement .
The first reason I agree with this is that , If students understand the ideas and concepts it is much more easier for them to understand any task or any project they are handling .
For example if they are doing any project , they should understand the concept of that project and come up with different ideas .
So that it will be well organised and willbe done according to the requirement .
If you go according to the facts we may not be able to succeed in that project .
Because in reality the similar project failed due to several reasons .

Another reason is that in any type of activity they perform , If they understand the concept of that activity and get some new ideas and proceed , it is easy to suceed .
If you really look for facts you may not suceed in many occasions .
Onother thing is that , Students always have no real experiance with many things and they look facts by reading books and other journels .
Some times which is not true and give wrong judgement also .

It is also important for students that if they understand the concept of any activity its easy get some good ideas based on their personnel experiene or some thing that what they read in books .
Always better ideas give good results and it helps students to perform another activity with more new concepts .
If they look into the facts they may not be able to gain any success but may get some information which they dont think in similar concept .
Some cases it will help student to undersand the reasons for failing or success .

Finally I understand that for students it is more important to understand the ideas and conepts than learnfacts .
