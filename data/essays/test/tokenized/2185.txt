There are many successful people in the world and these people succeed because they risk themselves using their intelligence in a wise way .
I agree with the statement that says `` successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well '' .

In the business world , many famous businessmen started their work by risking and taking new things .
Risk challenges people and those who are capable and confidence enought to do it will success .
For example , my father 's friend who was a worker in a company wanted to open his own business , so he gave up his work and opened a small clothes store and the following year he gained a lot of money .
However , he was an ambitious man and he wanted to expand his business .
He invested his money in by fabrication the clothes and as the time went by , the store became very popular in the town .

I believe that if this man would have never risked himself in the business field he would still working in the company and be an ordinary man .
But now I realized that if a person is wise and smart and know how to do business , taking new adventure and risks are a good chance to success .
