I do think that advertisments make somtimes products seem much better than they really are .
First i think this is logic since advertisments are usually commercial and this makes the main porpuse for an advertisment is to show the advantage of the product even if that mean exaguration .
Advertising in general is a relatively large field , it studies the response of consumers in order to be able to design the right advertisment for a certain product .
In an open market full of competetors usually the most effective way to sell a product is to claim that this product is the best and to try to convince the consumer to buy it and this is the main aim .
I can recall now the washing powder used for washing machines , when I watch these advertisments I get confused as a consumer , every advertisment for one kind of washing powder is claiming that it is the best in the market and it can do what others can not .
Like removing stains from clothes and giving a refreshing smels to clothes , and I have experienced that some of these claims are not quite right .

Some say why a good product need to be advertised in the first place , they say the product can talk for them selves , in other words adverstisment is used for the less quality product in order to sell it .

I do n't quite agree with this view since we see advertisments for the best cars brands in the world ( BMW , Merceeds . ..
etc . ) .
Again do these very fine products seem much better than they are when shown on advertisments !
I think not , since all fine quality product producers know they will loose some of thier credit in the market if they resort to exagguration and that might shock thier position in the market , and such names can not afford to loose thier ranking position in a certain market for example cars , washing powder , food . ..
etc .
