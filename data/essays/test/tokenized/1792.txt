I can say that I am the person who traveled many times .
Since 1999 , I visited the Italy , England , Egypt , Austrailia , and Thailand , etc to broaden my perspective .
I think that the most important thing that I learned from these trips is that being with the group and a tour guide is the best way to travel .
The reasons are as following .

First of all , we can enjoy the systematically planned trip .
In my case , I went on England without any group members nor tour guides .
I remember that it was the most terrible trip that I have ever experienced .
At that time , I could not ask for help to anyone , as I was not good at English .
So , I just stayed all seven days at the hotel .
What I could do at that time was just looking Englishmen who looked much happier than me over the hotel window .
On the other hand , when I went the Austrailia with many group members and a tour guide , I could enjoy a happy trip .
The tour guide assigned the time for trip effectively , so I could visit a lot of tourist attractions , which might be unnoticed if I went alone .
I felt that the tour guide is a indispensible element for the great trip .

Furthermore , I can definitely say that we do not need to feel loneliness if we go on a travel with other people .
As I implied above , I was very lonely when I went to England alone .
There was nobody I could communicate with .
However , I could enjoy the trip better with a lot of people when I went to Egypt .
In addition , the group members who accompanied with me were all Korean , like me .
We were very happy to meet people who were able to communicate with .
I think that it was also very exciting experience to listen other people 's story during communication with others , not only to look around famous places of foreign country .

In conclusion , I am convinced that it is better to be with group members and a tour guide when we go on a travel .
They enable us to enjoy well-planned tour altogether .
