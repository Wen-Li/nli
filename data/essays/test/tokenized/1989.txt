Many young people live an individualistic life , that , they do not feel dependent on a community , and they do not spend enough time to helping their community .
This individualism has various reasons as high technology , changing life patterns due to technological improvements and the self confidence that more individuals think necessary to survive .

Firstly , the modern or post modern times we experience encourage individuals to find their own purposes to live , not communal sacrification .
For example , less people go to church regularly throught the world , thus , less people ask advice of their religion authorities or communities to live .
Thus they do not usually need support of communities and they do not help their communities either .

Secondly , due to new technology as internet , people can do many tasks without going out , For example many banks have internet sites , that customers can have various services , Additionally , people can shop , and talk to their friens from internet without going out .
Thus , young people do not have to go out and interact with people for their many needs and they can live on their own without any belonging to communities .

As a conclusion , young people do not need belonging to any community .
They persue an individualistic life because of individualism that is experienced all the world , especially in the `` developed countries '' , and technological improvements that keeps individual isolated from society and community .
Thus , youn people do not need community and do not help their community and ignore the existence of their communities even they have one .
