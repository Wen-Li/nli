I partially agree that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are : this in my opinion occurs especially in sectors in which the markets are not so developed .

In the case of not developed markets , advertisements are biased to create a good image of the product : they do that because the main purpose of the advertisements is to make the people buy the new products .
This is done showing the good parts of the products they are marketing .
One of the main reasons why this is true is that in this kind of markets the success of an advertising company is measured by the amount of purchases of the products advertised ; the people will be more inclined to purchase the good that is presented as being `` good '' and not as being a `` bad '' .
This indeed means that the advertising company is going to try to highlight the good parts of a product and it will try instead to hide the worse parts of the product .
The customers are betrayed and treated as stupid .
This means moreover that the image of the product will be distorted by the advertisers , as the advertisers will be biased to show only the good parts of it .

The problem with this way of doing advertising might actually come when the market develops and new competitors enter the market .
At the beginning they might just compete brutally , trying to highlight the best parts of their respective products but when the customers realize that the qualities advertised for the products are not true , they might stop buying this product and buy the competitor ones .
In this case , the advantage to the producer of exagerating in advertising the good qualities of their products fall dramatically , while a more responsible statement of the good qualities of the products could be the key to achieve more customers .
In addition to this the company might be inclined to invest money in enhanancing the image of the company in general and making the customers believe that not only the products are enough good but also that the company is reliable and responsible .

In conclusion I think that advertisements make products seem better than they are only in some cases .
