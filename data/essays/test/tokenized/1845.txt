Though i think that it 's good to have a knowledge of things beforehand but in long run to succeed further one need to try new things and take risks rather than only doing things one alredy know how to do well .

The first reason for my agreement with the statement is that one can not always take it for granted that he will always get the standard situations and even if he knows everything about a situation he will be able to do well .
One always faces new situations or problems while working .
So to overcome those problems and succeed one need to apply new solutions and even take risks .
Most of the time , the people who hesitate to try new things and take risks get stuck to the same level .

There is always an amount of risk and uncertainity in new things but I also think that everythings is evolving .
So the people who are succesful are the one who were the first to do that .
These were the people who explored the things first and created the set of rules for others to follow .

So when one is ready to face new challenges then his whole approach of doing things changes and no body can stop him from the success .
He gets new ideas to implement .
His whole energy is streamlined in getting things done and he then look in to every single thing and resource for the solution .
He starts thinking in terms of oppurtunity and making best use of it .

The people who do n't dare to do new things always keeps thinking and get stuck to same routine and jobs .
This also saps there creatinve thinking and energy from in to doing there normal things .
