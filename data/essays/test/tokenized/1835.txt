I strongly disagree with the motion that , the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide .
I personally would like to travel alone without any tour guide for the following reasons .

Reduction of element of surprise :
When we travel with a tour guide , most of the things are expected and hence it does n't put up any surprise , and as some wise man said ` Surprises make you happy . '
So I can comfortablly presume that a travel guide reduces the happiness of the whole trip .
And significantly reduce the much cherished experience that a trip is bound to throw on the traveller .

Limited access to locals :
As mentioned above this point ratifies the notion further .
If I travel with a tour guide he 's bound to show the monuments and other interests of tourists , but what about the experience of mingling with the localites ?
It 's simply ruled out and just no scope pertains of it .
The most important part of a tour is itinary .
On travelling on expected lines its extremely difficult to get the nuances of the local culture and tradition .
For a avid traveller like me it would be a detereioration of experience .

Understanding of cuture :
For a travel there are many questions to be answered .
Like the motif of the travel .
Unless the motif is fulfilled the travel is incomplete in all sense .
Understanding and imparting the local culture is of high importance to the traveller .
To be spefic traveller of high caliber .
He would surely understand the importance of culture and necissity to confluence with it .
This ratifies the above mentioned points by all means .

`` The best experience is the experience of travel '' started some wise man .
And indeed it is .
I would like to take the opportunity to exhibit my pragmatic side of my persona .
I have been irrationally harsh to tour guides , but the fact reamins that most of the travellers opt fot them .
In some ways tour group led by a tour guide is indeed a good idea , especially when we are in a group ans stuck in a problem these group and guide come in handy to the situation .
It all depends on perception and interest of the traveller .
