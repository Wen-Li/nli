Some one has truly stated `` Imagination is more important than knowledge . ''
I totally agree with the statement that `` Most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are '' .
Today we are living in the world of so called Commercialisation .
If a thing sells in the market , it is does not matter what kind of an advertisement it is associated with .
I recently met an IMS Kolkata MBA graduate .
he told me a very fascinating information .
He said that people going in the advertisement industry or the management are simply taught how to make people `` fool '' .

The advertisement industry catches hold those aspects of a person 's ambition that he could only fancy in his imagination .
For example , a model using perfume of a particular brand could easily attract women from all the directions of the Earth flying to him .
Now who would not want such an experience in his life to be surrounded by women on all sides .
For this particular reason people start buying that product and the brand ends up with making millions of dollars as profit .
Some advertisements even fool people through schemes such as ` Buy two get one free ' or a gold coin on purchase ' Peolple get tempted by such gimmicks and end with a coomodity which is not worth the money spent .

Secondly , the advertisement industry focuses on the younger elite of the society including both infants and the adoloscents .
Some of the products are aimed at connectiung their roots with something that children fantasize .
For instance they associate cartoons with the clothing , drinks , super heroes that provoke children to force their parents to buy those products .
Now this essentially becomes a problem for the parents who buy them even if they are hazardious to their children .
There have been cases when people have misinterprated the ads and have even lost their life of have severly wounde themselves .
Recently a boy swallowed a mint gum and drank a soft drink over it resultin g in an explosion in his intestines and ultimately death .

I strongly feel a need to chalk out a policy to prevent the consumers from being fooled by the brand endorsements .
There sould be an International board to keep na strict eye on these brands and introduce `` Effective set of Guidelines '' to be hailed to for the advertisement .
