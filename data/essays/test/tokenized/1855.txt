Is it better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific topic ?
Well , as a matter of fact , it is .
Once you have a broad knowledge of many academic subjects the way you think changes your ideas open up .
Instead of being close minded and choosing one topic , you can force yourself to learn , then you will be a person of a wider span of knowledge .
You look at life differently with many other subjects , it helps you analyze things differently .
Lets say for example you didnt really like Math , but you learn it because this subject helps you think in different ways as you get older , it helps you analyze problems and find solutions .
Lets say now for Biology .
You study this subject you will be more aware of sicknesses and you will at least have minor knowledge on this subject which can help you until you get professional help .

I think that all most subjects should be studied in school , so you can have the basics of the knowledge in order to live your life in a balanced way instead of having knowledge of only on topic , because unless your life evolves around it , it will not help whatsoever it will become completely meaningless in all the other topics , yet it will help you alot on your main objective , but life does not load it self on that specific goal .

I conclude that great knowledge for one purpose is not as useful as minor knowlege for many academic references , also you can have something to major in .
