I hope that this statement will come true , but honestly I do n't believe it .
There are a lot of good inventions on the go now , for example cars driving with solar energy or with oil made out of plants - but still the oil industry is too powerful .
In my opinion the oil industry is doing everything to block alternative inventions like that .
They want the people to be dependent on oil , so that they can make money .
So they encourage the automobile industry to build cars who makes a lot of environment pollution .

Another point is the growing population in the rich countries .
People are getting older so they are able to drive longer .
The results are more cars in the streets .
Another reason is that people have to be flexible because of their job nowadays .
They want to live in a peaceful little cottage in a quiet rural area but the working place is in the next city , so they often have to drive hundreds of kilometres to work and are on the streets for hours .

Everything has to be convenient and comfortable .
Nobody wants to make compromises .
I 'm sorry if I sound kind of bitter and disappointed , but that 's my point of view .
I 's one of my biggest wishes that one day there is an invention that makes movements without pollution possible .
