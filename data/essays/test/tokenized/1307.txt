Advertisements by it self is a huge world there are too much advertisement and not all of them are honest there are many advertisements that people some times know that they are lieying in it but yet they go and buy the advertised thing they see on television something and when they buy them they find out that it does not look like the one they so on television .

Always advertisements make products seem much better than tehy really are but there are some that are honest but they are so rare and u can hardley find them , not all things put on advertisments is good .
If they were good why are they advertising it unless , a company has opened new and it want to make people know more about the produced things of that company , so that people would buy more of them , or if a company had made , something new or developed something known before , then the company could put it on advertising , but there are many advertisements that lies on people in order to gain money , but they do not think that if this person baught from us this time , he will never buy from us again ,

Goverments should be aware of all advertisements and they must put a cuantity of money of those who make fake advertisements by that way advertisements would make products look better than they really are , so when people knows that the goverment is looking after these advertisements he would go and buy the advertised thing with his eyes closed , but let us never forget that advertisements is an important thing for a company or a business group since all its produced things are being shown to people on television and millions of people watch television daily .

At the end advertisement is a huge domain and the goverment should be aware of every advertisement before it is shown on television , in this way advertisements would make products seem much better than they really are .
