Opinions might be divided over whether The best wau to travel is in a group led by a tour guide .
I strongly agree with this statement for several reasons .
First , traveling in a group is safer .
Also , by doing so , people can save time and money for a trip .

First , we can make a trip in safer condition .
of course , by traveling alone and two persons , the persons can go to anywhere whenever and wherever they want .
However , in unfamiliar environmental , if they face risk people and difficult problems , they can not protect themselves .
In context , traveling in a group is better .
For example , for my friend , he went a trip to china at last year .
On arriving at the place , he go to the downtown but just he meet two robber .
the robbers deprive all money of my friends .
As my friend has no experience , he can come back home wtih help of other koreans .
And now , he do not travel alone , he is traveling to Europe with a number of friends .

Second , it offers people benefits to save time and money .
By hiring guides , the travel cost might increase and orderde course may be able to require more time .
However , by traveling in a group with a giude , we do not have to worry about losing path .
And since many people pay for cost at time , the cost will definitely decrease .
According to a study release by korea research center , more than two-thirds of surveyed korean travelers mention thay when they travel in a group with a guide , they feel safer and economical .
Based on this study , when most of travelers come back , travelers with many people and a guide have much more money in their wallet .

For these reason , I firmly think that
