Advertisements for Selling

In the business world the aim is getting the maximum profit to live up your company .
Factory manifactures the products and then products are needed to be sold .
First rule of commercing is presenting the product with its beauty of design .
Today 's most efficient way of selling something is advertising products .
Also , usually these advertisements make products seem much better than they really are as a result of advertising techniques and for affecting people much more .

Firstly , advertisement companies earn huge amount of money due to their effectiveness of selling product .
So , they can make advertisements with using all of the technology help .
For instance , short video advertisements can change products better like Toyota Corolla for the last seven years .
I respect Toyota for their engineering process and I always expected better looking cars .
When first I saw corrolla on the screen , it looks very nice .
But with going to test drive it changes the ugliest car in the world .

Moreover , advertisements sometimes can be lies to sell the product .
They say only the advantages of the product but the truths are hidden at the advertisement .
For example , product is presented as the poorest against the rival 's product but the hidden thing that the guarantee valids shorter time .
In Turkey there are a lot of low quality Chinese products , however , it ca n't be learnt anytime in the advertisements .

In conclusion , advertisement is nearly a lie or a success of technology and this makes products visualizing better .
In all over the world there must be revised regulations for making advertisement .
If it does n't happen , consumers must think twice before buying it like today 's situation .
