The biographies of successful people from various areas , such as businessmen , scientists and artists seem to support the above statement .
Indeed , looking for example at a person like Steve Jobs , the founder of Apple , many examples can be found in his life for the necessity to try new things and take risks .
It is the continuing invention of new and innovative goods that fuel the success of Apple and Mr. Jobs .
And of course , new inventions are not safe from risks , as it will always be challenging to predict their success .

The analysis of another biography from a different field supports this theory .
Galileo Galilei , the Rennaissance scientist , who explored and discovered many revolutionary ideas and laws of nature , took such high risks in his work that he was even sent to prison for his beliefs .
After all it can not be neglected that Galilei had become one of the most successful ( in terms of the impact of his findings , such as the functioning of the solar system ) scientists that this planet has ever seen .

In the search of reasons to this apparent relationship between being innovative and not risk averse and personal success , the field of financial markets and especially the functioning of share trading may be a useful allegory .

It is very straightforward ecomics that teaches that return is related to risk .
In fact , the riskier an investement is , the higher the expected return from it .
But what does that tell about personal success ?
Completing the picture it can be said that the more innovative I am and the higher risk I take in my attempts to be successful , the more success I can expect , similar to the above described investment .

But at the same time , not only the return of a risky investment may be higher but also the possible losses related to it .
For a personal biography this means that there might be a lot of people who take risks and loose , and hence end far less successful in comparison to others who avoided risks and remained , as the statement says , `` doing what they already know how to do well '' .

This implies that the statement is only true in one direction .
History proves that the majority of successful people have been rather innovative people with a strong willingness to take risks .
This should not lead one to the conlusion that taking risks will automatically lead to success .
In fact , a brought study , involving the lives of many people , would very likely lead to the outcome that in average the success of the `` risky '' portion of the sample would not be higher than the average success of the risk averse portion .
