The world that we live in today is full of advertisements .
For a young man like me it is sometime difficult to deal with all these images and messages that are trying to tell me `` Buy this , buy that ! ''
.
But we are now so used of seeing them that we are sceptical about all these ads .
Thats why I think that products seem much better than they really are .

First , the fact that advertisements put the product in a scpecific situation will make the product more attractive .
For example , When you see a television advertisement that shows someone eating an icecream on a beatiful beach with clear water , nice sand and blue sky .
The viewer will associate the ice cream with the dream of being on a tropical island on the beach and relaxing .
In this sense I consider that placing an ice/cream in a specific context makes the product more attractive .

Another way to make products look more atractive than they really are is to improve the way a product looks like on a television ad .
For example , When you see a television advertisment for a fruit yoghurt you always see the fresh fruits going into the yoghurt and they are always staying nice and firm .
But when you open a fruit yoghurt in real life , the fruit chunks are always a bit spungy and ugly .
We also can see this phenomenon in fast-food restaurants , when you order a hamburger you always see on the picture that it looks delicious .
In fact , the hamburger looks a lot less attractive in reality .

I think it is normal that advertisments always make products seem much better than they really are .
The goal of advertisment is to sell bigger amounts of a product so they have to show the best aspects of there products without lying about it .
It is the job of lots of people to make a product more attractive .
To illustrate the way advertisment works , I recommend a french book wich is translated in english called `` 99 francs '' written by Frederique Beigbeder .
