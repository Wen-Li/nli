I fully agree with the statement that most advertisements make the products they are supposed to sell much better than they are in reality .
My opinion is not only based on some personal experience , but it also makes sence if you try to understand the position of the ones who are trying to sell their particular product .

The first reason why I belief it is inevitable for any advertisement to make the product much better than they are is that you must consider that these products have to be sold not only in order to make money , but also to achieve the amount of money that you had to invest for the production of these goods .
This investment makes it necessary to point out only the positive aspects of the product and not to mention anz of the negative or even bad aspects about them .

The second reason why I belief this is that you must consider the amount of competitors a product has on today 's market .
Since there is hardly any product on the market that can sell without similar or likewise products that are competing against each other in the same meketing segment , they therefore adress the same customers .
This makes it necessary for any producer to advertise his or her product , so that they can be distinguishable from the other products on the shelves .

Another Arguement why I belief this is that it is obvious how much customers are depending on images and myths when it comes to spending money on the best product .
And since those images or reputations are unlikely to create themselves or at least need too much time if they are supposed to develope naturally , it must be the task of advertisers to create what people want to or are supposed to belief about the products their are buying .

So in consequence I think that the need to sell the product in order to make profitable , the competition between the different producers that are selling similar goods and the need to create images are the main reasons why it can be argued that advertisement creates a better product than the one that is actually being sold .
