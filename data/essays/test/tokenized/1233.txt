Cars are importhat in life especially at work whether its novate or used .
Every year new development occurs for instance cars , trains , and helicopters .
I certainly agree that in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today .
Ther are two reasons that support the idea below .

Firstly , every year new tecnology development appears that means cars sold are increased day by a day and no more used cars are available for sale inasmuchas people feel exicited to look for a new car rather than old , cheap and used .
What attracts people the most after many years are the names of the cars , it 's color , and it 's size whether big or small that makes a sense as a whole .

Secondly , used car may have problems that makes many people to refuse buying it .
For example the gas may not fixed unless it 's taken to the cars station ; therefore the person will spend more money to fix the gas problem rather than having a new car cleaned and well organized from outside and inside and not paying so much money if a problem appeared .
That 's why after many years there will be fewer cars in used and new cars will be sold .

In conclusion , new cars are more beneficial and valuable than used car .
What I have shown below is very essential for now and and next years .
At least new cars are warranted for some years and that lowers the percentage of paying money on the car .
Without a doubt I agree that used cars will be less available in sold .
