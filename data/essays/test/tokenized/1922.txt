In my opinion , the successful people is the person who tries to challenge new things and is willing to take risks .
I agree that knowing how to do well is importamnt to get a good evaluation in a sopme situation , such as daily job routine .
However , I think the meaning of success is to get something it seems to be rather difficult for him or her by challenging it .

There are two reasons to support my opinion .
First , in this competitive world , getting a stable salary does not mean success , I think .
We need house .
We want to go abroard .
We want to manage our own company .
If we make effors , there is a possibility that the dream comes true .
For example , some of pur successful business exectives in my country had a hard time when they were young , but they studied very hard invested their properties in their future .

Second , successful person is someone whom other people wants to be .
I do not want to be like officeworkers who come to the offiece at nine a.m. and typing many documents and talking telephone , and leave office at five p.m . .
I want to think how we can increase profit , and how we can win in the copetition with other companies .

Successful people always try something new , even after being a successfull person .
They seemes to be full of energy and dream .

Finally , if you try new things taking risks , you sometimes face the different situation .
Such experiences makes you stronger .
Today 's success does not mean that tomorrow 's success .
Therefore , to be a successful , we should be enouogh strong to bear the difficulties .

You can not survive the difficult times by only doing what you already know how to do it .
You need challenging spirit and experiences of overcoming the difficulties .

I think that the road to success is not easy .
If you can investigate your time and properties in your goal , then you have a chance to get it .
The success is the fruit of challenging .
To get a sweet frut , we need to try new things and take riskes .
