I agree with statement `` The best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide '' .

For example , you went to egypt to explore the beauty of the pyramids .
And with you , you have a book which contains the information about the pyramids and the history of them .
And you go and explore the whole place all alone .
Now you are missing very important information like where all the mummies are buried and exactly the whole story .
Even though they are stated in the book unless shown in real you can not have a nice experience .

Taking a real life example , I once went to see the belaum caves in India with a friend of mine and began to explore the caves and we began our tour all alone and saw what ever came in our way and kept admiring the beauty of the caves and after seven hours we completely saw the caves and returned to our room in a hotel and I accidentally overheard people talking about the interesting things about the caves like the miracles that happened in the caves due to the constant flow of water and the marks done on the walls by the water and then I dont remember seeing all that told by them .
And the next day I again went to the caves with the rest of the tourists led by a tour guide .
As the guide was telling all the important things about that place then I began to notice all the things and also saw the markings done by water and a huge stone cut beautifully in a nice shape which I thought was done by a man when I went with my friend but was actually cut by the constant flow of water as told by the guide .
If I had no tour guide accompanying me I would have definitely thought that those markings and beautifully cut rock was human made .
And the whole place was shown to us in just four hours which has previously taken me seven hours .
From then onwards when ever I go to explore a new place I would hire a tour guide and make him lead my way .
After all , the experts know everything .

So , it is always good to have a tour guide guide you in a new place instead you leading your own way so that you will never miss out the beauty of the place and get to know the amazing things about that place as the tour guide know much about that place and can guide you through places or things which otherwise you would have missed out .
