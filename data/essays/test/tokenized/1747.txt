People always prefer learnig about subjects that interest them .
This is why , if you work in a field that appeals to you , at the end your work can not yield but success .
The question to be asked is , what if somebody is interested in many subjects at the same time ?

For instance if you were an engineer student in statistics , you would be studying computer science as well as theoretical mathematics .
A perfectionist would tell you , try to be good in both subjects .
You should understand statistical thoeries and at the same time you should be able to apply them using computer softwares .
The truth is that , in general no one could do so .
If you spend your time on programming , at the end you will be very week in statitics .
From this point of view , it seems obvious that it is better to have a broad knowledge of both subjects , or else your careeras a statistical engineer will be a failure .

To have a clear and a right answer on the topic , I would say : it depends on what profile does the person like to have .
For a manager , it would be better for him to be a generalist and to know about various subjects and fields at the same time .
whereas a passionist would be totally devoted to the subject that interest him .
Just think of the greatest artists , they have an outsider aspect that make them look different from usual people , this is mainly due to the fact that they sacrifice all there time to their work .
The do n't look lilke normal people .

To conclude , you should work according to what or who you really want to be and in both cases you will surely succeed in your life .
