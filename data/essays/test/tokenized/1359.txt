I disagree the advertisements make their products seem much bette than really are .
There are there reason support it .
First , it 's a big mistake for the goods'company .
Because if your advertisement ask us imformation is similar with it really is .
The custmers is respect for your company , and people will tell his classmate and families .
I think it is the most successful advertisement .
So the customers is the God , the customers use the goods really good can make your code famouse .

Second , when the advertisements is n't ture .
After people buy these things , they use it , even eat it , such as food , nurtirent , medicine .
They will do harmful to their health , sometime many paitients miss the right time to eat right medicine and miss the treat time , unluckyly they maybe have a lack in the lifetime or even died on .
What the advertisements are ?
They are the killer which send the peole who eat it or use it .
And the last , the goods , the company break the law as a result .
D urning a short time they earn the money .
In a long time they kill many people , and they kill themselves .

Third , these advertisements make the customer and the business company to be the ennomy , no matter who make an advertisements to show their goods are good for the people , how to improve our live even though the advertisements is good fo us , the people also do n't believe it .
They wonder that the advertisements is ture ?
How many things do the advertisements have 20percents 50 percents or really 100percent well .
The countries markets is mixture by their rubbish advertisements .
Many pretty company have to shut down their door .

So I thinik if we wo n't good for both sidel
