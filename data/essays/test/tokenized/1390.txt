I think that it is imprtant for students ti undarstand ideas and concept than it is for them learn facts .
Nowadays students are said that they ca n't think logically , and ca n't use knowledge what learned even in elamentary school .

Why to understand is imoprtant ?
If the peoples who does n't understanding idea , they ca n't use that idea in any situation .
I mean , if pepole who do n't know tha idea abou number , he ca n't count even .
People who got the idea can use the idea at least his life .
On the other hand , the facts are just one thing .
If studens learned one fact , they will just memorize it .
It ca n't be conect the other facts .
Because they do n't know that how should use its .
When I was in elementary sholl , I learned idea about how shoud i use tool in householding class .
So I can handle the idea and concept on my life .
Cook skill is really useful for me .

In conclusion , to understnd the any area 's the idea and concept is usefull for everyone in whole life .
So , I think more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts
