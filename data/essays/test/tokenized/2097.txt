I absolutely agree with the afct that advertisements rise the products ' appeal .
As a first reason , the interest in this activity increased considerabily in the last years .
Moreover , I think that people in front of several products will chose the one they saw in an advertisement , thinking it is better than others not familiar , even if it not true .

First , it is a fact that most of the organizations focuse more and more every year on advertisements than on the quality of the prime materials and working processes .
In the last year , both the ammount and percentage of money spent by organization in advertisements increased considerabily .
For example , in the United Stated the ammount of money dedicated to advertisements was larger than the one dedicated to instruction .

Second , most of people I know .
when have to decide what to buy in a supermarket , maily chose the product with the most advertised brand , sure that it will be the best product .
Once I have done a test with some friend .
I bought several brand of can of tuna and than i made taste a little bit of each brand to each of my friends , while they had the eyes closed .
As a result , they where not able to associate the favourite brand with the best taste .

In conclusion , I think advertisements make products appear better than what they are in real .
Firstly , beacuse organizations show bigger interest in advertisement activity than in quality of their prime materials and processes .
Secondly , on teh basis of my experience .
