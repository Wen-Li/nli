`` Life is unpredictable '' , is a famous saying that have been existing through human history .
Nobody knows what will happen to them ten years later , a week later or even an hour later .
They can predict , it does not work everytime .
Successful people would not have known they will succedd in life and hit the jackpot .
I agree that successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already knew .
Trying new things give people experience and human relationships - and I believe those two are the most important in life .

Trying new things give people more experience .
Experience , is priceless - it can not be exchanged with money or any material things in life .
Experience nourish one 's soul and it makes people grow , and builds them who they are .
Ones with a lot of experience will succeed in life because they have seen what others have not , and know a lot more about what life is all about .
For example , person who only studies on books might have a lot of knowledge , but can never make great success .
They must know everything , but do not have the abillity to utilize their knowledge to different situations they encounter - and that is what life is all about .

Also , trying many things builds strong human relationship .
You get to meet people from different part of the world and that makes you into a colorful individual .
In life , that is one of the most important things .
Knowing a lot of people opens you to a whole new world of possibilities .
Whenever you need help from someone things get a lot easier when you have wide human relationships .
Life is unpredictable - yes and that is why you need strong relationship to become successful .
For example , when a person is trying to run a new buisness he/she will have larger choice if the person has wide and strong connections from experiencing and meeting various kinds of people .
If he used to breakdance , he could run a bboy buisness utilizing bboy connections to the fullest .
If he played music , he could run a instrument store based off the connections he has .

I agree successful people try new things and sometimes take risks rather than doing only one thing .
Trying new things bring them so many good things in life that ones who did not can never obtain .
It gives them a lot of experience to become a strong and colorful person .
They will have a lot less possibiltiy of being embarassed whenever something happens .
Also , it builds them strong connections with different kinds of people .
Knowing a lot of people definitely helps in life .
