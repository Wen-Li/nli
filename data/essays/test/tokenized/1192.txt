I agree with the following statement .
Nowaday young people do n't give enough time to helping their comuties .
I think it is so because young people such as me have a wrong model .
When I see the television there are only a rich people that for helping their communities spend much money .
This is a good thing , but a normal person , that have n't much money what can he do ?
I think that for a normal people is enoughgh a normal act .
He can spend his time to helping their communities to do a meal to the poor peoople , or simply to help a children to do a homework .

Every us can do a normal short act that it can change a day to the other .
My granfahter told me that his friends was unhappy because was alway single , without a company .
When I can I go to find them .
And every one of they is happy to see me , a young people , that remember them .

In my opinion every time that I do anything for a other people I 'm happy also for me .
I think that if you help a person in the same time you help also yourself .
It is same at the christmas , when you give a present usually you receive another one present . ..
the helping is same !!

In the last years I usually go to the hospital for meet the young people htat are less luck than me .
I go in the hospital for 3 afternoon every week , I stay here for two or three hours and I talk with that who want .
When I came back at home I think that I 'm very lucky .
I have this think every time .

Helping my communities help me to undertsan how much i ' happy !
That every my problem is nothing in confront to a problem that other persons have .
Nowadays the young people do not give enough time to helping their communities . ..
but this isn ' for ever !
For every one will arrive the moment that undestand the important things of the life !
In this moment the person will start to help the less lucky people !

I agree with the statement , but I think and I hope also that the things can be change !
