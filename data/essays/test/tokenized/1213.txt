It goes without saying that different field need diferent way of learning .
But generally speaking , it is facts and experince that can help us better understand the knowledge , though idears and concept are still important factors .

It is said that concept and idears are the basic unit of thinking , one can hardly give a thought without clearly definition of a relative objective or substance .
For example , when people deal with a math problem , he or she can never get a consequance ----- not to mention a corect answer without knowing what is `` add '' or what is number .
Of course this is a eregious example , but it can well demonstrate the problem .

Howere , the importance role of the concept and idears in sovling problems can not banlance the significant factor of a personal realisition of a certain fact .
For one thing , the fact or a realistic experience can go to a long way toward a better undersanding and a well conmand of knowledge .
For istance , only you look and touch a elephant by yourself can you get a sense of the huge and strong of it .

In addition , there still some usefull skills that is impossible to conmand without the facts get from a certain experience .
To suppert this one need look no further than the skill of swimming .
Though one can well remember the important terms and key point of motions , we can suppose the scence the first time he or she plunge in to a swimming pool .

In conclusion , facts is much more important than concept and idears .
