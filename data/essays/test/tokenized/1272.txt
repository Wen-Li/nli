Advertisements are used to introduce products to the customers .
Companies spend a lot of money for advertisement to make their brand familiar to the customer that results with higher profit .
But to reach their goal they try every option including being dishonest .
I agree that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .

First of all , they show what they want us to see .
For instance , if the product is a shampoo they show a girl with a wanderfull hair or if the product is a toohtpaste this girl have theeth brighter than stars .
Everybody knows that the advertisement has light tricks and nobodys can have such a beautiful hair ot theeth .
Or they show a product 's only good parts .
In the case of electronic goods , it is harder to make the product seem better because there are quantitative values that they have to give like the RAM capacity of a laptop and these have guarentee but , in this case they can make the external look of the laptop much better than it really is .

Secondly , some advertisements demonstrates experiments that are done with the product to be more accurate , which we can not be sure that these experiments are real or not .
For example , in a detergent commercial they wash two identically dirty cloth with two detergents and they show that their detergent cleans the cloth better .
But I can never believe the experiment is really conducted as they show us .

Thirdly , some clothing companies make their clothes to fit their models whose sizes are really rare and very proportional .
When I look at the chatalogs or commercials I saw wanderfull clothes and when I try them they do n't fit me .

As a result , companies are trying to convince people that their products are best but they are usuallt tricking us with unactual information about them .
Although some standards that they have to obey for customer rights , they always find a way to show their good much better .
