Without a doubt , it is more important for students to know ideas and concepts than it is for them to memorize facts by hard .
By just learning facts , students may only remember them for a short period of time .
After a while , they will forget everything .
This is not an effective way to study .
I believe the most effective way to study is to learn how to derive facts .

First of all , in my experience , I have suffered a lot from memorizing formulars in Physics .
Even though I can input all formulars before exams , I always forget after exams have finished .
But there is an exception .
For those formulars that my Physics teacher has derived for me , I still remeber completely .
He has taught me the way to find one formular by combining and calculating using different formulars .
By doing this , I am able to remeber the origin of formulars which always alert me when I see them .

Moreover , students can learn more if they participate in class discussions .
During history class , I did not participate in class discusison just because I was too shy to say my own opinition .
However , after a while when I got use to situation , I have began to say my opinion .
And that moment , I have realized that I can learn more if I interact with other people because they have different views , perspectives and answers .
From then , I have always been trying to gain other people 's opinion .

In addition , Bill Gates , the creater of Microsoft is one of many who has absorb ideas and concepts by himselves .
He has been studying in Harvard University , however , he quit schooling and has began to study about computers on his own .
He has formed a team to interact , communicate and learn more about computer from the perspective of concepts .
At that time , there were only few computers developed in the world , so he had very small amount of facts .
He has developed ideas on his own and has acheived to create personal computers for home use .

Learning facts are only useful if students wants to remember only a short period of time .
But when it comes to research , they should use many kinds of sources and teachers to understand ideas and concepts .
