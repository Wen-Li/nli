I completely agree with this statement .
Understanding ideas and concepts is in several ways much more important than just learning facts .

My first reason ist that students should do more than just learning facts .
Nearly Everybody can choose what subject he or she want so study .
That shows that the students are realy interested in the subjects they study .
Just learing facts would not be as satisfying as understanding the ideas and concepts of all the different themes .

Although people can more easy remember things when they understand them .
Learning facts is unfortunately mostly for the short term memory .

The second point is that understanding ideas and concepts is much more usuful in real life then learning facts .
When you understand ideas and concepts you can use this basic knowledge in many different situations in your everyday life .
Just because of the way you take on problem .
A very simple example is when you want to find a bank for your money .
Only if you understand how it really works , you will find the right bank for you .
The fact e.g. Sparkass , a german bank , is the best one will help you nothing .

The last and most important fact is that you can only use all the stuff , you have learned during your studies , on the job when you understand the ideas and concepts .
In everyday business every situation will be at least a little bit different from the situation you experienced before .
Therfore it helps you nothing if you know about standart ways to solve a problem .
For example , you have to lead a team .
Just knowing about some facts about teamleading will not help you to lead the team to a good , or even better , great success .

If you know the fact - treat every person differnt - helps you not much .
Just because it dont shows you a to treat e.g. Peter .

In conclusion I want to say , that there are a lot of points showing understanding concepts and ideas is much more important than learning facts .
And I hope all professors around the world think the same way and try to teach concepts and ideas not just learning fact by heart .
