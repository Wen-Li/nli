I would definietley agree with it that `` successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what already know how to do well ''

Success is defined by each individual as a goal or an ambition to themselves .
Any successfull people who have reached the top , would have definitely faced so many failures and risks .
After being successful in reaching their goals , there is no meaning in doing the same things again and again , we would reach a state where we want to try out new things either in different field or in same field eventhough we know it would involve risks .
It is only when we try out new things we do learn new things and the mistakes we committed .

Famous scientist like Edison who discovered light didnt stop with that invention he further helped in the inventation of current .
Similarly Tesla who discovered alternating current , In the begginning discovered direct current ( DC ) could have stopped with that but since he wanted to try out new things and found out alternating current ( AC ) which we depend more on today for our daily needs .

Success keeps changing according to the person and the situation .
When we consider the world as a whole picture , we humans started our life from caves and stones but today live in a very comfortable world of sophisticated machines .
The way people used to communicate with each other has changed .
We use emails , Telephones and other modes .
We introduced internet , satellities .
We dont stop with a particular success , We do look for a better advancement and try new things .

Thus , Success varies from person to person and we all have to remember that success is not a destination and it is a journey that never ends .
