I love to traval , therefore , I positively agree that the best way to trvael is in a group led by a tour guide .
Because when travelingl in the foreign country , we might not familiar with the local cultural or custom and that might cause risks .
Furthermore , some places maybe too danger to visit , and by advised by the tour guide , it might decrease the dangerous .
For these reasons , I believed that join the travel group led by a tour guide is the best wat to have a wonderful travel memory .

When I have the chance to visit foreign countries , I always love to attend the travel group .
The reason is not only it might cheaper than travel along , but aslo the travel agency can arrange the traffic and staying problems .
Besides , when I travel to a place in which I have not been before , the tour guide will introduce the culture and custom for the me .
Therefore I can save more time to do reasearch .

Take myself for example , I visited Bali island by mysely last year .
I spend a lot of time to do the reaserch .
However when I arrived the island , and because I can not speak the local language , I do not even know how to rent a car , and it took a long time to arrived my hotel .
In the second day of my travel , I went to visit a tempel , and I do not know that the temple is not allow to take pictrues inside .
As a result , I have to hand out all of my film and I lose my good memory in the island .
I think if I attend the travel group and there is a tour guide , then the tragidy would not happend .

Though people might think that arrange the travel schedul is more flexible and fun , however , my personal experience told me that trvael in a group with a tour guide is more effiency .
Not only we will not wast time and money on arrange the traffic stuff , but aslo we can obsorb the knowledge from the tour guide , and meet more friends in the group .
To sum up , I do believed that the best way to travel is in a group led by the tour guide .
