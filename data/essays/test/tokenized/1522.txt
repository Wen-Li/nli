Although i think that learning by facts is more important in the life of students , in my opinion is more important for them undestanding ideas and concepts than learning facts .

There are two fundamental reasons for which I think that the understanding is more important that learning .
In the first place , as far as I am concerned without ideas there are not facts to learn .
The most important discovery in the all kind of sciences there are not possible if there are not based on an idea or a conpcet .

We think to the Theory of the relativity formulated by Albert Einstain in 1902 is an example that it can supports my opinion .
In my view in fact for a students is more important know and understand the process and the questions that this theory had opened and developped than know the fact itself .

Another reason for which i think so is the importance of the immagination and of the creativity .
Understanding the ideas and the concept of the whole world opens our mind to new discovery .
accordingly the development of the tecnology is possible because of it is based on the studies of other people that probably have not had the possibility to continue their studies or have not been able to see a particular thing .

So , in conclusion , I think that the possibility to immagine or to conceive an idea is the basis of the progress of the world .
Facts are simple a facts .
