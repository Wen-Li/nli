I will be discussing the statement under the business 's umberlla .
I , personally , agree with the stated statement which says that successful people try new experiences and take risks .
I think that not all successful people are risk takers , but taking risky things might be a very good idea to start businesses .
No one knows for sure that his or her business will be a successful one , but a person , of course , will know after being involved in business world .

Most of businesspoeple had encounter difficulties at the beginning of their businesses .
They would not be successful if they had not take the advantage of taking risks .
For example , as a personal one , my father started his work in the field of real state eventhough his expertise was in software programming .
So , he took the risk and made his personal dream to be a business person .
He has been working in real state for thirty years and he owns some houses and lands .

Trying new things is also a very beneficial in business world .
For example , the YouTube founders were not sure that their web page would be that success .
At first , they thought that the web page would not grap people 's attention because it was a new idea in that time .
After its using growth among people , Google Corp. paid more than $ 1 billion dollars to the founders .
This proves that trying new things might be a key to be a successful person .

Therefore , trying new things and take risks in busniess world are sometimes a very winning equation .
