Most of us have probably seen the kids asking their moms for a candy or chocolate of which they 've seen the commercial on TV .
How about adults being cheated by the advertisements either on TV or somewhere else ?
In fact , most of the advertisements we see might not be reflecting the truth but trying to hook consumers in order to sell more .
The truth is ; advertisements do not reflect the truth because they are not controlled by the government , they only show the benefits of a product and they are producer biased communication methods to reach vast amount of people .

First of all , the government does not controll the commercials using appropriate methods .
In fact it can not do that .
In a small country of a couple of millions , there are more than thousands of companies most of which are active and chose to use commercials to reach their consumers .
On TV , newspapers , big boards , flyers and using many other ways that can only depend on the creativity of the advertiser , they reach millions of people everyday .
Just the TV , for example , has more than a hundred different channels all of which earn their money of commercials .
Therefore it is impossible to check all methods of advertising whether they are accurate or not .

Secondly , any commercial would only reflect the products advantages but not the disadvantages .
Even if you are advertising a very expensive product , you would say `` it 's cheaper now ! ''
.
You would n't probably say `` Coca-Cola is unhealthy and results addiction to itself ! '' but instead you would say `` it 's delicious , it 's cool '' . the purpose of a commercial is not to indicate how useless a product is but to indicate how usefull it is .
Therefore , in mentality , if something is that harmfull , the advertisers just ignore the harms and emphasize why people should buy that product , like the example of cigarettes .
No commercial ever indicates that harmfull effects of cigarettes but they show cool people smoking to show their products cool .

Finally , in fact a commercial is a biased method of communication .
Every commercial , either on TV or on newspaper is being produced or applies by some producer or manager .
Since the purpose of the advertisement is to convince the people to buy the product , they would reflect their bias at the commercial .
However , even if they were trying to be completely honest , every person has his opinion and people would reflect their opinion even if they do n't want to like a piece of art they are working on .

In summary , advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .
They can not reflect the truth .
They are not controlled by the government whether they are reflecting the truth because it is impossible to check all advertisements .
Besides an advertisement only reflects the adventages of the product being advertised because of the purpose of the advertisement is to convince people to buy .
Finally even if advertisers wanted to be honest , it would not be possible because an advertisement would only reflect the opinion of the producer of it .
