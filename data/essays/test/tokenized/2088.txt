I will have to say that I strongly agree with this statement .
It reflects the feeling that many us carry everytime we encounter an advertisement .
Contrary to what society wants us believe , most advertisements make products seem much better that what they really are .
Many of the enterprises which conduct such acts are mostly in the Fast Food , Internet , and Automotive areas .

Probably the most typical of them all are the Fast Foods empires , they always try to sell their food as the best food around so they display it in a really appreciable manner .
Pretty much everytime you walk into a restaurant they display their food , they always look really good , big , and tasty .
Then when you actually get it does not look at all like the one advertised , it looks small , like if it was done in hurry .
Well this pretty much the story for every Fast Food restaurant out there .

Internet providers also tend to such things too , they always say they have the best high speed Internet service in the market but when you actually get it is pretty much as slow as the other ones .
It is really unfair but with some research it can be avoided

Automotive companies try to sell their cars by comparing their cars with a similar one from another auto maker .
They always go at each other in attemps to sell their product .
This techniques works , the only person who ends up loosing is the consumer because they might not get what they were looking for .
Sometimes when you first test drive a car it feels awsome , and then when you actually own that same car it never feels at all like that first time .

All these enterprises use this technique of advertising in attemps to sell their products .
I will have to say that it is definitely not the fair whey to do it but , it is what they do to sell .
The only whey we can beat them is by beign more intelligent than them , we can do this by doing some research before we buy a product .
Their are many magazines available now to such research , they are really beneficial .
