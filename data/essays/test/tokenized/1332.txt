When facing the question whether understanding ideas and concepts is more improtant than leaning facts , different people have their own choice over other .
However , if it is up to me to make a decision , I do believe understanding ideas and concepts are more important with out hesitation .
And with respect to my preference come three following reasons .

First and foremost , the reason enjoying the proprity as my optimum choice states that real ideas and concepts could make student get more usefull knowledge which they must equipped to find more facts .
Concepts , I think , is the basis of science which could explain lots of natural phenomena .
For example , I have a litter brother who always fell corious about some amazing things which I think is just a simple work .
However , because the lack of concept understanding , he always get confused of it .
So , no concepts , no problem could be solved .

The more concepts we have received , the more way we could explore our life , and then , the more chances we could invent new products and achieve success .
According to a survey for the inventors who all have got several invention prises , ninty percent of them had acknowledged the real concepts before they went to work on their thinkings .
That is true becauses a person having no specific ideas will not plan their work well .
No wonder many scients believe basic concepts are so necessary .

Last but not least , idea and concepts understang could be easy to measure student 's quality and how many much knowledge they have achieved .
A concept repeat or exam , rather than talking about the facts the students just experienced , may test the ture ability of students by presenting the scores they just got in the exams .
Maybe it is easier for teachers to understand their student 's study conditions

However , a coin has two side and the flip side of it is that without learning the facts , students will not understand anything well .
Though it exsits , I state that understanding concepts is more important .
