In my opinion , the statement `` Successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well '' would n't be apt for all situations .
Because to try out new things one needs to be daring enough , successful or not does n't count much .
If trying out new things was reserved to people who were successful , then in the first place there would be not even a single person who would be eligible to call themselves successful .

Success comes after trying new things , and trying out new things much rather depends on the persons attitude rather than success , all these inventions which are made till date are the result of a group of persons trying out new things over a period of time , it might not be a matter whether the people were successful earlier or not .

There are many examples to support the above said statement , one of them being our own Thomas Alwa Edison , who invented the bulb , before discovering the bulb , he had numerous failures but all of those didnt stop him from trying out new things and the result being we are not sitting in dark anymore .

And moreover successful people dont necessarily try new things and take risks as they have the fear of losing it all , but whereas a person who has nothing to lose has nothing to fear about , and hence he would be ready to take more risks and try out newer recipes , if it works then it would be penned down in the success tips or otherwise are lost with the wind .

There are many successful people who are afraid to take risks , for example a famous batsman in a game of cricket never goes for risky shots because if he is caught , it would tarnish his reputation and he would n't want that to happen .

I would like to conclude based on the above points that to take risks one need not be successful , and most of the successful people avoid taking risks because they have a lot at stake if they fail .
