The title of this essay is YOUNG PEOPLE NOWDAYS DO NOT GIVE ENOUGH TIME TO HELPING THEIR COMMUNITIES .
The title is very significant in the social situation of today .
The young of today for my opinion do not spend much time for other persons but employ the free time in other questions .
The ragions for this situations is not random but it is the song of situation actual and education of the young .
In free time the young goes at the sea , lake , gym , sports , bike , relations with friends but not helping their communities .
In fact the presence of young in associations voluntary is low but ithe employ in political is not partecipate .
I live in a small country with 1400 persons and I see the not presence of young in istitution as local amministration .
In electoral period in phase of formations of electoral list to finfd young at partecipate in local administration is not easy .
In political field , for my opinion is that the young had saw in last year negative situation that can convey the young at not love the political and the near environment .
This is the negative fact because in political environment there is n't new strong with new energy .
To have in ploitical young is significative because I think that many provediment is better orientade at favoreable the young person and the young family and young couple .

Another situation that I see in my country is for voluntary towards old person with phisical problem , or with problem of trasportation for hospital or for exams .
The association is in hand at person of about sixty - five years .
The presence of young is not exist .

The young people have task of work or study but the impulse for occupate tthe free time for other person less fortunate of we not exist .
That is the problem of actual society and I hope that change .
