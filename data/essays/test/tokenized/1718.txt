SUCCESSFULL PEOPLE

In my opion , successful people try new things and take a risks rahter than only doing what they already know how to do well .
Because if they do n't do that they ca n't developed themselves .

The reason of their success , she or he thinks new things before no one thinks .
Or to has a brave to try new things .
For example , in Turkey we have a mega star , Tarkan .
He is more successful than other singers .
Why is he more different than the others for us ?

When he started his career , he made an amazing kind of music .
It did n't same the others .
Also he had a different hair and dress style .
All of them made him fantastic for us .
After him , every new singers wanted look like him .
They seemed like copy .
The used same music , same style .
But Tarkan made a new thing again that was an untriedfull video .
He used a naked person in his music video .
He took a risk because it was the first for Turkey and it could be very dangerous to use naked person in Turkey for him .
But if he did n't try it , he would n't be a mega star .

All of the things can show us , taking risk and trying new things make people successful .
But also we must n't forget when we do something we have to make it very well if want to be success .
