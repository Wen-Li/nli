I Agree , with that statement that most advertisments make the products seem much better than they really are , because all the companies want to show that their company is the best , so they try to show that everything is extremly good than anything else you can imagin .

They think with that they will get more money from it , but eh problem is that the people will buy it and they will try it and if it 's not better than any other product no body is going to buy it from them again .

For example the tv advertisements for the creams they always say if you use the cream for like 3 weeks you will get the result of it in less than 5 days .
You think they are right so you go and buy it and then you used it for like a whole month and nothing is changed .
Then you go back to teh company they you ask them `` What happen with this '' they will give you an explanition that you are the one that used it wrong and they tell you another way to use it .
Then they ask you to buy another cream so you can use it right this time and you do it again without thinking about .
Then a few months after that i new cream comes out and they make it look like nothing is better than it and you go and buy .

All companies for advetisments is looking for money .
They dont care if you use the cream or not as long as you understand the advertisment and you are ready to buy it .
That will give them more money and that all they need .

This why we shouldnt believe advierstisements very fast and always excpect less than what they actually write in there advertisment .
Try to avoid being tricket by those kind of companies .
