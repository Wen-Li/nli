Knowledge has been man 's most reliable tool for success and development since time immemorial .
knowledge and the capacity to utilize this knowledge into something useful is the reason for the human race 's growth .
Had there been no knowledge , we would still have been living in the Neanderthel ages .

` Knowledge is the tool for success ' .
It has brought us away from a state of bliss into reality .

Broad knowledge of a subject brings about the scope for a broader perspective as Ideas and inventions are not limited to their specific branch .
For eg the growth in technology has been utilized in areas of medical research , communication , banking and the industrial sector .

Again an eg is the ambitious cloning projects taken by medical researchers , are also expanding to stem cell research which in future might be used to cure cancer .
Thus the expansion of knowledge from one field to another presents a broader perspective and higher possibilities .

On the other hand specific knowledge of a subject is important to develop skill and expertise in a particular field .
If there is no expertise and the knowledge remains stagnant or influenced by other factors , it would kill quality and the possibility of improving upon the subject to take it to the next level .
To take an eg had there been no research on the ` intranet ' developed by the american army for its own use in the 1970 's , the world would never have seen the rise and expansion of the ` internet ' or as widely called ` the world wide web ' .
The Internet is a phenomenon that has revolutionised the concept of communications across the world .
Any piece of information can be obtained at the click of a mouse .
This is all a result of specialisation and research in a particular field .
Quality can only be achieved through specialisation .

In sum , I would say that no quality work can ever be achieved without specialisation .
Skill is the key to success and can not be compensated .
The specific knowledge can then be used in collaboratin with other fields to reach to higher levels of expertise and growth that would benefit the society as a whole .
