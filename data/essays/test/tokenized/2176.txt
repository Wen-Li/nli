I certainly agree with the statement .
The advertisements are , in fact , to make them better looking .
We watch tens of advertisements for each days .
We pay attention to them because they are persuasive .

A lot of their creators , today , use many creative ways to make the advertisements more attractive and conspiquous .

Nowadays , the advertisements are on the everydays ' TV channels .
The creators try to do their best to make it looking more attractive to the consumers .
If it does not work in this manner , the creators do not even need to try to spend their zeal and time to make advertise - ment .
We have , at least one time , disappointed by our newly consumed products .
We bought them because it was looking good in advertisement , but it was not when we actually tried them .
It is because there is not limitation to exaggerate for their products and the different angle will show the completely different image at times .
However , the advertisements might not work well for some products .
For example , the computer is the matter of its function and ability .
But , the advertisements can make it better for consumers ' eyes by its own magic ; it can use famouse singers or actors to advertise it .
Then , some consumer would buy it .

We walk around streets and can see many products easily .
But , where do we pay more our attention to ? ; just standing objects ?
or the objects with a fancy , designed background ?
Standing objects want to be stand there , but the advertising objects want to be bought and keep being persuaded .
I have bought a lot of products from being attracted by those advertisements .
But , would n't is be more important to make one to buy the same products because he really liked them rather than deceiving for that second ?
But , it would be the perfect if the product is confidently advertised , and the consumer is satisfied for his decision .
It is the true advertisement .
