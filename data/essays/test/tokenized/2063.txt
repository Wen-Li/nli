I agree with it is important for students to understand ideas and concepts than to learn facts .
although most of the people say that is is very important to know the fact the what has happened , and how it has happend .
i think it is useless to sit and think about what has happened .
because it is just waste of time to relay on the past .
As the students of the 21 st centure , where the technology has been already developed .
we has to move with the fast moving world . ..
everything has been created for us .
now it the time for us only toread about the main idea of the product , for what it has been created .
we have to understand the whole concept regarding the developement of the product .
analyse the concept and should further modify it .
for our future use .
As the facts explain us about what has already happened and how it has happened .
it only important for us only to know what had happened and we should leave about that .
because they only give us idea , but nothing more than that .
it also not so important for us to read it so deeply .
we hav to leave the past as the past and should always move with the future technology to make our lives beautiful .
Acccording to me as we the students of the technology we should always have the creative thought to invent some thing new and to give it to the society so , we should not simply sit and think what had happened , but think about what to do to improve the technology to make the life so simple .
In order to conclude my opinion with learning thew new ideas and understanding the concepts .
i suggest my friends only to learn some thing new than relay upon the past to know the past .
because of we being the stundents of the new era has so much work to do .
that is to give some thig to our mother land .
there is so much research work to do to invent some thing new .
which may be helpful to thew humankind .
so much work has been done by our fathers and it is our responsibility to conclude their work with good results .
