The developpement of cars is a reality and nobody can forgett it .
Cars have became an essential things for a lot of people .
But we have to notice that these developpment has consequences on the environment .
In my essay I 'm going to speak about the present situation and then I will describe how cars have to evoluate to keep their place in our societies .

Nowadays cars become a problem because of a lot of reasons .
They need some oil to function but the reserves disappear because of the high consumption .
Then this consumption create pollution that is very dangerous for people and for the environment .
Ecological destructions are caused by the cars .
We make deforestation in order to create some roads to permit people to travel by car .
In addition some people reject their responsabilities and try to keep their personnal confort .
Indeed they do n't use common transports as Bus but prefer to go to work by car even if there are some big traffic jam .

Futur for the car developpement is an evolution to do cars that could respect more the environment .
It exists some projects to use cars which power would be hydrogene , water or natural gas .
In reality we can also take some bus which are using a melting of gas and oil .
It exist yet some cars which could make great distances using electricity or GPL ( natural gas ) .
While we have to be vigilant about this sort of evolutions because the developpment of countries as India or China could have been dramatic consequences if each person has a car .
The earth wo n't allow this type of situation and it will be the begining of a very important revolution .

To conclude we know that our way of life could n't follow the same evolution .
Our consumption society could not be activated for everyone on the earth .
Cars are a good example of this situation .
If we wish that everybody could have one we have to change their source of power .
