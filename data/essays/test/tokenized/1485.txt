I agree whit this subject for the fallowing three things , first is that the travelers can get lost in the place that they are looking at , the second is that the travelers can know much more about that place , the third reason is that travelers can find interesting the place by people that allready know that place .

Travelers can get lost .
The person that do not know a place , they can get lost verry easy because they do not even know the streets , and because they are jus new at the place , and they may do not know the languaje that they speak in that country or oplace .

Travelers can know much more about that place by a tour guide .
They can find it more interesting if they see things that they wanted to see , like if a tourist wants to see the statue of the liberty if better to get there by a tour because if you do not know how to get there you can get lost .
But there is also a way to get there just by asking , but in this time you can not believe in anybody because you never know that is that person tells you the truth or just he wants to mess whit you .
I prefer to take a tour guide I thinfk is safer an better .

Travelers can find interesting the place by people that allready know that place .
You never know what a traveler spect of the oplace he is in .
But you can allways show him what you think is good for them to know about your place , like I will show to the tourist the best museums or the best shopping centers ( malls ) so he can get a expretion of what is like .
Also I will show him the best restaurants so he can get a good taste of the food that they make where I live and finally I will take him to a nigth club so that we can have fun .
I think that is a good think to show the tourist what it is like in your town .

This topic is verry interesting , there is a lot of things to talk about .
It is a good think to show the people where do you live so that they can have a good expectation of how is your town like and you and the tourism can get fun together , and they can tell people about your town if they like it , and people could make your town very famous .
