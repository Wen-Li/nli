Whether most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are ?
There is much debate over this question .
Some people claim that advertisements are responsible for providing some engaging and wonderful pictures of product to most audiences for entertainment , while any other people hold the oppiste opinion that these advertisements would confuse the decision of people and make people purchase some useless goods .
In my opinion , I think I would side with the latter opinion and the goods appearing in most advertisements are actually not real .

First of all , usually the main purpose of most designer of advertisements is making the goods or services designed by them seem like perfect and they also want to see the result that everyone who after looking this advertisement is willing to buy the goods and services they want to public .
In a word , all of these delicate designs are ready for owning the preference of most people and earn the more commercial benefits .

Secondly , under the strong competition , which advertisement could stand out is the key point of getting the success in the field of business .
So I believe that all of these large advertise companies would try their best and make the biggest effort to produce the exaggerate appearences of the goods and services for attracting people .
What is the result ?
The available advertisements turn out to be more and more out of real situation .

At last , we must admit people prefer viewing some beautiful and attracting pictures .
That is to say , if advertisements are not engaging enough to grasp the eyeball of audiences , their advertisements would not make sense as well as the products they will introduce .
So seeing from this angle , making unreal advertisements are unavoidable .

All in all , there is no doubt that more and more people would come to arrive at the same conclusion with me and begin to realize the real situation of advertisement .
All the points discussed in the above arguments demonstrate that the real advertisements with loyal introduction of goods ' funtions or effects are not existent .
