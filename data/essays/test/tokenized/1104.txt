I disagree with the statement that traveling in a group led by a tour guide is the best way .
I think that the best way to travel is to create own plan and travel without a tour guide .
The reasons are as follows .

First , if I go to travel , I would like to decide the time schedule and place to visit by myself .
In the tour , time schedule and the place to visit is usually almost fixed .
I wonder if these things are sitable for me. 3 years ago , I joined a tour in Thai Land because that was first time to got to the country and I thought there were not so many people who could speak English .
In the tour , tour guide was good but time schedule was tight .
Also , the place I wanted to go was not included in the visiting place in the tour .
At the time , I thought I sholud arrange my travel by myself if I have already had the place where I wanted to go or the activities I wanted to do in the travel .

Second , I wanted to save my money for traveling .
And I want to investigate my money to studying English instead of a tour .
If we join a tour , we need to pay for the tour guide .
So , that means that it will be more expensive than without a tour guide .
In my last travel with a tour guide , it costed twice as much as without a tour guide .
It was so expensive , but I could not satisfied .
To prevent this situation , it is better to create own plan and to trave by ourselve .

Third , to ceate travel plan is so fun and interested for me .
It will make my travel so memorable .

In conclution , I prefer to travel by myself not with a tour guide .
I hope many people tried to create their own plan .
