It is quite controversial topic whether the number of vehicles , mainly cars , would increase in future or whether their use will diminish .
Some people mention that due to population explosion , which many of the developing countries are facing today , more cars would be required as compared to those required presently .
On the other hand , some believe that the quantity of cars would decrease in the future times as they think that people would become more conscious of the threats posed by excessive vehicles .
I personally believe smaller number of cars would be used in future .

Nowadys , people are also getting more conscious about the problems like increased air pollution and sound pollution which are direct consequences of high number of vehicles in the cities .
Also , the present cars mainly employ fossil fuels which are limited and would extint sometime in the future .
A lot of emphasis is currently laid on consuming the availaible fuels wisely and by saving them for future .
In recent times , there has been an increase in number of articles and advertisemts appearing in newspapers which urge people to use public transport in order to get rid of the above mentioned problems .

There has been a tremendous increase in the number of vehicle on roads in most of the major cities all around the world .
Also , people are facing a lot of problems caused by the incresed number of cars .
People in such big cities face problems like congestion and road-jams specially in the peak hours of morning and evening .
There has been an increased demand of adequate public trasport .
One of the most befitting example of this increased demand and the subsequent action is the introduction of Metros train as the public transport .
All the major cities in the world like New Delhi , Tokyo , Kolkatta have either been provided with this new metro train services or some attempts are being carried out to implement the efficient public transport .
A lot of reseacrh has been going on implementing altenatives like Monorails , especially in highly congested areas where Metro trians ca n't be implemented .

The introduction of high capacity buses and development of special corridors for them in cities like New Delhi is yet another example of numerous attempts to improve the public transort system .

So , I feel that this combined increase in consciousness in general public about the consequnces of increased number of vehicles and emphasis on improving public transport might eventually lead to decreased number of cars in future .
