Adverisements of products in today 's life plays a crucial role in product sales which leads to a higher profit margin of a company .
Since our world today relies basically on money , advertisement business is also affected by the situation .
Most advertisiments are made to show a product better than it actually is .
This approach can be seen in brand advertisements and advertisements of movies .

Most of the advertisements are trying to affect and influence people with their mottos .
Advertisors try to show product as a lifestyle and more than what it is .
For example , Sprite - a leading brand in drinks - claims that your thirst will destroy after you drink it .
They try to claim that Sprite can take place of water .
But scientifically , it is impossible .
The amount of sugar in it will increase the desire or demand of water after the Sprite drinking experience .
This situation is the main result of showing products much better than they realy are .

The film industry is making fragments of the movies and advertise it in order to reach to a large number of audience .
To accomplish that goal , they get the best parts of the movies and edit it and with this process they try to make the movie bigger than or more than it is .
Everybody has that kind of an experience in his or her life .
They go to a movie with great expectations but when they see what it really is , they blame themselves about how they gave money to it .

Most of the advirtesements in the present time are products of emperialism .
They are all made to increase the amount of money which leads to an increase in firms ' income .
Advertisors also put into position to do that if they can not affect product 's sales , they will be a part of unemployment group .
So when we look at the big picture of advertising sector , most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .
