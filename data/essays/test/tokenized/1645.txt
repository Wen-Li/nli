Now-a-days people are showing much interest in travelling to new places and exploring new things during their leisure time .
The people enjoy travelling in groups , particularly the college and university students .
In my opinion , it 's always better to have a tour guide along with you when you travel to new places .

First thing when we travel in groups , we will find someone to organise and host the team .
It would be much easier to make the plan of the trip if we have a person who is familiar with the going destination .
So , when we are going to an unknown place it 's advisable to take a guide along with you .

By taking a guide along with us we have many advantages .
Firstly , as the guide is familiar with the places he will make all prior arrangements like accomodation , site seeing and travel directions .
He will give a perfect tour itinerary .
Secondly , we could able to save lot of time in visiting places , where we will not face any difficulties in locating the spots .
He will describe all the history , about the culture and importance of the place while sight seeing .
He will also guide us the do 's and dont 's while travelling to a new place .

To my personal experience when I was in my college , we planned to a hill station in group .
After taking all pain staking efforts , somehow we have reached our destination .
There we felt lot of difficulties in finding a better accomodation .
We have no idea about the places which we have visited because its a remote place , where peole are very few .
We could not even find someone even to go to the particular spot .
We did not much enjoyed the trip as we have wasted a lot of time in finding things in our short period tour .

Considering the above points I feel that it 's better to have a guide along with u when you are travelling in a group , so that your trip will be more joyable and interesting .
