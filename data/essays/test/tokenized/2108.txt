Development starts with fantasy .
Actions and works devoid of imaginative and creative mind are doomed to disappear from the common legacy of mankind .
Yes , I completely agree with this statement .
What encourages me to say this in such a confident way is the history of science itself .

The history of science is full of success stories and outstanding figures .
The common trait that made them shine so brightly was their extraordinary minds craving for trying new things .
They all knew well that without taking risks they would n't have achieve any simple advancement .

Nikola Tesla , one of the greatest minds of 20 .
century , constitutes a great example to how a scientist can not be satisfied with what he achieved .
He laid ground for the basics of electric current and discovered alternative current making huge wealth out of his discovery .
But , instead of enjoying the comfort and luxury , he set out to discover free atmospheric energy and ended up losing everything he owned along with his life .

We 're flying incredible distances thanks to courageous Wright Brothers who took the risk of humiliation .
If they gave up trying new things we would never have experienced the excitement of flying .

The same thing is also true for the business .
