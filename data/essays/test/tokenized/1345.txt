The issue in question is whether most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .
This is an interesting question , different people hold different views due to their different backgrounds and life experience .
As for me , I strongly agree with the assertion for the following reasons .

First of all , advertisement is the magic of marketing .
Advertisement can be showed in various of ways , such as magazines , newspaper , telephone , television , radio and so on .
The company can also held a product launching conference to introduce the new launching products person to person .
There are several ways to induce the buyer to pay the money , but we seldom find a advertisement to reveal the weakness of the products .
It takes a lot of time to compare all of the same category products , so we often make the buy-it-or-not decition by only receiving the strengh-side information provided by the advertisement .

secondly , the need for the products can be created by the talented marketing genius .
They produce attractive stories , events , pictures to appeal for our notice .
Exellent advertisement makes us feel that we need the products in our daily life even though we actually do n't .
For instanse , the OREO snacks make a good advertisement in Taiwan , they make a film that is about a cute boy eating oreo when he plays with his little dog , He melts oreo with milk before every bite .
That is really a impression .
After my sister saw the advertisement , she buy a bottle of milk everytime when she buy the oreo snacks .
And she tell me that she agree in this way oreo become more delicious .
Actually , we all know that the product `` oreo snack '' never change , but the advertisement successfully transmit the new image about the product and make the products much better than before .

Considering the aforementioned reasons and examples I cited above , I totally agree with the assertion that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .
Though good marketing approach , everything can be better .
