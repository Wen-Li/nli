Some people believe that only doing what they already know how to do well is sufficiently for success .
In my opinion , however , the opposite is true .
To be able to successful in life we must try new things , take risks and have knowledge about so many things .

If we want to be successful , we must try new things .
In the bussiness life , we always do regular things .
So , we earn same money .
I am electronic engineer .
When I started my new job , we was buying some rudimentary electronic boards .
They were very simple , on the other hand , very expensive .
I told to boss about designing our own boards .
He permited me , and I succeed it .
Now , we make much money than before .

We must take risk to be successful .
Risk is the most important part of success .
I went to boss to talk to him about designing our own boards .
This was very risky for me , because if I could not achive to produce this boards , I may be fired from my job .
We bought new machines to produce them .
In addition , I spend my time for only this work .
These were very sufficient reasons to be fired .
But I had taken all these risks , and I achived it .

The last action of the way of success is that we have to improve ourselves in many ways .
If we have good knowledge about our major , we can try new things , and take risks .
I mean these go hand in hand .
If we ignore one of them , it is impossible to be successfull .

In conclusion , I believe that there are three main components of succeess .
These are to try new things , take risk , and have good knowledge .
However , everybody has a different opinion about this issue , and I respect all of our views .
