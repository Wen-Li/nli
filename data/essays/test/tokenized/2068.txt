This is an era of cut throat competetion .
Be it education , sports or earnings .
Everyone is vying to get to the top and in the process might not desist from being slightly to overtly pretentetious .
The same goes for any company which is in the market to sell its product amidst competetors who are waiting for the slightest of the chances to cut into their sales figures .
So one needs to constantly try to convince their clients or consumers that their products or services are the best available .
To realise this goal the advertisements needs to project more than what the product actually is .

Taking a more pragmatic look the whole behind an advertisement is to blindfold the consumer in buying the product .
Like the advertisement about a biscuit which claims that four pieces of it will suffice the daily needs of a growing child .
Or how about a soft drink advertisement making people believe that on having it will lead to a sense to pride for the motherland .
The whole idea is to make the multitude believe that we offer something which is truant in other products .
A big sized company spends millons of dollars on these advertisements just to create a buzz in the place in order to attract more consumers hence generating more profits even if this calls for a slight over or incorrect representation of the product qualities .
If the end result is profit everyone is game for it .

I feel that the over accentuation is the major objective of any advertisement and the onus lies on the people to identify those points and make an educated choice .
Just going by what a company is projecting on media can prove to be too ignorant a decision .
A more researched pick is what is needed in today 's world where nothing is real .
