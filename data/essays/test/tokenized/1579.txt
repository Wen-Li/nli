Some people think that the success is achieved when new risk are tried ; however , others see a success can be achieved when a person does what he or she is familiar with .
In my opinion , success can be acheived something is known .

First , when people know what they do they can utilize their time .
those people can plan their time significantly , and they do not waste their time .
For example , when they want to to do something , and they do not know about it bebore ; therefore , they have to change their setrategy many times .
the wasted time will lead then to the failure .

As a result , people who waste time to do something that they are not familiar with will not sucess .

Second , good chievements can be performed when people are knowledgabe in the field that they work in .
Prior information is very important in any topic in order to achieve advance in the topic .
For instance , when a team wants to develops a new device .
If the team do not have experience in how to design this device , they will not achieve any thing to develop the product .
Even if the team tries to convince other people with the success of the device , people will laterly discover the drawbacks of the device .
Therefore , prior knowledge is one of the important aspects which leads to success .

In conclusion , it is very important for people to be familiar with a topic when when they want to do a contribution to it .
If the have this a knowledge about the subject they cane come out with successful results in a very short time .
