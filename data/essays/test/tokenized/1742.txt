I grew up in a city in the North of Italy .
In my city there is an highly efficient system of transportation based on buses and underground that enables people to commute without using the car .
For that reason I agree with the proposed statement and I 'm well aware that in the future there will be fewer cars in use than there are today .
But , in particular condition , I can imagine a growing number of cars in the future , for exemple in small cities .

I think that cars in the future will reduce for three main reasons .
First , cars are responsible for the pollution of the big cities and gouvernement seems to care more and more to environemental problems by restricting the access to urban area to cars .
Second , cars are expensive and need a constant maintenance .
Third , the trafic jam is resaponsible for many hours spent in commuting .

As a result the only way I see to solve the three problems I 've just explained is an efficient transportation system .
The gouvernement of my city decided many years ago that it was necessary to develop a commuting system able to allow the people to left the car at home and to commute with the bus or the underground .

This decision had a big impact on the car sales evolution .
Since 2001 , starting years for the undergroud , the number of car in my city is decreasing .
For that region I believe that in the future the number of car in my city will continue to reduce .

I imagine that in small cities , where it 's not present an underground or an efficient system of buses the increasing necessity to move will lead to an increasing number of cars .

At the end if I consider my experience I 'm well aware that in the future there will be fewer cars in use than there are today , at least in big cities .
