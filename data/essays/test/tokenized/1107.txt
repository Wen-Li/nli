I personally do not agree with the statement that `` The best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide '' .

The primary reason I do not agree with the statement is because I believe that while travelling a certain element of adventure is needed to make the travel enjoyable and memorable .
I think when you travel in a group led by a tour guide the element of adventurism would be lost .
The thrill in exploring and travelling new places on one 's own would be more rewarding compared to the comfort and pleasure provided by a guided tour .

I might be willing to travel in a group but without a tour guide .
I would prefer to take along a travel book , if necessary , as a guide .
It would be more fun to explore new places with friends and family , but without a guide .
It would bring out the adventure spirit in members of the group .
Though there would be a chance that we might get lost during the journey it would be worth the trouble once we complete the trip .
We can reflect back on the trip and share all those happy moments .

I feel a guided tour would only expose us to the most popular locations at a place .
But when we make the tour on our own we would have have the freedom and time to explore the place on our own .
Also the experience would be unique and different from what anyone else would experience if one opted for a guided tour .
I speak partly from personal experience .
I troughly enjoyed my trip along with friends to the `` Burra Caves '' near Vizag in my home state .
While a guided tour would have provided us with a visit to all the popular locations on the our , we decided to explore the place on our own .
It gave us the chance to see many places which were not included in the guided tour but nonetheless were more exciting and memorable .
On the other hand I do not remember much about the guided tour to the `` Golconda Fort '' in my home town of Hyderabad .
