i agree this statement because of following reasons .
first , to try someting new is really important to improve the problems .
for example , its my sister .
she tried to pass the exam to the colledge of London .
she was lasy and already woke up very late .
she did not like study hard and talk to stranger .
she was very shy .
she could not do everything alone .
but she decided to try the exam and she changed her life .
she studies hard and wakes up early for presenting the lesson for university .
she becomes to be able to take to stranger and eat something alone .
she can do everything alone now .
to go abroad is really dangerous and including a lot of risks .
but she would like to change her life for her future and she could changed her life .
and that stance is the essence of the successful people .
second , that is the president of nissan motor .
he led the nissan the top level company .
one of the thing he did is to release and sell the farelady z which is really famous car in their line up now .
at that time he got the president position , that car was not sold because they could not have the power to sell them and they could not improve the car to emotional , speedy , beautiful shape and useful one .
and the people who were the staff of nissan rejected to release and reborn the farelady z because there are so many risks .
one of them , if the customer will not but anymore . ..
but the president strongly did his project and customers love to bought that car .
finally he led the nissan to the top level company .
to try new things is very important skills to live .
the risks also teach us to spend the time better than not to try .
the just waitng and keep their stlye will not bring anymore .
to do something new bring a valueable and interesting life for
