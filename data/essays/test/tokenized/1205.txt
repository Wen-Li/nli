I disagree with the opinion that there will be fewer cars in use than there are today .
There are three main reasons to support my ideas .

First , our society and technology are glowing rapidly .
Even today , we are not able to live without cars , so I have a huge question how come we will be able to live without cars in the future even though our society is becomming better and better .

Second , for people who live in suburbs , cars are really important transportation .
Without a car , they can not be out of the town or they can not even go shopping to buy gloseries .
So , cars are vital tool for people who live in specific area .

Third , people are recently climing the danger of our natures , so car companies are likely to produce new kind of cars which do not produce much toxic gases .
In the future , there must be invented new cars which produce less gas or no gas !
I believe that our future cars will be friendly against environment .

In conclusion , cars are most convenient and useful transportation for all of us .
If some Green-considered cars will be invented , we do not need to give up using cars .
From these ideas , I would like to disagree with the opinion that there will be fewer cars in use than there are today .
