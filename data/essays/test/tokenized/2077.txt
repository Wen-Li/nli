I fully agreed that successful people actually attempted new things and take risks rather than just doing what they already confident in doing well .
I believe all successful people have the inclination to try out new things for the sake of excitement and self-fullfilment .
Throughout the history of mankind , we see a lot of major accomplishment and foundings due to the spirit of taking risk and attempting for the uncharted zone .
An good example is Thomas edison who major invention of the lightbulb that iluminated the mankind in the darkness of the night .
He is able to try out new substance with his invention and eventually found that Tungsten is the right material that glow when electricities passed through , after uncountable times of failure in searching that particular material .
In , fact after each failure , Edison was pleased because he declared that he sucessfully prove that another kind of material is not suitable .

In nowadays world , we have seen large steps of advancement in technology .
These advancement is due to the fact that we have a great amount of brave scientist that dare to challenge the unknown .
We have seen mankind reach out to the space and landed on the moon .
These can only be achieved when NASA is determined to challenge the gravity to travel outside the earth rather than satisfied with the fact that we already manage to travel within our earth with airplane and ships .
It is this determination of taking risk and exploring the unpredictable that help to make mankind advance .

In the world of business , we see a lot of miracle happen only to those who willing to take the odds and bet their future .
Of course , the risk being undertaken have to be resonable and the effort being putting in have to be in the right channel .
One good example , is the president of Singapore Mr Lee Kuan Yew , who miraclely bring the country in to a major finance and investment hub in Asia , eventhough the small island is predicted to have zero chances to survive after the British retreat all its army .
Being left behind with a country with almost no natural resources and only a small domestic market due to the limited size of popolation , Mr Lee has prove his courage by taking major steps to try out different ways of establishing a country with methods never tried before .
Beside pulling in foreign investment from USA and Japan , which is an unusual way of diplomatic at that time when all the countries are still heavilly inclined to the Europe as business partner , Mr Lee invited the Istrael Military advisor to train his country troops , which is seen extraordinary due to the fact that Istrael is never a favourable country to befriend with .
Yet , the economic success and the emerging of a strong army for the later year to come prove that these courages measure by Mr Lee is definitely prove to be wise and a learning example for us .
