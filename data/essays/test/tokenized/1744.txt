I completely agree with this statement .
Howeever there are some reasons to force the young people to do it , this situation is occured mainly by young people .
While they are fighting against the life conditions to gain money and get to a high position , they can easily forget to give enough time to helping their commmunities .
Also they give a lot of time to entertainment instead of giving time to their communities .

First of all , todays ' world is much more competitive and harder than the old times .
To continue their life in todays ' world , young people can forget their responsibilities to their public .
To illustriate , peole need more and more money to continue their life .
And this situation forces them to be violent to others .
In the daily they have n't got any free time to relax and ask themselves `` How can I help my community `` .
They become greedy and selfish .

Also they prefer giving time to entertainment instead of giving time to their communities .
This happens because a great deal of the young people out of manner .
They think that their joy is more important than their communities .
As a result of this they can easily go further from their communities .

Some opponents think that young people are right about not giving enough time to their communities because of the lack of time .
But the young people are giving time to entertainment instead of communities .
To be honest , giving enough time to your community can make you happy and strong relationships between community and you can give much more joy than which you give time .

To sum up , instead of giving time to earn more money which we need and wasting time in the joy and night life , we can give enough time to our community to create a good relationship between our public and us .
