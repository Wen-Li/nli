Due to the importantance of economic and the competence bought by various kinds of products , the advertisment is playing a more and more essential role in our life .
But to say advertisemnts are all taking benifits to us , however is not easy .

The most noticable problem is whether the advertisements do give us a true view of the products .
Depending on my personal experience and view , advertisments , at least most of them are sending us a better products than they actually are .

First of all the information from the advertisements may not be complete .
Every thing has two sides .
The products as well , may have their disadvantages .
However the companies want to maxize their profits so that they always hide the dark sides of the products from the customers .
Take the sports drink as an example .
We can see from the advertisements that the sports drink can take us energy when after kinds of sports .
But we also need to know it will become poison if we drink too much , especially when we are not doing sports which is not presented from the advertisements .
So always we can only see the advantages from the advertisements .

Another reason for my propensity is that due to the serious competence of the modern market , If one company presented an untrue advertisement without punishments , the other company may be affected by them .
If they do not do the same thing , they may not working well or even can not survive .
So this kind of untrue advertisements just spread out like virus .
It is so common now that the companies advertise their products untrue .

Taking in to all aspects above i agree with the statement that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .
And it is expected that the govements can notice this problem and take a effeciency way out .
