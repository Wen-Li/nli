Although it is more important for students to learn facts than it is for them to understand ideas and consepts , I believe that it is more important for students to understand ideas and consepts .
There are two reasons for this : more useful and more edicational .

First of all , to understand ideas and concepts is more useful in the future .
For example , to my experience , when I was a jonior high school student , my math teacher did not tell the answer immidiatry .
I would to know the answer fast .
However He teach us importance oh thinking .

Second , to understand ideas and concepts is more educational than to lean facts .
When students learn concepts , they can think of matter .
If a lecturer thought students only facts , students do not consider .
For example , according to the survey in my country , in the case that a teacher do not tell facts , 70 % students try to find fact in their own .

For these reasons , I agree that it is more important to understand ideas and concepts .
