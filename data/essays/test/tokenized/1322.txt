I believe that most advertisements do really make products seem much better , handy , and necessary for daily use , than they really are .
It should not be surprising to say that ; since the ultimate goal of the advertisements is to convince you to buy things , whether you need them or not .

First of all we need to be specific on the type of the advertisements we are discussing about .
Some products need to be advertised , some others do not because you may already know what you actually need .
For instance an advertisement of a new car if it 's a unknown brand serves well for the product sales since an ordinary customer does not consider buying that specific brand .
First he or she needs to be convinced by the advertisements to change his or her car .
Second they need to be convinced to buy that brand , so it 's a two level process .
The same logic applies for every item that is rarely bought and maybe expensive as well .
The actual problem is to spread the message that even a person is happy with his car , advertisements have the power to illustrate the situation otherwise , presenting an option that there are be better and cheaper cars to be bought .
Thus the role of the advertisement can be understood better if we consider the subject from this perspective .

The other type of advertisements are of some type of brands which do n't need to spend large amounts of money for advertising .
Very good quality brands , brands that target a specific type of customers ( income , social status etc ) , or products that are for use of only one gender do not need striking advertisements .
You can not be deceived by an advertisement of a toy as an adult .
You are not interested in make-up apparels if you are a man or without a wife .
Similar to that example if you are a passionate BMW driver , the ads of Mercedes do not atrract your desire .
Therefore such brands have less intention to make their products look better on ads .

To conclude it would be better to say that it is true for an advertisement to be convincing .
But it is up to you from which one you would be attracted most .
