I think that in the student life is more important understand ideas and concepts that learn facts for two reasons : the consecuences to the real life or working life and to the other hand about the way to learning of the human beings

the first reason is because the concept is tha base of all knowlegde and with the ideas you can imagine all that other things that compane that .
When you are student you need the concept and ideas to react to any situaction of the life for example when I were in the college I learnt about how A coul 'd sell my services as designer , in this moment know all the concept about the merchandising of the products and when I finished my university and I followed to the next step the work I had to show my ideas and sell my owns products and all of the concepts learnt was aplicated

and the second reason is the way to learn the humans beings becouse since we are children we learn the concepts with the hand to the facts , but without the concepts the fact change their form and they are transformed in only a moment with importance to us

for example the learning to clean the teeth , if the kids dont konw the importance of clean their teeth they never will learn the habite

in conclution we couldnt separate this the facts
