In my mind , specifying itself on a specific subject can enables a global development .
If Freud had not been specified in psychology , Einstein in science or Bill Gates in economy and data systems , would our world be the same ?
If nobody had wanted to specify in health care , would I be here right now ?
They would not be the same results , the same impact on the world development if everybody was working on several subjects without developing them widely .
Specialization became part of human nature the day when we understood that everybody needs each human characteristical strength to go further .
Development of exchange markets from salt prices to globalisation illustrate this phenomenon .

People realize what he think it will be better , what interested it the most and what will enable some other persons progressing .
My personal desire is to study finance , to learn more about trade and create a firm .
This will permit some employees to live , even if some problems can occur , and will allow me realizing what I desire the most .
This specialization does not imply that I 'm going to forget other subjects but that I will develop a specific subject widely .

We need each one specifications to do a world .
We must not realize all the specifities that an other person implement every day , it just going to serve us for a specific need .
Trade reflects very well this idea .
Countries try to produce goods or services that can not or are difficult to be produced by another country to complete its needs , and the inverse .
In this way , each country increase its productivity on a defined sector and exchange with others to complete its needs .

Even if a human dream is ubiquity , nobody can know all about everything that 's why human are specializing themselves in activities to create together a global knowledge which will satisfy everybody owing to exchanges .
