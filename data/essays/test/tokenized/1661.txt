It is quite a widespread opinion that our western societies are becoming more and more self-centered .
That thesis of course extends to the youth , making it neccesary to ask oneself whether it is true or not that young people are not engaged enough in helping their communities .
It is possible to find some evidence that the comitment of young people to their communities significantly diminushed over the past decades , but that this may be due to a shifting in the definition young people have of `` their '' community .

It can not be denied that young people seems to be less integrated in the communities than they used to .
Young people , at least in the european countries I know , are not often to be seen in religious manifestation : that is an evidence that the feeling of membership in a religious community is way weaker than he was for 50 years , leading to a reduced amount of time given to support this community .

Moreover , it seems to me that people , especially young people , value more an more the time they have for them own , so they are more and more reluctant to give him , for any cause .
This could be seen as a consequence of our way of living , that gives an huge value to leisure , but it could also be linked that a large proportion of young people are doing studies that require a significant amount of working time at home .

Even if those facts tend to argue in favour of a desafection of young people from their communities , it can not be overseen that young people sometimes give large amount of time for none traditional `` communities '' , that absorb the time that would have been devoted to other community for a few decade .
For example , the non-profit humanitary organization have a large prportion of young members ; the students association are more active than ever .

This trend to chose one 's `` community '' rather than to adhere to a traditional one can be quite dangerous : it is an explanation of the recent increase in number and power of the gangs .

To put it in a nutshell , it 's not true that young people do n't want to spend time for a community , but they do it for a community they have chosen rather than the traditional ones
