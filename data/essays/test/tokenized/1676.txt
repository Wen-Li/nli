Successful people always exist as a group of elites .
Common people worship them and regard these successful people as their role models to follow .
However , why can these unique people suceed ?
Are they more likely to try new things and take huge risks or they only focus on their own expertise ?
People have been arguing this case for a long time , but they have not been able to reach a consensus .
Nowadays , as the pace of modernization becomes faster and people 's minds open wider , we can view this particular issue form diffrent angles .
Personally , i agree the idea that succesful people do what the others afraid or not awared to do .

Every feasible decision or statement is based on rational reasons .
The first and foremost , Successful people can discover the opportunities better .
In this competetive society , chanllanges come with opportunities .
It is not exaggerated to say that you can find great opportunities in every domains .
However , the problem is , people are not really sensitive to the appearence of chances .
Successful people are diffrent .
They are diffrent only because they can catch the chances and make a good use of them .
Bill Gates is a great example .
He saw the great potential of computer industries and deligently worked with this .
He sacrificed his academic career in order to focus on his buisness .
As a consequence , he has become successful .
Therefore , succesful people are the group of people who can find opportunities and bravely try to achive their goals .

Moreover , successful people are usually intelligent enough to see the great profit behind the risk .
They usally have magnificent understanding in some specific region .
Hence , their knowledge provides them courage to take the risk .
The example of Napolean os convincible .
He was a genius in military region .
It is not an overstatement to say that he is the greatest military leader of all time .
Because of his ability , he was able to see the flaws of his enemies so that he could made audacious strategies , and sometimes , those were unprecendented , to attack his enemies .

Generallys peaking , it is their talent that make succcesful people become so creative and fearless .
Lastly , Successful people usaully have better mental qulities to withstand their audacious decisions .
This means that they are more mentally-durable than common people .
Statatistics show that the CEOs of big companies are more prone to be calm and sustainable .
A direct consequence of that is they are more likely to try brand new things and be brave .
Thus , can win the hidden profit after taking the risk .

In conclustion , after thorough consideration , I believes that it is more sagacious to say that successful elites are more likely to try new experinces and make risky decisions .
This has been substantiated by listing several reasons , including their senstive awarness to opportunities , intelligence and mental toughness .
