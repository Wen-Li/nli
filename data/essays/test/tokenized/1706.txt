Do you ever wonder why the models or actresses look simply amazing in the front cover of any magizine ?
Well , thanks to Photoshop !
Yes , they are not perfect and they do have wrinkles and bad skin sometimes .
This is just a tipical trick to convince us the readers to buy specific things for personal benefits .
I believe because of this reason that advertisements have the need to make some products seem much better that they really are .

Nowadays , as it is basically known , all the magazines and TV commercials makes us sometimes want to look like somebody else .
Everyone has wished it once in their lifetime .
As the Neutrogena publishing manager assistant it is my job to search for new products woman are looking for by interviews and other specific data .
Also I have the knowledge that before any product is released in any kind form certain steps must be checked and preformed .

First , a model has to be selected ( artist or professional model ) he or she has to go through a photo session with nice chick clothes and makeup .
Second , the pictures are re-touched by professionals that work with Photoshop ( a progam that modifies images ) sometimes with the selected model present and erase any kind of unwanted mistakes ( wrinkles , dark circles under the eyes , zits , etc ) .
Third , the name of the product and the product itself is attached to the main picture .
All of this to only promote a product that in many cases is not even used by the model for the photo session .

But imagine promoting a anti-wrinkle cream if the model in it had visible wrinkles ?
I would certainly not buy it , neither would anyone .
So , it is necessary to make products seem better for the selling of these of course and the profits of specific companies .
I am not establishing that all of the products are not effective I 'm just saying that with a little of help a lot of them are easily sold .

To sump up , this method of making products to seem better than they really are is a very good way of gaining profits .
In our days this is what is all about . ..
making money is n't it right ?
And what better way that to do this I believe it fair .
