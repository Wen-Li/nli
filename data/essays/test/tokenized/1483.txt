Certainly , I do agree with the statement that the advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .
The advent of consumerism and perceptible increases in the per capita incomes across the world especially during the nineties had led to more and more demand of quality products and its varieties .
The economic transformation and technological advancements has even made quest more profound and so the availability of the wide array of products .
The increasing number of companies are entering into the market for similar products leading to enhanced competition .
This competition amongst the companies/firms manufacturing similar products has led them to prefer for aggressive advertisements .
The advertisements positions the products into a niche market and differentiates the products with the already existing ones .
In an attempt to position the product and reach to the wider segment of population , the innovative advertisments in print , media and other forms of advertisments have relied on communicating mostly on the quality attributes of the products .
These quality attributes may be from the ingrediants in case of food and consumer products to the performance , look , style and satisfaction in case of other capital goods and services .
While creating an advertisment , the advertsing and manufacturing company 's main intention is to show case their product/service by highlighting the uniqueness and quality attributes in such a way that it impresses/convinces the consumer and leave an indelible impression on the mind .
Some times , in an aggressive advertising , the product attributes are exaggerated in much better way than it is .
The advertisments of toothpaste and soaps and nutritional supplements of childrens are a good example wherein every new product is advertised in a better than reality to woo the consumers .
However , this practice is not good and needs a proper check and a regulatory framework must be put in place to penalise such acts of advertisments of products as it violates the basic ethics of good marketing practices .
The products advertisements should show case only on the genuine attributes , valid testimony or trials and should not impinge upon the hypothetical basis .
