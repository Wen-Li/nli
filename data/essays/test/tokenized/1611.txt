Are Cars Slowly becoming Extinct ?

Yes , I agree with this statement because of the following reasons .

In todays day and age the people of all ages and cultures have become extremely health and environment concious .
This is probably because in every newspaper and magizine as well as on the television you will always find an topic on the envionment appear , this has spread awarness through out the world and has got people thinking about the future of the earth .

Due to this many countries , governments and cities have begun a concious effort to try and reduce the number of cars on the road , in a final bid to try and conserve our environment which is already begun to discentigrate before our eyes .
Like the glaciers that have started to melt in Anatarica and the many holes that have appeared in our ozone layer .

Therefore we see many changes in the thought proccess of the future generation and of the current governments .
For example in Japan we see rules being passed which make it illegal for one person to drive a car to work , there should be at least four people to a car , in turn this cuts down the number of cars on the road and helps to reduce the damage to the environment .

Another country that is trying to cut down on the amount of car usuage is Dubai , which has already started construction on a metro rail system which run throughout the city and take commuters to and fro ; from work , school or shopping this along with the slowly increasing petrol costs will help encourage people to use the tram instead of their car .

Many other countries have also passed rules on car usuage , like the U.S. and U.K. which have implemented heavy taxes on petrol as well as on car manafacturers , hence raising the costs of purchasing a car .

Therefore due to all the positive publicity , public awareness and government envolvement we see people willingly using alternative methods of traportation as well as slowly being forced by peer groups and government rules to use alternative transportation methods .
Thus I agree and strongly believe within the next twenty years we will see very few cars in use or maybe even none at all .
