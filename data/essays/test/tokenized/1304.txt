I agree with the opinion that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .
Some people say that some products must be abolished because they have bad influence on people .
However , if the products have some weaknesses , I think it is not right .
I have two reasons why I think so .
I 'd like to write about them in the following .

First , I think some products have a huge influence on our life .
For example , cellphone , internet .
The cellphone make us easier to call friends , and make us easier to meet .
It is very useful because people call each other whenever they want .
Moreover , it can take pictures , also people can send pictures by e-mail , so people can share their experiences immedietly .
The internet can communicate with people all over the world , and it is much faster to send e-mail , so people wo n't get sad unless they exchange their e-mail address .

Second , whether the products have problem , it can be solved easier .
For example , the internet has some bad advantages for people , especially t

In conclusion , personally , I think there are many products that changed our lives extremelly .
It is sure that some people believe that the products change our lives in a wrong way .
However , it always make our lives more easier than before , and if we lost these products like internet or cellphone , I do n't think we can go through this modern society .
Therefore , some people should believe that how these products are important to our society .
