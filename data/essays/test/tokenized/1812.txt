Given the choices between the statement , I agree that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .

First , the advertisements are good at creat the situations for consumers .
For example , I want to eat ice cream when the weather is very hot .
At that moment , I see the advertisement about the ice cream .
It will let me want to get one right away .

Second , the advertisement are good at use the idols to attract people to buy thier products .
For example , it is very attractment to me when I saw the super star who appealed .
After she used the product that made her face more young and beautiful .
It will let me want to buy one .

Third , the advertisements are always let consumers have a lot of illustrations and dreams .
They teachs people that the products what they owned are the best in the world .

To sum up , these are the reasons why I agree that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .
