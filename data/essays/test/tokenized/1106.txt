Nowadays , many people think the best way to travel is in a group by a tour guide because this way is very convinient .
But in my opinion , I disagree with the idea .
I prefer to travel by myself .

The last year , I traveled to the Yunnan province with the group by a tour guide .
Before the trip , I was very excited because I would have a wonderful trip and visit so beautiful place .
But I was disappoint .
The agent was not responsable for the trip .
In some place , I did n't have enough time to visit and to have some photoes because the guide bring me to some stores and lost much time .

So I think that if we have a considerable plan we are not necessary to travel with the group by a tour guide .
Firstly , this way to travel losts a lot of money .
The guide may take you to some stores .
If you ca n't buy the goods , the guide may not have a good attitude to you in the fellow trip because the guide lost the award from the store owner .
Moreover , if you enter the group , you must pay for the trip which maybe more expensive than the tip by individual .

Secondly , traveling with the group losts a lot of time .
The reason is that there are a lot of people in the grop , not just only you , so you must wait for the other people when you go to the next place .
Also , the guide spend a lot of time in the shop so that you do n't have enough time to learn more knowlege of the next place .

Thirdly , you ca n't feel the freedom when you travel in a group by a guide .
The traveling plan is unchanged in the process of the trip .
When you konw a new interesting place and want to visit it in the trip , the guide must n't agree with you .

In a word , the trip by individual is more free and cheaper than the travel in the group by a tour guide .
So I suggest that if you want to travel , you can try to go with yourself .
Maybe you have a different and wonderful trip .
