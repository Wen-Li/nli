I agree with the statement .
I believe advertisements fundamentally present the features of a product in an attractive and easily understood manner .
The highly scientific manner in which this is done leads to the consumer perceiving the product to be better than it actually is .

Most marketing agencies tap certain key traits of human behaviour in their design and development of marketing schemes .
Some of them are greed , envy and philanthropy .
The advertisements would be conceived keeping any one or all of these traits in mind inorder to communicate to the consumer about how the product is the best thing to happen for his or her life .

Take envy as an example , most product firms use this prevalent human behaviour quite effectively in their advertisements .
Lets try and remember any advertisement for deodrants or toothpastes .
I would like to ask the reader of this essay two questions .

Do you ever remember being mobbed by members of the opposite sex , because of the deodrant that you have applied ?

Do your teeth becomes as white as those of the person using an identical toothpaste in the television advertisement for the same ?

I am sure most of the readers of this essay like me , would reply negatively with a mournful look .

Let us take greed as the second example , a common practise followed by most product companies during public festivals is to have massive advertisements in the newspaper stating a discount in the prices of their products .
A potential consumer who might not need that product at that time , still goes ahead and buys it because he or she believes that he or she will not get the product for such a ` good ' price in the future .
Thus using the festivals and greed as a platform , the company creates the message that its product is the best thing for the consumer to own .

Thus I have stated in this essay , why I think advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .
