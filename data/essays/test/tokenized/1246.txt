Where to travel in a group or travel by people themselves is a hot topic right now .
Some people think it will be very helpful to travel in a group with a tour while some others prefer to travel by themselves .
When facing this question , I would prefer travel by myself for the sake of the fun and flexible schedule .
I would like to give my reasons and evidences as following .

Firstly , I have lived in US for a couple of years and my English is good , these allow me to travel to the English-Speaking countries as all the places that I want to travel to is somewhere like Perth , Hawaii , London where people all speak English .
I do n't have to worry that I ca n't read the sign or do n't know how to get around .
I can always take the local public transportation to the destination , and maybe talk with the locals on the weather in the bus or subway .

Secondly , travel by myself will be much more interesting .
I could just go wherever I want to at any time once I arrived that city , without worrying the schedule of the group , without carring the peer pressure from other group member .
Or I can just rent a car in the destination , drive to the place I want to go , stop by a bar and sit down chatting with locals .
If I travel with a group , then these will not most likely happen .

Thirdly , travel without a guide will enable me from beening forced to somewhere I do n't like to go .
I am person who do n't like to go to somewhere full of people .
I have learnt from my lesson of my trip to Niagara Falls , I paid a lot to travel with a group however I was very upset with the whole trip .
The place was packed with people and the service of the hotel was not good , too many people waiting in the restaurant to get seated , and the food of the restaurant that the tour guide brought us to was not very tasty .

Moreover , my boyfriend is very good at planning trips and I would like to travel with him rather than with a boring tour guide , as I usually got a lot of fun and surprises when I travel with him .
I went to Disney Land with him two years ago , he planned for the whole trip and it turned out fabulous .
We not only enjoyed the disney world went to a city in Disney called Kissemme and watched the best show I have ever seen - The Arabian Nights .
There was a lovely pony which play the show together with an actor , what supprised me is the pony can remember how to play the show and even put the blanket when the man fell asleep on the stage .
And also after dinner we even get the desert called `` Princess wedding cake '' , what a adorable name !

Of course , travel with a guide will help you from getting lost , and they will provide you a lot of infomation of the place .
But according to my personal experience , I am would not prefer to travel in a group with a tour guide .
