Accurate academic knowledge is the key to a successful future professionnal activity .
But we should consider whether the success story should be based on a broad or a specialized knowledge .

Broad knowledge might be useful both in day - to - day to life and profesionnal activity .
Indeed , it provides a comprehensive point of view on many different subjects .
This shoul be called culture .
It might therefore help you being more critical and more adaptative in many different situations .
But under these circumstamces , knowledge remains general , unspecific .
Talking to professionnal life , this kind of general knowledge will never provide you specific skills and you might never be an expert enough to lead your own project - though very broadminded

Specialization mades of you an expert in a single domaine .
This should be called expertise .
Whereas the current profesionnal competitive context tends to make us trying to become experts on eveything , focusing our knowledge on a single subject seems more appropriate of the large amount of information and knowledge we share and use in 21st century .

Emphasis on a specific subject could give you the opportunity to developp an interesting skill that few others have and that they would therefore like to share .
Developping specific skills based on a specific academic carreer is the single most effective way to make of you an efficient and competitive worker - though perhaps narrowminded .

The ideal would thus be a delicate balance between a interesting general background based on broad knowledge with an emphasis on a specific subject you would be an expert in .
But like others idealistic positions , reaching it is quite difficult thoiu not impossible despites the amont of challenges we have to face daily ...
reaching excellence in everything .
