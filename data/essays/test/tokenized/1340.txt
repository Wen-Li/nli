Travelling is a vital part of our life .
Travelling to new places teaches us a lot of new things .
We gain knowledge and experience about new places and various things related to them .
For example , when we visit a new city , we learn about the lifestyle of the people living there , their cusines , culture , etc .
Some people like to travel alone and some like to travel in groups led by tour guides .

I disagree with the above given statement and i think the best way to travel is to travel alone .
There are various reasons to support the same .
Firstly , when a person travels alone he perceives all his surroundings in his own way whereas if he/she is travelling with a tour guide he gets to know the things from only one viewpoint i.e. guide 's viewpoint .
For example , Once i went to see Taj Mahal .
Its a landmark in Indian historical architecture .
I think i saw and learnt a lot of things about the place which would have been impssible if i was accompanied by a guide .
Secondly , while travelling alone person is independant .
He can do whatever he likes .
He does not need to seek permission from the tour guide if he wants to stray out of the group .
Whereas with the guide , you are bounded to the group .
You observe only what your guide shows you .
Guides can be helpful sometimes when it comes to historical buildings because they are often familiar with the history of those buildings .
Thirdly , when a person is alone he has oppurtunities to explore various places in the new environment like differents restaurants , hotels , etc , He is never in a hurry .
If a person likes a particular place he can even stay there without any kind of compulsion .
As an example , in our country guides are not professionals .
It means most of the guides are not educated enough .
They are not the best persons for the job of guides .
Morever some people find it dificult to stay with a group at all times .
Everyone needs privacy .
Its often dificult to adjust with a group of unfamiliar people .
Also , if a person catches some kind of disease or has a health problem during the travelling , he can take a break .
So these were the main points which convey that travelling alone is more beneficial and interesting too .
To conclude , We can say that travelling with guides has some advantages but on the whole its not good .
So travelling alone should be preferred always .
