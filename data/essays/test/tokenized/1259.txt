In this time , the schools are giving our children diffrent topics .
And each topic has an influance in thier charectar .
Some topics made them creatice some do n't .
Therefore , I agree with th statement and I believe that it is more imortant for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for tham to learn facts beucase this thing will make tham creative by having a big imagination and turning the ideas into facts .

Giving the students ideas , will help them to have an imagination , which is important in thier life , specially if the ideas are wrong .
Giving wrong ideas to diffrent kind of student will have diffrent influance on them .
Some of them might take it as it is and believe even if it is true and that kind we should be aware from them and try to give them the both fact and idea together .
The another group might think about and try to think about and by doing that they will get a big imagnation that could help them to prove it .
And as a result of that they will have an open mind , which can discuss any topic .

Proving an idea is a really arduous thing because it is an idea ! .
But after proving it and turning it into fact you will be proud of your-self and you will feel like a king that time .
When I was a child my mother used to tell me an idea which it is : `` not all of the scintest right you could be better than them '' .
She was telling me this idea since I was seven years old .
After while , when I grow up and become a man I proved that , by proving that Newton 's formulas are wrong .
It was arduous for me to believe it and for my peer also , but when I remmebered my mother 's words it became easier to believe .
That moment I was n't happy for having that big honor , but also to prove that any idea , as mother 's idea , can be fact someday .
And that has a really big impact in my life , I am now in schoolarship for the gifted people only , and that kind of ideas are what the students need .

Therefore , if the school will not teach my students ideas , I will do it by myself .
becuase of my love to them I want them to have a big imagination and to try to turn the idea into fact .
