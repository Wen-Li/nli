I agree with the following statement .
That is to say , I think the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide .

I have three reasons to show this .
First , a tour guide ( or it maybe a tour company ) will make plans about travelling .
When should we leave home ?
Where should we go and how long we should stay there ?
What places should we see ?
etc . ..
I am reluctant to make plans of travelling , but I like travelling because I can see many buildings which I have not yet visited and many people who I have not yet met .

So it is very happy for me to have a tour guide make plans .

Second , if we travel with a tour guide knowing a lot of things about the cite , I can learn a plenty of knowledges from him / her .
I live in Japan , and there is a lot of place to visit .
Several world heritages make my mind feel good .
A tour guide may explain the traditional values of that cite , and we may know much about it .

Third , using package tour , safeties will be saved .
I heard that one of my friends traveled abroad alone and encounted a lot of troubles .
He lost his passport , and he had to stay there more than he would expected before .
If he had gone there with a tour guide , he would n't have experienced such a event .
If we use package tour , insurance to deal with this sad events can go well .

Therefore , I agree the idea of `` the best way to trabel is in a group led by a tour guide '' .
