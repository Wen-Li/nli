I believe that there is not only one route for success .
To be rich may be one type of success , and to get a good wife and children may be another type of success .
Moreover , either the person believes that he or she is successful or not may not understood by another person .
Therefore , I think it is true that the abilities or characters that are necessary for a person to success also vary by the types of success .

One of the types is that taking risks leads a person to success .
One of the examples is taking up a venture business .
In entrepruneuring a new business , he or she must think out a charasteristic business model that is completely different from any other business models that large companies have already been conducting , because the chance of success in the business world lies in creating new ideas .

Another type is that a person can be successful by doing the way he or she already know .
One of the examples of the type are politicians .
For politicians , the skill to listen to lots of various opinions and combine these opinions to the correct policy is necessary .
Although I admit that creating new policy is sometimes valuable , the ability of controling and leadership is more important for successful politicians .

After all , in entrepruneurs and politicians and every other profession , successful people are able to understand their own standpoints and situations and choose the best activity for them .
In order to do so , people must be clever and intelligent .
