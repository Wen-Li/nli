`` Will we still be using cars in twenty years from now ? ''
.
even with the rate of devolpment in the fields of sicnses it hard to belive that there will not be any cars in fifty years from this day .
maybe we can say that there will be fewer cars in used at that time but to say that it will not exicst is only a blind hope .
There might be a deffrint kinds of ways of transporting maybe like flying-vehicles or flying bycecles or somthing we can not even imagen .
What I belive is that the mind of humens reaches another level of thinking every dozens of years because it found out a lot of thing that was not avilable at the past so it begins to create a new way of thinking and sorting things that was inspaired from those invention .
So if nowadays we have cars we will surely will have less cars by twenenty years from now or even ten years from now .

These days we have a lot of ways to cut down the numbers of traffic and cars by bulding railways for traveling great distance , for the people who can not affored to buy a plan tiecket which will cut down the traffic in the highways and to decrease the rate of the daily accsidents in them .
The perfect solution for the cities traffic would be to bulid a network of subways around the city to provide it 's seriveces to the whole puplic which in a lot of ways more helping then having a car , because I will not be burdened by the cost of maintenances or by the parking spot that I got to park it in. most people does not hav eany needs in having a car but for the lake of another way of transportaion they find themselves forsed to buy one .

All that is only the half of what there is to say but in my opinoin I surrunder to the voice in my head that is telling me that there will be less cars twenty years fronm now .
