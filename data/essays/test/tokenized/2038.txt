Advertisements are very important for customers to gain information about products or have a knowledge about a new product that has just started to be sold in the market .
But there is an important problem about advertisement whether the products seem how they are in real or not .

I agree with the ones who believe products seem much better in advertisements than they really are .
First of all , in the market there are many producers for a specific type of product , and customers usually decide between the products according to his/her needs , technical and design aspects , price and quality .
The customers wants to buy high quality products with a less price and the producers want to sell a lot of them to get the highest profit .
Since the producers know the demands of customers and what they are looking for , advertisements are prepared according to customers usually .
For example , I decided to buy a mobile phone but not an expensive one two months ago .
I searched over the internet and came across with an advertisement .
In the advertisement they were claiming that , they sell the cheapest mobile phone .
When I clicked the link , a picture of the phone and price of it came to the screen .
There were also some technical details written with a small font .
On the screen of the phone in the picture , there is a coloured sailer picture and a blue sea .
I thought that the phone has a colored screen and immediately ordered one from the internet without reading the technical aspects because price was very good and it was a hot offer for that day .
Two weeks later my phone came and I realized that it does n't have a colored screen and also larger than the size shown in the picture .
I became shocked and immediately phoned customer relations .
They told me that there is a small note which says that there are two models for this phone and they put the picture of improved modal under the web page .

As you can understand this experience producers prepares advertisements according to customers and they do n't real reflect the real model
