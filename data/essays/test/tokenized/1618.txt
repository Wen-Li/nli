As to me , I prefer travelling alone to travelling in a group led by a tour guide .
The reason is that I can enjoy the travel without restriction and also can experience foreign cultures themselves .

First , if I travel alone , I can enjoy my leisure time fully freely .
The most frequent complaint of people who are travelling in a group is that they have little time for their free activities .
However , travelling alone can guarantee that you can go around anywhere you want to go and can stay there until you want to stay .
This is somthing that group travels can not offer .

Second , travelling alone provides more opportunities for travellers to experience other cultures .
If you have guides who can help everything you need , there is few chances to experience the region you are travelling .
On the other hand , if you do n't have such guides , it is you who have to communicate with the native people .
Through this interaction , you can really learn about the area and people in there .

All in all , I would like to choose travelling alone rather than travelling in a group with guides .
Not only can I enjoy the time freely , but also truely experience other cultures .
