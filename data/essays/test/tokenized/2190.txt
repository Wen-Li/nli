I do n't think you have to choose only one learning method .
That will be kind of radical .
Let 's better to develop an idea that probably would be more productive at the topic of learning .

For understanding the statement , let 's define with two word the methods of learning : `` theory and pratice '' .
Karl Marx in the 19th century developed some ideas about `` theory and practice '' and he supported that the best for learning , it 's to make a combination of this two concepts .

If I decided just to say which of the two words is more important , maybe I would be making a mistake .
I think that there is not a unique learning method that it tells you anything about a acknowledge .
One you get the acknowledge you need to practice what you learned .
That 's the part where the practice get intro the process .

I ca n't understand theory without practice and viceverse .
The schools are made for teaching students and the objective of this , it 's that after the have been in the classrooms the will be able to work and produce , for they bringing out something good to the society .
But some researcher have found that if they reforced the knowledge gotten in the classrooms with laboratories , practices and proyects , the learning proccess would be more effective .

Actually around the world researches , teachers , psicologist , have developed study methods .
These methods are now used in some Universities , and ther are effective .
If you had the opotunity of joining two or more different Universities ( of course not at the same time ) , you would distinguish between each method , and probably you would be able to choose the best method for your learning .
I recomend from my own expirience not to choose just one method .
