Throughout history , people who have been considered successful are those who took risks and decided to look for opportunities .
We know the masterpieces of the great inventors and artists , but behind that final object were many attempts that enriched the creative process and eventually led to success .

Had Colombus not tried to find a new way to India or risked falling over the edge of the world , the course of world history would have changed , and more importantly , no one would know who Columbus was .

Success obviously requires being proficient at some task , which in turn involves dedication and practice .
But proficiency is not enough .
Success requires being better than other people and discovering new ways to do things .

Modern art is a result of a group of people who , in their respective fields , decided to do things differently from the approved way .
In painting , academic painters were technical masters , but only those who risked new ways of painting and new materials are remembered today .

Only by proving ourselves and risking failure can we know and discover what our strenghts are and apply them .
By taking risks we improve the chances that one of them will pay off .
It is well known that the return to any project is directly related to the risk involved .

Only by taking risks can high returns be expected .
Trying new things has an important effect on a person 's state of mind .
Being subject to new ideas and experiences , even if unrelated to the task at hand , generates a creative process in the brain that enriches the way we do things and opens the possibility of new ideas .

In order to be successful we must strive to find what we are good at and perfect it .
This can only be achieved by trying out new things and taking risks , history proves it .
