I do n't agree with the statement , in my opionion , the traveling by myself is better than travel in group led by a tour guide .
Because I could be more freeable , I do n't need to pay more money and I may increase the ability of self-control .

First of all , if I travle by myself , I could have a more better plan , I thinks that is the most important reason for people to choose this way to travel .
In this way , firstly I could choose how to go to the place and where place to go to , I also could when to leave .
others , I do not need to go shopping be the ledding .
In many travel groups , they often take the people to buy some unuseful things , and then the guide will get the benefits from the shop .

Secondly , if I am not with the guide , I do n't need to pay for them .
In fact , we can buy some books to understand the history of the famous places , we do not have to ask the guide .
I believe the books will be more useful .
In the other hand , we could use the money to buy some other things .
I think it is better than giving money to guide .
Thus , I prefer to travel by myself .

The most important reasons is I can improve the ability of self-control , it means I need to kown a lot of the information about the place I will go , I need to understand the purpers of the travel , i need to plan all of the travel an I need to control the spend of money .
I think these are very crucial for myself .
This way also indicates I will be a manager to decision something .
If I do it well , I must have more confidence to face the life in future .
So , this way of travel carry more weight than another one .

To conclude , I think the travelling by myself has more adventages than those of led by guide.l could have own plan , I do not lose more money and I can get more ability , So I think that is my best choice to travel .
