I am convinced that advertisements make products seem much better because their objetive is to sell those products , in order to do that they have to maximize their qualities and minimize their flaws .

. Psychological issues
. Marketing issues
. Job related experience
As the daughter of a world renowned psychiatrist I undestood at an early age the importance of psychology in every aspect of our life .
As as Veterinarian , I tend to see things from a scientifical perspective exclusively leaving the emotional issues aside .
To work on this I have attended several workshops given by mental health specialist to discuss different topics from several view points .

During the last workshop the topic of if advertising was realistic or did it tend to make products seem better than they really are came up and Dr. Peterson the best psychologist in the country told us that people tend to look for miracle products or exilirs in order to relieve themselves of the responsability to use the products correctly , for example we tend to choose diet products that tell us we may eat everything we want and by using the product we will still lose weight eventhough that is a paradox .

As we all know advertising is one of the 4 basic points of the marketing mix .
Advertising is used to convince us that the product is the best , that we really need it and that although there are other brands , this one is the best and the cheapest .
They have gotten so good at it that they now tell us what to wear , where to buy it , what to eat , to name a few .

As I work for a international veterinary laboratory that sells different types of additives , biologicals and antibiotics , I have learned that advertising is essential to everything , mine can be that best product there is , but if I do not maximize its strenghts it will not sell .

With all the above I conclude that one of the main finalities of advertisements is to make products seem much better than they really are .
