I 'm totally agree with the statement expressed .

In fact , I truly think that people that do well something could do it better if they only do n't suppose the way known is the best one .

What I ' trying to explain is that who is satisfaied about , for example a job or an activity , in general use known and common methods to reach his satisfaction .

Otherwise who uses experimental ways to do things is usually a person that get in discussion current methods because he belives himself to be able to find a better one .
These kind of people always take the risk of their choices , often really discover better ways to do thiinks and so they have success .

I think that no one can has success if does n't belive in himself and does n't refused ways to do things learned from other people .
If you uniform yourself to what is commonly considered as well , you will never go beyond the limit of mass thinking and exploit whole your capacity in order to outstand the mass and so reach success .

For example , in art , impressionistic style was very uncommon for its age in wich realistic style was considered the best .
Impressionistic artist , trusting in themselves and completly unlinked from the common use of colors and paintings , demonstrated us a definitly better way to show human feelings and nature .
They took the risk and the win the challange with other painters of that period because they deeply trust in themselves and did n't give attenction to critics .
in definitive success depends by self trust
