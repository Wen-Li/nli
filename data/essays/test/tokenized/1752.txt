I do not think that there will be fewer cars in use than there are today , twenty years hence .
The number of cars in every country has been steadily increasing since the time cars came into use : this scenario is certainly unlikely to change .

One might consider the current state of the environment , as as a major reason as to why cars may become obsolete .
The pollution caused by the emission of the exhaust fumes from the petrol and diesel driven cars is surely a major cause for concern .
Moreover , concerned ctizens may also say that the loud honking of the car horns increases noise pollution .

However , in keeping with these considerations , car manufacturing companies have started making cars which run on electricity , solar energy or chemical energy ( battery operated cars ) .
These cars , though still small in number , are gradually gaining popularity among the concerned citizens .
The have been proved effective in reducing air pollution to a great extent .
Also , cars with softer horns are being manufactured and laws prohibiting blaring horns would definitely reduce noise pollution .

Though one may argue that with increasing developement , most cities and towns in many countries are getting better connected by well-developed and technologically efficient transport systems such as railways and airplanes and this could be a reason leading to fewer cars being used in the next twenty years , i fail to agree .
In my opinion , these days , everyone wants independence and space .
Everyone prefers to plan according to his or her own conveniences .
Hence , the usage of cars will not decline .
If a person owns a car , he can live by his own timings .
A car would provide flexibility in terms of time .
It definitely would provide more comfort and personal space .

Keeping these views in mind , i think that though the numbers of cars may not decrease in the next twenty years , however , the types of cars may change .
The cars produced then , would definitely be more environment friendly and technologically advanced and catering to the comfort of the individual .
