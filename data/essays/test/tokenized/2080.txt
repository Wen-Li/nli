I totally agree that most advetisements make products seem much better than they really are .
first of all the purpose of advertisements is to sell through a variety of very convincing arguments .
They try to answer questions like why you should buy my product .
How it is more important and has better quality than any other products on the market .
With competition being so high , the focus sometimes shifts to a more convincing advertisement as a mean to increase sell and therefore the advertisement exceeds the quality of the product .
Let consider Advil for example .
A Tv commercial for Advil usually protrays someone experiencing an intense pain .
The next clips of the commercial would show you that by taking one tablet of Advil the pain would completely dissappear .
Everybody knows very well that it does not work that way but in other to draw people 's attention to the product advertisements have to represent the product in a surreal way .
the advertisements in the motor vehecule industry are even more extravagant and surreal .
My favorite one is the toyota thundra commercial .
In this commercial a Toyota Thundra pick up truck is dropped over 100 feet from an higher elevation .
To everybody 's amazement the truck was still intact and without a scratch .
Other commercial would should cars driving over water , the most ragged terrain without any problems at all .
All those commercials are very misleading .
the portrayal of those products exceed their qualities .
Those car commercials far exceed the performance of those vehicule .
Even though peole are away of those fake computerized based commercials some would buy into them .
They help increase not only the performance of the product but the sell .
Some people would still believe and buy those cars with full awareness that the commercials or advertisements are misleading .
some would go as far as to say : `` their is nothing important on Tv anymore except the commercial . ''
In some ways they have an intertainment quality that drone people to them .
With absolute certainty I would say yes that advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .
