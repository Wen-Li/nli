In my opinion , it is more important for student to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts .
First af all , if students can understand ideas and concepts it is enough to take high scores on exams and students need to pass a lot of exam for along their whole life elemenetry school , undergraduate and garaduate studies .
they need to take standardized exams .
On these kind of standardized exams ask about ideas an concepts so students must know them .
In addiction , if the students understand concepts and ideas they can improve their knowledge on it and they can be successful .
