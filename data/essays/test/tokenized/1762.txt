Taking risk , and new innovative thinking is mandatory for success .
The person who ca n't take risk ca n't grow well , and get sucess .
Our history have plenty of examples that every sucessfull person have taken risk and thinked diffrently .
Our resercher , Scientist who have taken risk in experiment of failure or win , and many of then are sucessfull .
Thomus Edison , if he had n't taken risk and had n't try new thing then it would be difficult that bulb had been discovered .
Newton if he had not think about why n't apple fly up and came down then Newtons Low of motion had n't discoverd .
Like sciencetist , The businessman who have taken risk and thinked diffrently are sucessfull .
There are many businessman in the world but only who are sucessfull hav tahen risk and thinken problem in extraordinary manner .
Bussinessman like Bill Gates taken risk , and his company Microsoft has become world class company , This is due to his innovation , thinking diffrently , even though he belong to middle class family .
Like Bill Gates , Indian businessman Dhirubahi Ambani also think diffrently then comman people and his comapny Reliace beacome most reputed comapny of India , and his sons became most rich person in the world few time ago .

On the other hand comman people dos n't take risk so they are not much sucessfull .
From this I does n't mean that every people who will think differntly and will take risk will be sucessfull , on certain sage it depend upon one 's fate as well .
