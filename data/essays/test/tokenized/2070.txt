The best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide .
There are plenty of guided tours and travels around the world .
In most places , tourists look for a nice and relaxing journey .
Although normally hiring a guide represents an additional cost , guided travel contributes a significant cultural enrichment to the experience .

As a traveller , one does not take too much time into planning the site-seeing and other tours .
Taking the time to buy the city guides and information brochures on museums does not accomplishes the goal .
Some of the amazing things of travelling often rely in the details .
For example , a walk through the courtyard of a castle in England will definitely not be as amusing if noone tells you the details about who actually lived there .
People may even dare to imagine the tenacious fights that once occurred in the castle walls long ago .
The old folk stories about tourist sites revive the experience .

The time and places to visit will not always be balanced .
There are such places as Paris which one can not know for completely after one week of daily walks and museum visits .
Only those who live there will grow aware of the tours worthy of a pair of worned shoes and body aches .
A guide will propose the most amusing sites , the world-famous places and those local rare thrilling experiences .
I would rather pay some more money in a guide than spending plenty of time trying to completely know the Louvre Museum .
Anyone who takes part of such bold attempt will miss a great deal of Paris if he only had a week .
Definitely , a guide can provide the tour which best fits you interests .
In that way , one will go back home and feel relieved because he really knew Paris .
The best time invested during a travel is the one spent in a guided tour .

In conclusion , travelling is a matter of cultural enrichment .
To the eyes of a traveller , the sites will not evoke such experience like a guide would do .
The folk stories and well invested time gives us a sense of satisfaction .
There are such beauties in travelling that maybe one can not see by himself .
Sometimes one would like to share them and not be able .
Travelling in group led by a tour guide is an alternative that will prove every penny worth it .
