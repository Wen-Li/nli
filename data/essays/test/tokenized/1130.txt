I definitely agree that young people nowadays do not give enough time helping their communities .
In my opinion , young people totally forgot about their responsibilities about their community .
Nowadays , young people trying to be rich as soon as possible .
These are kind of television effect .
Their aim nowadays is get rich or die !
Why i think television has effect ?
Because young people watching watching much more tv and they are watching about celebrities life such as how they are having party , how big are their houses , how are making holidays . ..
This list may go so far .
And who ever watch it impress about their lifes and want to be rich .
So they forget their resposibility about their community .

Moreover we have one more problem ` loneliness` .
Young people growing up lonely and that causes big problem for community life .
I think children should grow up with a social vision .
This means they should learn the importance of friendship , sharing something , caring about someone .
In that way when children become young people they will know the importance of helping .

And one more is about parents .
Their responsibilities to show how te be a good , helpful and responsible person as child 's first teachers .
If young people see a goodness from their parents for example if the parents visit some old people caring house , or work on charity jobs , young people will learn about their responsibilities .

On the other hand , there is one more way to be helpful for our community .
Young people must be a succesful students as knowing that they are our future .
If they become succesful in their school , they will improve and change something in our country .
And improvement and difference in our country will affect our community in good way .

In conclusion , we all have responsibilities for our community
