Some people say that it is better to go on trip alone without a tour guide .
However , I do not agree that traveling alone is always beneficial for someone .
First , trip in a group led by a tour guide can be more convenient .
Second , It will be time-saving .

Above all , Traveling in group is convenient .
Of course , traveling alone can gives a poeple a sense of independence .
However , trip in a group led by a guide is more convenient than trip alone .
Let me take my last year trip to Erope can be an example .
When I was in the second of college , I decided to travel to Erope alone .
At first , I thought that I will be able to find where I am supposed to go by myself .
However , I will not be able to know How I have to go .
I did not know where place is good , which food is better .
I regreted that if I had traveled in group with a travle guide , I would have had convenient trip .
This shows that traveling in group with someone who know that place is very convenient .

Next , traveliing in group can be time-saving .
Some people argues that trip alone is effective .
However I disagree that it is time-saving .
Most of people go on trip to somwhere they never had experienced .
As a result , when people travel alone , he or she will use a lot of time to decide where they go to and what they do .
My parents ' last trip to America can be an example .
Their trip to US is first for them , so they decided to travel with a tour guide .
A guide helped them trip to more easily giving the useful informations about America .
After traveling , they talked me that It is more time and money saving because of a kind tour guide .
They were able to reduce expenses and time by doing so .

In conclusion , Traveling in group with a guide can be beneficial to travelers .
First , It ' convenient .
Second , it 's time saving .
