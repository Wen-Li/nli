It is a common proverb in my llanguage the one that says `` who never tries , will never make make it '' .
I try constantly and in a every-day basis to be as attached as I can to this prase .
Doing new things imply taking risks ; perhaps , in difficult situation .
Success , certainly , is not something that may come toward the persons leaving him/her with the only misconception that all it takes is going on the same old path , the one that everyone else transited .
The person who wants to succed needs to take risk , I believe .

The first point I would like to meet is that by doing things that you already know , pasing through the same path may take you to a situation where you would find yourself trapped in a rutinary , therefore boring situation that could ended up turning the individual into a inneficient part of the job environment .

Also , by trying to reach success based on what the person knows how to do `` superb '' , will not let her/him try new things in which she/he could presented great skill and / or enjoyment .
In other words , if you are used to work homogeniously throughout your whole life , you can be missing other practices .
For example , if you are really good at soccer but you are afraid that you will not do that well at basketball , and you later decide to give ypourself a chance the results could be even more suprising that youy expected .
perhaps , you are as good taht you are asked to joy the school team since yo didi so well basing your game in those abilities that make so good at soccer .

In addition , trying new things may supply the individual with more innovative ideas and more vast experience to reach the success he or she is looking for .
This means that by experiencing different environments and getting involved in , for example , different fields , different cultures or different stratus the perosn would obtain as am result geeting to know himself in a different a wider way .

For what It was stated before is understandable why I agreed with the notion of triyng new and innovative things in order to reach success .
Having been studying in Canda and been far Away my home provides you with the idea of what i 'm looking for .
nothing but success !!!!
