For a student is very important to learn fact of history , litterature , science , ecc .
But at the same tine is fondamental that the student understands ideal and concepts for make his own decision .

This is a big problem that tuches many international scholls , where teachers do n't care very much about what a student can `` absorve '' from a lesson or from a specific argument that the teacher is going over .

There is this problem because the professors are not payed enaught so they lose the `` hinspiration of teaching '' that consist on the dream to make a better future by teaching to the students the wright way to think and to make a choice .

For learn facts u have to study the history , and with it u have to understand the concepts and than you can be able to make a choice thinking .
Because is from the folts of the history that you can make a better future .
but if you do not know the history you will make the same mistakes that people made before you with no learning anything from tham .

An example of understanding ideals , is be critical when you read the news in the news paper .
So from there you are able to make a thought that will make you able to have a discussion with other people about the same topic .

So is better if students learn this as soon as possible .
In this way they will be successful .
