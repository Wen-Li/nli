Advertisements are a big part of our life .
We see them in the TV , on big boards and even on buildings and we are greatly influenced by advertisements in the way we see and think about that particular product that is being advertised .
It is very easy to think that a certain product looks much better than it is , just by the way it is presented in advertisements .
It can be misleading to solely believe in advertisements , because they may not be true .

The advertisements are prepared by the companies which produces the product .
They can not be objective on this product , because they want to sell and gain profit from it .
So the advertisement of a product may be prepared such that only the advantages or the good properties of the product will be pointed out and disadvantages or bad properties will be omitted .
Advertisements of fast-food companies are an example to this situation .
These advertisements only states how tasty their products and how much you would enjoy eating their products , but they never state how unhealthy their products are .

People are influenced more as they watch the same advertisement over and over .
Because we see an advertisement for product at least hundreds of times , we start to believe that the product has quality and it is a thing that we need .
It actually diffuses into our brain and after some time when you hear the name of that product , you have an urge buy that product .
Therefore if two companies produce exactly the same product and they make its advertisement but one company has more money to spend on more number of advertisements , the people will have a tendency to buy the latter product .
This is the way big beverage companies use to sell their product .
People see the advertisement of these companies so much that , whenever they are in a position to buy two beverages , they buy the product of the big company , thinking that it has more quality and taste .
