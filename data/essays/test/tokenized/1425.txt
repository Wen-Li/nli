Yes I am completely agree with the statement that effective way of representation or displaying produts would not only increses there demand in market but also make them better .
Afterall , many produts in the market are avaliable which might dont have featutes comply with the features shown in there advertisments .

User freindly grafics , computers , internet , televisions and news papers play an important role in advertising .
By useing grafics , colors and computer designing , advertisersnot only helps us to understand produts more deaply but also attracts potential buyers .

I want to qoute my personal experince .
My best freind want to buy cell phone not only because he likes its features but also attracted by the way it was represented in its advertisment .
He later founded that the cell phone he had purshached not satisfies his needs .

Some advertisments are meant to enhance the features which are avaliable in produts in order to make it more attractive and better .
Today , loads of money are being invested in advertising industries to make product more attractive .
Diffetent market policies and monetary methods are being used to make advertisment more grandoise .
Some advertisers hire famous personality like film stars , cricket stars , musicians and other sports stars in order to endorse their product effectivily .
Some people might buy these produts only because they like or admire their favrouits brand ambbasedors .

In India , some advertisments depicts our cultures and traditions in order to convey effective publicity of their product .
For example , HAMARA BAJAJ ( an automobile firm ) displjy true colors of India and simoultaniosly enhances their production .

Thus I want to make an statement -- whenever someone is goinging to buy produts , checks its features firts not its advertisment .
Beacuse sometime advertisment may coumoflages reality .
