The issue stated by the topic is that whether successful people try out new things and take risks rather than of doing things they how very well .
This issue is important because many successful people involve great scientits who are very well known for their valuable discoveries .
I firmly believe that successful people feel like trying newthings and taking risks .

Firstly i believe that successful people fell like trying new things and take risks because they are being motivated and inspired by their earlier task which had been a great success in their life .
Since their earlier task is been successfully completed without a failure they get movited to try out new things without any secondthought whether the new task will be a failure or success .
They feel like taking new risks inspires them to a great extent .

Additionally i believe that successful persons try out new things by taking risks to prove themselves more successful in life .
Their confidence levels get boosted due to their earlier taks and feel that they can be more successful by performing newthings .
Doing the things they are well equipped might be a boring task to them .
like performing a same expermient for a scientist again and agian is boring since he already gained a test result of that experiment .
A new experiment will be a inspiring task to him since he has not before and he will be quite curious to know about the new test he is performing with .

Finally i agree that successful people take the challenges of new tasks and risks rather than doing what already they know to perform well because they would like to compete with others .

Today in the world everyone are competing with another to prove themselves .
They would like to discover new things by taking risks so that their product gets recognised in the market .
And also they will be honoured for that task .

In conclusion i state that some events are thogh associated with risks successful persons feel like performing the task .
since with out taking risk certain things cant be performed like spending money on bussiness is a risk task .
But the results may be more better that bussiness person may gains more profit than the amount he invested .
