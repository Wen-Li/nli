I agree with the statement `` Successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well '' .
I start by defining success as having a personal , emotional , monetary or creative gain in any aspect of life .
I believe that risks takers have the chance to test new ideas and accomplish their personal dreams , whilst people who do not take risks pick the safer choice which is to keep doing what they are used to do .
They do not pursue their fantasies and therefore will never get to know if their dream would have been successful .
For example a person working in a bakery , who knows how to do well a certain pastry and never tries to open his own store .
He does not take the risk , thus he will never know if his dream would work , and will never be successful while he keeps doing his job even though he is very good at it .

People who do not take risks are afraid of failure , since doing what they do brings such stability to their life they do not feel the need to change .
However taking risks even though they could end in failure , that failure would teach you new lessons in life , it would give you new experiences .

Risk takers can develop ideas , deepen concepts and improve their technics , since taking that extra step will create a whole new set of possibilities which will give them not only personal and emotional gain but also will widen their creativity .
For example , pursueing a singing carreer instead of just being a singing teacher .
If that person would try to record a cd , may be she would even end up meeting new singers , band memebers , people from the music industry who could help her singing , give her tips and even widen her scope and introduce her to new rhythms .
That way by taking a risk , she has a personal and a creative gain , and she could even improve her vocal capacity .
If she had not taken that risk she would still be a teacher , teaching the same class for the rest of her life with no possibility of growth or success .

In conclusion i think that risk takers are capable of gaining many positive experiences , by following their dreams .
They will not be left with the doubt of whether that idea would have worked or not , and even though they are more exposed to failure , that failure comes along with valuable lessons that will help them in future situations , that in itself determines success in an aspect of life .
Thus risk takers have more probabilities of having personal gain , and therefore be successful , than a person who picks the safer choice .
