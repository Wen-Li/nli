yes really i agree with this argument the media is the main reason for this problem .
hence the telivision shows and paper advisiments are doing their business for their commercial reasons .
any one can go and advatise his products in telivision programs by giving money .
The manager wont see the quality of the product and he advatises in his channel .
My personel experience on this is once i am thinking to buy a refrigator .
and i am thinking of which brand to take at that time i am watching the television in that the advisiment came on the refrigator .
I watched it and byed that refrigator withen one month it got repaired there is no warranty for that brand .
Simpley by this advisements daily nooff people are getting tefted by the dealers .
In my view government should only rectify this problem by keeping some strict rules for advising .
The rules must be like this .
Government should keep some gradings to the products , the product must be checked by highley trained proffisionls , then only the product must be released into the market .
government should also give gradings to compinies , and also any advitisiment which is been viewd in telision or printed in news paper must be registred .
then only it has to be viewd or printed in paper .
by this process The products see better than the advisiment .
Lastly in my view i really agree with this question .
