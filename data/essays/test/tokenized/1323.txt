I partly agree with this statement .
I think that there are a lot of problems with fuel as the main source of energy for cars nowadays .
This will get much worse in the next couple of years .
That 's why there have to be some solutions to solve questions of pollution and energy requirement .
Cars belong to our dayly routine like coffee and bread , so there has to be something instead .

I believe that there could be different sources of energy for keeping cars going , like the sun or even wind or electricity .
If that happens , the prizes for those new cars would raise immidiatly to an incredible hight .
So in such a time there could be much fewer cars then nowadays , because most the people would n't be able to effort a new one like that .

But I do n't think like this for a long term objective because technical developments always become cheeper after a while .
So after a few years our cars , as we know them now would just be replaced by another type of them .

Another , I guess much better possiblity , would be to reform the public transport system worldwide .
Of course there would be a huge number of problems to face , but it would be much better for the enviroment and also for the living conditions in `` melting pots '' like New York or even Berlin .
If there are electric subways and cable cars available at each time of the day , a car would n't even be necessary anymore .
At least in big cities .
Also if it would be safer to go by bike through the streets it could be possible to have fewer cars in a few years .
But I do n't really think people want that , because they are spoiled of indipendence with a car and do n't really face the problems with it .
But I guess if the prizes for a reformed public transport would be lowered and it could be a relyable alternative , then it would work to get the cities free of cars after a while .

But that does n't count for little villages or hidden areas somewhere far away from a town .
Because without a transportation possibility , people there would n't really have a chance to live on theyr own .

So after all I think there wou n't be much fewer cars then today .
Hopefully I am wrong and there will be at least different ones , but I do n't believe in it for certain .
