Can you imagine an old lady standing in front of an really expensive mashine which had just destroyed her oldest book , telling you that it was said in the advertisement that this mashine could clean everything without harming it ?
This situation happens more often than you might think .
Often you can not relay on what is said in the advertisement .

I have seen a good example for lying in advertisment in China .
There was an advertisment for loosing weight .
The principle was to wear special socks that forces your body to give away the fat , in the television one was able to see white socks before they were worn by a person , the same socks , after the person walked with them for a while , were completly dirty and dark .
The advertisment said that this is the fat , the person has lost .
No educated person can belive such supid things , because we learned in biology that this is impossible .
This is an extreme example , but there are plenty of daily life examples .
A good example is washing powder , there are thousands which promise you to help you to get the dirt out of your clothing and to protect them from getting dirty again .
And although you tried them all , none of them persuades you entirely .

Another fact is the outward aspect of goods shown in the advertisments .
There are a lot of tricks , the producer uses to put the product in the right light .
For example a holiday resort which is , according to the advertisment directly allocated at a white beach , is in reality at least 500 meters away from the beach .
The fotograph only makes you thing that is much more closer .

To summ it up , one can say that everyone should always be really carefull concerning what one sees in advertisments , because there are plenty of possibilities producers can use to make the viewer think what he wants him to think about a product .
And this will always be better than the product in fact is .
