The globalization our world is experiencing means the victory of the global , the era of diffusion at a great ladder .
This is posible through medias that permit the diffusion of the data .
This is the undenying power of these medias that entails the great number of advertisements today , especially in the western world .
The main problem with most of thses ads is the fact they make products seem better than they really are .
Indeed , this is the purpose of advertsing .
But the second point is to say that this phenomena can be dangerous .
Thirdly , a careful behavior is necessary .

First and foremost , this is the purpose of advertisers to make the products they promote better than they actually are .
Companies pay them to study the demand for a special good , and then to draw up how to present this good to the consumers .
Obviously , the final goal is to make them buy it .
Advertisers have various means of promoting the product , and various medias to transmit it to a large audience .
The means consist mainly of giving all the advantages of the good and of putting its drawbacks on the back burner .
The advantages can as well refer to technical , healthy or even mental qualities .
For instance if the product is milk , its nutritive qualities would be put forward as much as the feelings of well being it is supposed to imply .
Advertisements are everywhere : on TV , on the radio , in the streets . ..

This message , sometime deceptive , can become dangerous .
Indeed , it is getting hard to choose between the products , and the consumers are more and more influenced by what they hear or see .
Thus , many advertisements may foster new needs , which are not needs actually , but people get addicted to it .
This can be the case for instance with branded clothes .
These ads can also cause educational problems .
Indeed , children do believe in these false needs , while they are not learned important values .

This entails the necessity to have a careful behavior .
It is important to learn keeping a distance from TV , not watching it too much .
The consumers should try to be careful with these advertisements which only appeal to their feelings .
It could be also useful to draw other criteria of choice than the ad we have seen .
These criteia are obviously the price , but it can be the composition , the origin of the product concerning fair trade .

As a conclusion , advertisement influence a lot our decisions , sometimes in a bad extent .
This is why we need to pay attention to this fact , and to keep our own master .
