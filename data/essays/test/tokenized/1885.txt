A group led by a tour guide is not my favorite way for traveling .
I think this depends a lot on the kind of person who is traveling , because many people find them useful and practical .
Even though a guide has a lot of knowledge , they are too strict on the itineraries and do n't let you focus on whatever interests you the most .
I think this kind of travelling is more for people who worry a lot on timing and having things strictly according to plans , but I am not that kind of person .
I like to be free to do whatever I like , whatever interests me and comes to my mind at that time .
This is why I prefer lo lead my own tour , obviously with the help of maps and information about all the new places I am visiting .
Another thing I do n't like about the group led by a tour guide is that you have to be all the time with the same group , and for me it can sometimes be annoying .
I like to be spontaneous , and decide on the last minute looking at my options what I want to do .
When I traveled to Europe , with my mom , we had a train pass that was valid for a month I think , so we could go anywhere we wanted and on the date we wished .
We already had seen some places we wanted to go , so we booked a couple of hotels with the approximate date , just to have a safe place to stay .
The plans changed a lot during the trip and we went places that were n't on our plans , amazing places We usually guided ourselves with the `` michelin '' guide that gave us the most important information .
This was the best trip ever , I got to visit many cities and got to know many places on my own itineraries .
I like traveling alone and based on my interests , I do n't like groups or guides .
