I think that successful peopel have different views and action patters .
That 's why they can seccess .
So that , the Views and action patters should not be same as things that most people know and be old .

For example , Bill gates , Microsoft 's CEO , is well-known for the inovator of the software .
He dropped the college to strat his own business with his new ideas .
If he did not try to create new software and take risks to fail his business , and stayed his status , the inovation and developent of the software could have been delayed .
Defenately , he had different views to see the things and action patterns , and now , he is the richest person in the world .

In my point of view , major characteristics of success are prior visions and the propulsion , which the idea is taken into the action .
The prior vision means that the possibilities to see things that most people can not recognize .
It must be new .
For example , couple of years ago , the karaoke became a very popural entertainment in Korea .
The karaoke was originally famous in Japan .
When a business man visited Japan , he thought that it had could make money for him .
He created the Korean style karaoke , and it was very big hit .
After all , he was considered as a person who had a prior vison , but at that time , he also had risks to fail that idea .
There is a saying , `` information every body know is not information any more . ''
Especailly , these days it was called as the flood of information .
I believe that people who want to be successful have to find out new things and ideas that nobody ever try to .
Even though there are many risks , depends on how to control and operate the things , risks can be reduced .
