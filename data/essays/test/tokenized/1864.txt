In the modern society almost all companies rely on advertismets to promote thier products or serveces .
This makes adverisments companies to whatever they can , to make products or serveces apeal to the consumer .
Because of that , there is a big debate wheater adevertisments make products seem much better than the really are .
In my opinion , I gree with people .
who say advertisments make products seem much better than they really are , for many reasons .

The first reason is that , they show only the possitive side of the product .
Thus , these comopanies decieve people and not showing the other side .
For instance , a clothes soap company might decieve people by only saying that this product can clean all hard dirts in your clothes , and not showing that it may spoil some kind of clothes .
In addition , these companies decieve people by exagurating on the positive side of the product .
For example , I saw a commercial about an acne treatment .
In this commercial they says , this treatment cures any one who is suffering from acne .
In fact , I bought this product and I tryed it , but it did not help me .

Another reason is that , many companies prefer to target childern because they can be decieved easly .
Thus , these companies put a lot of advertisments in cartoons on T.V .
In fact , these advertisments are not only on T.V .
They are everywhere in the roads billboards to target childern .
There is a strong evedince to support that if you look at the new generation of childern , you will recognize how they differ from the older ones .
These childern love the phrase `` I want '' .
They ask thier parants for many things .
All of that because of the decieptive advertisments , which target childern .

Overall , these companies love mony more than any thing else , which makes them decieptive .
They decieve people by exaguration and not saying the side effects of the product .
In addition .
They have created a new generation of childern , which these childern ask parents for a lot of products to buy , by targeting them in thier deciptive advertisments .
