I agree with the statement that it is important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts .
I think so because I feel that ideas and concepts play a more important role in further education than learning facts without understanding the underlying facts .

Concepts play a very important role in building up the future of a student .
Knowing the concepts from each level of education helps the student understand the complex ideas which are built up these basic concepts and ideas .
If a student does not have an understanding of the basic concepts and ideas he will not be able to going any further in learning the subject .
Only with the understanding of the concepts and ideas will the student be able to think of his own ideas based on them .
For example , if an electrical engineering student doesnot understand the basic concepts on which the kirchoff 's laws are stated he will not be able to understand or solve any of the circuits , whose analysis is very important for designing and sythesizing an electrical network which the student will have to do later in his course .

Although learning the facts is also as important as understanding the ideas and concepts , learning the facts will be of no use or the student may not be able to retain what he has learned if the student doesnot have a good idea of how these facts are established and what are the underlying concepts that led to the confirmation of these facts .
Without knowing the concepts the student may not be able do dany further research to improve the existing models of the ideas .

Hence for all the above stated reasons I believe that it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts .
