From my perspective , it is true that successful people try new things and are willing to take risks rather than limit themselves to doing what they already are able to do well .

It is fundamental to recognize that the chances of being successful are significantly increased by trying new things , since the potential opportunities provided by an effectve invention are most probably higher than with persisting things .
A good example in this context is the Bill Gate 's creation of computer operating system `` Windows '' .
This new technology provided personal computer users with a formerly unknown measure of effectiveness in how to operate their computers .
Accordingly , this `` invention '' enabled an effective and straighforward usage of computers , a fact that drove demand for this product to an enormous level .
As a consequence increased sales of Microsoft Windows drove the success of Bill Gates .

By simply sticking to and slightly modifying the persisting MS DOS technology Bill Gates would have not been able to have such a great impact and such a high level of success .

Furthermore , successful people are better in dealing with risks .
When risks can be handled in an appropriate way they would not limit the winning-potential of new things to an extent they could do .
Correspondingly , if risks can be managed and limited , the incentivation for not doing new stuff is lower .
Let us imagine a project involving the construction of an entirely new type of bridge - spanning a much larger gap and being much more filigrane than any other bridge before .
A good project management would always have various ways and tools to manage and reduce risks .
For instance , a detailed and accurate time plan for the management of time risks .
In addition effective project managers also have created contingency plans of what to do when certain planned processes fail to work .
By having tools that at hand the level of risks can be reduced in such a way that the project success can be facilitated .
