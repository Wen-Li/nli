In general , I agree with this assertion that advertisement make products better .
However , in some cases , it harms the reputation of the products as well .
My points of view about this issue based on the analysis below .

Of course , in order to sale more products , most companies are using advertisements to stress the advantages of their products , It always works in a positive way .
It not only lets the customers know more about it but also fire their desires .
For example , SK2 , which is a famous brand Japanese makeup , lets Zhang Zhiyi to make its advertisement .
As we all knows , Zhang , a beautiful woman , offers a chance to this company to make a great profit in China .
By this advertisement , people will think this makeup will allow them have similar skin as Zhang does , since Zhang said in the advertisement she used it everyday .
As a result , the income of the company in China is amazing .
Hence , advertisement can always give a perfect image to the people watching it .

However , some advertisements actually act in a opposite way .
Once a company , a traditional Chinese food maker , used a advertisment which claiming its production has wonderful effects in improving the children 's brain .
And also , it contains certain substance which celebrated in China .
Nevertheless , the second day newspaper points out the substance mentioned in the advertisment has not been verified yet .
It could be harmful .
So most Japanese stop from using it .
After several monthes this products disappeard in Japanese super market .
This illustrates the point that the advertisment which is not well organized or the quality of products are uncertain , the effect is negative .
In a word , not all of the advertisments can lead surprising results to the producers .

To sum up , althugh sometimes the advertisement can make the products much better than they really are , it can also make undesirable to the maker based on the qualities of both the advertisement and the products .
