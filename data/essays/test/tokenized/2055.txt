Although today education systems pay a lot of attention in the learning of facts , it is also important for students to understand abstract ideas and concepts , and not only to memorize data .
It must be addressed , that both activities are needed in the formation of knowledge and the development of education .

Education is mainly based on the practice of the studied theory .
Humans learn as they practice , one will not make knowdledge it 's own if concepts have not been practiced .
Not even the most capable student can learn how to play a musical instrument only by seen it on a presentation , the music student must also spend long hours practicing how to play the accurate tunes and notes .

In the same way , all math students have to do home work to gain practice an understand the concepts of calculus , if they just learn by heart the facts around math they will not be able to solve a single exercise on a test .

Memory plays an important role in the development of a student education but in the long run memorized facts will end up been forgotten .
On the other , when a student understands a concept , he or she would not forget it right away and perhaps would hold it for the rest of his life .

On the other hand , learning facts is essencial to understand abstract concepts , and the understanding of concepts is as well required for the developing of knowledge .
It would be impossible to understand abstract concepts , if there are no basic facts to lay the basis of knowledge .
As a matter of fact , to learn any phiscal phenomena students must have basic formulas as a given .
Newton 's laws are needed to learn about bodies in motion , and these laws are basically memorized .

Both activites complement each other and should not be separated or in the rush of disputing importance in education , both should ride together in the path of knowlegde
