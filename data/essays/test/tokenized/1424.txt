I agree with this statement .
In my opinion it gives you many advantages to have a broad knowledge in many academic subjects .
First having knowledge in various different areas allows you to be more flexible .
The advantage of this is shown for example at finding a job .
When you are specialized on just one specific subject , and in this area there are n't too many jobs available , you have a huge disadvantage compared to those who have the broader knowledge , since they can just switch to some other area , and be as successful .

Another important argument is that knowing stuff in various subjects improves your skills in problem solving .
Since you are taught in various areas , and know many ways to solve problems you can think outside the box , increase your knowledge and evaluate problems much easier than people who are based on one subject and decreased with their possibilities and ways on solving the same problem .
Because the people who have a broad knowledge can apply to higher thinking skills , with combining their knowledge , and thus have a higher chance that in their knowledge there might be a similar problem they already had solved .

People who have a broad knowledge can be sure that they wo n't find the problem of not liking there proffesion anymore .
What if the person who specialized almost all his life on studying and specializing on one academic subject does n't like his subject anymore ?
What if he finds out that there is something else , something he would be more interested and better in than his specialized area ?
This can be a destructive problem , that people who have a broad knowledge do n't have .

In the end I want to conclude that in today 's world people with broad knowledge are more in favor of getting a job in a leading position compared to people who are specialized on one subject .
Since today 's world is very flexible it also needs managers and leading people who are as flexible .
Having a wide knowledge increases your chances in the present time .
