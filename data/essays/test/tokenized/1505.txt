The issue about admertisement making products seem much better than they are misleading the consumer is a controversial one .
On the one hand some people argue that advertisement oversells the products , magnifying their characteristics and benefits .
On the other hand some people agree with the purpose of advertisement that is to communicate a product 's benefits , and the need for the companies to effectively communicate these features .
On a final analysis I believe that advertisement is controlled and regulated and it is needed to inform the consumer .

I disagree with the statement , because I believe that advertisement is needed to communicate the features , characteristics and benefits of products and services .
One reason why I disagree with the statement is that there are a lot of competition from products or services , and a consumer has to make an educated guess , and their only source of information comes from advertisement .
Thus the importance of showing the benefits of what the companies are selling to meet the consumer needs .

Another reason why advertisement does not mislead consumers is that there are a lot of regulations regarding adds and claims .
A company can not make a claim on a product or service that is not true or that is misleading .
In Mexico the Federal Consumer Insitute , a govenment agency regulates every add , and package and reviews all the claims .
Competitors can ask this agency to review some of the claim of other products , and if the agency finds that it is not true , misleading or it can not be proved then the agency will take away the product or service from the market .
there are a lot of examples in adds controversy in Mexico , like when a company that sold detergent saying that it will remove every stain from the clothes , after the consumer agency reviewed it decided take away the advertisement from TV or any other mean of communication .

Finally consumers are smart , they do not believe everything they see or hear , they are exposed to so much advertising that even if one claims a message that is not true or misleading , the consumer will notice and will not buy that product or service , so the company will not gain the confidence of its comsumer prospect and eventually go out of business .

In summary advertisements are necessary to communicate the benefits of products and services and there are ways to control them in order to make sure they not oversell benefits and mislead the consumer .
