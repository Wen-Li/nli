This statement raises the issue of the specialization from an academic angle .
It seems to me that having wide knowledge of several academic subjects must be the uppermost of my mind ,

To begin with , we must bear in mind that , nowadays there is constant globalization around the world .
This phenomenon is responsible for new requirements from people .
It is essential for students to be prepared for many different situations .
Indeed , scholars who have studied the evolution of the working market , predict that future generations of workers must be ready to change around ten times their work during their entire life : hence the necessity to dispose of several options in case your employer puts an end to your current job .

Besides , I intend to work in management , and it stands to reason that good managers should be able to deal with all kinds of situations , which will not possible for a specialized manager .
My aunt used to do data reconfiguration in a big company .
Once , she had the opportunity to sign up for a 4-week-program to learn how to use a computer .
Back then , she believed that there would be no use in considering applying for the program .
A few years later , the development of computer softwares made her look useless in the company , once she realized that , she quit .
There can be no shadow of a doubt that it was very difficult for her to find a job afterwards .

Moreover , when you keep studying several academic subjects , you still have the possibility to focus on one of subject you are particularly interested in .
To sum up , i would tend to think that having broad knowledge of several academic subjects would be the best to succeed in the current context .
However , far be it from me to insinuate that specialized workers would not find a decent job .
