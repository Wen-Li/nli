In the market people will find many types of products and also many brands of the same products .
It is important to realize this , because when some advertisements are delivered to our house , much of the quality and characteristic will depend of the brand and the way the product is promoted .
For that reason I agree with the statement that Most advertsiments make products seem much better than they really are .

When someone checks the advertisements looking for a specifical product , first he looks if is the proper product , then he compares the price and then itis possible to look for other things like color and size .
However , when this person goes to the store in order to buy the product and the seller shows the product to him , he realizes that the product look different maybe smaller or wider than the one in the brochure .
For instance , last mont i wanted to buy a Laptop and I saw a very nice one on a local store of my city .
I checked everything , the memory RAM , the video card and the hard disk capacity , but when I reached the place the Laptop was enormous it seemed like a desktop computer , but in the brochure when someone saw it , the Laptop had the same size apparience as a small notebook .
At this moment i understood why this store had offered this price such a very great bargain .
Another good example is when you buy things by internet .
Sometimes , sellers do not put the real photo of the product , instead of this , they attach other brand new product photo .
Therefore , the person who wants the item buys the product and pays with his credit card , after two or three days the product arrives and the buyer realizes that this product is different to the seller 's advertisement .
Last summer , i wanted to buy some specific brand of sunglasses and i found this glasses in the internet , i bought it and when the sunglasses arrived , it was true that it had the same model but the brand was a different from I selected .

Thus , I believe that this statement is true and I strongly agree with it .
It is important for sellers to change their way of promoting their products .
Until this , I will always prefer to go to the store and see the product before buying it .
