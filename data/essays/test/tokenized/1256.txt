Yes student should understand ideas .

Student should know the concepts behind it .

Student s the upcoming creater .

To know idea and consept behind it is essential for student .
we know that `` half knowledge is danger '' because without knowing idea & concept his knowledge is not complete .
student is lerner he need every thing about it .
he should come to know what it is why we r using it .
then only he sucseed in his feeld .

for exeample if we take an Enng field if he dont know the actual purepus of a paticllar disign he cont rectify any fault in that .
if he know the purpose he can find the faults .
by knowing idea & consept student may do further developments in his field .
he can add his adeas to incres the performence of the paticlar design .

In my own expeeriance i faced a problem with an mechine the thing it need is not availbe at the location even thow i sloved the problem .
becasue i know the consept to start the mechine and i have the idea about the working of it .
one simple exeample is that with out using ignition key u can starte a engine if u konw the consept how its works .

Every student must know the idea and consept what they are lernig .
then it will pullfill there knoldge and gives satisfaction .
