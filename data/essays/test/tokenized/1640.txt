With the way technology is advancing today cars surely do not seem to be the norm of tommorow .
The ever increasing traffic jams and road block have led to irritation among people and diverted their choise of transportation .

With the advancements in technology , smaller and more efficient machines and equipments are being developed every day .
This trend is most likely to spread to our vehicles too .
Who would want to move about in 3 ton vehicles in the 22nd century ?
Infact , people have already started getting irritated by the traffic jams and road blocks which take away a majority of their time .
But , of course , we have no choise .
Maybe this will not be the cenario a few decades later .
Given an option I surely would never waste hours driving to work or back home .

With the advent of wireless technology , everything is available at fingertips and it is predicted that future will see more and more people working from home rather than go to the offices .
Also , home service systems are developing and even today many people just order thier food , clothes or accesories right at home .
So if you can do just about everything by simply switching on your computer then very few people would opt to travel in order to get these facillities .

Moreover , is n't the metro system developing rapidly ?
With the reduced cost of travelling by trains or other modes of transportation , I firmly believe the importance of cars will reduce dramatically in future .
Then again , is n't it more convenient to use transports where you do not have drive ?

The future also promises to bring new gadgets and machine which we can not even think of today .
Perhaps a device which can help you travel to any place on earth within moments will be devolped .
Maybe something like the information travels through wireless or maybe asomething like a timemachine which just needs a click of button to take you anywhere you want .
But for now we can only wait and watch .

In contrast , to reducing needs of using a car as a means of transportaion , there will always be atleast a few of those crazy about cars .
These people will make sure that cars do not become a history .
Those who just love driving these four wheeled motor vehicles will surely use it , if not merely as means of transportation but as a luxury or fancy item .
A perfect example of such car crazy men are those who collect the old modeled cars of 1850s and 1900s .
They do this certainly not because they ca n't afford better tranportation as these cars are far more expensive than those available in market today .
So Why do they do it ?
The answer is simple , extreme love for cars .

To sum up , i would say that even though the number of cars in the future are going to decrease we may never see a complete extinction of the most prefferable and widely used means of travel today .
