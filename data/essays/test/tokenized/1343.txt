The statement faces the question how much advertisements polish up products .
Since the quality of a product is one important point during the process of decission to buy a product or not , advertisement helps the customer to find the product more attractive .
Therefore , an advertisement that make a product seem much better than it really is , is a convincing advertisement .
A advertisement that do not make a product seem much better or attractive , would be useless .
A second dimension is to take in regard the number of persons reacting to the advertisements .
Beyond this mass , there is a subset of people strongly affected by the advertisements , whereas another subset remain unaffected .
Knowing the relation between these two groups and the total sum of advertisement would help us to clarify the question if the proposed statement is correct .
However , the companies and advertisement agencies posess many statistics on clients ' reaction and the overall amount of money put into advertisement .
The fact that a big part of the companies ' budgets is for advertisements , as we all know , clearly suggests that advertisement in general is very effective .

Therefore , I agree with the statement that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are , but also indicate that in certain cases advertisement fails to polish up a product .
