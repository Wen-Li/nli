It is always good to travel in groups under the guidance of a guide as group touring provides you with a great accompaniment and relieves you from the planning tensions .
Surely , it saves a lot of time in identifying the worth visiting areas .
On the contrary , touring without a guide and good company or alone may be boring and often there will be a possibility for detouring becuase you do n't have a person who is familiar with the locations .

One may think that touring without a guide may be more adventurous and provides greater thrill to your venture of touring to unknown places .
But what we think new may turn out to be very well known place to many other people .
By the time that we reach a place that is picturesque our feeling of discovery may become a trivial trial on seeing the other people who reached there with a little effort under the direction of a professional guide .

If we are not familiar with the touring places we obviously tend to waste a lot of time , money and energies that can be utilized to view more worthier places .
When we do n't know the worth of a place we need to know the worth from either text books on that place or from the people who live there or otherwise from understanding the inscriptions on the rocks .
Many a time it is impossible to us to decipher what was writtent on it because of the linguistic as well as sementical constraints .

So in order to avoid all these predictble disturbances and wastagew we can utillize our resources effectively by employing a tour guide who can give us a lot of information about the places that we tour and if it is required we can extend the thrill of our tour by extending it to someother unknown places , the information about which also can be obtained from the tour guides and so I certainly support the given statement .
