In my opinion it is true that nowadays young people do n't give enouh time to helping their communities .
I think that now young people are busier than some years ago .
They also don ' t have enough time to do their own activities !
For exemple I am a student and a go to university : it took me all of the time that I have : I go to university every day and when a do n't go to university I have to study so much that it is not possible for me to give my time to my community .
I would like to do this , but I ca n't .

However , this - do n't have time to do anything - is not the only reason .
Nowadays young people are interested in other things and many times they prefer doing these than helping their community .

So I agree with this statement : as a young girl that I am I have to admit the existence of that negative behavior .
I do n't like this , I think that is wrong but , at the moment , I ca n't do anything to change it .
However I really hope that when I finish the university I will have more time to help my community .
