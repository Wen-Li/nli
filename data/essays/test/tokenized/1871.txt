I agree with the opinion that most advertisements makes products much more better than thay really are for the following reasons .

First , this '' believe '' sounds quite logic beacuse the firm that created the product wants to have the biggest benefit as possible , therefore it accepts to '' tell lies '' to people to achieve this goal .

Second , by adopting this method the firm does n't violate any legal rules , at least for many kinds of products .
In fact there is no rule stating that what you tell about a product needs to be prooved , except in cases of pharmaceuticals on other products of this type .
For example , to create e commercialise an advertisement showing that a perfum can render a man irresistible you do n't need to make a resarch and obtain certain findings to proove it , you can simply tell it .

That 's a good point for firms to adopt this method .

Third , there is a lot of present researches focused on finding the best ways to controls minds .
These area of research is called '' commercial neurosciences '' and it is trying to find out how to manipulate the brain of people and to convince them that a certain product is good and is valuable to buy it .

Finally , the firm does n't risk anything by presenting the product better than it really is .
In fact the nice and positive image given will increase the number of people that are curious and want to try it and if it will works , meaning people will continue to buy it , it is good .
On the other hand , if people ar enot happy once tested the product , they will just stop to buy it but nothing dramatic wil happen to the firm .
