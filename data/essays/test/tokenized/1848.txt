I believe , that many advertisements do display the features of a product in a fairly too positive way .
From my point of view , there is a variaty of reasons why this is the case .

Frist the main obejctive of an advertisement is to attract people 's attention be any means .
A normal product we use in our everyday life normaly does not provide that , because it is just too ordinary .
Therefore the creative people in marketing deparments who produce these advertisements need to put something special to the product .
This might be a product feature which is a bit exagerated ( in comparison to other product in the relevant market segment ) or a feature which is not neccesaryly combiened with this product .
A problem of this strategy is probably , that costumers may change their to a product of a competitor , if their expactations are not met .
But from my perspective this risk is fairly low , because all costumers known that every company acts the same way .
Therefore the clients usually do n't expect to recieve a 100 % of what is said in the advertisement .

Second : Since many companies in the market try to get someone 's attention , the advertisements may show a tendency of getting a little bit more extreme from time to time .
This gets obvious if you compare advertisments in television during the 60 's with today .

So companies do have a real advantage if there ad 's are just a little more recongnised as the ad 's of competitors .
This a kind of a ` herd movment ' in the whole advertisment industry .

I think , there are a lot of good arguments in favour of my point of view .
