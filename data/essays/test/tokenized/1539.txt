I do agree with the statement because I am convinced that advertisments are created with the intention of not only promote specific charateristics of a product , but create expectations in the mind of the consumers .
This expectations are what in the end , lead the decision of the consumer , and without this expectations , the consumers will not be convinced about why expend their money in one product or another .
So the creation of a better image definetly is the main objective of the advertisments .

I remember to have analysed this situation of why does the advertisments make look to a product much better than what they realy are .
when I studied business administration at Universidad de las Americas , a global and higly international Mexican College , and I felt that the program apporaches social issues in a very broad and comprehensive manner .
Nevertheless , I felt form the start of the program that understanding of social issues would be useful to improve my general management in the human factor .
Thus , I enroll in some courses delving into the complexities of the mind and how does it affects every activity undertaken .

This led me to study the works of Dr. Jose Carroza , a famous Spanish sociology that discussed the topic at lenght .
He make seceral studies related to the impact of advertisment in potential customers .
He was very interested in knowing wheter a customer will buy a product just by the objective characteristics .
His research concluded that even if a product could performance better than others , it will not be buy by the customers .
He demostrated that a good advertisment can sell more of a product that does not perfom as good as another ones .

In my own experience , I have been also witness of the observation that good advertisment sells when it presents large expectations for a product .
Working as a project director for Grupo Aitex , a major Real State Developer with public and private concerns has exposed me chanllenging situations not only related to technological , business , industry and economic situations , but related also to the people with whom I closely work .
This exposure has broadened my mind understanding on how does different backgrounds and experiences affects everyones decisions and has also helped me in seeing situations from different perspectives before making a decision .

I remember one time when I was able to prove the efficieny of making an advertisment campaign for a new project of 500 flats .
At that time my boss explained to me the importance of making high expectations for the target market , because as he said `` the success of the future sells depends on how much we could encourage the people to come to our new project . ''
The impact of the campaign was so sucessful that we stablished a new record on sales .
I will never forget the impression of that experience produced just because of an advertisment .

But the impact of a good advertisment is not just local , as I had the opportunity to discovered in many of my trips around the world .
Many of my most important memories are related with travelling , not only to major cities , but to the richness and fabulous diversity of my beautiful country Mexico .
In my travels , I had taken time to chat with the locals about different situations , and I remember one time when I was in India taking dinner with a group of people from diferent countries and we were discussing about the impact of publicity in our perception to some products .

We were recalling one television spot from the Gillete company that was promoting the razors for me .
With the group , we discussed about how that advertisment was spread all over the world , and it was amazing to discover about its impact .
All the people that were gathered that day concluded that we had been affected by that advertisment in the same way , but in different countries .
That experience proven to me that the impact of the advertisments when they make a product seem much better than they really are , is global .
