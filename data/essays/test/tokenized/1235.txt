It is not easy to say simply that if travelling in a group led by a tour guide is the best way or not .
Because there are truly some advantages to travel in a group led by a tour guide , but personally speaking , i like to travel by myself .

First , I am the kind of man who like to challenge themselves .
So i want to something with risks .
If i go for a trip in a group with a guide , it will lost the chance to enjoy the venture .
For example , as you know Great Wall is very famous in China which is located in the northern moutain part of Beijing city .
Same parts have been reconstructed by modern people just for the tour .
For the safety , all of the guides will show you to these parts if you are in a tour group .
But if you want to see the real ancient arcitectures of the Great Wall , you have to go alone to the dangerous parts of the Great Wall which keep the old structures .
It mustl be more interesting .

Second , it will be cheaper by travelling alone .
Many guides will take you to some shops which have some secret economic relationships between them to encourage you to busy some gifts .
Finally , the shop owners will share the profits with guides .
I quite do n't like this , more exactlly speaking , I hate this behavior .
I was ever cheated by some bad guides , so from then i decieded never to go with a guide again .

In conclusion , I think to travel in a group led by a tour guide may be a good choice for most people , because it safe and conveniet , but totally is not the best way for me .

I aslo suggest others : Just to fly by yourself , you will see the real blue sky !
