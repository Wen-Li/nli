I seriously doubt the statement as we already have had probably the worst oil crisis behind us thirty years ago and we are despite all political effort still relying on cars .

As everyone knows resources are limited but I believe this dependency upon the car will just go on and on as it has - since the widespread usage of the automobile started .
And individuals would be willing to pay a much higher prize as the car is the one and only way to travel that is completely independent from any other interaction like schedules or booking .

Even if we would invent new means to travel there would be still developing nations behind us which would want to make the leap towards the automobile .
China consists of 1/6 of the world population but the bicycle is still the prevalent way to travel .
So we can expect China to start getting a car density like in western europe as wealth is going to be spread due to the more and more evolving economy .

Cars can be an object of prestige in Western society , too , and few people will want to consider getting rid of a car for rational reasons like environmental issues .
Especially not in the upper economic classes that own expensive cars as they would care less about political incentives like fuel getting more expensive for plitical and environmental reasons .

Whatever we would invent in future may it be a car run by hydrogen or electricity it would still resemble the design of our today `` s automobile and therefore still be considered a car .
So the number of cars is definetely not going down , but almost certain due to increase .
