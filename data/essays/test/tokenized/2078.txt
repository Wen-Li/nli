I agree on the statement `` Most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are '' .
I believe that if the product is really good , it does not need any advertisements .
Advertisments is only way that company sees if their product is not working well enough in market .
Advertisement is only the means of attracting more and more peoples .
Moreover , the fundamental rule of marketing is if the product does not find coustmers let coustmer find product by advertising it .
There are many reasons by which it can be agreed upon the statement that advertisments make product much better than they reallr are .

Firstly , the advertisemnt agensies trap the coustmer by giving various offers with their products .
They just show their product as the number one product in the category of that product .
Like for example , this diwali the tata motors advertised their diseal car stateing that it give better milage than any other car and their are also providing heavy dicounts on festival seasons with some gifts .
So , the customer will forget to compare the car with other diseal cars in greed of gifts and heavy discounts .
This shows how the advertisments attract people or we can say fool them .

Additionally , the advetisement agencies sometimes sell the prroducts which are not worth and they may also be harmfull for the health .
Like some expired eatable products that are now considered as harmfull for use .
The company have no profits in these products .
So , they do what ?
they advertise these products that they are available on heavy discount or they are 50 % off on their marked price .
The some customer does not take care of expiration date and buy the product .
This may harm them .
So , adversitment sells the product which is not worth selling .

Moreover , the advertisement have greater hand in succesfull of toxic softdrinks .
The softdrinks available in market are very toxic and harmfull for younger or even for whole generation .
But they are in incresingly demand by the presentation of advertisment .
The product shows some well know people to endrose it and this hepls these product to get the attraction by which they are succesfully selled .

Finally , I believe that advertisment are the main source by which the products seems better than they really are .
And this practice should be stopped by health govenment by allowing only those product to advertise which are really good .
ANd first the product should be tested ang gi \ ven the permission to advertise .
