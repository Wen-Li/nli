The issue at hand is whether understanding ideas and concepts is more important than learning facts .
It is a very complicated issue since most of the educators claim that via learning facts students can get the ideas and concepts related to topics .
I agree with the statement , since i believe that the main point of education should be understanding ideas and concepts in order to create new ideas rather than only learning the facts and not to make students bored concerning education when they are constrained to learn lots of different facts .

Firstly , i believe that ideas are more important since when student learn the ideas and concepts initially this will increase his inspiration about that subject .
Lots of scientist started their work only by considering the ideas not the facts found before .
And this made them to be open to create new ideas .
This is because when a person know that quite number of people had worked hard and could do nothing he would be afraid of dealing with that subject .
For example , Ramanujan who was a very famous mathematician started his work about mathematics with a little knowledge , but since he liked the subject he worked harder and harder and found lots of many things , and finally reached to an astonishing position in mathematics history .
So by learning ideas only students can work efficently .

Secondly , if the student do not have an interest in a particular area he do not want to learn facts about that subject and get bored and became unsuccesful .
As a result of this he may lose his interest in all other areas .
Then he may stop working to anything .
This situation is inevitable since somebody like one area while others like another .
For instance , Einstein might have lost his interest concerning science when he became unsuccesful in primary school because of some irrelevant courses .

To sum up , we can say that students should be made aware of firstly ideas and concepts then facts .
Since by teaching facts firstly concerning lots of different areas they can be made bored and can lose their interest .
