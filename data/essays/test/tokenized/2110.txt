One may think that beeing specialized in one specific subject may be better for our own personal and future profesional life .
As far as I am concerned , I would say that one must keep a broad acadmic knowledge in order to succeed in his future .

First of all we must remind that the true culture is not a lot on a very specific subject but a little about as must subjects as possible .
That is just because we wo n't have to stay enclosed within our ivory tower in the future .
Today 's world is made of communication , travels and foreign people .
That is why today 's people will have to be prepared to face a world which is evolving faster than ever .
As an exemple I would talk about the people working within the British or French mines .
When they had to close for economic reasons , that people very specialized could not find a job elsewhere .
We must remind that a structure of an ecoonomy may change and that some sectors could disapear and others rise .

If someone is prepared from the begining to face a world and a professional life which could always evolve , he would have to be effective and moreover have a descent life .
That is a way to get a purshasing power by being flexible in our work .
An other point is that if someone wants to get a better job within a car company , knowing everything about cars and telling it to his superiors wo n't be a way .
Profesional relationships are also made of humane qualities , passions and culture .
By knowing several knowledges about various subjects , one can easily build good relationships at work and maybe , as 25 % of men , meet their future wife at the office .

To put it in a nutshell , I would say that obviously , having many academic knowledges and humane qualities is a main adventage in today 's world , when flexibility is a key .
