I think that both understanding ideas or concepts and learning facts is important for students , but I think that learning facts is a better way to understand everything .
In fact if you understand properly a fact , you wo n't forget it !
on the contrary if you learn a concept it is possible to forget it because concepts and ideas are too astract .

When students have to learn something they usually read some conceps into some books , but they do n't understant properly what they have read until the professor does n't explaine them referring to some facts .

The more professors refer to a fact , the more students learn quikcly !
And professors are usually aware of it and so they explaine the lessons referring to a practical facts and not only reading to the text .

For example if a professor explains how to use a particular program of computer reading the explanation on the text , the students do n't understand how to use it ; but if he supports his explanation with a computer and he shows to the students the program , they probably understand it better .

But there are a lot of professors that prefer read the text without any explanation and so students do n't understand properly the lessons .
Starting from the facts to the concepts is the best way I know to understand something .
I am really sure about my position and I wonder how students can think the contrary ; I think the statement is not correct !
Probably students prefer starting from the concepts because they can use their brain and they can improve their conceptual skills .
