Successful people often make hard choices or have an important opportunity .
Both of these factors imply risk taking .
It is not really difficult to find this kind of people .

The most common important successful characters took the risk to stand up for their rights .

During the Enlightment back in Europe in the 18th century , men and women had to stand up against two important forces that dominated them for more than several centuries : the chatolic church and the power 's king .
Indeed , for the first one , people used the religious inluence to monitor and control the people .
During this period in History , men and women such as Voltaire , Diderot or Montesquieu wrote books to show they point of view using irony or sarcasme .
These men were successful risking everything for the good of the people .
It then helped the people understand that they have the right of freedom and the puisuit of happiness .

Another common example that happened in the 20th century in the United States was the end of Segregation .
Men like Dr Martin Luther King Jr or women such as Rosa Parks stood up for their rights risking everything in a `` modern society '' for everybody to be equal .
These characters were successful because they took risks .
Like a lot of other people and because of the political power , they could 've kept on living their lives and close their eyes in front of racism .
They are now still admired by the general american population .
