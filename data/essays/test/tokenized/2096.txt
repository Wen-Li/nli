The advertisements are playing a major role in todays business .
There are many companies that attract the people with their advertisements .
The people were getting very much attracted to the advertisements .
Some of them may be really good and most of them are not .
I agree with the statement that `` Most of the advertisements are making the products seem much better than they really are '' .

There are many reasons to support my idea .
one of them is many people get impressed by seeing an advertisement of voltage stabilizer stating that it can withstand any voltage but after few days usage when high voltages are passed it fails to withstand resukting in a damage to a refrigrator or a television .

Secondly , i want to give an example that happened in the country of my domain .
My friend named John buyed a bike by watching a television advertisement saying that the bike runs hundred kilometers per litre petrol .
After some days of ridig the bike he found it is just running sixty five kilometers per litre .

Thirdly , I my self bought a watch from the showroom and it is said that the watch is water resistant .
Soon after i purchased it when i am leaving to my hone it showered suddenly and found some water on the watch .
After some hours it stopped working .

Lastly my uncle bought a bread packet and the owner said that its fresh and tasty and can last for a week .
After a day or two when my uncle started eating that the upper most layers were good to eat and the layers from middle to the end were infected with fungus .

As the media that is Television , radio , news papres are playing a major role in entertaining the people the advertisements are highly broadcasted by on or other means .
So the advertising companies were making cash by not selling the true items that shown in the advertisement .
