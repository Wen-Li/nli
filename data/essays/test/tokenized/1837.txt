As multimedia continues to increase , we can not neglect the great advertisement it has provided for a wide veriety of products .
Nowadays there are commercials everywhere .
Products are now better advertised than ever before through TV , radio , newspapres , magazines and even on the streets .
However , the question arises here .
Are products `` that '' good ?

Advertisement has ofcourse enabled manufacturers to display their products , whatever they were , in the best possible manner .
Lets consider Pantene for instincts , a very significant hair product that everybody knows .
Pantene has displayed many TV commercials on how amazing it 's shampoo is .
Its commercial always displays a young woman with the most exquisite hair anybody could ever encounter .
Her hair in every commercial is always long , strong , healthy and shiny .
In a matter of fact , her hair is too perfect to be true !
I just often wonder if there is hair like that in our real world and in a matter of fact I doubt there is .
That hair is most likely , as I can imagine , visualized hiar .
It was probably visualized thruogh a special computer program and then attached to the woman 's head in the commercial .
Why am I saying this ?
It is because I have brought the product and several of my freinds have , yet non of us has seen a massive change .
Ofcourse I do n't expect my hair to be just like the woman 's in the commercial , but I expect something from what they state in the commercial to happen , like having a healthier hair for example , or tleast seeing some kind of change to the better .
As a result , I discover that the commercial of the shampoo has really nothing to do with the actual product available to the consumers .

Here my argument begins .
Why are commercials so fake ?
Why are they too perfect ?
Has it come to the point that manufacturers are nowadays decieving people and lieing to them just to get a product sold and successful ?
In a matter of fact , I do n't believe that commercials and advertisements are making pruduct successful , they only give them the attention requird as people become interested in discovering the product .
Once the consumer tries the product and realizes it 's insignificant , the consumer will no longer think of buying it again .
Simply , advertisements have this power of making products seem much better than they really are but they certaintly do n't promise them success .

It is a shame how far producers and maunfacturers have reached to lie to the public by making their products seem extravagant through advertisements .
All they are getting in return is distrust form the public .
People nowadays are becoming aware of the great hypocricy lying about behind each and every commercial .
A simple massage to all companies .
Be realistic , you might gain more success out of it !
