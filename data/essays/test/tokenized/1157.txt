Advertising is an art .
How do you get people to buy a specific product rather than the other one next to it ?
You only emphazise the best aspects of the item , and more importantly you `` claim '' .
Advertisers often mislead buyers on the real value of what they are selling to them .
This is why I strongly believe that advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .

And to support my opinion , i will use exemples based on my personnal experiences and observations .

I never forgot the day when in the U.S for a month i decided to call a television marketing channel to buy a set of kitchen knives .
I was probably only 8 or 9 years old but i was mesmerized by what was promised to me. `` it will cut right through the bones of your chicken like if it was a tomato '' the sellsman claimed .
After convincing my older brother to call and buy the knives , I was more impatient than ever .
But when they finally arrived , my deception was huge .
The knives did n't look at all like the steel ones i 'd seen on TV , nor did they cut very well , even through soft and tender ingredients .
In fact I had n't looked at the bottom of the tv screen , where a little star stated that the product aspect could differ , and its efficiency too .

Even last year in europe , a law was passed to ban misleading advertising in the food industry , because consumers started to complain that they had bought morning cereals that were supposed to lower their levels of stress , and that sadly , it did n't work the way they had expect it to .
The truth was there was nothing , not even a single ingrdient that was known to reduce stress levels .

While it may be true that you do have certain products that offer what they promise , the vast majority does n't , and it is all because of one thing : profit .
They have to sell as much as they can and find every way and means to convince a consumer to consume .
So do n't believe that advertisement stating you can loose 60 pounds in 7 weeks , or the one claiming you can grow back new hairs without surgery if you are bold , because they are simply irrealistic .
