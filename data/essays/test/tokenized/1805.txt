Somp people may not think most advertisement make products seem much better than they really are .
But I do n't agree with them .
I think it was really most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .

Firstly , I think most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .
Because now the tecnology is much better than before .
Some company wants to get more money from the products , even if the products do not have these fuction , they will use some advertisement to make products better .
So that could make customors believe that products is really good for them .
But after they use the products later , they will found out the truth .
And also maybe the products give them some pain after use the products .

Secondly , I think most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .
Because on the TV , there is a lot of commercials , and the company wants more people to believe the products is good .
They always find super stars to give presentations by using the products .
Ask them to tell people how good is the products and how useful are they .
And through the commercial more and more people will receive this message and know more about the products .
But among lots of commercials , only a few commercial tell the true fuction of the products .

Finally , as I said before , I agree with this statment .
I really think most advertisements make products seem much better that they really are .
The only way we could know if the products are really like the advertisements make is try it by ourselves .
We could n't believe the commercials and the advertisements .
They always lie to us to make the products seem much better than they really are .
So we could just believe our eyes instead of believing the advertisements .
