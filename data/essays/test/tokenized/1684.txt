The ideas are the flame that encourage people to make new things , the concepts are what lie behind any theory that wants to explain the facts that you observe in the real world .

The invention of the automobile is just the way humanity found to solve the problems about mobility .
Before the automobile was invented there were other means of transportation , but people realized that thy were not good enough , so the idea of improving the way they move around came up .

If we think about theories that have came up while trying to explain facts of the real world , we discover that the concepts are what is truly important about them , because they are the ones that give the support to any theorie .
Concepts are the heart of the theorie .
For example when it comes to financial markets , you should not know that when interest rates are high the exchange rate weakens , but you should know why that happens , you should understand that when interest rates are low , capitals go abroad , so the supply of the currencie is lowered therefore the exchange rate weakens .

The most important thing for a student should be to understand what is behind the facts .
The reason things are the way they are .
This way he will be able to approach to any problem that he faces , no matter if it is different from the one he was taugh .
As long as the students understand the concepts that support theories they will be able to apply what they learned in college in they 're everyday life .
