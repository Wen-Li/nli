First of all , I agree with the statement given here that `` The best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide '' .

My first reason is , as we go to a new place , we may not be knowing how the place will be , how will be the behaviour of the people , what their culture is , what their customs are , what their tradition is etc .
If we go to some latin American countries , we may find some difficulty undeveloping their language and also we can not understand their accent even though they speak english .
For example suppose you planned to go france .
The language the people , speak there is french .
You may not understand french , here you need a guide .

My second reason is , if the place you planned to tour a historic place without a guide , you finally end up with the rocky structures you saw there .
As each historic place has a history behind in the main purpose is to know its history .
As we are not familiar with the place and its history , a guide it is right person to explain it .
Fot example , take an instance of visiting Mahabalipuram , a famous historic site in India , It 's all filled with temples made of rock , carving on stone etc .
We need a guide to explain what those rocky structures are .

Lastly I deside to say from all the previous things i discus `` The best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide '' .
From these you know every thing means history and what are the resourses are thereand the greatness of that place .
Moreover you enjoy the company of the tour guide , traveling with company is good .
