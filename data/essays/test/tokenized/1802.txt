The topic is mainly concerned if it is the best way to travel in a group led by a tour guide .
I believe and agree with the point that it is better to travel in group led by a tour guide .
It is a better way because if we travel with a tour guide , he explains us everything whatever he knows about the thing or place .

I can specify you a reason and an example of this .
Since we are from biomedical engineering we went for a visit to a place in kerala where the heart valves were manufactured .
The company 's name was SRICHITRA .
There was a lot of research going on there about the heart valves like developing of artificial heart valves .
For every group of four of batch students they alloted a guide .
Certain students left not considering the importance of the guide .
They went on their own .
Our group went with the guide and fortunetly the guide explained us about the research going on , and the products developed etc .
He also explained what he has done in the development of the artificial heart valves .
We put forth our doubts .
These doubts of individuals from group were answered by him .
We gained a lot of knowledge through his lectures during the tour of the place than others who roamed individually or without a guide .
A test was conducted regarding the heart valves and we topped .
Then everyone realised the importance of a guide and a group .

In other case when we went for a tour to delhi in our tenth class with our classmates and teachers with a guide there was lot of knowledge gain through the questions we posed to the guide .
He shared a lot of things with our group people .
It was then onwards i realised the importance of a group and proper tour guide .
In some cases without a proper tour guide we may end up with less knowledge of the things and places than others .

Hence i agree that the best way to travel is in group led by a tour guide based on my experiences .
