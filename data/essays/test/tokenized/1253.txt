Certainly there are some people that like trips with a tour guide .
But I do not agree with that opinion .
I think trips without a tour guide is better than trips with .

My primary reason is that with a tour guide , there is a little frre time .
For example suddenly when you want to eat something , If you do not have a tour guide , you can eat .
But if you have a tour guide , you can not .
The same is true of using a toillet .

second If you do not have a tour guide , you may experience many things .
For instance in trip for foreign country , you may not use your country laungage .
you may have to speak in English , spanish , or chinese .
It is difficult to talk with foreigner .
But it is big chance .
In the environment you are gived chance that progress your ability .
without a tour guide , you may have hard work .
But the hard work is very important thing .
Travel should not be composed with enjoy things .
You need hard thing .

Therefore I disagree with travel with a tour guide .
