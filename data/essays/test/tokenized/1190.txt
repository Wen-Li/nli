I completely agree with this statement since many products never prove what they promise .
Everyone knows how companies advertise their products , you can hear them on the radio , see the in magazines , newspapers or simply open your eyes when you are walking along the street .

Our daily life is full with advertisments - some are more noticeable for us , some are less .
But they all share the same idea of their producer , - to get into our minds and remind us in case we need a product .

Since our ecomomy is so overloaded with companies offering the same products , everyone is trying to sell at most .
Every company is investing more and more money in the production of a sucessfull advertisment rather than they invest in research or for the product itself .

For a low value product , with no research expenses they can fully invest in the advertisment , since this is the fact that makes consumers buying the product .
Initially we dont care about the materials used creating this product or how much time and effort was invested in research .

Since childhood we are trained to listen to advertisments , therefore every company is trying their best to make their product on the advertisment as much appealing to us as possible , if we need this product or not , we still listen are see the advertisment .

For sure advertisements are not always telling the truth or prove the tests they have undergone to successfully lead in their range among all other products .
This is the way companies are competing among each other and everyone is adding more facts which are not true .

Thats why people know many products do n't prove what they promise in their advertisments .
The simple reason why well known companies are lying to us is in order to increase their sales to make the consumer buying this product expecting results they never can get .

I see the situation is changing , companies want to be seen as thrustworthy and therefore starting to invest more money in genuine researches , tests , to prove the expectations of a product .
