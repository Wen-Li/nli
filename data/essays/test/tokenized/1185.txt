The problem thet young people do not give enough time to helping their communities is very common .
I think that it is true , I am agree with this statement .
Nowadays the young people are busy , between school , work and sport activity , but it is not a good reason .

The problem that their are not interested at their community , they think about themseves , their study , their job , their friends .
All are first that helping their communities .
I think that could make a promotion of this activity , the goverment must be interested about this problem and make something to change this situation .
I feel that if exsist a organizated association that give information and contact person that could help and how need to help , more young people give their time to help someone .

Also the school could sesibilize their students in this way , it could introduce promotion about this .
For example could give extra credit to the students that give his or her time to helping the comunity .

I think is important to promoter this activity , because a young person that gives something at his or her comunity , will grow a good person .

But not all the young people do not give time to helping their communities , I know many person that make something for the communities .
They emplied same of their time to make something to someone , they could take a child or make volontary at red cross , organize travell for children or ageded peolple .

In conclusion I think the young people could give more of their time to helping their comunities , but also they have need to be encuraged and motivied .
The institution could play a key role about this problem .
