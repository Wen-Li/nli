I really agree with this statement and believe that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .
The main reasons of this are the people 's inclination to creating images in their mind and the essential part of televisions and computers in our life .

In today 's life , people like images more than reality .
They like to create some positive stereotypes about products and they like to make people be jealous of them since they own that product .
This is easily visible in my city .
Nowadays , everybody has a black bmw .
Everybody worship to this car and they are making a show with their cars .
They have an image that this car is sportive and it points to wealth .
However , the reality is not like that .
Bmw is a too expensive car which is not value of its price .
It also uses a lot of petrol and creates lots of problems .
This is the consequence of a challenge in our minds .

Another reason is the essential part of televisions and computers in our life .
We spend so much time in front of them that our minds fall into a trap by believing whatever we see .
We , being unaware of it , start to perceive TVs and computers as undoubtly thrustworthy resources .

In conclusion , advertisements can make most of the products seem much better due to the essential part of televisions and computers in our life and due to our inclination to creating images in our minds .
