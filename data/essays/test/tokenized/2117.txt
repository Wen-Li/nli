Which way do you prefer to travel ?
Personally , I have expereinced both ways of travelling .
However , I would choose to travel in a group with a tour guide .
There are abundant benefits I get from travelling this way .

If I travel in a group led by a guide , I can visit most of the crucial and prominent monuments and cities .
Due to the fact that the guide is very familiar with the famous places , we can go to fabulous places without any help or difficulties .

Furthermore , when we travel individually or in groups without a guide there are many disadvantages .
Primarily , even though we visit well known places , we wo n't be able to know the historical facts unless we search for them in the internet .
In my opinion , we should know historical names and people that is related with the monuments we look at .

Finally , by travelling in a group I can get to know the people I am travelling with .
As we talk and experience conventional and ritual traditions during the trip , we can know about other people .
Perhaps , after the trip we can still be friends and call each other and talk about interestin stuff .

For example , I was in Japan few months ago without any guide .
My family could n't speak any Japanese and were unfamiliar with Japanese culture .
There were a lot of difficulties in travelling .
We were n't sure where to go and the transportation was so complicated that we lost ourselves in the subway station .
Even though we went to several temples and monuments , we did n't know any historical facts about it .
Looking without knowing what it is was very unfamiliar to me and our family .

To sum up the reasons why I would prefer to travel in a group with a tour guide : foremost , I would n't have a lot of difficulties in travelling .
Also , we can be more receptive with informations about prominent places .
Last , I can get to know people in the group I am travelling with .
