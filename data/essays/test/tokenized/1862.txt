Although I can understand people argueing that there will be more cars in use in twenty years from now than there are today , I support the idea that there will be fewer cars in use .
There are three main reasons why I think this will be the case .

First , during the last ten years oil prices went up constantly .
This was mainly caused by political tensions arising between countries providing and consuming oil .
I think this development will continue since most political conflicts causing these tensions still exist today and because there are no easy solutions available to solve these problems in the near future .
Therefore , with oil prices continuing to rise , less and less people will be able to afford to pay the fuel needed for their vehicles and as a consequence , the number of cars in use will decrease .

Second , global oil resources are shrinking .
It is becoming more and more difficult to bring oil to the earth 's surce and to find new sources of oil .
This is backed by the fact that already today an increasing amount of off-shore oil platforms are built and that oil is already being explored in life-threatening areas like the polar regions .
Therefore , since fuel supplies come to an end and since alternative technologies like hydrogen powered cars will probably not yet be publically available , shrinking global oil resources are a further reason why numbers of cars in use during the next twenty years will decrease .

Third , air pollution will continue to dramatically increase in the future .
This puts a serious threat to people 's health and a country 's citizens ' living quality .
Therefore , it is very likely that countries start to restrict and even reduce the numbers of cars allowed on their streets .
As a consequence , in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today .

Considering all the arguments and developments mentioned above , I think it is very clear that in twenty years , there will be fewer cars in use than there are today .
Personally , I hope that I will still be able to drive my own car , since I would miss the convenience of unrestricted mobility very much .
