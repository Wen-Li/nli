Most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .
it doesnt matter what products , it could be fondations , eye shadows , lip gloss , eye linear and many more .
In magazines , we see girls that looks amazing out of the lip gloss , so we buy lip gloss , and it ends up looking way different .
The eyes make up too as well .

Though there 's some advertisments which are real , like hand creams , accessories and many other stuff .
But most of them are just waste of money and time as well .

However , women that are interested in such things , they would keep on buying and getting stuff , thinking that they looks way better with the products .
Though they dont know that its no good for their skin .

I remember a friend of mine went once to this huge skin care , and she knew that she 's going to pay way more than 200 bucks !
but she said , `` oh its ok , its going to make me look good , i really want to try this cream on . ''
It was this browny cream which look extremely disgusting , but because she saw that picture of a woman who used it , she believed it !
she spent over 250 $ to get her face done and it ended up having this brown things stucked in her face !
and her skin is really bad now , its like a cream that burned her face not fixed it .
Though in the picture she looked so sexy , hot and no words would describe her .

I do n't really recommand to get products without making sure it has in , what its made of , make a huge research about it , and ask people who tried it instead doing it blindly !

Its really interesting to get our skin cleaned , and take care of our beauty !
but i guess it 's much nicer to make sure what we are using before going ahead and doing it !

Right , most advertisements make products that seems nice , but my point is to make sure of it , dont look at pictures , look at the main skin !
