I agree with the statement that `` most advertisements make products products seem much better that they really are '' .

Apart from making the products look attractive and good there is no point in a advertisement .
The purpose of advertisements is to promote and market the products .
In this process many advertisements require that they dramatacize the properties of the product to catch the attention of the viewers effectively .
This dramatacizing almost always makes the products look better than they actually are .

For example consider the case of junk food advertisements .
Though they are not as useful and benificial as their advertisements make them look but they are portrayed that way to attract the attention of the viewers .
If these advertisements were to project the true nature of the product no person with a sane mind would go for it .

Also consider the case of a fuel company which advertises that with that particular brand of fuel , as low as a couple of litres in the automobile is sufficient energy for it to run hundreds of kilometers .
Although everybody knows that this cant be true it helps the advertisers deliver a point and helps them market their product .

It is a well established pshycological priniciple that the common and uninteresting events attract less attention when compared to the uncommon and exciting events .
To take advantage of this priniciple the advertisizers tend to create the advertisement as uncommon and interesting as possible .
In this process they end up showcasing their product as much better than it actually is though it might not be their primary intention .
If this is not done there is the risk of the advertisement not serving its purpose and there would be no point in making it .
