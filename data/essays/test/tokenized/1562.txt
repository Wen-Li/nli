I strongly believe that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are for the following reasons .

First , advertisement only emphasises on the merit of products .
When I was in a junior in Tokyo University , a famous university in Japan , I bought a computer .
The advertisement of the computer claimed that the specification of this machine was so high that any application software could work efficiently and the price is very cheap .
I was very satisfied with buying such a good machine with low price .
However , when I got back to my home , I found that any application software did not be installed .
I must buy application software in addition and it costs 2000 dollars .
If the advertisement had claimed not only their merits but also their defects , I could have saved my money .
This example clearly show that advertisement only claims products ' merits .

Second , the cost of advertisement is often more expensive than the cost of products .
When I worked in a cosmetic company , I was in charge of the product promotion .
The original cost of the products was only 2 dollars .
However , the cost of the advertisement was 3 dollars a product .
Without advertisement , we could not compete with other companys ' products .
Therefore , we invested much money on advertisement to make our products seem much better than they really were .
As the above example clearly shows that advertisement often costs much higher than the cost of products .

Thus , I definitely believe that products are seemed to be more better than they really are with advertisements .
