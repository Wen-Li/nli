People often say that understanding ideas and concepts is more important than learning fact .
Personally , I agree with the above statement for two reasons .
First of all , It reduce the time and the posibility of failure to learn how to do .
In addition , it more last long to my memory than just learn facts .

To begin with , understanding ideas and concepts is more important than learning facts .
Generally , the result of our act is seem to related with learning facts .
However , there are more fundermental and basic proncipals in learning how to do .
For example , when I learn ski , I did that without learning basic theory .
So , I had hard time during learning how to ski .
If I had a little basic skill or theories , I 'm sure that it was more effective .
Therefore , we may conclude that understanding ideas and concepts is more important than learning facts .

Secondary , understanding ideas and concepts more lasts long than learning facts .
We have witnessed many cases that short-term memory is generally used to learn how to learn .
If I learn how to play the piano , basic theories are very important .
Without this procession , even though we learn about conducting a melody , this skill does not last long .
In thas way understanding ideas is more effective than just learn how to do .

In conclusion , I strongly believe that comprehension of ideas and concepts in more important than learning facts .
