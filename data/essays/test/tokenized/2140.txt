I do believe that is far more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts .

I study psychology and in this field it is crucial to pursue undersatanding about the concepts and ideas .
If you do learn the facts but then outside of the calssroom you are unable to apply the concepts and ideas to the reality you face , your capability for acting and modifying a problem or difficult siatuation will be really limited .
If all a student had to do was learn facts , then no important changes or new discoveries will be possible because he will be caring about the very basics only .

I know persons that have piled up through their lives , all sorts of facts , they know every single of them over a specific topic .
Still , when you give them a scenario that was not included in the facts they learned , the might be unable to conduct themselves on it .
This wil be rather opposite for a person that dominates the concepts and main ideas , she would not have as much trouble because all she will need is to learn some of the facts and then she will be able to make her own conclusions and real understanding would be achieved .

Many people at fields sucha as medicine or science , believe that leraning the facts will allow them to succeed on what they are doing .
Sadly for them this is all wrong .
For example , if a patient is dying and the medicine student learned about how essential it is to mantain the vitals at certain level , but he does not understood how this fact should be integrated along with the concepts and main ideas about this topic , simply he will have quite a hard time as he will know the patient will die and he can not stop it .

Our world and our thoghts are made up of ideas and concepts , those are the basic components which lately guide us to facts .

I belive that is essential to gain a domain over both learning the facts and understanding the ideas and concepts .
For contructing valuable knowledge you will need to master both .
The facts are important as well and you have to know them , still it is true that the facts by themselves will not lead to a deep and profund comprehension .

In our psychology department there is an important statement ; `` psychology not to interpret , but to transform '' .
Understanding the concepts and ideas will enable you to do so at any given situation .
