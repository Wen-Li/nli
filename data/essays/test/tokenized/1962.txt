The world challenges dramatic changes in the last decades with its all meanings , also including the business world and the branch of its sales department .
Advertisement becomes playing an important role in companies ' life .
More and more firms use the way of advertising to present and sell their products .
But not all the advertisements reflect the product that is actually produced .

There are really good advertisements which help the company to increase its sales percentage so does its profit upon the sales .
However , on the other side , lost of the people who are educated about slaes and advertisement also discuss about the ethics of advertisement .
And the statement written here is just one of the topics discussed .
It is stated that any adveretisement produced to represent a product should contain all the information about that specific product and do not mislead the customer .
So it should reflect only the actual product ; not the more or less .
Still , there is no exact common ethic or code explaning this in all the societys ' law .
So some of the companies can use the advertisements which are representing the product more than what it is .
This causes the customer buy the product after he \ she sees it on tv or flyer or somewhere else and get dissappointed after using it .
Because the product is not as good as it is shown on the advertisement .
It does not cut the same way as it cuts on tv or it does not cut the grass as the customer wants .
Then , it is realized that most of the advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .
But the customer wastes his money and feels disappointed .
However , he also can not keep himself from looking and buying the products advertised because they are really good advertisements and make the products seem much more efficient or useful .

To conclude , although it is not appropriate and ethical to advertise products more than what they are , lots of the firms follow this strategy to increase their profits and customers help them to maintain their strategy even they experience any dissappoinment from the products they buy .
