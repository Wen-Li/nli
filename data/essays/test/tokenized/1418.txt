Communication and industry brings us some new concepts , selling products and advertisements of these products .
Advertisements can be very helpful for understanding what the product is .
However , usually advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .

Advertisements may be necessary but they can be checked by some mechanism if they reflects the reality or not .
I want to give you a torch example .
A seller was standing on the corner of a street in Ankara , the capital city of TURKEY , advertising torchs which do not need any energy sources like battery or electricity .
I think they were all made in China and they very extremely cheap .
One of them was recharging by shaking the torch , one of them was recharging pushing an arm on torch etc .
There were three kinds of torchs which do not need energy source according to the seller .
I brought the torch which can be recharged by shaking .
That day the torch was working properly .
But one or two days later it did not work .
Because I understood that there is a small battery in it and it takes energy from that battery and shaking the torch changes nothing on energy source .
When the battery dies off , the torche also does .

I gave e very simple and small example which can be ignored because of its cost .
However you can see such advertisements on tv or on internet or even you can listen them on radio .
You should ask for help to your friends or experienced costumers who bought that product .
You should read the warranty statements of the product and if exists user manual .
Becuse if you read the user manual you can understand what the features of the product are .

I had mentioned about some mechanism which checks advertisements are true or not .
Finally I will say this mechanism : trust yourself .
Not only on the advertisement , if you want to learn the real features you should talk with other customers , make a little investigation .
After all you can make a decision whether the advertisement says only the truths or not .
