Successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well .
This has emerged as a new trend and a very good one aswell .
I totally agree with the statement .

Success is like a recipe , if you do it right , you succeed , if you dont , then you are doomed .
Its totally your decision to either go for the success or live a simple life .
And if you choose to achieve success then you need exact amounts of the components .
Trying new things , taking risks , worker harder than others , thinking big , having confidence , being charismatic would be some of the components needed to make your recipe just perfect .

Trying new things is number one , which is accompanied with working very hard .
Success should not be defined by others for you but it should be very clear that it is you who defines what success is to you .
By doing so , you would be able to achieve it more easily .
Albert Einstein became successful or famous by doing what he believed in and he really worked hard to achieve it .

Taking risks would either give you an advantage or a disadvantage over others both having the same magnitude .
Inorder to become successful this is unfortunately compulsory .
Risks donot only mean risking your life or your financial status .
It is defined from situation to situation .

For e.g. You are sciences teacher at xyz school .
You are very hardworking and creative aswell .
You try an experiment and if u want to publish them then you would have to resign from your post from your school that has policy not to allow its teachers to publish studies that have been performed in the school laboratory .
So what would you do ?
u can either work in the school or take the risk of loosing your job and achieve what you believe in .
Then you can either succeed or fail very badly .
Which ever one it is , the only thing you need to know is that this is not the end of road , life 's too big to finish so early .
