advertisement 's liar switching from one channel to another you can hardly find a program , all you can see is publicity for certain product . so lately it is becoming the major source of money for most of the company . unfortunatelly this creats chaos in my mind , and greatly effect my behavior and my decision , because obviosly our recent advertisement are making the product much better than they really appear . this reality is the reason behind personal benefit and behind the decieving world we are living in . my first point why i see that these recent advertisement are all fake , becomes when i look around my self , in my environment and all i can find is every person seeking for his own benifit and profit . so each business man try to make his own product the best product on ground , which will ha a great negative impact on decision making . the second reason why i see advertisememnts so not trustworthy is the way the whole world is functioning . in other word when i see that all people are becoming agressive and violent , greedy , and cheeters . for example is the mac donald hamburger , when u see it 's advertisement on the road you find it so big , or big enough for you , however when it come to reality , or when you arrive the place and order it you find it two time smaller .
