i completely agree with the statement that successful people try new thing and take risk rather than only doing what they already know how to do well . because a person who is successful know well how to do the thing and what consequence will bring it positively . firstly , if we consider a film director who used to direct a number of succesful film know well how to direct a film and when it will be received positively by the audience . he may be directing a simple story or a complex story , he should never make the audience get bored . they should feel something new and exciting element in his film then finally it will be a successful film . these type of director who catch the pulse of the audience can try new thing with new idea and take risk finally they will be successful . secondly , if we consider a bussiness magnet who is successful in his bussines will go for new bussinesses though he doesnt know about that but his leadership quality and creative thinking will make them successful . when they know how a bussiness will be successful by sticking to those basic step he will be successful in any type of bussiness . lastly , when a person is successful all the other people around him will have confidance in him and encourage him to do new thing which will make him successful. `` successful people never do thing different they do the thing differently '' . this is why i think successful people try new thing and take risk .
