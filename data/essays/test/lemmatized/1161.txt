in korea , there is saying that neigbor is closest causin . it mean that every community have close bandage for themseleves and easily cooperate each other , and it is not exceptional to young people . however , thing are changed a time go by , and i firmly agree that young people nowdays have le concern to their community . i suport my idea by two main reason which is the matter of individualism and quality of community . to begin with , i strongly beileve that the reason of le concern to community is high individualism . as industrialization develops , many people started to concentrate on their own time and life , not on their communitie . they even do not recognize what their community are doing . for example , my friend ha no concern and doe not want to involve in her community . she ha her own job a a university student , and there are so many thing to do . she even ignores the thing that need her help . secondly , i confirm that it is because of the community ' misworking . they underestimate the importance of young people 's concern beacause they are interested in only benefit of welfare to elder people who usually concern with them . in that sense , community are obsessed to get elder 's high reputation and concern . these make young people to be sick of doing something for their community and no advantage for helping community . those event that community holding are not attractive and even boring . this is the major reason why young people do not give concern and help their community . consequently , i agree that young people nowadays have no concertn to help community in the name of high individualism and the quality of community .
