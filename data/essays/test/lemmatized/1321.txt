the communitiy is not an entity without it people . people who live together , share the resource like school , road , sanitation , market and much more . to serve the community ha rather gained a backstage nowdays . the worst thing is that the young people who are the future generation , are laking time and zeal to help their community . there are various reason behind this problem . changing social value , pressure to excell in career and indifferent attitude of the youth can be considered a the few of many factor resulting in this problem . firstly , i feel that in many highly developed modern society the social value have changed . the people have become more self centred and they hardly care about the others . they enjoy living artificial life . as a result these value are passed to the younger people a well . after all , an individual behaves in the manner what he or she see . this attitude is le prevailing in the lesser developed society like in the developing world . there , poeple are dependent on each other and still believe in serving their community . secondly , the young people are hard pressed against time in their life . they have a tremendous pressure on themselves to excell in academic , job , sport etc and a a result they spend most of their time in working hard to achieve their objective . helping their community in activity like educating the street child , helping the old people etc. come a a secondary priority for them . also not having any monetory benfits in return to serving their community discourages them to work for the same . finally , one more point which i believe contributes to this problem is the indifferent attitude of the youth . todays youth ha easy access to everything . in wealthy society , the youth ha access to every luxories without having to work hard . they believe that it is their birth right to have all the facility they are enjoying . they are so much involved in their fun related activites that they forget that every right come with a duty in return . so to conclude , i can say that it is important for the youth to understand their sense of responsiblity towards their community and society a whole . the can not live isolated from the problem of their surroundings . just a little caring attitude can do wonder for them and society a a whole .
