some people say that it is more important for student to understand idea and concept them to learn fact , if i could make decision then i could choose that to learn fact is much important when we l are learning . three most crucial reason why i think fact is much useful are listed a follows , we can associate with society ; we can understand more quickly by handling a situation ; moreover testbook and definition is not always true . one very convicing argument for associating with society is the best way to clarify what is the fact that we will encounter in the future . for example we could meet a lot of people and they can share a lot experient eith u , futhermore no one can deny the fact that associating with society could make u more confidential . a point also very wealth to noticing is that to handle a situation is the shortcut which we could pas the process from textbook . for instance if we learn much more fact or do somemore experiment form lab that can make u understand more faster and make deep impression in our mind , furthermore in some part of department fact is always more important then idea and concept , only by doing yourself that could help you more . last but not the list , all of we know that idea and concept just similar a definition in testbook , not everlasting true , and much of then we can not prove it , a examplification from a brightly frame of reference it is no way to prove why e = mcsquare . moreover if we dought about that and no mathod to prove we will feel distress . in summary i protest the point that ideal and concept are more important then to learn fact , a i mentioned sometimes concept are no more reliable but perilous to u if we have no opportunity to prove that . after all to learn fact is much bet
