i have always studied in school which asked student to understand idea instead of learning fact with no reflexion . i am well-aware of the advantage in understandind idea . i can also imagine the advantage in learning fact . there are strong advantage in learning fact . the first point i would like to make is that it is an excellent way to get a large general culture . understanding idea take time whereas learning fact can be quite quick . thus people can learn more thing . another argument is that in life , people do not need to prove exact information because it ha been already proved and all they have to do is using information for a particular purpose . for instance , in my school , general culture and history test were usually multiple-choice test because knowning the fact wa the most important point . if there are strong advantage in learning fact , there are some even more compelling advantage in understanding idea . first , even if it can be long , people get a better memory of these fact because they have understood the concept and in the case they have forgotten the fact , they can be able to find it out . secondly , people can more adequately use these fact because they know how the whole theory work . for example , i once had to cope with an intricate math problem and i knew all the proof and concept for each formula . therefore it wa very clear for me how to use them and i finally reached the solution . to conclude , i think that it is far more important to understand idea that to learn fact . learning fact give a larger general culture but people will maybe not able to use it adequately . understanding idea give important asset to cope with problem , which is very important in active life .
