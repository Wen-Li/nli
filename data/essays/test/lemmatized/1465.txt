in my opinion there are no sign why the number of car should decrease in the next twenty year . at first there is a common growth in world population even the number is declining in the industrial state . as this is no sign for more car of course you have to regard the development of china for exemple . its cross domestic product is increasing with seven per cent a year what mean they are able to buy more consumption product involving car . even local car producer see china a the futur market and build facility there . what count for china is also considerable for india and other asian country . moreover there are no alternative for mid ranging destination . the bus support in bigger city is well developped and to reach other city you can go by train or airplane but the one living in the wide spread suburb are forced to take the car . but in fact they are not only forced to do so , they want to because it is much more convinient . you do not have to wait for the bus and you can go everywhere because the street allow you to . another aspect that prevents the car from vanishing is more in people 's head . cars are symbol for the wealth and the social status of their owner which affect especially men and can not be denied . this lead to buying behaviour that no bike will ever cause . as a summary you can say that there are many good reason why car will remain part of our society for at least the next few decade , even if oil is running out soon engeneers are searching for method ( like hydrogen ) to keep the car running .
