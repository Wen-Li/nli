i agree with the statement that say that successful people try new thing and take risk . in this essay i will explain my opinion briefly . first , i believe that any successful man is creative . a person who take the oppotunity coming his way and change it to the form that is useful for him . for example , i have a friend who is very creative and good worker . she wa emploeyed in a clinic building , and she wa not happy about her job . she tried to open a restaurant without having any knowledge in that field . she worked for a while in a restaurant , and then she opened hers . she wa very successful in her business . she improved her income to a big extent . second reason that hold my opinion is that many people who do not try new thing remain stuck to their condition . for example , my cousin ha been working a a cook for more than 20 year , and he will never change because he doe not like to experience new thing . third , life is very short but it give the desire for the people who work diligently . if anyone doe not take chance in his life , his life will be boring and he will not be able to improve it . if a person work hard in his field without changing or trying new thing , he will end up a a failure . in conclusion . if you want to be successful in your life , you should take chance an try new thing in your life . otherwise you will end up with the same man who never change .
