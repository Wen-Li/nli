some people say that learning fact is more important than understatnd idea and concept . however , it is more imporatant to understand idea and concept . truly , student need to learn the basic fact . but there are more importatnt reason to understand the idea . first , they are more likly better understand what the text book say . second , it is helpful for student to organize and remerber what they stuied . first of all , by understandind the idea student can apply that idea on other field . and it will make student better understand not only their field but also other area . let me take my experiance for example . when i wa in a first year of the university , i took two elctive couses . one wa art and philosophy and the other wa customes inthe contemporary sciety . in the former class there are a lot of reqiurement to undersandig the idea . at first it wa callenging but in the end i got valuable information . next , when student just learn about fact , they cram right befre the test . and after the exam they about what they studied . but understanding idea take much longer time to understand . and that would be offer more chance to think and imagine in various manner . a a result , they can remeber well what tey stuied . according to recent study released by korean national reserch center ninety percent of of survayed student reveal much more high grade than thoes who just learn fact . this show that understanning idea is far more important .
