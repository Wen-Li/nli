`` the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide '' . i partially agree with the above statement . every individual have their own opinion and their own intersts regarding the tour . some people dont feel comfortable in a group and some feel more comfortable in a group . people who want to know everything about a place would prefer a travel guide with them . for example , some people feel to explore the historical place . they may be interested in knowing the history of the place and the myth behind the construction and the monument . for such people , a travel guide would be much helpful . he would help the tourist to know the significance of the place and also the story behind each construction . this help the tourist to gain the knowledge regarding the art and culture of that place . the people who travel with their family in a vacation for a limited period of time would mostly prefer a tour guide . they feel that they have le time and should explore the whole place without wandering unnecessarily here and there . some people like to know the place on their own and explore the finest part of the place . they feel uncomfortable in a group . the person may be interested in some place and the tourist may explain le about that place . sometimes the person may feel to enjoy the beauty of the place and would prefer privacy . but the group tour doesnt alloe it . the tourist may also get bored on listening to the word of a tour guide . some people may travel to the place very familiar to them like devotional place and the place near to the residence . this kind of travelling doe not require a tour guide . its just waste of money .
