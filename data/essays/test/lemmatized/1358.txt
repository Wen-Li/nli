in my opinion it is important to take risk in order to be a successful person . i therefore agree with the statement that successful people more often try new thing . in order to be a successful person you need to risk chance and try thing out . ( it also matter that if you are financially successful person and the cushion you land on by failing is softer . ) as long a you do only what you know how to do there is le chance of failure , but also limited chance to reach a new level of business , understanding or even a new continent . if christopher columbus would n't have risked his health , the money of his king and a lot of time , he would n't have found america . and in this example the failure of the contract wa a story of success in itself . therefore the tale of success is often a story of taking chance whose outcome is not clear . a person will be even more successful if entering space that no one ha entered before - taking the road le traveled - , it doe n't matter if it is a continent or a new invention in a laboratory . another reason for the conheritance of success and risk-taking is that successful people are more self-confident . a good confidence in yourself and the world is extremely important to take chance , but also to win people over with your idea . if columbus would n't have been self-confident he would n't have persuaded the spanish king in giving him money and ship . the story of success , being self-confident and taking risk therefore is linked .
