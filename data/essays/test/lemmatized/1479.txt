i am not very sure that it will be really so . it depences a lot even by the area that we considere . if we look at the city , this statement could be true , because several people that in past preferred to move by their car , today try to use more autobus , train , ecc . .. this is possible nowadays thanks to the new technology available that make train , plane and autobus faster and more secure . many city have spent a lot of money to power their service of public transport . in other area where we can see a le density of people , and where train and autobus line are not very efficient , the number of car is not decreasing for my experience . with a car anyone is able to arrive in the right place without the risk of rain or traffic that he can meet on foot from the station to the right place . we must considere too , for my personal thinking , that the rate of young people who become able to drive is greater than the rate of ancient people who lose their ability . the modern culture , and probably more money available today , bring a father to buy a car for every son . so , probably , in same case the number of car on the street is increasing , a behaviour that i see everyday on my town . even if i hope that it wa only a my own impression , because i think that 99 % of our city ca n't satisfy the increasing request of service from the driver .
