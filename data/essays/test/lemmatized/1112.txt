i agree to the given statement that `` the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide . '' traveeling in a group ha many advantage when compared to travelling independently . if we are travelling a a group there is a tour guide who explains all the place history and significance of the place better than any one . a tour guide know each and every thing about the place which we are visiting and he explains the significance and history about the place . the problem of language is also avoided by travelling in a group led by tour guide because guide explains those thing in a language known to many people . generally guide know many language because he should have to handle with different nation of people . the chance of missing of people is also avoided because guide take care of the people he is leading . if we prefer travelling independently there is a chance of missing some significant place because we do not all the significant place in a place where we are travelling . a tour guide help u in making arrangement for accommodation and food facility . a tour guide naturally do not miss any significant place . he know how to arrange the travelling plan such a when and where should we go , on what criterion should we choose to see place . a tour guide lead the group and control all the people in the group efficiently . if we are visting any foreign country , hiring a tour guide and travelling a a group help in many way that there is no chance of dealing with individual tension . we can enjoy the tour with no tension because all facility will be provided by tour guide by making arrangement for accommodation and food facility . inspite of these benefit the major advantage is that we get to know the history of the place we are visiting , in an interesting manner told by a tour guide . for all these reason i agree to the statement that `` the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide .
