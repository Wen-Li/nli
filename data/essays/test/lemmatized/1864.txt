in the modern society almost all company rely on advertismets to promote thier product or serveces . this make adverisments company to whatever they can , to make product or serveces apeal to the consumer . because of that , there is a big debate wheater adevertisments make product seem much better than the really are . in my opinion , i gree with people . who say advertisments make product seem much better than they really are , for many reason . the first reason is that , they show only the possitive side of the product . thus , these comopanies decieve people and not showing the other side . for instance , a clothes soap company might decieve people by only saying that this product can clean all hard dirt in your clothes , and not showing that it may spoil some kind of clothes . in addition , these company decieve people by exagurating on the positive side of the product . for example , i saw a commercial about an acne treatment . in this commercial they say , this treatment cure any one who is suffering from acne . in fact , i bought this product and i tryed it , but it did not help me . another reason is that , many company prefer to target childern because they can be decieved easly . thus , these company put a lot of advertisments in cartoon on t.v . in fact , these advertisments are not only on t.v . they are everywhere in the road billboard to target childern . there is a strong evedince to support that if you look at the new generation of childern , you will recognize how they differ from the older one . these childern love the phrase `` i want '' . they ask thier parants for many thing . all of that because of the decieptive advertisments , which target childern . overall , these company love mony more than any thing else , which make them decieptive . they decieve people by exaguration and not saying the side effect of the product . in addition . they have created a new generation of childern , which these childern ask parent for a lot of product to buy , by targeting them in thier deciptive advertisments .
