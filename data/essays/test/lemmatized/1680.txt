do you believed that there is a serious problem in our education that student are taught to the test ? unfortunately , since our society ha became so test-oriented , student nowadays are busy remembering fact instead of give their own opinion and idea , worsely , they lack of the ability of critical thinking . as far a i am concerned , i support the idea that it is more crucial for student to understand idea and concept than learning fact , and the following are the reason why . first of all , i think that learning fact alone doe not do any good for student , because student tend to forget those trivial detail a soon a they leave school . i remeber when i wa a high school student , i crammed a lot date of history event and content in my textbook in order to get good score on exam . however , i realized how useless those fact were when i found myself no longer remember them since i graduated and it doe not affect my life . secondly , i think student should try to figure out solution to problem on their own . developing such ability requires them to understand thing from different perspective . sometimes the idea can be so difficult that they have to work in group and it become a great opportunity for them to learn how to cooperate which teamwork is greatly appreciated in today 's society . all in all , i conclude that learning fact alone would kill the creativity of student and restrict their thinking . the successful education should teach student how to think not how to cram fact for test .
