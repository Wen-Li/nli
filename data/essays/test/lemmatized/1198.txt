while some people say that successful people try new thing and take risk rather than only doing what they already know how to do well , i strongly believe that successful people do not always try new thing or take risk . to begin with , some people succeed because they have creativity or imagination a little different from everyone else . for instance , 10 year ago , there were a lot of social networking service company in japan . in that situation , no one could predict which company would succeed because there were not any difference in their business . among them , a company , mixci , became only on successful company in japan because it advertisement way wa a little different from other competitor . it targeted only young japanese people . there wa not any drastic difference between the company 's ad way and that of competitor . the difference wa in it target . in view of this , i believe creativity a little different from others are the most important factor to succeed . furthermore , some people succeed by utilizing risk sharing method . to illustrate , in business some entrepreneur begin and succeed their business by the help of venturer capitalist . according to the survey conducted by a famous japanese newspaper company , about 80 percent of the start-up company listed in tokyo stock exchange were helped by venturer capital or other investor when they started their business . in view of this , taking risk doe not always lead business to succeed . in conclusion , i strongly support the thought that successful people do not always try new thing and take risk . i believe that successful people have creativity and imagination a little different from other ordinary people .
