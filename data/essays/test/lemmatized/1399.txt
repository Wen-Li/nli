on the television , on the radio , newspaper , magazine , billboard , in short everywhere we see the advertisement . companies are spending incredible amount of money to advertise their product and when doing this i believe that most of the time they exaggerate their product . i do strongly agree with the idea that most advertisement show product much better than they really are . in most of the advertisement , the thing that is shown or said is not incorrect but incomplete . for instance , there is a prophylactic vaccine which is against cervical cancer in woman . cervical cancer is mainly caused by a virus called hpv . this virus ha several different type . the vaccine , gardasil , prevents woman only being infected by two type of hpv . on the advertisement , it is expressed that gardasil provides a hundred percent protection . this is not false but of course lead to misunderstanding . when my mother had seen this advertisement she , just like most of the other people , thought that vaccine is preventing completely against cervical cancer . however , in reality , vaccine is only preventing completely to be infected by those two type of hpv . those two type cause approximately seventy percent of all cervical cancer , not the hundred percent ! in some other advertisement , they try to show how effective their product are . for example , they say that their toothpaste provides you white and shiny teeth in a sort time . during this , some thing that is written in a very small font pass through the screen very fast and nobody can read it . it may be written that the product give the result after 10 year of use ! it is appearent that some word like `` short time '' can change from person to person . in conclusion , in most of the advertisement they try to make the customer perceive the property of the product a they wish . customers need to be very careful about what is being shown or said in the advertisement , and even search for the detail .
