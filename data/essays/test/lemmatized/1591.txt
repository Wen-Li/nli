this is an important topic , and i suppose it ha been discussed for year and that will be discussed for year to come by professor and all the people involved in the teaching and learning system . but , in my opinion , there could be no doubt of which is best for student . i am sure that is far more important for student to understand concept and idea , rather than simple fact . that way , they not only learn new thing , but also learn to think and to develope their imagination and ceativity . take for instance the example of a student in the secondary school that is preparing a history exam . if he only learn the fact of what he is reading , say for instance , the french revolution , he probably wo n't understand the development of event and the effect that they have in modern history . by thinking about the idea and concept that are the basement of the revolution , he would be able to get a more useful picture of the topic , he will probably remember more thing , and above all it will be useful for his life . talking about imagination , i can say that is also another desirable effect of understanding idea . take for example the gravity law : if a student only focus his attention in the unit used to express the acceleration of gravity , and such technical detail , he will probably miss the core of the thing . gravity is something that involves everyhing in our world , and is most important to understand it effect and implication than if it is expressed in foot or meter . and imagination come there to help understand all of this . when talking about creativity , i can give an illustrating example that clarifies it . think about great inventor , like benjamin franklin . by understanding idea and putting them togheter in new way , he wa able to achieve very relavant invention and technical advancement that are today still used . on the whole , i would say that we should pay more attention to this topic , and focus our effort to giving the student the tool they need to understand thing , not only remember them like a robot could do .
