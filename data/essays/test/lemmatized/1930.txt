i agree with the idea that advertisement sometimes mislead people or cause them to misunderstood the feature of product . mainly , advertisors used lightning and camera technique , relative size technique and attractive scenery for that purpose . in advertisement , worker often use technologically improved light and camera diffrent from the one we use in our house . thus , these professional equipment show everything shiny and beatiful . even a sewer can be presented a a prosperous liveplace . for example , the advertisement about the car will be misleading generally . because , in these type of advertisemets , the car are always presented a shiny , with a smooth and gently curved surface . however , if you stop by an automoblie gallery and see these car , you will think that they are not a attractive a they seem . in addition to camera technique , producer advertise their product by using relativly large or small object in the advertisement . for instance , if they want to sell a mobile phone , which is expected to be small , they prepare an adversitement with a tall people , whose hand is absolutely larger than ours , then we can think of that the mobile phone is really small . you can think this small mobile phone is attractive and suitable for you , but that is not the case . or , they can want to sell a relatively big car and want to emphasize that it is big , they prepare an advertisement with full of little child , instead of driving in vast desert . hence , a person which like bigger car can be misleaded by this advertisement . the size is one aspect of scenery ; however , not completely . the color and shape of surroundings are also used a a technique . for example , one company want to present it new product which is a candy . they can advertise it by putting into a colorful and round shaped surrounding ; hence , you can think that it is tasty and sweet . however , after buying these candy , most probably , you do not think about the candy a you did before . consequently , advertisors and company are using several technique to make the product seem attractive ; however , it is misleading generally .
