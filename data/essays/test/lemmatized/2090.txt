in a society that stress individualism , the complaint that young people were reluctant to engage in social work rise . the following essay is dealing with the resulting question whether young people give enough time to helping their community . i clearly disagree with this statement . in my opinion , various project are initiated by young people to enforce social interaction in community . many school offer so called `` compassion project '' to their student . these project are voluntary and free the student from class simultaneously in order to make time for any social activity . these can be carried out in hospital , asylum home or other social institution part of the community . at my school , such a project wa a full success . more that 90 % of the student enrolled in the program even planning the next project to come . also , an exhibition wa organized . the student and the school administration a well see clear advantage of being socially active : the acquired soft skill are highly benefical when it come to applying for a job . companies often require people that are motivated in social interaction . especially in leader position like the profession of a ceo or manager , those core quality are necessary to handle a job with challenging demand . students are aware of these advantage and are more than eager to learn these skill by helping the community . another reason for my opinion , that young people indeed engage in social activity supporting the community , is the personal benefit . young adult that carry out social work , experience not only advantage in their career , but also in aspect of their own personal development . learning how to deal with people in need , such a homeless people or elderly , will improve the person 's ability to deal with problem . those problem may include social communication and interaction . if i will encounter a situation with a friend in need , i will be a better listener and comforter after having learned how to be in such a position in a social setting . other than that , i will learn to reflect on my own need and solve personal conflict . young people often face the question of identity . `` who am i , where am i going ? '' social engagement will surely help to answer this question . young adult will be able to identify their position in society when being exposed to different kind of people part of the society . usually , young adult are not dealing with people like homeless or other member of the society that are sort of outcast . as a consequence , young people will gain an insight on society 's problem and in what way they are personally affected by them . another consequence may be a self-reflection and answer to the question `` who am i ? '' allover , i am strongly convinced that young adult are giving enough devocation to helping their community for the reason stated and discussed above . those young people will make the world be a better place .
