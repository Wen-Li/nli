i do agree with the above statement and at the same do not completely disagree with it . advertisements do make much better than they really are . for example a great industry with very good fame and heavy background advertises their product with heavy publicity . when the item is being released in the market with great starcasting they bring an impact on the public that the produt is very good even though if it is not that good and this is only due to the publicity given by them through advertising . public is going to be finally affected by the seeing the advertisement . many product are being released in the market everday , but every product is not such worth and that useful to the public . most of them are worthless , they are only good for advertising and not for usage . for example the a wire shown in an advertisement may be very strong to say , but when coming to the general usage it might not have that impact a advertised . coming to the positive side of it , whenever there is an introduction of any new product then without any knowledge of the product no costumer is going to buy it . so advertising doe not always mislead u , but may even give u the knowledge about the product . treating every advertisement to be the same might again mislead u . as every outcome ha two result and the end result depends only on the way way we take it , the work of an individual is to get knowledge about the product not only from the advertisement . gathering knowledge only through advertisement is the worst procedure of gaining knowledge . cosidering an item to be the best is not finalized by the advertisement but done by the end user .
