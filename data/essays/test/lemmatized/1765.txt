today all the people are influenced by medium . everywhere we can see spot , pubblicity , photo , movie of a lot of product . these are used to make know the product , but often they are used to make appear the product better than in reality . people are always attracted by these thing . a normal person in front of the television can see everyday so many spot to can dream product in the night . more the spot is good , more the person think the product is better . the product will no be the same betwenn advertisement and reality . infact today nobody who want make profit doesn-t lie . everywhere for all the thing that a person could by , there is a businness . on the contrary in it isn-t always like this . in fact we can find product which are the same of the advertisement but this is follow by the expensive price of them . not all the people can buy these expensive product even if they want quality product . so there is everywhere and there will be everywhere somebody who will try to sell a product le expensive than the others and with the same quality . but really only sometimes it-s true cause he-ll use all that he could for make you believe it . and at last a person who doesn-t work in this farm can-t know the reality quality of the product . so , year after year there were some mark which take more place , and today when one buy something , he know what he buy only with the writes of the mark on the product . an adulct can know in part what thw product is in reality , but not the child who dream with beautiful spot . in the end i can say everybody know what is better , but only when one look for the money in the bag he can choice to know what is really better .
