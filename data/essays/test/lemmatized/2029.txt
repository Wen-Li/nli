as the world change and time becomes an ever-important resource , the value of such time increase a a consequence . i believe that there is a shifting equilibrium point between the time one can dedicate to work , to himself and to others . employment data show that the marketplace is always more competitive . young people , who typically lack professional experience , have a hard time entering and remaining in the job market . obtaining a job position in line with one 's personal education and commitment is essential in conducting a good life , so it remains a primary goal . the increasing level of competition mean that reaching this goal requires more and more time . the consequence of this increase in effort is the fact that the time left for oneself or for others ( such a community ) is on a steady decline . i do not support the idea , though , that this time is `` not enough '' unless the ( rather poor ) general idea that it is `` never enough '' is given for granted . as the value of personal free time increase , so doe the value of such time when it is spent helping others , such a community or anyone in need . if our grandparent , working 40 hour per week , used to do , say , 4 hour per week of community work , i believe that young people nowadays working 60 hour per week ( in order to keep a good job ) doing 2 hour per week of community work are actually doing even more than our grandparent used to ! i believe the original statement might be more reasonable if it wa changed into something like this : young people nowadays do not have enough time to help their community a it once wa possible . the issue on whether this reduction in personal free time is socially appropriate or acceptable is not an issue to be discussed in this essay , but i believe that it is the central point around which the underlying issue of the original statement revolves .
