it is true that advertising make product seem better . in fact , i believe that this ha become one of the main purpose of modern advertising . while it is true that the original goal of advertising wa to spread the knowledge of a particular product , it ha now lost this function . food product , for example , are difficult to promote on television because the medium can not convey how they smell . the fact that producer are forced to rely on image only ha caused the birth of a whole business dedicated only to producing fake good-looking food . it is well known , in fact , that the hamburger shown in advertisement are made of plastic material . the human mind can be easily influenced by the eye if what is seen conforms to the expectation of a person . as an example , the cheese in real cheeseburger is not so yellow , tidy and perfectly square a what can be seen in promotional picture , but the mind associate good look with good taste and a person can then feel attracted by plastic cheese and repelled by the picture of real cheese . another reason for this new trend in advertising can be found in the excessive competion . there are many product on the market that are essentially the same . when different company copy each other , they can only rely on advertising to make the general public believe that their product is superior . this is what happens , for example , with buiscuits . there are certain type of buiscuits that are undistinguishably produced by many competitor . statistics show that the average customer prefers to buy buiscuits produced by famous firm , attribuing the differnce in price from other , cheaper buiscuits to a difference in quality . this reasoning is actually influenced by the sheer amount of advertising he ha been subjected to about famous product . although genuine adversting can still be seen , the very nature of the market ha changed the business and promotional image and video are almost always an exageration of the quality of the product .
