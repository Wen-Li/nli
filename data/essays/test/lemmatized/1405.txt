in order to ass the statement above it is necessary to clarify the purpose of advertisement in general and the way that the advertised product are presented a being ` better ' . first , the general purpose of advertisement is to enhance sale by making the product recognizable and differenciatable from others . a way that this goal can be reached is by claiming that the product is ` better ' than all other comparable product on the market - or even better than itself actually is . second , the term ` better ' allows many interpretation : a product can be better by being cheaper , more convenient , of more use for health and so on . the question is why these exaggeration are used on purpose when it come to advertisement . take the example of bp . while the abbreviation formerly stood for `` british petrolium '' it now stand for `` beyond petrolium '' . with this change in corporate language bp try to get rid of the rather bad reputation that oil company have in the age of environmental awareness . for this reason , bp claim to be a ` green company ' in it advertisement while in fact the percentage of alternative energy within the company 's portfolio add up to only 3 percent . this exceeds by large the amount of damage that is done by bp 's classical oil business . another example is the trend in nutrition , when for instance nestle us extra ingredient in order to enhance a product 's effect on e.g. the immune system . while it 's been proven that they have some effect , it 's also true that these product usually contain lot of sugar - therefore undermining the positive effect the added ingredient promise . so , why do bp or nestle try to enhance their reputation by appearing to contribute more to the environment or health than they actually do ? because the buyer or investor can usually be convinced easily by advertisement . only few people actually make the effort to check the statement made in the advertisement by looking into the balance sheet or the nutrition fact . therefore , in the eye of most buyer or investor , advertisement make the product ( or company ) appear in a much better light than they are worth it . since this contributes to the enhancement in sale and in turn fit the general purpose of advertisement , i have to agree with the given statement that most advertisement make produkts seem better than they are .
