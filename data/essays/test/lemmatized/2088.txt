i will have to say that i strongly agree with this statement . it reflects the feeling that many u carry everytime we encounter an advertisement . contrary to what society want u believe , most advertisement make product seem much better that what they really are . many of the enterprise which conduct such act are mostly in the fast food , internet , and automotive area . probably the most typical of them all are the fast foods empire , they always try to sell their food a the best food around so they display it in a really appreciable manner . pretty much everytime you walk into a restaurant they display their food , they always look really good , big , and tasty . then when you actually get it doe not look at all like the one advertised , it look small , like if it wa done in hurry . well this pretty much the story for every fast food restaurant out there . internet provider also tend to such thing too , they always say they have the best high speed internet service in the market but when you actually get it is pretty much a slow a the other one . it is really unfair but with some research it can be avoided automotive company try to sell their car by comparing their car with a similar one from another auto maker . they always go at each other in attemps to sell their product . this technique work , the only person who end up loosing is the consumer because they might not get what they were looking for . sometimes when you first test drive a car it feel awsome , and then when you actually own that same car it never feel at all like that first time . all these enterprise use this technique of advertising in attemps to sell their product . i will have to say that it is definitely not the fair whey to do it but , it is what they do to sell . the only whey we can beat them is by beign more intelligent than them , we can do this by doing some research before we buy a product . their are many magazine available now to such research , they are really beneficial .
