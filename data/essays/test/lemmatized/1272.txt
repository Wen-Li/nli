advertisements are used to introduce product to the customer . companies spend a lot of money for advertisement to make their brand familiar to the customer that result with higher profit . but to reach their goal they try every option including being dishonest . i agree that most advertisement make product seem much better than they really are . first of all , they show what they want u to see . for instance , if the product is a shampoo they show a girl with a wanderfull hair or if the product is a toohtpaste this girl have theeth brighter than star . everybody know that the advertisement ha light trick and nobody can have such a beautiful hair ot theeth . or they show a product 's only good part . in the case of electronic good , it is harder to make the product seem better because there are quantitative value that they have to give like the ram capacity of a laptop and these have guarentee but , in this case they can make the external look of the laptop much better than it really is . secondly , some advertisement demonstrates experiment that are done with the product to be more accurate , which we can not be sure that these experiment are real or not . for example , in a detergent commercial they wash two identically dirty cloth with two detergent and they show that their detergent clean the cloth better . but i can never believe the experiment is really conducted a they show u . thirdly , some clothing company make their clothes to fit their model whose size are really rare and very proportional . when i look at the chatalogs or commercial i saw wanderfull clothes and when i try them they do n't fit me . as a result , company are trying to convince people that their product are best but they are usuallt tricking u with unactual information about them . although some standard that they have to obey for customer right , they always find a way to show their good much better .
