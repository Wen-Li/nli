with the way technology is advancing today car surely do not seem to be the norm of tommorow . the ever increasing traffic jam and road block have led to irritation among people and diverted their choise of transportation . with the advancement in technology , smaller and more efficient machine and equipment are being developed every day . this trend is most likely to spread to our vehicle too . who would want to move about in 3 ton vehicle in the 22nd century ? infact , people have already started getting irritated by the traffic jam and road block which take away a majority of their time . but , of course , we have no choise . maybe this will not be the cenario a few decade later . given an option i surely would never waste hour driving to work or back home . with the advent of wireless technology , everything is available at fingertip and it is predicted that future will see more and more people working from home rather than go to the office . also , home service system are developing and even today many people just order thier food , clothes or accesories right at home . so if you can do just about everything by simply switching on your computer then very few people would opt to travel in order to get these facillities . moreover , is n't the metro system developing rapidly ? with the reduced cost of travelling by train or other mode of transportation , i firmly believe the importance of car will reduce dramatically in future . then again , is n't it more convenient to use transport where you do not have drive ? the future also promise to bring new gadget and machine which we can not even think of today . perhaps a device which can help you travel to any place on earth within moment will be devolped . maybe something like the information travel through wireless or maybe asomething like a timemachine which just need a click of button to take you anywhere you want . but for now we can only wait and watch . in contrast , to reducing need of using a car a a mean of transportaion , there will always be atleast a few of those crazy about car . these people will make sure that car do not become a history . those who just love driving these four wheeled motor vehicle will surely use it , if not merely a mean of transportation but a a luxury or fancy item . a perfect example of such car crazy men are those who collect the old modeled car of 1850s and 1900s . they do this certainly not because they ca n't afford better tranportation a these car are far more expensive than those available in market today . so why do they do it ? the answer is simple , extreme love for car . to sum up , i would say that even though the number of car in the future are going to decrease we may never see a complete extinction of the most prefferable and widely used mean of travel today .
