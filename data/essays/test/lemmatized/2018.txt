i mostly agree with this statement that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their community . this kind of i dea is said at everywhere and becoming a huge problem . the reason i used the word `` mostly '' is because i used to give much time to helping my community when i wa in elementaly school . i participated in a lot of community event such a valleyball game and road race by the sea and the volunteer recicle and so on . i had so much fun at the time , and i think i wa somewhat helping the community . but since i became a junior high school student , i get not to participate in any community event , because i get too much work to do for myself rather than for my community . this can be said for everyone else . and i also have other reason for making this statement more reasonable . as long a i know , there is no interesting information about community 's event . nobody would even know how to help community . i previously wrote why i think no young people give much time to helping their communication but now i can put some example for what happened in result of the little or no help for communication . the first one is at the disaster such a at fire or some scientic erruption . the result of young people 's no help made disaster more terrific because they have the most strongest power . the second example is what happened in my city . since they do n't participate in any event which community held , the most event became only for elder people ; this led le young people participate in . from these fact and example for the result , we can see that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their community .
