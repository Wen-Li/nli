first of all , i 'd like to say that i am a student , i am 22 year old and i consider myself one of the young people that i 'm going to write about . i do not totally disagree with the opinion that young people today tend not to dedicate some of their time to helping their community , but i think that this happens for a reason . the following reason and example support this opinion . firstly , i think that a lot of young people do their best both to be good at school and to do service for the community , but it is true that they also give importance to staying with their friend and having fun . maybe , something that differs from the past is the amount of time that is dedicated to this purpose . until a few year ago , there wa no television , no videogames : the family and the community played a more central role in the everyday life of a child or of a teenager . nowadays there are so many leisure activity directed to young people that they tend to prefer to spend their time playing with their playstations rather than volunteering in an hospital . another point that i would like to make is that young people do have a lot of thing to do . for instance , they are expected to get good mark at school , to do well in their sport team , and often at the end of the day they prefer to just relax . however , i see around me a lot of teenager helping in activity such a entertaining the elderly , helping in keeping the neighbourhood clean , organizing activity for the community . recently in my town a group of youngster ha organized a little association that aim at helping people that want to stop using drug . sometimes i think that adult ask a lot from young people of my generation , without realizing that they are already doing their best for themselves and to improve the world around them .
