advertisement these day are the main source by which a seller could attract the maximum intention of the consumer.a seller could grab the interest of the consumer through avertisement . i agree with this statement that most advertisement make product seem much better than they really are . seller these day spend huge amount of money in order to launch their product in the market in which their product image increase so they find advertisement a the best source . a million of people watch telivision daily so it the best way . but generally most advertisement make a false image in front of the consumer . they will tell u about it positive effect but will exclude it side effect a their poppularity of the product will decrease . for example the advertisement of fair cream . they will present their product in this form that it is the best of all the product and ha no side effect . they will not even tell u about the harmful chemical which are added in it . so by this meathod a consumer is cheated . but some advertisement do form a true image in front of the public . for example renouned brand such a nike , reebok , they have their reputition for their quality product . they will exclude making false statement . but most of the company today dont care about the quality of the product and will tend making low quality product and selling them by making false image of their product through advertisement . another good example of false advertisement is various scheme launched by the company with thier product such a if one buy thier product he or she will get a free scratch card by which one could win a handfull amount of money . but all these scheme are shown in the advertisement in order to make thier product different and to increase the sale of their product . so from the above example i conclude that advertisement are generally preferd by the seller to make it product different and attractive in front of the public .
