as ypu know , people can work in a group because they can make it more wonderful , but travel is not by together to make it wonderful or safely . if you fell great , the trip is successful . that 's why i do n't agree with that the best way to travel is in a group by a tour guide . some year before , my parent and i get into a group to visit australia . we visit many beautiful place , but we ca n't get time to visit the place where we like . when you get into a group to somewhere to visit . you have to listen to the guide , what he say are almost business thing sound like where can by some gift and many more information that we can do nothing . in then next , when one come to anothere city or country , the first thing he will do is learn about local cuture . you can not to buy something or just walk and walk , because you want to learn about it . you must not to get there to eat fastfood for learning local culture . in the third , you need to rest in yout trip , and not to get busy in your trip . travel in a group led by a tour guide can also make you to feel your trip is too short and too busy to enjoy your trip . not only can it make you unhappy , but also it can make you tired . if you travel by yourself or by a group which only are your friend , you can feel relaxed , and taht maje you put more metion to your next work . that 's all of my opinion , nejoy yout trip in yourselves life , how fun you can get is only by yourself . i am love in this travel style , what about you ? let it to be .
