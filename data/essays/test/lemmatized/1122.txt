like the elderly people say : the world ha been changed . nowadays people are more busy with their job and themselves . everyone is complaning about something which they have faced with , but they are not listening to others about what they are complaining . the new generation , the young people are the best example of people who applies this kind of behavior : they are the most changed and most adapted to new world , afterall . we all see teenager when traveling by bus , railroad or another another mean of transport : they all wear earphone and listen to their own music . if a burglar steal the bag of the man who walk behind them , they will not even recognise this event happened . this is a simple example of teenager became unaware and indifferent of their community . we also see many other situation which teenager take part in : a college student is on a bus which is full , but he ha a seat , he ha worn all of his brend new clothes , probably he is going to meet some of his friend and go to the cinema or have fun in a some different way . an old woman get on the bus , she ha a limp , she walk really slow and she hardens herself to walk a quickly a she can for not to wait the bus . there is no vacant seat so she is standing . the boy recognises the woman , but he is pretending like he is unaware of her getting on the bus , just to keep on sitting . the worst of all , young generation is quite unaware of that is happening around the world , or even in their country . even celebrity . as it is asked to britney spears that if she is supporting the war between america and iraq , she say ` if president bush support it , it is ok` . she doe not even have her own argument about such a big event ! to sum up , the world keep changing , but the path it follows doe not seem bright . there is a thing must be done : this genereation must be helped to realize that the world is living and also they are living in this living world . humanity is a society , and a society ha to share many thing together . as all people combined themselves in such a way , people , especially young people can not behave so selfish .
