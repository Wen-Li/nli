in my opinios , i prefer having broad knowledge of many academic subject rather than to specilize in one specific subject because of importance of academic age . there are several reason . first , a narrow knowledge field may occur of narrow seesight . the man who know only one field called `` l '' typed human . vertical section of `` l '' show various field , and horizonal field show are amount of knowledge . because the `` l '' typed human doe not know another area , they cound not work another area . it may be a extremely penalty . i recommand `` a '' typed human or `` h '' typed human having two or more specialize skill or ha not only specified skill but also related skill . these tyoed human can adopt every position , and may found their new potential . for example , i majored computer science , but i alwals ha a question about another potential . i studied various subject , a a result i could cook , actor and master of takwondo . second , a you would like to become a specialist , you should know about all the field related to your subject . for instance , if you like to become a best network engineer , it is impossible to know about the network . for the efficient transmit/receive mechanism , you should know the hardware architecture ; for the reduce of problem such a bottle neck , you should understand not only memory architecture but also operating system ; if you get a software showing gool performance you doe not know about network , you should know software engineering . in addition , if you would like a good project conclusion , you need to know the activity a a team management . if you doe not various field , you could not lead your team composed psesons having various skill . all clue written on upper thesis must study at a academic age . in academic age , it is a best age to study abroad , so all student in a university doe not lazy to studying an abroad subject . you had better having a broad knowledge of many academic subject .
