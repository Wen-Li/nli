in my oppinion each successful person is different . on the one hand there are a lot of sucessful people who try new thing , take risk , invent something unique and get famous . on the other hand there are many people who try the same thing and turn out not to be sucessful . being sucessful is not just a matter of who you are what you exactly do it is also a lot about having luck . luck could mean you have fortunate relationship like relative that are in high position and can help you to get in an important position a well . that would be the opposite side of the statement because that would be an example for a person who might become successful but ha never stepped out of his comfort zone . there are people who have certain talent but these talent will never be discovered because they do not get the chance to get into the needed position . there might be a woman in india with the most beautiful voice . she might be hundert time better then many successful popstars but she will never get the chance to show that . maybe she is poor and ha to nurture her 4 child . it doe not matter how risky she would be : chances are very low she could ever leave her country . she is simply in the wrong time at the wrong place . i can not agree or disagree with that stament . i have seen people who have been successful because they took risk but then i have also seen people who have taken risk to become successful and have poorly failed . before a person make a decision he should consider if he can life with all possible consequence and if the success is worth taking these risk .
