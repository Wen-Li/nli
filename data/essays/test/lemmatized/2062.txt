people can nowadays interest themselves and study whatever subject they want , thanks to the internet . the widespread idea is that this is a good thing . but what about the academic subject ? do we have to try to learn a bit of the broader range of subject or specialize our study in a single way ? i do believe that we should try hard to have knowledge on several academic subject . being a generalist allows you to make your future safer . let 's imagine that i have chosen to study nuclear science only and that , in ten year a world agreement will forbid the use of such a power - even if it is not about to become real at the moment . i will not find any job and i will have to go back to school to study something else or find a job with no special study level required . generally speaking , having a wide knowledge of several academic subject prof that you are a curious person who is not afraid by finding out other domain and who is maybe much more flexible than the others . if you lose your job , you can even find another one in a branch you have studied before . it is a way of being well-more integrated in a society : you can talk to someone whose main interest is formula one such a someome who is keen on the renaissance period . maybe , they will be both brighter in their specific domain , but to their contact you will continue to learn . and this is not the case for people who have a single subject of interest . they eventually are not so-well social integrated . however , we need them for job in the research domain for example which demand a lot of them . but , i personnally could not do that . in conclusion , i need to communicate a lot and express my opinion on any subject , i am so curious that i could not stand specializing in only one domain . that is why i think having a broad knowledege of many academic subject is better .
