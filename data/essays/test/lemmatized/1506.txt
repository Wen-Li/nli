the young age is the most active age in the human life . most people now adays spichally the older people say that young people now adays do not give enough time helping their community , i think that because of the life style of the young people now . i disagree with them because we can not say that all of them are helpless . everybody now can see alot of phiyical job most of the worker are from the young people , forexample i can see most of the policeman or the fireman are young also in the militry . in this example we can see that they can help the government which is part of the community . they also going to university and school , after graduating of course they may take a place in helping the community forexample , i am 20 year old and i wish to study accounting and work in a bank or a big company to help my country grouing that is why i wish to pas the tofel test . in the fisteval time many people can see young boy and girs are working in the summer also in many diffrent place in stade of staying helpless , in the bookshop , supermarket and also the boteeqs . the new generation of the young people have more knowlge of how to use the technology , internet computer and many thing that older people do not know how to use , that 's why we can take advantage of them . as a conclution , i do not think that all of the young people do not have time to help .
