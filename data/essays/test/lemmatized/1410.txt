some people hols the opinion that aadvertisement can make product seem much better , others , however contradict this opinion . as far a i am concerned , i would agree the atatement . in a way , the product ' benefit are enlarged by the advertisement . there are too many reason and example to support my opinion . there are numerous reason why i agree with the above opinion , and i will explain some of the most important one . the main reason is that , most advertisement are overaclaimed . it can be given a concret example , on television , we can offen see the medicine ad . the medicine always be discribed a a magic cure-all . another reason why i advocate the attitude for the above attitude is that it is unreliable for u to trust the advertisement company . those kind of company may speak too much lie in order to sell the production , that would let them make a great amount of money . one very strong argument of a is that , in our country , the government ha not issue the regarding law or rule about the advertisement . this demonstrates the undeniable fact that there would be a lot of unreliable advertisement on our television show . we consumer must chose the good carefully in person in stead of the useless and unbelievable avvertisements . however , a the saying go `` every coin ha two side '' , advertisement also ha adventages , forexample , we can know many information about the good we interested in . we can get a guidance about the world 's fasion . further more , not all the advertisement are unreliable . but if all the factor are compared , the disadvantage of advertisement carry more weight than those of it benefit . from what ha been discussed , we can finally draw the conclusion that most advertisement make product seem much better . so , i agreee the statement .
