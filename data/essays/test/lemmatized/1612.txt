accurate academic knowledge is the key to a successful future professionnal activity . but we should consider whether the success story should be based on a broad or a specialized knowledge . broad knowledge might be useful both in day - to - day to life and profesionnal activity . indeed , it provides a comprehensive point of view on many different subject . this shoul be called culture . it might therefore help you being more critical and more adaptative in many different situation . but under these circumstamces , knowledge remains general , unspecific . talking to professionnal life , this kind of general knowledge will never provide you specific skill and you might never be an expert enough to lead your own project - though very broadminded specialization mades of you an expert in a single domaine . this should be called expertise . whereas the current profesionnal competitive context tends to make u trying to become expert on eveything , focusing our knowledge on a single subject seems more appropriate of the large amount of information and knowledge we share and use in 21st century . emphasis on a specific subject could give you the opportunity to developp an interesting skill that few others have and that they would therefore like to share . developping specific skill based on a specific academic carreer is the single most effective way to make of you an efficient and competitive worker - though perhaps narrowminded . the ideal would thus be a delicate balance between a interesting general background based on broad knowledge with an emphasis on a specific subject you would be an expert in . but like others idealistic position , reaching it is quite difficult thoiu not impossible despite the amont of challenge we have to face daily ... reaching excellence in everything .
