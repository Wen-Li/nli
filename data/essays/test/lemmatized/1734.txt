the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide rather than travel alone . i feel it is true because i would like to share one of my expereinces , when i went to chennai i wa left all alone to go out with noone to tell me where to go . you have noone to guide you through the city , you tend to get bored and without a companion and without a guide a person is definately getting himself in a funny and dumb situation . if you travel in group you tend to be more cheerful and sharing xperiences anmd talking happily . and if you have a guide with you it would be more cheerful and enjoyable . the guide can help your way through the city and help your way out with the transportation etc . one may feel that travelling alone will help him a lot or it may be enjoyable but it is all wrong notion . the best way travel is in group or with the person who know the city and is well acquantained with the town or so called city . i have another expereince this wa when i went to mumbai , we were all in a group , ours wa a group of 10 member . if you go out you enjoy the tour throughly and never have a dull moment in the tour . we had also taken a guide in the city who helped u in finding good hotel , good food , and good transporation . a tour guide is a person who will help you in all the physical amenties starting from the transport to the miscellenous activity . also the group we are going through should be lively enough to have a fun time . always a group led by a tour guide help you in having a no problem tour .
