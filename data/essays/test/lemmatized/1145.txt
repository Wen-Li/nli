i seriously doubt the statement a we already have had probably the worst oil crisis behind u thirty year ago and we are despite all political effort still relying on car . as everyone know resource are limited but i believe this dependency upon the car will just go on and on a it ha - since the widespread usage of the automobile started . and individual would be willing to pay a much higher prize a the car is the one and only way to travel that is completely independent from any other interaction like schedule or booking . even if we would invent new mean to travel there would be still developing nation behind u which would want to make the leap towards the automobile . china consists of 1/6 of the world population but the bicycle is still the prevalent way to travel . so we can expect china to start getting a car density like in western europe a wealth is going to be spread due to the more and more evolving economy . cars can be an object of prestige in western society , too , and few people will want to consider getting rid of a car for rational reason like environmental issue . especially not in the upper economic class that own expensive car a they would care le about political incentive like fuel getting more expensive for plitical and environmental reason . whatever we would invent in future may it be a car run by hydrogen or electricity it would still resemble the design of our today `` s automobile and therefore still be considered a car . so the number of car is definetely not going down , but almost certain due to increase .
