in this time , the school are giving our child diffrent topic . and each topic ha an influance in thier charectar . some topic made them creatice some do n't . therefore , i agree with th statement and i believe that it is more imortant for student to understand idea and concept than it is for tham to learn fact beucase this thing will make tham creative by having a big imagination and turning the idea into fact . giving the student idea , will help them to have an imagination , which is important in thier life , specially if the idea are wrong . giving wrong idea to diffrent kind of student will have diffrent influance on them . some of them might take it a it is and believe even if it is true and that kind we should be aware from them and try to give them the both fact and idea together . the another group might think about and try to think about and by doing that they will get a big imagnation that could help them to prove it . and a a result of that they will have an open mind , which can discus any topic . proving an idea is a really arduous thing because it is an idea ! . but after proving it and turning it into fact you will be proud of your-self and you will feel like a king that time . when i wa a child my mother used to tell me an idea which it is : `` not all of the scintest right you could be better than them '' . she wa telling me this idea since i wa seven year old . after while , when i grow up and become a man i proved that , by proving that newton 's formula are wrong . it wa arduous for me to believe it and for my peer also , but when i remmebered my mother 's word it became easier to believe . that moment i wa n't happy for having that big honor , but also to prove that any idea , a mother 's idea , can be fact someday . and that ha a really big impact in my life , i am now in schoolarship for the gifted people only , and that kind of idea are what the student need . therefore , if the school will not teach my student idea , i will do it by myself . becuase of my love to them i want them to have a big imagination and to try to turn the idea into fact .
