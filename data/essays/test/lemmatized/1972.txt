i completely agree with the idea that people who take risk are more successful than those who do new with old . it is possible to justify this idea by using the example of the music business . indeed , whenever a song becomes number one of the chart , it is mainly due to the universe of the singer , the way he writes or sings the lyric , or it can be due to the introduction of a new feature or style in a current style . all innovation are source of success if they are well managed , organised or promoted . a perfect example of this argument could be mickael jackson . the reason of his success resides in all the risk he took by introducing a new style in pop music , and also by inventing dance step . he completely changed the vision of pop music and the way that music wa done . plus , he introduced the concept of musical comedy in his video clip . all the action he did were not predicted to be successful , but he took his chance and his risk were worth try . i do not think we would have been so important today if he had copy previous singer . today , it is impossible for someone who want to succeed in the music industry to do what mickael jackson did . in interview , new famous artist of pop say that they were all inspired by mickael jackson , and the reason why they are successful today is mainly due to the fact that they used some of mickael jackson 's talent and innovation which they improved and combined to their new feature . all these combination are risky , but a the statement say `` successful people try new thing rather than only doing what they already know how to do well '' . few people in the music industry do thing that have been done in the past because they already know that customer want news . even if singer sing old song , they will always try to put new style into it in order to innovate by remixing the instrumentals or modifying the text . as a proverb say `` only those who take the risk have a chance to succeed '' which go in my argumentation way .
