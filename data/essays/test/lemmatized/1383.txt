i agree the fact that successful people try new thing . these people start a thing with high goal and will proceed with the work for success never thinking of the failure . as they could succeed in their work they do even take risk rather than doing the same thing a they feel it a joy to do the thing and if even one thing fails , they will not even consider it a they were successful before . but some people who received failure frequently or at the beginning feel afraid of implementing the new thing . they most probably keep in mind about the failure they received before . and most probably the final result is failure . all the new technology and the thing now present are the result of the successful people and the risk taken by them . if in the olden day the peole and the scientist satisfied with the old achievement , we may not have the new thing we have now . if the people and the grahambell ( who invented bicycle ) satisfied with the bicycle , we probably might not have all the bike and the car we have now . in the olden day all the theory were discovered over century , i.e. one theory is discovered by two or three generation of scientist . when fire broke into einstein , the father fo nation 's research laboratory , he felt happy and enjoyed looking at the flame that he can develop new thing again by leaving the old thing . he is happy that the thing might have gone , but it gave many new idea and experience to him . it is dependent on u to see whether we are a succesful peole are not . because it is we who had taken the decision and implemente the thing . the success for one depends on how he manage the thing and and how he organise the event or task . it 's the secret fo the success for most of the present day enterprenuers . it is not sure that successful people always achieve success . we can say that the the risk or the new idea implemented be the successful people is running this world . but this success doe not belong to one category . because the development ha got many way such a in medical field , electrical field , computer field , mechanical field , etc . . the leading development in the world now is in the computer field . the invention of computer changed the way teh world ha got before . modern robot along with computer sensor can perform heart surgery which is a typical one with out cutting the skin . these are the new thing implementes by the scientist and teh successful people
