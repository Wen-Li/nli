some people say that young people , nowadays , do not give enough time to helping their community . i think that nobody , actually , can do generalization about this question for the following reason . it is impossible , for me , to measure the interest of young people in helping their community . the second point i consider important to undeline is the tendency to criticate young people and to consider the people who lived in the past ( especially young people ) better than the people living in the present time . i think that there are a lot of young people who give their time partecipating actively for the wellness of their community . there are also boy and girl that are enthusiastic about this idea , but they do n't have enough time because they spend most of their day studying or working . i think also that the quality of the time dedicated to these activity is more important that the strenght of the time spent on them . moreover , there are certainly young people that do n't have much interest in helping their communieties . for me is important to underline that the problem is not the age ; yes , i agree that it is a very good thing that youg people could give their time to helping their community , but also all the component of the society ( adult people and old people , men and woman ) have to be involved in this good project . finally i think that nowadays young people have more opportunity to become protagonist of the community they belong ; thanks to the school and the spread of the medium they can know better the main problem , and to feel better involved than in the past time in solving them .
