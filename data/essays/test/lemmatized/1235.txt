it is not easy to say simply that if travelling in a group led by a tour guide is the best way or not . because there are truly some advantage to travel in a group led by a tour guide , but personally speaking , i like to travel by myself . first , i am the kind of man who like to challenge themselves . so i want to something with risk . if i go for a trip in a group with a guide , it will lost the chance to enjoy the venture . for example , a you know great wall is very famous in china which is located in the northern moutain part of beijing city . same part have been reconstructed by modern people just for the tour . for the safety , all of the guide will show you to these part if you are in a tour group . but if you want to see the real ancient arcitectures of the great wall , you have to go alone to the dangerous part of the great wall which keep the old structure . it mustl be more interesting . second , it will be cheaper by travelling alone . many guide will take you to some shop which have some secret economic relationship between them to encourage you to busy some gift . finally , the shop owner will share the profit with guide . i quite do n't like this , more exactlly speaking , i hate this behavior . i wa ever cheated by some bad guide , so from then i decieded never to go with a guide again . in conclusion , i think to travel in a group led by a tour guide may be a good choice for most people , because it safe and conveniet , but totally is not the best way for me . i aslo suggest others : just to fly by yourself , you will see the real blue sky !
