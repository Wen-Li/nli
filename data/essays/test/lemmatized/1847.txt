in my opinion , advertisement should be used to explain which are the real product quality . nowadays advertisement are mainly used to `` confuse '' people that have to buy them , so they are not able to estabilish which product is really the best one , because they are blinded by a lot of advertisement that seem to indicate that the product which they are referred to is better than the others . the question is : there is something true in those advertisement ? how can we choose a product starting to his adverisements if we are not sure about their effective quality ? this is the point ! we ca n't . .. we can only try it , and off course , we have to buy it . . there are a lot of example , like product related to the fitness . in television , during a spot , somebody show something that could help u to loose kylos in few day . is that true ? just try it , and it could happen that this isn ' t a real and possible goal . in my personal experience , i bought a flat television and the seller told me that there wa n't the possibility of dead pixel , in agree with the product advertisement . after few day , i find three dead pixel on my monitor . i agree with that statement , it is true that most advertisement make product seem much better than they really are . this is because nowadays there is the necessity to sell a many product a they are produced , but , in seller opinion , the only way to do this is to manipulate the real product quality using false advertisement . i don think this is a good thing . . it is a kind of trick that can be dangerous for people who belive in advertisement , and who buy something hoping that it can help them .
