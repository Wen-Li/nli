i believe , that many advertisement do display the feature of a product in a fairly too positive way . from my point of view , there is a variaty of reason why this is the case . frist the main obejctive of an advertisement is to attract people 's attention be any mean . a normal product we use in our everyday life normaly doe not provide that , because it is just too ordinary . therefore the creative people in marketing deparments who produce these advertisement need to put something special to the product . this might be a product feature which is a bit exagerated ( in comparison to other product in the relevant market segment ) or a feature which is not neccesaryly combiened with this product . a problem of this strategy is probably , that costumer may change their to a product of a competitor , if their expactations are not met . but from my perspective this risk is fairly low , because all costumer known that every company act the same way . therefore the client usually do n't expect to recieve a 100 % of what is said in the advertisement . second : since many company in the market try to get someone 's attention , the advertisement may show a tendency of getting a little bit more extreme from time to time . this get obvious if you compare advertisments in television during the 60 's with today . so company do have a real advantage if there ad 's are just a little more recongnised a the ad 's of competitor . this a kind of a ` herd movment ' in the whole advertisment industry . i think , there are a lot of good argument in favour of my point of view .
