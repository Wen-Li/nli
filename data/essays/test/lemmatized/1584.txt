i disagree with the idea that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide . there are mainly two reason described below . first , good thing for travelling to me are knowing more about the place or the country and knowing more about people from there . for example . i want to know what they usually do , eat and think about something . second , when travalling in a group , people are likely to talk in a group , not talking to people from the place where they travel except for only needed communication . when travelling led by a tour guide , we can not go to place we want to go to . nothing we can do if we spend more time on the specific place and if we want to go anywhere tour usually do not select . for example , i usually rent a car when i travel . driving around the city is such a fun and very good for knowing people from the city and even driving law in city . for example , there is a round intersection in australia and kind of difficult for people from other country to drive through the intersection , but once you get used to it , it is such a convenient intersection . i never felt like that if i did not rent a car . and also , when i have a problem , i have to deal with it by myself like asking someone for a help . this is also a good example that i can not get something that i can never do from group tour . but , travelling alone is sometimes dangerous for some people , so be carefull to choose the way to travel . i think that the best way to travel in a small group by themselves for maximizing their experience . than
