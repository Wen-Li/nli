the statement say that in twenty year there will be fewer car circulating on earth 's route . even if this would have positive consequence on the pollution condictions , i really do n't think it will be possible and i do n't agree with this statement . in fact , everybody know that during the last period the use of the car ha spread in the world , in particular in the rich country of the planet . some year ago only rich people had the financial possibility to brought a car , but then the cost of a car progressively felt down . above all , ford , the famous productor of german car , had a strong importance in this process . he reorganized his factory in order to produce a lot of car quickly and with lower cost . thanks to him , the car price collapsed . the most famous model is the ^ t model ^ . it wa a small , black car and almost everyone had the financial possibility to buy it . now the car market is almost saturated . that mean that everybody ha at least a car and the sell are basically due to the need to change it after some year of use . so maybe nowadays the number of car bought each year is not a hight a some year ago , when for the first time people began to use car to travel or move in city . however , i do n't think that the car market is in crysis . on the contrary , the use of car could spread in poor country . this obviously ha tragic consequence on air pollution . in addiction to this , the oil source of the earth are almost over . because of this problem maybe in twenty year there will be different kind of car that do n't use oil but different source of energy . . the so called ^ clean enery ^ . for example it 's possible to use the sun energy to make a car move . there is also the possibiliy to buy an electric car that ha le influence on pollution .
