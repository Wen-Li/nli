i agree with the given statement . every student must able to know the concept of lecture . if the student got the basic idea , he will able to get the whole concept perfectly . the main reason is if the student able to got the concept , then he will be in a position to explain to anyone . with half knowledge he will not get anything . some time one application may use in another application . by knowing the concept only we will apply and solve the problem of other application . in physic , it will came across rapidly . in physic , we will apply one application for the other . by getting whole concept only we can able to solve the problem . another reason is that , if student learn about concept in his academic year , he would have easy in higher education also . the term all are familier in his academic . so , he could not worry about the subject . another reason is that , by learning fact , the student would not get full subject . he will not perfect in the subject . so , he must have to learn about concept . if we take an civil engineer a example , if he do not know the knowledge of concept about the construction of building and bridge , it will fell down and lot of money will be wasted . so , in student age only he must able to get the whole idea and concept of subject . so , it is importent for student to understand idea
