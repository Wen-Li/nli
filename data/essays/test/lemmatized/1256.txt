yes student should understand idea . student should know the concept behind it . student s the upcoming creater . to know idea and consept behind it is essential for student . we know that `` half knowledge is danger '' because without knowing idea & concept his knowledge is not complete . student is lerner he need every thing about it . he should come to know what it is why we r using it . then only he sucseed in his feeld . for exeample if we take an enng field if he dont know the actual purepus of a paticllar disign he cont rectify any fault in that . if he know the purpose he can find the fault . by knowing idea & consept student may do further development in his field . he can add his adeas to incres the performence of the paticlar design . in my own expeeriance i faced a problem with an mechine the thing it need is not availbe at the location even thow i sloved the problem . becasue i know the consept to start the mechine and i have the idea about the working of it . one simple exeample is that with out using ignition key u can starte a engine if u konw the consept how it work . every student must know the idea and consept what they are lernig . then it will pullfill there knoldge and give satisfaction .
