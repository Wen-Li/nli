i agree the statement that successful people try new thing and take risk rather than what they already known for the following reason . first , we have to do the anther way which our competitor do to compite and dominate the market . for example , when i wa 26 , i worked for a internet advertising company . there were lot of competitor in the market becase internet advertising market grows rapidly . our company , cirius technologies , had to aproach our client in another way to which our competitor proposed because we started our job later to our rival . so , we need innovation . we introduced new technology for easy manegement of our client 's budget . our sale wa increased rapidly because of our new technology . if we had sold our service the same way of our competitor , we wold not have changed our situation . second , taking risk is chance after all . when i wa in the company i mentioned , we were not affuluent . in business , the term to success are much resouuces , especially great employee . we took the risk to finance from bank to invest for for those reason i mentioned above , i strongly believe that successful people try the thing which have not known already .
