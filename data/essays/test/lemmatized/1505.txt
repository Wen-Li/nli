the issue about admertisement making product seem much better than they are misleading the consumer is a controversial one . on the one hand some people argue that advertisement oversells the product , magnifying their characteristic and benefit . on the other hand some people agree with the purpose of advertisement that is to communicate a product 's benefit , and the need for the company to effectively communicate these feature . on a final analysis i believe that advertisement is controlled and regulated and it is needed to inform the consumer . i disagree with the statement , because i believe that advertisement is needed to communicate the feature , characteristic and benefit of product and service . one reason why i disagree with the statement is that there are a lot of competition from product or service , and a consumer ha to make an educated guess , and their only source of information come from advertisement . thus the importance of showing the benefit of what the company are selling to meet the consumer need . another reason why advertisement doe not mislead consumer is that there are a lot of regulation regarding add and claim . a company can not make a claim on a product or service that is not true or that is misleading . in mexico the federal consumer insitute , a govenment agency regulates every add , and package and review all the claim . competitors can ask this agency to review some of the claim of other product , and if the agency find that it is not true , misleading or it can not be proved then the agency will take away the product or service from the market . there are a lot of example in add controversy in mexico , like when a company that sold detergent saying that it will remove every stain from the clothes , after the consumer agency reviewed it decided take away the advertisement from tv or any other mean of communication . finally consumer are smart , they do not believe everything they see or hear , they are exposed to so much advertising that even if one claim a message that is not true or misleading , the consumer will notice and will not buy that product or service , so the company will not gain the confidence of it comsumer prospect and eventually go out of business . in summary advertisement are necessary to communicate the benefit of product and service and there are way to control them in order to make sure they not oversell benefit and mislead the consumer .
