i do agree with this statement because one can not apply fact to situation . for that reason i consider understanding idea and concept much more important than learning fact . as i already stated the major difference between learning fact and understanding concept is that you can apply concept to different area while fact are only useful for specific situation . for example if you merely memorize a math formula it will only help you if the teacher asks you to write down the formula . on the other hand if you actually understand the concept of how the formula work you will be able to solve all kind of math problem with it . another reason i consider understanding concept more important is that human are only able to learn from concept , not fact . let u take an example from history . if one know when the second world war started and ended , who participated etc. one would not be able to recognize a situation where something similar could happen . if one understands why the second world war ha started and know the cause-effect-relationships this person is likely to recognize a similar situation . and only if one is able to recognize a situation one can think about possible solution to prevent it from happening . the third reason why i believe that learning fact is not very important is that one is much more likely to forget fact . if you memorize that the boston tea party wa in 1773 you are very likely to forget the year a time pass whereas if you learn why and what happened you are likely to still know the important thing even after a few month . that is because it is much easier for the brain to memorize cause-effect-relationships that are connected to knowledge you already have than to memorize mere data . as i already said , the concept are the most important thing because you can not apply mere fact to situation . therefore fact do not help you dealing situation which everybody ha to do every day . this is the reason why i think that understanding idea and concept is much more important for student .
