i agree with the statement that it is important for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact . i think so because i feel that idea and concept play a more important role in further education than learning fact without understanding the underlying fact . concepts play a very important role in building up the future of a student . knowing the concept from each level of education help the student understand the complex idea which are built up these basic concept and idea . if a student doe not have an understanding of the basic concept and idea he will not be able to going any further in learning the subject . only with the understanding of the concept and idea will the student be able to think of his own idea based on them . for example , if an electrical engineering student doesnot understand the basic concept on which the kirchoff 's law are stated he will not be able to understand or solve any of the circuit , whose analysis is very important for designing and sythesizing an electrical network which the student will have to do later in his course . although learning the fact is also a important a understanding the idea and concept , learning the fact will be of no use or the student may not be able to retain what he ha learned if the student doesnot have a good idea of how these fact are established and what are the underlying concept that led to the confirmation of these fact . without knowing the concept the student may not be able do dany further research to improve the existing model of the idea . hence for all the above stated reason i believe that it is more important for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact .
