that 's a really true statement . advertisements ha now a day become the way company can manipulate human being . most of the advertisement we see appear to be what we had dream of . advertisements ha become the way company can easily get u to buy their product . when a man see an advertisement of any product and a nice pretty girl advertising it , he becames crazy for it . we can see the example of `` axe '' . all it advertisement are with a lot of beautiful girl in tiny skirt following a man that us this product . me like a man , the first time i saw it , i run to buy it . i ca n't deny it smell good , but you ca n't pretend that all the girl run after you trying to get an appointment . most of the time this is what happens , company exagerate thing making u believe that we will reach heaven if we buy all those thing . but that is how the economy move now a day . companies need a way to sell their product , and there 's no better one that advertising it . but advertising it with a bunch of good thing . companies have found out that we , a human being , have emotion and feeling and we dream to have thing we wo n't get so easily . and that is what company advertise , all those dream come true by buying one product . it 's disappointment to find out that all wa a lie . people must learn that nothing is like they paint it for you . the only way to find out what 's good and what not , is proving it . so do n't be so fool to believe that your dream will come true just because an advertisemnet say it .
