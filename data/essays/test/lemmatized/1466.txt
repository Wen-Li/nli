i agree with the following statement that most advertisement make product seem much better than they really are . now a day with increasing industrialisation and the growth of the market economy there is a cut throat competition among the industry a to which industry sell most of it product . so , in order to increase the marketing of their product large scale a well a small scale firm are using advertisement campaign . these industires often hire the well known television star and actor to launch their product . and the one that can hire the most reputed actor win the race and it marketing increase manyfold . but in reality these advertisement overrate the product than they actually are and hence cheat the consumer . people also prefer to buy those product that are campaigned by the big actor because these campaign develop a sort of relationship between the product and the consumer . a small firm can not hire a renowned advertising company to launch their product so even if they are producing much better quality than the large firm are producing , marketing of their product remains low . advertisement company aim at developing a sort of relationship with the consumer . for example , if they are advertising for a newly engineered car that look very attractive , they try to attract the younger generation through their campaign and often hire a younger actor to do their campaign . as a result younger generation is grealtly influenced by the advertisement and is tempted to buy the product even if the product is not very well engineered on ground of strength and other capability such a mileage etc. hence they make the product appear much better than they really are . hence , consumer are often mistaken of the type of the product they should choose and hence they often make mistake while making choice . moreover , the number of industry are increasing day by day and are coming up with their more recent technology and product which serf to worsen the situation further . hence , in my opinion this problem of being falsified by the flamboyant advertisement can be reduced only through the awareness of consumer . by giving more importance to the quality of the product than on the advertisement a consumer can make an effective choice between the various product .
