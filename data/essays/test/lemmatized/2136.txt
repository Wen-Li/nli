no fuel no roads no cars people would not be able to breathe after twenty year due to pollution and we think of cars. `` dust dust everywhere , no tree for oxygen , a big hole in o-zone '' are enough to make my view clear that car would be extinct from the world in near future . car running on petrol and diesel would not get fuel for their startup . today in the present era , the consumption of fuel and energy is so rampant that within no time our world would be xhausted from all what god ha given u . the foremost thing required to run car is the fuel which is depleating day by day . the indiscriminate logging of wood for our selfish motif would also become a decisive factor for the future of vehicle in the world . scientists have evolved a new concept of solar car running on solar energy but i have a question for all of tham that what willl be the ue of car once situation arise for pertaining your own survival . the increasing pollution due to dangerous gas emitted by car would be the cause of their demice . the road are built after industrialisation on the place where forest prevailed . tthese thing would ultimately lead to the damage of society . the ozone layer ha got a big hole which emits harmfull ultraviolet wave straight to u from sun . once these wave start flowing , even solar car would be of no use . the car newly made to run on gas are actively and highly inflamable where a bit of error can cause life suffering . these gas are also depleting due to their extensive use . thus virtually there will be no way out . i would personally like to suggest the use of cycle and public transport mean which would increase the life span of vehicle reducing pollution and preserving resource . thus concluding this topic , i would like to take a note to all scientist to prepare way in which the earth can be saved and not the increment in car . the depletion of resource surely would end up the era of cars.a fewer would also be difficult to be sought out .
