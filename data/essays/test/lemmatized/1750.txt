i completely disagree with the thought of `` the best wat to travel is in a group led by a tour guide '' . there are a couple of reason why i think this way . let me tell you one by one . firstly , guided tour doe not allow me to look around anywhere . if i want to go to somewhere else to where the tour will not visit , i could not visit there . also , i maight have to go somewhere i do not want to visit . secondly , in guided tour , there is timekeeper . whether i want to stay more or leave a soon a possible , they will not allow me to do so . for example , when i visited kyoto in that tipe of tour , i had no enough time to see the place , because in that tour , we had to visit many place in a day , so we had only thirty minute per place suprisingly . and the make matter worth , we spent a long time in a bus . thirdly , when i travel in a group led by a tour guide , there are few oppatunity to meet and talk with people who live around there . meeting new people is one of interesting purpose of traveling . when i visited malaysia on my own , i made many firends there and people who lived in there tald me much about not only the place but also their custom . on the other hand , when i visited u.k. in that kind of tour , i did not make friend with anyone . the last but most impotant , reserching and finding about the place by myself is the best intersting thing in a trip ! so , the guide tell me all about the place is something boring for me . truly , guids are kind to tell information , i appreciate that , however reserching by myself is more inte these are why i do not prefer traveling in a group led by a tour guide . seeing to anywhere , staying anytime , meeting new people , and fiding about something are the goal of the travel .
