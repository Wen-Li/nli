the discussion of most advertisement make product seem much better than tey really are is a controversial one . one one hand , some say that advertising is an illusion of showing product much better than they really are . on the other hand , some say that advertising is art of introducing a product or service and make consumer aware of it . i disagree with the statement given because the regulation on the advertising , penalty that company paid , and consumer getting more involved and demanding make this argument invalid in today 's medium environment . it is not pretty unfair to say that advertisement make product seem much better than they really are . we have seen many example in the past , however the current regulation do not let such misguidance of advertising . when we look at the advertising world , we see that it developes without any regulation and regulation were made usually after a problem occured . when the consumer complain about that problem , then the industry need to solve it via regulation in order to protect the industry and consumer . it is not allowed to give false information in current regulation and the penalty is pretty heavy . you may argue that regulation may not enough . however , we see big company paying astronomical penalty when they make false claim . therefore , they have internal mechanism to control every single advertising they show to the consumer . in this way , they do not only protect themselves from huge penalty , they also protect their reputaions . i think another important reason why this statement can not be true is about the consumer gett'ng more involved , demanding , and smart about their chices . in today competitive environment , consumer have the power of changing their choice very easily . therefore , if a company make an advertising that make it product much better than it is , consumer simply do not buy it next time a their expectation can not be met . so , company know this very well and they do not make such advertisement . as a conclusion , i believe that the argument of most adverisements make product seem much more better than they really are 's not true . in medium history , we may see soem example supporting this argument . however , the current regulation , penalty that company should pay in such case , and today 's more demanding and powerfull consumer make this argument invalid .
