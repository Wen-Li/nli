i agree with the statement that successful people try new thing and take risk rather than only doing what they already know how to do well . on one hand it might seem to be a better strategy for a person to stick to area that they already know well . after all , success is usually measured by the person 's productivity , by his or her contribution to the cause he or she is working for . taking risk , trying new thing may cause a disruption in a person 's productivity for an unkonwn amount of time . but on the flip side , there are limit to how far one could go by only sticking tho the thing one know best . firstly , even though for a short while the person can sustain high level of productivity , there may be a point in which the product produced using the old skill may become obsolete , they may not be sought after by people anymore . and at that point it may be too late for the person to try new thing . secondly , toying with new idea , trying different thing enhances the person 's creativity . for example , one can combine new idea gathered while working on a novel technique with his or her former better established skill . in short the person can gain a broader view in life . consider great scientist . how did many of their great discovery came about ? could einstein establish the general theory of relativity had he just stuck with the law of classical mechanic ? or could the continent of america be discovered ? the name we remember today belong to those who took risk and tried different thing in their life . einstein took a risk , he could have failed , but that mattered little for him . he had a vision , and against all odds , given his strong will , he proved he wa right .
