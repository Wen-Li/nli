advertisments are meant to explain about the product and it benifits to the consumer there by increasing the sale of the product . at time advertisments are used to attract more consumer by mean of creativity in advertisment but still not conveying wrong message . but few advertisments exaggorate about the product . they show them much better than what they are actually . one of the most popular advertisment in india which i think fall in this category is about a soap named ` lux ' . the product developres use cinema heroine for this advertisment and quote that the reason for the beauty of hearione is the soap . obvisouly it sound redicule . these day everybody know about the make up they go through . but they still continue with such kind of advertisments . the other example is in general about bike milage . most of the manufacture of bike quote that their bike give 60-80 kilo meter milage per 1 liter of petrol . in reality it give only one fourth or one third of that at maximum because of various other reason like condition of road , maintenence . but they never mention them . the most rediculous and most bothering advertisments these day are about bank loan . these day bank are coming up with all type of possible loan . home , personal , vehicle , festival . .. what not !! . they advertise so attractively quoting that all over need will be satisfied by taking the loan . and they are litrerly behind you to take the loan . but they do n't quote the hidden cost and incremental in the intrest rate that may occur . there are many such product in the market . this kind advertisment may be to sustain the compeition . but once consumer use the product and if they find the truth they may not purchase it again . there by the manufacture loose them permanently . the purpose of advertisment will itself be lost .
