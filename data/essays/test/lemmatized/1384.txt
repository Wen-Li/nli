i agree with the statement . it 's reasonable to think young people have no time to help their community or they spend a lot of time in a bad manner . a lot of people ca n't think to spend own important day life without learning money . it 's so because our society obliged to u to learn money a you can and have a good work which you can permit everything with . this is the biggest problem , usually you do n't do anything without a material scope . i 'm convinced by another important thing . a lot of time our society , i love define a the western society , obliged to u to be physically in a certain way , so young peolpe prefer to put our attention on theirself . they prefer spend much time in gym , or other place like that to improve their physical aspect . there is the idea that i come before all the others thing or people . at the beginniong i have to improve my way of life then , if there is more time , i can think that i 'm not alone . it 's important to underline how people are obliged from this kind of society , they accept this condition without can do anything . in this contest , another impostant thing we have to underline is how a day is shortest than a day of some year ago . nowdays a young people spend a lot of time at school or working and sometimes is impossible to think to do other activity during tha day .
