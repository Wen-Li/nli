the problem thet young people do not give enough time to helping their community is very common . i think that it is true , i am agree with this statement . nowadays the young people are busy , between school , work and sport activity , but it is not a good reason . the problem that their are not interested at their community , they think about themseves , their study , their job , their friend . all are first that helping their community . i think that could make a promotion of this activity , the goverment must be interested about this problem and make something to change this situation . i feel that if exsist a organizated association that give information and contact person that could help and how need to help , more young people give their time to help someone . also the school could sesibilize their student in this way , it could introduce promotion about this . for example could give extra credit to the student that give his or her time to helping the comunity . i think is important to promoter this activity , because a young person that give something at his or her comunity , will grow a good person . but not all the young people do not give time to helping their community , i know many person that make something for the community . they emplied same of their time to make something to someone , they could take a child or make volontary at red cross , organize travell for child or ageded peolple . in conclusion i think the young people could give more of their time to helping their comunities , but also they have need to be encuraged and motivied . the institution could play a key role about this problem .
