i totally agree with that statement . there are lot of product presented a the best ever and that there will be never again a better one . as an exampel can be mentioned the automobile industry . often they present their car in advertisments a one of the fastest but on the other hand a one of the most friendly one to nature . but how can an fast car with lot of horsepower be friendly to nature . the pollution of an car with lot of horsepower is still very high even it is already lower compared to older car which were produced year ago . also mentionable ist the cell phone industry . how often is explained in their commercial why everybody should use one specific cell phone . a producer of cell phone for example create an new cell phone and promote it a the best one for manager or people with leading position in company , because it ha special feature which will make their work and daily life much more easier . but after a while first test are published and these one show all the mistake which were made during the production process . the only choice a consumer who had bought one of those cell phone ha is to buy a new one or update his one with new software . but he never can be sure that all mistake will be deleted through such an software update . the producer will then offer the same cell phone model with new feature and without the mistake of the older model a few month later . an other point is that in advertisments often the product are so easy be put together . in these commercial the consumer is told that by putting the product together you have only to pull there and to do this and so on . for example a baby bed which a friend of me bought . she tried to stand it up to place her little baby in it . according to the direction and the commercial a woman could put it together an her own , at the end we were five people trying to put it togther .
