people might think commercial are relyable and that ; s because many people buy their object by mean of advetisements . or maybe , there is no choice but to believe in ad because it take too much time to get true information about every single of good people buy . how it is , i can not help agreeing with the above-mentioned statement , `` most advertisement make product seem much better than they really are '' , as long a people do n't forget the basic , most ovious purpose of the advertisement , it 's not an astonishing thing to confirm that their daily consumption ca n't satisfy them often . i mean through the tv ad or paper publication , people get the information of such and such thing , but people frequently become upset with what they really got to have . in other word , advertisement are bound to atrract people , they have to make people to spend money on what they are showing . that 's why they use big star , fliry comment , shining package , and so on . these thing cleary show what the ad use trick to make their prouducts a lot better that they virtually are . thus , there are many consumer center a well . it seems sudden firsthand to talk about cunsumer center here . but , honestly , it really stand because of this problem ; people get disapointed with product which are viewed a totally different from what they saw through commercial . center deal with these happening . they typically try to protect cunsumers from being deceived by conmercials which make product look `` too '' much better than they are in reality . taken in this sense , product ommercials make up their good in purpose .
