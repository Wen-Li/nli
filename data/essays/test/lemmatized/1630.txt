helping the community in which we are living , is a curicial component of being a society , i belive . when the people are sensitive to eachother and try to improve the quality of life of the others a well a him/herselves , a better society form . in my opinion , young people do not give enough time helping their community . there may be several reason for this . one of them may be is that , time is precious nowadays . there are lot of activity to join or lot of document to read which help the improvement of the person himself . therefore , i think young people concentrate more in improving themselves . both the education system and the requirement of today 's world reinforces this behaviour . i am a member of a socal club in my country , in which we organize some activity . although the actual aim of these kind of club are personal improvement , they use some of social activity a a tool . for instance , member go to house of elder people or they organize a concert and give the profit of the concert to the homeless children 's hause . among these activity , it is obvious that , organizing a concert is more rewarding in the aspect of improving personal talent and gaining experience than visiting old people . the second one actually , is more like an advertisement of the club . the member are more willing to participate the activity and shoulder responsibility when arranging a concert , like finding sponsor or signing contract with the concert place . the attandence is usually below the expectation when visiting old people . young people do not seem to be intrested in the happiness they will create . as a conclusion , i believe that , young people do not give enough time to helping their community but mostly are interested in helping themselves to increase the quality of their living .
