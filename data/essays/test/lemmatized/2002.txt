if it is important for student to learn fact , i agree to the statement saying that it is more important for them to understand idea . facts can not be discussed or rebutteled . learning fact is the most easy thing that anyone can do . by contrast , idea and concept have to be discussed and demand work to understand them . it is not always easy to `` catch '' the idea and concept . thus , student should spend more time to understand them in order to understand the field they are studying . while being in class , it appears that spending more time to explain idea and concept is more useful than focusing on teaching fact . indeed , the value added that a professor provides to his student is his explanation ; it is something that student could not get elsewhere than in the classroom . students can easily learn fact at home , by reading the supporting material . my own experience shew me that it is more useful learning in this way . a professor who only or mostly focus on fact is `` useless '' ; it would be preferable to stay at home , at least it would not make any difference . on the contrary , a professor who spends the most of his teaching time to express and discus the different concept and idea make his class very interesting and animated due to the increase in participation of student and the interaction with the professor . i do not argue that learning fact is useless . sometimes , some fact are also useful to understand idea and concept . facts should be taught in class when they are useful to understand idea and concept . the way of teaching should be focused on the most important thing and the main idea and concept . facts have to be studied at home , but taught in class only when they support the understanding of idea and concept .
