time is a limited resource and young people do n't succeed in scheduling their activity in order to have time enough to help the community where they live . i remember that don milani , a famous italian priest of the 20th century used to say i care , instead fascists shouted i do n't care . i hope this example emphasizes how helping other people modifies our personality . firstly this lack of love towards mankind begin since a child go to school . in fact parent occupy his life with school and many other activity , most of all sport activity , in order to keep him busy while their work . thus a young guy learns that is better to play football than have spare time to spend taking care of other people . afterwards he ha grown up , he is involved in numerous activity , but even universitiy itself eats up all the day-time . nowadays doing a degree is really demanding , student loose their time because they have to attend class lesson and they have to study at home . furthermore society increase this attitude towards selfishness and television is transmitting everytime image of rich , proud , selfish people who are hailed self-made man , stating that people have to work hard to accomplish their goal . this image have a bad impact on our society because everybody is striken by this and reacts by placing himself at the center of his life . it seems to me that there is a sort of big brother who is trying to introduce a new hedonism , a behaviour that seek only for beauty and pleasure . maybe he is managing to do it because , if we consider everybody , both young and adult , we could realize that they prefer remainig at home to smiling to a poor guy , looking for someone who simply listens to him .
