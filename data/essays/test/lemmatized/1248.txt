i disagree with the statement . first of all let me explain what i understand about `` successful people '' . someone is successful if one reach the goal for a certain task on time . the goal can be either the same every time or something totally different . it `` s the same with the task . the task can change ore keep the same . let me provide an example to underline my thesis . someone like to run a marathon . that is the goal . the task is to train for the marathon in order to achive the goal . the training method can be allways the same and just because of having an ongoing dialy training it can be possible to reach the goal . on the other hand training method might change and even with the changed training method it is possible to achive the goal . in both situation the runner is not certain because unprodicted situation might occure like an ilness , bad weather condition during the marathon . in case the runner decides to do a iron-men he would change his goal from marathon to iron-men . he could keep his training method from the marathon preparation or change it to some other method . trying new thing the person ha to get used to change which normale decrease the ability of being `` good '' and `` fast '' after a replication of the activity the person get more familar and the quality and the speed is increasing . that mean trying new thing for the first time people are most likely not a succesful a peole who have done the activity more often . becaue of the fact that new thing are of course not well known the person taks the risk in being not successfull .
