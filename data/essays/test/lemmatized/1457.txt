at the begining , invention like the radio , movie and tv were created to entertain people . a dramatic evolution ha been seen in the entertainment industry . now a day the industry ha become almost purly a bombarment of advertisement . culture is now basically dependent on the medium . ads often time use false statement and false image that will make their product look better than in actually is . one of the most common advertisement that affect a certain group of people is when the industry is trying to sell beauty product . women in general , are mainly affected by the these ad , on what product they will buy . women are not just affected on what they should buy , but also how they should look like . most of the time the ad industry will air brush or cumputerize most of the ad so it will look amazingly `` real '' . they will perfect their image a much a they can so people believe that the product actually doe the change , thet the result are true . women are pressured to buy these product to fit in the social standars . mostly hoping that the product will give them the result that the ad say , but 99 % of the time it will bring dissapointment . another example of how advertisement make product seem more powerfull than they actually are is in toy ad . children are fooled by tv commertials all the time . barbie commercial , for example , they move by themselves , they supposelly come with all these extra thing , and they also promote that she can `` do '' many thing that she ca n't actually do . children are brain washed by all the fake junk in advertisement . they are told that the toy in the ad is the best thing that ha been created . the kid with their innocent mind belive this , and pressure their parent to spend the money on the toy that they want . many time you will have dissapointment in the child , but other time they would be so into their imagination that they wont even realize that the ad and the action of the toy is fake . the medium ha a huge impact on how society act , think , and doe thing . most of the time advertisement is full of lie to promete a new item , just so they will make a profit . media brainwashes to make money .
