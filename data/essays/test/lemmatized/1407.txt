i do not agree with this statement that it is more important for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact . but it is depends on what the concept is , because if it is about really serious topic and the information that student need to know , student should know and learn about it . especially , if it is about the nation and world . student should know what happens in the world . but sometimes , there is a information that they do not need to know the fact
