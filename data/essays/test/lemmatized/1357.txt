i do agree on the statement that most advertisement make product seem better than thez really are . the reason are easy to find : the person who work for a certain company a the administrative for it advertisement are very well informed about the psychological process in people 's brain when they encounter certain stimulus . with this power the influence the costumer and make him or her want to by their product . these stimulus are very often visua : if you want to sell baby nuture successfully , all you have to do ist to show a happy baby with it mother advertising it . another way is to only list the positive feature of the product , such a it low prize , all it extra etc . if the company did not use advertisement to manipulate their costumer , the would have much le profit then they currently have . sometimes it is very useful to hire popular star , such a model or musicients . one example for that would be the advertisement of mc donald 's in germany . here , the supermodel heidi klum go to mc donal 's and order a menu with chip and a salad . she even bite a bit off one chip to demonstrate that it is completely okay to eat at this restaurant . but they do not show is that she never swallowed the chip . another example is the advertisement of deichmann shoe in german tv : in this little film you see the international celabrated so-called pussy cat dolls dressed in their usual style of clothing and walking on a stage , pretending to be performing . they all wear the latest shoe that one can find in the named shoe store . and even if they look really fashionable , this doe not change the fact that these shoe are highly uncomfortable and of a very low quality . but this fact is not very important to the girl who admire this group and who now seem to see a possibility to be like their idol . summarizing , i am of the opinon that advertisement present a product a something which it is not in order to make sure that the consumer will buy their product . i think that one should have a critical attitude on advertisement in general and to create one
