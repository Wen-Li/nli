people in the advertisement industry and in marketing claim that publicity is a mean to correctly inform consumer about the quality of a product . but personally i believe that in fact advertisement twist the presentation so a to make a product seem better . advertisement is one of the mean used in marketing , together with pricing , distribution , etc . the whole goal of marketing is to convince consumer to buy a product , so that a company make revenue . as a consequence , advertisement tends to be partial in it description of a product , often highlighting just the positive quality without mentioning the drawback . for example , last month i gave a try to a new isolating glue for shower being advertised on the press . they were emphasizing it superior resistance to water and it ease of deployment . however , after the first use the remaining glue becomes very sticky and dry up very quickly if one doe not close it carefully - something i realized only last week when i tried to use it , invain , for a second time ! hiding the negative characteristic is not the only aspect in which advertisement alters our perception of a product . when shown in picture or at television , the outlook of product is maximized through the sapient use of lighting , computer graphic , and is often accompanied by nice sound effect . all of these factor are aimed to increase the impact an object ha on our imagination , so that our desire to posse it , i.e. to buy it , is stimulated . the impact on imagination is frequently augmented also by the coupling of feeling to the presentation of a product . i remember a very funny advertisement campaign made by tenent 's , the scottish beer , on bbc a few year ago . there were two series of spot , one for male consumer , and one for female . on the first , a man wa sitting on a couch enjoying a soccer match , while a woman wa standing aside holding a tray with a glass of tenent 's . the man wa tasting the beer and then would press a button to open a panel beneath the woman to make her fall below . .. '' not fresh enough '' , he wa saying . fun , sense of domination , and sense of perfectness all appeal to men . on the woman 's version , the woman wa standing in front of a fridge at the end of a long corridor waving a glass of beer and saying `` t is ready ! '' ( a smart play on word for a british audience , by the way ) . the man would run to the beer , only to crash against an invisible barrier at the entrance of the room . .. and the woman would enjoy the beer . here , the sense of a smart revenge wa the main point to appeal the lady . both version were appealing to the sense of enjoyment , and not purely to the product `` beer '' , thus making it appear for what it communicates rather than for what it is .
