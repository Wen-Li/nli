the given statement it self indicates that the person is successful already in his carrer or in his profession . i agree with the statement because the person is already got success in his profession he mite learn new thing definately . if a person is satisfied with his success and remains calm mean no use he is already succeded thats why he should go for new thing related to his profession and related to his view and etc . if he doe regularly what he know is the worst thing , in the given statement explained that successful person try new thing and take risk rather than only doing what already know how to do well i agreed with this statement . for example if scientist launched a new rocket called agni it target or it cover a distance of 100miles then it got success . next time if he doe the same rocket to launch no use , already he got success in that then he should go for better than that this time if his rocket try to cover a distance of 150 mile it well and gud . but these type of risk taken when he had sufficient amount of material then he may go to take risk to do the risk and try for the better product than the previous . but if in some case if he fails he will get or the entire unit may get loss but the thing is he tried for the new thing thats more better if if got failure also taking some risk and doing the thing is better . in other case a person is a big industrialist his business are wide range if he stop working from that point then no success will gained if he run same business for some time in the future he may get loss because of increasing technology , if he dont go for a new thing or try to place other business it a very gud option . already that man had a wide range of business if he invents on other business or launch new product in to the markt taking some risk rather than only doing the same old business if get success in new business it is more useful . if at all if if got loss also he can recover by the old business because it alreadyi n wide range . success is obtained in any case or in any field is more difficult task because losing or inventing money on other thing is easy but not sure to got that back if a person is successful in his porofession then he should go for new thing and new idea , to work on the same field in many other way and try to take some risk on that thing is a good option . trying the new thing is very big task if a person or people who are not successful in their profession they may not have a chance to take are risk the thing or going for new thing . they may not risk are not go for the the new thing . then they lagged by the people who got success . successful itself is the achivement then we can go for new thing . its a very gud option to do or try for new thing .
