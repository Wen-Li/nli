`` the best way to travel in a group led by a tour guide. '' i i personally support the statement because whenever we go to a new tourist place we doe n't know anyone there , and may face problem about the accommodation , nice restaurant , and may spend extra money forthings we buy over there a we are not familiar about the rate . so , if our group is led by a guide he can help overthere . as guide are local people can explain the his the history of place we watch . we can enjoy the tour much more if we have a guide with u . we feel more secureas he will be guiding u . in a tourist place only some place are famous example in my citynamed hyderabad charminar , golconda fort , nizam palace , zoo park are famous . most of the visitor want to visit only these place , but with these place the city have other place to watch like gandipet , ramoji filmcity , birla mandir , salarjung musium etc. if the visitor do not hav the guide with them they can watch the place which they heard before , they can not plan efficiently how to make a way to watch the places.a guide is very helpful to enjoy more on what we spent . but choosing the right guide is very difficult task for the visitor , we have to first deside the character of the guide . because he is the person we are going to trust , if we trust a wrong person then we have to suffer . but only one thiong we miss if we have guide is that , we have to follow his instruction and unable to do anything we want . i feel that if a guide is with u the reason why we make the tour can be fulfilled efficiently . and for safe and secure tour a guide must be there . and the guide should be enough good . so , i personally agree with the statement given .
