is it better to have broad knowledge of many academic subject than to specialize in one specific topic ? well , a a matter of fact , it is . once you have a broad knowledge of many academic subject the way you think change your idea open up . instead of being close minded and choosing one topic , you can force yourself to learn , then you will be a person of a wider span of knowledge . you look at life differently with many other subject , it help you analyze thing differently . lets say for example you didnt really like math , but you learn it because this subject help you think in different way a you get older , it help you analyze problem and find solution . lets say now for biology . you study this subject you will be more aware of sickness and you will at least have minor knowledge on this subject which can help you until you get professional help . i think that all most subject should be studied in school , so you can have the basic of the knowledge in order to live your life in a balanced way instead of having knowledge of only on topic , because unless your life evolves around it , it will not help whatsoever it will become completely meaningless in all the other topic , yet it will help you alot on your main objective , but life doe not load it self on that specific goal . i conclude that great knowledge for one purpose is not a useful a minor knowlege for many academic reference , also you can have something to major in .
