success is a thing that can be interpreted very differently , depending on people 's point of view . my point of view about `` success '' is to achieve determinated and accurate goal , and always have an objective , both in private and professionnal life . in my part , i do agree that successful people are those who take risk and try to develop new thing and way to carry them out . first of all , people take risk because they want to go ahead to find a solution to improve their situation , and this desire of changement is reflective to a determined and self confidence , main point for success . then , the thing that do not kill make u stronger . that is to say if we fail doing something , a engaging with someone , launching a new business or choosing education orientation , we will remember our mistake and never do them again . we have to make mistake to know how to do it in a better way , to improve our knowledge , and one day to be successful in achieving something . in the business field , most of the time , manager who tried to launch their activity on new market , but made a lot of mistake due to their lack of experience , causing a bad situation in the company , are fired and replaced . i think that it will benefit the company which will next recruit these manager , because they should have learnt from their experience and will be able to act in a difficult situation , knowing what to do , in order to be successful for the company . finally , i think that it is important to have objective in our life . objectives make u volunteer , engaged and involved in what we do , and without objective , our life would be poor . the unique way to have new objective is to achieve the actual one , and to achieve them , it is important to take risk . people who only do what they already know are self satisfied , so they dont need to have any objective .
