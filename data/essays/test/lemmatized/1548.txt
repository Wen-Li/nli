i agree with the following statement that `` successful people try new thing and take risk rather than only doing what they know how to do well '' . firstly according to my opinion successful people are those people who have became successful by not just doing the same thing which they had already done or known to them earlier but by doing different , challanging and creative thing which ha made them successful . sucessful people always keep on changing their atitudes and sense of work a per the situation , their decession are not rigid they are very inspirastional , useful and motivative . secondly succesful people always have the thirst of doing new thing and ready to take the task no matter the amount of risk involved in it because they always have an positive attitude towards doing new thing and challanging task , they always come up with new idea and thing that can be used to be more famous and successful , they always keep on thinking of getting new idea and startegy in doing a new task which will not only help others in many way but also also help them in getting recognisition and more successl . thirdly successful people are intelligent and smart they think differently from others and are always ready to take up challanges that come in their way and always keep a postive attitude in order to acheive them which help them to become more successful , they are always ready to accept new and challanging task with an aim to achive it , they never use the same old strategy or idea which they had already used but rather keep on getting new idea and strategy that can used to complete the task . one of the example is the late mr. dhirubhai ambani pioneer of reliance industry and one of the richest and successful person in india the main goal of the successful person is to keep on searching new thing and idea rather then considering the same old pattern which the had known earlier because considering new thing and idea will not only help them in various mean but also to other which again in turn benfit themselves in return . thus accorinding to me succesful people are always in a huger for searching new thing idea and ready to take risk to become more and more successful .
