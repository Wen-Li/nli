today in our day to day life we watch lot of advertisement in television , newspaper and magazine . advertisements have become an important medium for growth and raise of the certain product . advertisements tell u some different and unknown thing of the product in an short time which usually sometimes we can do it by buying the product and understand the usuage and importance of product . however some advertisement doesnt prove the product better than they really are . i disgree with the statement , sometimes advertisement doesnt make product seem much better than they really are . in the television channel we come across lot of advertisement about weight loss product . they say that the person is going to loss 5 kg in 1 week but it is not all happens . for example , recently my cousin whose in suffering weight problem had seen the advertisement of weight loss product and she ha taken the product and she started using it . but shockingly she gained extra 4 kg instead of loss weight . the advertisement had misleaded her completly had made her attracted taken the advantage of people . in the daily newspaper , recently i have read an article about an article it all about improve communication skill by buying book . theres and free gift of pack of cds along with the book . however when i went to the shop and asked about the book . they said that the cd are not for free but i need to some extra 10 $ to get the cds along with book . the adverstisements in newspaper sometimes doesnt convey accurate and real message about the product . recently i saw an advertisement in television about the metallic guitar and thought of giving it a an birthday gift to my friend . the advertisement ha given orginal cost a 100 $ with tax included for 1 yr warranty . however when i bought the guitar and started practising it for few month i have foung it not working fine and one day the string of guitar ha broken . when i took this guitar to the shop the shop keeper ha said the warranty ha been a long and past offer given to customer and it doesnot exists anymore . advertisements must bring an postive approach for people to buy it and feel satisfaction when they really buy them . it should not mislead the customer , which could cause bad reputation for the product and decline in growth of the sale of product .
