i agree with that statement . the ozone layer is getting worse everyday and nobody is doing somthing important about it yet . the talk for solar power ha been going around for so long now but still i do n't see a difference in our ozone . everyone know that the main problem for the ozone layer being that way is because of air pollution . air pollution mostly come from automobile and factory , especially chemical factoris , and to tell you the truth we have n't been doing a great job over the past year . if scientist found out an easier way for the people to use solar energy i would'nt even be writting this essay for you guy . unfortunatly there is n't but that still dose n't mean i 'm giving up hope . so yes i believe there will be fewer car in the future or in twenty year . oil a a business ha ruiend the world with greed , power , and selfishness . if our machine ran on solar power there would be no money envolved and in that case there will be no problem . people do n't understand what kind of problem money brings to them , and when i say people i really mean the people who have alot of money and no problem and do n't care about anything around them . i 'm not saying that there will be no car in twenty year , im just say that if solar power is a big success in year to come then it is true , there will be much fewer car later then there are today . i 'm guessing that in a good thirty to forty year the whole earth will consist of solar power , and i do n't just mean car i 'm talking everything we use with patrol . so most likely i we all should go with this theory of mine .
