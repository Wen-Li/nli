it is quite controversial topic whether the number of vehicle , mainly car , would increase in future or whether their use will diminish . some people mention that due to population explosion , which many of the developing country are facing today , more car would be required a compared to those required presently . on the other hand , some believe that the quantity of car would decrease in the future time a they think that people would become more conscious of the threat posed by excessive vehicle . i personally believe smaller number of car would be used in future . nowadys , people are also getting more conscious about the problem like increased air pollution and sound pollution which are direct consequence of high number of vehicle in the city . also , the present car mainly employ fossil fuel which are limited and would extint sometime in the future . a lot of emphasis is currently laid on consuming the availaible fuel wisely and by saving them for future . in recent time , there ha been an increase in number of article and advertisemts appearing in newspaper which urge people to use public transport in order to get rid of the above mentioned problem . there ha been a tremendous increase in the number of vehicle on road in most of the major city all around the world . also , people are facing a lot of problem caused by the incresed number of car . people in such big city face problem like congestion and road-jams specially in the peak hour of morning and evening . there ha been an increased demand of adequate public trasport . one of the most befitting example of this increased demand and the subsequent action is the introduction of metros train a the public transport . all the major city in the world like new delhi , tokyo , kolkatta have either been provided with this new metro train service or some attempt are being carried out to implement the efficient public transport . a lot of reseacrh ha been going on implementing altenatives like monorails , especially in highly congested area where metro trians ca n't be implemented . the introduction of high capacity bus and development of special corridor for them in city like new delhi is yet another example of numerous attempt to improve the public transort system . so , i feel that this combined increase in consciousness in general public about the consequnces of increased number of vehicle and emphasis on improving public transport might eventually lead to decreased number of car in future .
