i agree with the statement because of many reason . one is , advertisement always exaggerate the qualification of the product and cause people to expect miraculous result . so , when the customer face with the unsatisfactory result they are disappointed and do not want to buy the same product for the second time . in addition to these , people are more likely to buy the product they see on the tv and pay higher price just because they like the advertisement . it is a very common trick which is used by the brand owner . most of the time consumer pay a lot to low quality product because of the advertisments . for example , my mother bought a shampoo which she saw on the tv and paid a lot more than usual . after she used it she realised that her expectation were not met . she wanted to have healty shining hair like the famous actress on the advertisement but experienced that this perfect illusion exists only on tv . moreover , some product do not contain the same amount of ingredient a mentioned on the product and put customer health in danger . this situation exist especially in the country where chemical control are not very strict . advertisments mostly emphasise the very special ingredient in their product and encourage people to buy it whereas most of the time company refuse to declare the percentage . another negative effect caused by this general understanding is that people are more likely to think that the product which they do not see on tv are useless . if a company doe not spend huge amount of money for advertisment and if a consumer doe not know about the brand she refuse to try the product . here again we can see how influencial the advertisments are
