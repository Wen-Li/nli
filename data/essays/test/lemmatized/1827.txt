basically i am not in accord with the opinion . such kind of generalisation is not possible . because there are lot of evidence which prove that young people are still seriously aware of their community . there are lot of club which are really very helpful . and also there are charitable group and ofcourse still there are lot of blood donation camp . and in those camp most of the donar are young boy and girl . still we see that yong people show their respect by offering their own seat to aged and weak person . lot of cultural programme are still held in locality to entertain the common people by young people which difute the opinion stated by the speaker . but it is really true that people now a day are much more busy thn earlier . due to the increasing competition people are engaging more in their personal life . but it is not their own fault . if we compare the activity of young people of nowadays with the past then we see that now people are more con cerned to their career and their study . but it is not true that they are not concern of thair community atall . still now if there any flaw arises in our society young people are those who come first to solve the problem . few day ago i heard about a club of young people who took the all responsibility when a small boy just fall down from a building . and the most amazing fact is that there were a lot of people who were aged but they did not take the responsibility of the boy to carry him to the near by hospital . but the club member when came to know about the incidend they just rushed to the spot and carried the boy to the hospital without caring about the police and all other risk . actually there are a lot of incident which prove that the statement is a really flawed and baseless . so from yhe stated explanation we can simply conclude that young people are still a much active a past regarding the time they spend for their communitie
