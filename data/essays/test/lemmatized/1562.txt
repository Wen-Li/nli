i strongly believe that most advertisement make product seem much better than they really are for the following reason . first , advertisement only emphasis on the merit of product . when i wa in a junior in tokyo university , a famous university in japan , i bought a computer . the advertisement of the computer claimed that the specification of this machine wa so high that any application software could work efficiently and the price is very cheap . i wa very satisfied with buying such a good machine with low price . however , when i got back to my home , i found that any application software did not be installed . i must buy application software in addition and it cost 2000 dollar . if the advertisement had claimed not only their merit but also their defect , i could have saved my money . this example clearly show that advertisement only claim product ' merit . second , the cost of advertisement is often more expensive than the cost of product . when i worked in a cosmetic company , i wa in charge of the product promotion . the original cost of the product wa only 2 dollar . however , the cost of the advertisement wa 3 dollar a product . without advertisement , we could not compete with other company ' product . therefore , we invested much money on advertisement to make our product seem much better than they really were . as the above example clearly show that advertisement often cost much higher than the cost of product . thus , i definitely believe that product are seemed to be more better than they really are with advertisement .
