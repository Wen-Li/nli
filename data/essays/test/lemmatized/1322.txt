i believe that most advertisement do really make product seem much better , handy , and necessary for daily use , than they really are . it should not be surprising to say that ; since the ultimate goal of the advertisement is to convince you to buy thing , whether you need them or not . first of all we need to be specific on the type of the advertisement we are discussing about . some product need to be advertised , some others do not because you may already know what you actually need . for instance an advertisement of a new car if it 's a unknown brand serf well for the product sale since an ordinary customer doe not consider buying that specific brand . first he or she need to be convinced by the advertisement to change his or her car . second they need to be convinced to buy that brand , so it 's a two level process . the same logic applies for every item that is rarely bought and maybe expensive a well . the actual problem is to spread the message that even a person is happy with his car , advertisement have the power to illustrate the situation otherwise , presenting an option that there are be better and cheaper car to be bought . thus the role of the advertisement can be understood better if we consider the subject from this perspective . the other type of advertisement are of some type of brand which do n't need to spend large amount of money for advertising . very good quality brand , brand that target a specific type of customer ( income , social status etc ) , or product that are for use of only one gender do not need striking advertisement . you can not be deceived by an advertisement of a toy a an adult . you are not interested in make-up apparel if you are a man or without a wife . similar to that example if you are a passionate bmw driver , the ad of mercedes do not atrract your desire . therefore such brand have le intention to make their product look better on ad . to conclude it would be better to say that it is true for an advertisement to be convincing . but it is up to you from which one you would be attracted most .
