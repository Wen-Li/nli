i agree that understanding idea and concept is more important for student than understading fact . there are two reason to support my opinion . i would like to show in the following statement . first , study of idea and concept lead for student to the ability to adoped to the various situation and field . although fact are important , it tends to be in the limited area . students have a lot of possibility of work place , job and career . they have to strengthen the ability to adopt to anywhere . second , current society becomes specillized in the quite extent . the material that student have to study lie in the broad area . for example , all the student need to know the fact of nanotechnolgy ? on the other hand , the time for student to spend study is limited . although there are a lot of graduate school for higher eduction and it extend the time to study . yet , they still have to utilize their time effectively . therefore they should focus on the common material including idea and concpets and give them priority . in the concluding , i agree that it is more important for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact . althougn , fact are also important because they consists the basis of every study , research and so on , i do agree the importance of understanding ieas and concept by the before mentiones reason .
