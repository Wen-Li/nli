i do agree that most advertisement make procuts seem much better than they really are . let 's take for example the picture of a fast food meal . they always show perfectly shaped sandwitch , colorful sauce flooding out of them , fresh salade leaf and very attractive color . but when you find yourself at the counter , thing are really different . the sandwitch seems half size compared to the advertised one , an unidentified mix of sauce appears at the side and a few slice of salade can be found inside , which are almost tasteless . i think that with food there is at least some hoest reason why the product can not look exactly a the advertiswments do : in fact , there is an inherent difficulty of producing identical item . but what about kid game ? here thing are different : the product is identical of that shown in the advertisement , but it is always advertised in a context which let him appear much more better than it really is . for example , a single lego police station , shown in the context of a huge and fully operative city made of lego , will appear much better than it is taken alone . it might appear a very interesting item in that enviroment , but taken alone on a shelf in your bedroom , it could be not so attractive . off course , you might alway buy a full city made of lego , and probably that is the actual target of that advertisement ! in both case , the reason for making a product seem much better than it really is , is to attract people toward that product . sometimes , similar product have similar characteristic and feature , and the only way to direct the consumer 's attention towards a product instead of another one , is to tell the thruth plus . .. a small lie . that small lie is the actual difference between the reality and the appearance .
