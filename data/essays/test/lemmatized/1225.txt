since the beginning of civilization man ha been living in community . this wa mainly because of the human nature to be part of a social structure and participate in activity a a group . it also ensured help for the member of the community in time of crisis . man ha developed a a society . from being part of household with 15 to 20 member we have now come to living with smaller , closely knit family in these modern time . these huge family had their duty and responsibility divided among themselves and this reduced the burden from being thrust on any one member of the family . it also gave the family more time to participate in a greater number of community service like social gathering , charity event and the like . however with the growth of city , child started moving away from their parent and forming their own nuclear family . this added to the responsibility of each of the family member thus leaving little time to participate in the community . i agree that young people today do not give enough time to helping their community . however this is because of the fast paced life that we all live today . we have a lot of individual duty , career and other work to attend to that helping out with our community doe not feature on our list of priority and is often ignored . a competition grows so doe our work load and so do our expectation about ourselves . we get involved with college exam , family function , project for school and other activity that we do not leave enough time even for ourselves to relax and enjoy recreation . however in recent time it ha been observed that the youth have been coming forward to participate in issue that they feel strongly about . it could range from issue a simple a correct waste disposal at the local dumping ground to the more serious matter of student opposition to reservation in various policy . the youth have been voicing their concern more vociferously than before and it is about time that they were taken seriously . however this participation is still in it infancy stage and requires organisation probably at school or university level . this will enable student to decide a a group what they can do to help a certain project like an adult literacy program or plan concrete measure to be taken against indiscriminate deforrestation . it may be the case that although the young people nowadays want to give enough time to helping their community but just dont know how to begin . it would help that like minded people come forward to form group or organisation that could effectively achieve what one person may find it hard to do on their own . this can be done by forming various society in school and at university to help student be work for a cause they really believe in .
