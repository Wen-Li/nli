are most of the people living nowadays successful ? are they struggling to successed ? people , nowadays , are help not only themselves but also other people they , actually , do not know . therefore , successful people usually try new thing and take a risk . to my mind , people , whom are successful should try to do new thing even though sometimes it is a risk . thus , i agree with the statement above . successful people will feel bored sometimes if they continued a the same routine they do daily , why ? with trying new thing he or she might get an advantage by doing it . what are those advantage ? first , intelleignce student , for instance , will always study the same way they usually do ; however , if they change the way they study , they will , for sure , an advantage for this change . for example , i talked once with a smart student and asked him , `` do you study the same way all the time ? '' he replied , `` no ! i usually change my studying style for enetertainment . '' i asked , `` is studying have an entertainment ? '' he answered , `` yes , because without enetertainement you will not study will . in other ward , changing the studying style help you concentrate on your study . '' for that reason , we may say that having a risk in studying give people an advantage . second , having a risk in the stock market , which is very serious . if a person always profit money from the stock market that mean having a risk once will not affect him or her . for instance , i wa talking with a bank manager once , and i asked him , `` about people , whom have a lot of money in their account ? and the money they use for the stock market ? '' he answered , `` those people are having a high thinking ; in other ward , they think about which stock are they going to buy ; even though they have a lot of money . '' i asked , `` but do not they have some risk with their money ? '' he replied , `` yes they do . we have once a man had a risk and bought stock with all his money ; after that , he got an advantage by doubling the amount of money he have . finally , businessmen always do the same thing daily . if businessmen change the way they speak or deal with people by having his employee a a friend of him . this could be dangerous because he might give them some of the company secret . but they could help him by not only new idea , but new project . therefore , businessmen could get an advantage from his employee . people most of the time successed in thing they usually do , but in thing they do not usually do they think they will fail . without risk in people life they will not learn new thing . to sum up , people have to have risk in their life to go for the better .
