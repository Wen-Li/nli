i agree with this statement a human being living in this world of advertisement . the advertisement are crucial for the company . in order to survive in this competetive world , they need to advertise their product and hence increase their sale . but the competition in the world is incredible nowadays . in order to stay on top and increase their sale the company need to create new advertising strategy and new idea . these new strategy and idea sometimes go beyond the moral ethic of the industry misleading the people about the product of the company . for example a child watching a tv advertisement of a choclate with the spider-man figure on it , can easily think that he can be like spider-man if eats this brand of choclate . and also some other advertisement create such an image that if you eat or buy or drink that sort of product , you will be very happy , enjoy the life more that the others or suddenly discover the secret meaning of life . i understand the intend of the procuders of such advertisement a an adult . but i doubt this is valid for youngster a well . they are too innocent and they have too much to learn about life . in our modern world , what they know about life is what they see on televions , in internet and on magazine . they need guidance in order to protect themselves from the adverse affect of such communication mean . and advertisement are main part of it . but from the producer ' point of view , of course they are right . they need to show the people that their product is better than the others and maybe it is the best . but they need to be just and fair and they should not cheat the consumer .
