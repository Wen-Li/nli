it is not easy to take a side between if is more important for student to understand idea and concept or if is more important for them to learn fact , for these reason being agree or disagree with the statement it 's very complicated for me , however , my kind of personality is comparable with the importance of understanding idea and concept and this make me incline to be agree with the statement . there are two characteristic of my personality that help me to illustrate why i am agree . first , i love to know the thing base , in other word , i dont 's like when i do n't understand thing from the begining . second , i am very creative , and that characteristic ha implication like use different idea or knowledge to built new thing or idea . both characteristic help each other to support my election , if i understand thing from the beginig and i have the concept clear , i have the capacity to built new thing , besides i can deduce thing by myself . when you learn fact , you are available to answer just what is involved in the thing you have learned , otherwise , when you have idea and concept clear , you can figure out thing that possibly would't be in the question . in conclusion , for me , it is more enjoyable the capacity of creating new form of knowledge from the one i got before and learning fact would not offer me tihs possibility .
