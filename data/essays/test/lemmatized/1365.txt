nowadays , in many school the student gained their knowledge just by many practice , personally i think this is not a good idea . when we are studying what we should know first is the method and the idea that lead to the result . when student are learning , they must first understand why will it be like this or that , it is not only because it can encourage the student to discover the real core of the knowledge , but can also make the study effiecient and enterprising , while modifying their knowledge with flexibility and usage in a wider range . first , the student can really get what they have been told and , no doubt be smarter . the way of learning english for non-english speaker , for example , is to learn from abc and use it , if the learner never have an idea of what is a bible or what is the greek mythology , he or she will not know the way the english is used , do n't even mention about the magnificence of this language . second , if he doe n't know the why or the how the studying objective act , that will make the process of study boring for the learner . in contrast , if the student understand it , he will have a will to control it and the will of knowing more . the base of the knowledge will tell the student why or how it act and make them have the ability of insighting thing . you will say , yeah , a resercher or a specialist will need it of couse , but let me tel you , well , normal people also need it in their daily life . family member must understand idea to keep their relationship go on well . if we just learn fact that will be very fast , yes but not prounced .
