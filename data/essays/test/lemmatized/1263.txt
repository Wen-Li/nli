i never reflect about this , before but it is a interesting question . i agree more or le . in fact undertand what we learn , and why it ' like that , it 's very important for student . if the student just learn fact without understant idea and concept they ca n't do them own opinion . and this for all . for economy , for history , for mathematic , for all we learn at th university . it'very important to learn with intellgence . udnerstand idea and concept ha for consequence to have an opinion , own opinion . necesseraly you juge what you are learning . this very important because like that human are not robot , they are hot scheep with the seme opinion . for example on history if student learn fact whitout understand il , they ca n't see mistaces and problem . they just learn . it 's not in off for humanity . we have to understand the word and what'happening . we have to see , juge and do a own opinion . if the student , taht 's mean , the future human , do n't udnerstand nazi and just learn the date of war , they ca n't see when people thing again , and begening again raciste . if the people d'ont understand why the onu is created , they ca n't understan why when a coutry take a decision even if onu do n't want it , it 's not the possible . it 's the seme for all . in scientific fact for understand how is the word why he 's like that or like this , we have to udnerstund theory not just learn formules . but , learn fact can be utile , because first you learn fact and then you try to understand idea and concept . you can do this without you did that . it 's necessary to learn fact because like that you can udnerstand idea . understand idea and concept when you learn fact , it 's the key to be free . free in your opinion , free in your jugement and free in your life . because when you undnerstand your word you 're not passive but active and that is the most important , to be active , to be unique by your culture , your opinion .
