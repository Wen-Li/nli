i hope that this statement will come true , but honestly i do n't believe it . there are a lot of good invention on the go now , for example car driving with solar energy or with oil made out of plant - but still the oil industry is too powerful . in my opinion the oil industry is doing everything to block alternative invention like that . they want the people to be dependent on oil , so that they can make money . so they encourage the automobile industry to build car who make a lot of environment pollution . another point is the growing population in the rich country . people are getting older so they are able to drive longer . the result are more car in the street . another reason is that people have to be flexible because of their job nowadays . they want to live in a peaceful little cottage in a quiet rural area but the working place is in the next city , so they often have to drive hundred of kilometre to work and are on the street for hour . everything ha to be convenient and comfortable . nobody want to make compromise . i 'm sorry if i sound kind of bitter and disappointed , but that 's my point of view . i 's one of my biggest wish that one day there is an invention that make movement without pollution possible .
