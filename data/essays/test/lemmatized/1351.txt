i live in a country where we have to learn a lot of different subject until we are 18 or 19 year old . i really think we can have different point of view on this subject . let 's write down the good and the bad point of each proposition before making a conclusion . having a broad knowledge is very important a it is a basis . you ca n't make a really good specification without any core knowledge . that is why you have to study various subject before specialzing . you also can improve your personnal culture by learning a lot of subject , which will create a strong basis very important to be adaptable and even open-minded , on topics-of science for example - . moreover , when you are young you often do n't want to know what you want to do in the future . in that case , learning a lot of different thing on different subject can keep all solution possible for you . it close at least no door . learning really specific thing permit you to have a great competence on a subject . it may permit you to work faster with shorter study which can obviously be a great thing . then , when you specialize a lot , you can make really long study and maybe get a good job . when you really hate certain subject or really love others , their is no hesitation to make : just specialize . if you really enjoy biology , stop learning litterature . this kind of education permit you to be a real champion on a subject , it 's certain , but i hope you really , really love it . i think that it is really important to have a certain number of core competence that you must learn a long a possible . it 's a difficult thing to choose between math and geography , or litterature and biology , so it can be a good thing to be able to have a high knowledge in all those subject . as a matter of fact , i had big problem to choose what subject or main field i really wanted to study after having left high school and it might be hard to think that you are studying a subject instead of another .
