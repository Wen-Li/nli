i disagree with the opinion that young people do not give enough time to helping their community : in fact i think they do it , but their work and their contibute are not evaluated and appreciated a much a it would be . i will support my opinion with several example of situation i experienced in my life . young peole is more interested in culturals event of his contemporary period and more expert in term of knowledge of music , theatre or visual artist than older people of their community ; so young people often organize show , concert or reading in order to share their experience with the rest of the communitie . this special help to their community is often undervaluated to the other citizen . for istance , when i wa 16 , a group of friend and i organized an art exhibition of contemporary art in the city hall of my village collecting and showing several piece from local artist . the majority of the exhibited piece wa rather orrible and all the citizen did n't appreciate our work . looking from another perspective , we gave the chance to young artist to exhibit somewhere and some of them now is a famous international artist and he remember yet he exhibited in a small village where everybody despite the youngpeople hated him .
