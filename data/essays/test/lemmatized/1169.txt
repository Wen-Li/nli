i 'm always amazed when hearing people claiming the significat advantage of travelling in group . even one did not know much concrete unpleasure stuff accompanied by such way of travelling from his or her own experience , he or she could have deduced it from common sense . just take a glimpse at those people in goups , you may find all the defect related to this way of travelling -- terrible limitation , constant shopping and , inevitably , a higher cost . i first went to london in a tour goup at the age of 9 , which wa organized my school . the trip wa indeed exciting for a young boy . however , there were still some unpleasant thing which i 'll never forget . every morning , we were supposed to get up at 7 o'clock and get to the designated place in order to attend a ` tour goup ' even if we kid usually played late at night and hardly had any sleep . but any concern for our precious ` sleep time ' were neglected , simply for the reason , said the grown-ups , ` keep up with the schedule ' . what a terrible thing it would be to ` keep up with the schedule ' when you were right enjoying the vast sight on the london eye ? what a vexing thing it would be to leave the westminster church only stayed for minute in order to ` keep up the schedule which is often required when travelling in a goup . i could have enjoyed more if i had travelled by myself . in addition , traveller may usually get afflicated by the tour guide ' endless ` amiable ' suggestion to buy some ` unique ' and ` worthy ' souveniors which are ubiqutously meaningless and expensive . motivated by their word , you may easily begin the process that changing you should-be-happy trip into a shopping mall ! i do still rememble how many useless thing i bought in manchester and leeds which almost got me crazy . moreover , it seems that the cost of a tour guide will never be cheap . regardless of the possiblity that you 're decieved , usually a tour guide will still cost a lot . on the other hand , travelling by you self would help you to save up this cost and spend it where you like . as the doubt of ` individual tour ' ha claimed , we traveller can hardly enjoy those tourist point without the leading of an experienced guide . however , they have neglected the pre-eminet use of the book and internet . having read the map and inroductions about the destination , one can boldly go to where he want . perhaps the guiders may even know le than the book can tell ! now , start a trip of your own , after having a nice search on ` google maps ' ?
