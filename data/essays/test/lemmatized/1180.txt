i agree to the statement and disagree at the same time , because it depends on the place i 'm travelling to , and if i have been there before or not . the statement is correct in a way , but also wrong in other way , if i weighed the pro and con of travelling in a group led by a tour guide , i would say that i would agree with the statement if i 'm visiting a new place that i do n't know anything about it . on the other hand , if i 'm travelling to a place that i have been to before , i would prefer to travel alone . travelling in agroup led by a tour guide will give me the privilage of feeling secure , this is very important when it come to place i do n't know . at the same time i can rest assured that i will see all interesting place and sight of that place , without missing anything . this way i can truly live the experience and enjoy the trip without worrying about money arrangement , hotel booking , airline schedule and other thing that can really ruin the pleasure of the trip . but if i 'm travelling to a place i have been to before , i will definitly prefer to travel alone , this will set me free from being tied up to a group all the time . thats because i know the place , i know where to have fun and i know what is interesting to do or see , so there is no need for the commitment to a schedule . furthermore i can enjoy a specific activity more time than another one if i would like , but this is a pleasure of freedom that come with a price , a i will be responsible for all the arrangement of travel , but it is a price i 'm willing to pay for that freedom and pleasure i 'm looking for . to sum it up , i 'm willing to put more money and effort to travel alone if i can handle the risk involved in that , but i would absolutly travel with a group led by a tour guide if the risk are vague , because uncalculated risk can cost me a lot .
