in twenty year there will be fewer car in use than there are today . according to me , that would be a dream becoming true because i think that we live in a way too much polluted world . to stick back to the subject , i think that there will be le car in the future . in paris , driving drive people crazy , especially since our mayor created corridor for the bus . our mayor , bertrand delanoe , ha also accrued the number of bus for the day and ameliorated the night bus service which are both really good thing . so more people are using the bus than before and are leaving their car in their car park . also , when you live in big city , at certain time , it take you le time to go somewhere when you use the bus or the subway than if you had taken your car . traffic-jams are horrible in paris , everybody yell at everybody ; everybody is being rude and impolite also it is really stressing and get on everybody 's nerve . if you want to go to the countryside , you can take the train , and while , you are travelling , you can do whatever you want , you can read , phone , listen to music , sleep , eat . . but when you are driving , you can not do all these thing , no , you have to watch the road with attention , you can not fall asleep . driving is really stressing , you can not enjoy the view or the landscape , but only look at the black asphalt of the road . i wa thinking of something else also : in france , every year , we have many car accident caused by alcohol abuse . maybe these accident feared people and now they are le reluctant to driving . for example : i know that if i am going to a party with my friend and that i will drink overthere , i would not feel secure to driving back my friend . an other element that can reduce the number of car on the road is the fact that now , some firm and company ask their employee to share their car , to do what we call in france ` co-driving ' . also , when i think of it , i know that sometimes my mum feel lazy after work , and that she ha not got the courage to drive back home . so she take the subway and leaf the car on the car-park of the company , poor little car , all alone in the dark , at night instead of being in the heaten car-park nearby our house !!!! sincerely , i hope that in the future , there will really be le car , that people will more often use the public mean of transport or their bicycle . i would really like our city paris to be like one of these city in china where everybody travel with it bike .
