i agree with the statement that successful people try new thing and take risk rather than only doing what they already know how to do well . one of the reason that i think it is is because people can be sccuessful only after you start new thing . when you try to do something new , it can end being sccessful , or can end not being . but how could you get a sccess withought even starting it ? the point is that if you want to get a sccess , you first try to start something . another thing is that taking risk can lead you to be a successful person in the end . when you take risk , that is when you will face some problem doing it . i think those time are when you learn to do something , because you will be dealing with problem , and after a while , you will have grown . when you have grown , i think you have scceeded in your life . we can see why you have to take risk from some people , too , like hiker . some people go into mountain with only a bag , try to go somewhere they have never been to . they are risking their life , but when they make it , you can always see their face full of smile which show you their huge sccess . if you do what you already know all the time , you can not never go ahead . once you start new thing , and take risk , you can go forward . being sccessful is not that easy to be , because there is always `` not sccessful '' on the other hand . however , without even starting the new thing , you will not be able to learn anything .
