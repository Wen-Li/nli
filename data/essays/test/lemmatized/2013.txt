education is the most important for the human being , because it take a lot of year to finish and you are getting prepared to the life at this period , nowadays , teacher of the new education system teach their student that understanding fact are more important than understanding concept , however , we can see that is not succesful way to learn the issue . first of all , there is no type of student , who can understand the fact before understanding the idea , you can not require the result , unless they have an opinion about the the concept , so that , you must teach the student main idea , this will improve their knowledge and they can easily focus on fact , otherwise you can not require them to learn detail . secondly , it is obvious that student can not create solution and improve themselves on new idea and concept without the fact , it is essential that the student learn the fact . this debate will survive for many year because i think it depends on the student , some student can reach the idea from the fact , but some of them can not reach the idea from the fact , and we can see that idea and fact are combined to each other , you can not seperate them , they are like a diffrent part of a same apple . in conclusion , ideas are the result of the fact , the fact mean nothing only with themselves , i think this situation is not only for student , this is all about human being , teacher have to teach the idea deeply so they can find the answer for the fact .
