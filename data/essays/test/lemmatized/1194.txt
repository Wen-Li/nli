yes i agree with statement `` the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide '' , this is because if we travel alone and with out a guide you will get bored and u will feel lonely in the tour . and according to me , when i went to tour with my friend i enjoyed lot with my friend sharing the experience and feeling and make me more intresting . the best way is to hire a guide so that he will explain the thing which we are going to see and which we are watching , because none of u didnot went to that place and none of u known about the history of that palces . if we hire the guide he will explain the history of the palces and play some joke on that and make the tour more lively . and when i went to the banglore city alone for some purpose i have to saty alone for 2 day and i wa pretty bored on 2 day . if i went to banglore with a group so , that my two day will more enjoyable . lastly , i would like to conclude that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide , so that the tour will more lively and tour guide will explain all the thing about the tour and the site which we are going to watch and the tour will be well planed by guide and all the time schedule and all other thing will be seen by the tour guide . and by using the tour guide there is no problem of missing the site seeing place and wounderfull thing because the tour guide is the professional in that . so if u travel in a group you are going to make the tour more enjoyable and give ur most unforgatable experience with your group .
