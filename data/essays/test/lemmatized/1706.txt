do you ever wonder why the model or actress look simply amazing in the front cover of any magizine ? well , thanks to photoshop ! yes , they are not perfect and they do have wrinkle and bad skin sometimes . this is just a tipical trick to convince u the reader to buy specific thing for personal benefit . i believe because of this reason that advertisement have the need to make some product seem much better that they really are . nowadays , a it is basically known , all the magazine and tv commercial make u sometimes want to look like somebody else . everyone ha wished it once in their lifetime . as the neutrogena publishing manager assistant it is my job to search for new product woman are looking for by interview and other specific data . also i have the knowledge that before any product is released in any kind form certain step must be checked and preformed . first , a model ha to be selected ( artist or professional model ) he or she ha to go through a photo session with nice chick clothes and makeup . second , the picture are re-touched by professional that work with photoshop ( a progam that modifies image ) sometimes with the selected model present and erase any kind of unwanted mistake ( wrinkle , dark circle under the eye , zit , etc ) . third , the name of the product and the product itself is attached to the main picture . all of this to only promote a product that in many case is not even used by the model for the photo session . but imagine promoting a anti-wrinkle cream if the model in it had visible wrinkle ? i would certainly not buy it , neither would anyone . so , it is necessary to make product seem better for the selling of these of course and the profit of specific company . i am not establishing that all of the product are not effective i 'm just saying that with a little of help a lot of them are easily sold . to sump up , this method of making product to seem better than they really are is a very good way of gaining profit . in our day this is what is all about . .. making money is n't it right ? and what better way that to do this i believe it fair .
