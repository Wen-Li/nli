i agree with the idea that most advertisement make product seem much better than they really are for the following reason . one of the purpose of the advertisement is to stimulate people to buy their product or so if the advertisement is le atractive than the real product it is meaningless to spend the budjet on the advertising . do you atract the advertisement such a not so beautiful colored cosmetic or not sizling beef steak picture in front of the restaurant ? in addition , other important purpose of the advertisement is to aware people attention to their brand . recently in the market there are many many product appealing to consumer it is so competitive in the most industry . your competitor also should provide much attractive advertisement to attack your product so you should create attractive advertisement to compete them . to make product seem much better is very important when we think the purpose of the advertisement . consumers usually learn from their past experience that the advertisement emphasis on too much benefit which they really can provide , so they tends to judge the advertisement severly . many people know if they succeed to lose weight they need to reduce the amount of food they eat and excesize regurally , they realized that only taking supliments or having cream on their body do not effect . however they need to have a dream by the advertisement which provided positive image for their diet life . to think the purpose of the advertisement and consumer behaviour it is unavoidable that most advertisement make product seem much better than they really are . however we also should keep it mind that sometimes too much decolated advertisement might loose consumer trust then lead your business failure .
