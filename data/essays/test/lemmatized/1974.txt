in the market people will find many type of product and also many brand of the same product . it is important to realize this , because when some advertisement are delivered to our house , much of the quality and characteristic will depend of the brand and the way the product is promoted . for that reason i agree with the statement that most advertsiments make product seem much better than they really are . when someone check the advertisement looking for a specifical product , first he look if is the proper product , then he compare the price and then itis possible to look for other thing like color and size . however , when this person go to the store in order to buy the product and the seller show the product to him , he realizes that the product look different maybe smaller or wider than the one in the brochure . for instance , last mont i wanted to buy a laptop and i saw a very nice one on a local store of my city . i checked everything , the memory ram , the video card and the hard disk capacity , but when i reached the place the laptop wa enormous it seemed like a desktop computer , but in the brochure when someone saw it , the laptop had the same size apparience a a small notebook . at this moment i understood why this store had offered this price such a very great bargain . another good example is when you buy thing by internet . sometimes , seller do not put the real photo of the product , instead of this , they attach other brand new product photo . therefore , the person who want the item buy the product and pay with his credit card , after two or three day the product arrives and the buyer realizes that this product is different to the seller 's advertisement . last summer , i wanted to buy some specific brand of sunglass and i found this glass in the internet , i bought it and when the sunglass arrived , it wa true that it had the same model but the brand wa a different from i selected . thus , i believe that this statement is true and i strongly agree with it . it is important for seller to change their way of promoting their product . until this , i will always prefer to go to the store and see the product before buying it .
