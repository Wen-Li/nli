`` move fast everyone ! we have to hurry for the next course to see . '' it is common situation when we travel in a group with tour guide in the popular place . in my opinion , traveling in a group led by a tour guide is not the best way to travel . first reason is that it is time consuming . in addition i can experience adventuruous travel when travel alone , not led by a tour guide . first of all , when we travel with other people in a group , it is time comsuming . everytime we move to other place to see , we have to wait for other people who did not arrive at bus from the first place . i had a bad experice when i traveled to china in a group led by tour guide . the first spot we visited wa great wall and next course wa trying some traditional chinese food . however , there were some people who lost their way in the great wall and did not come to the place we promised to meet . almost one and half hour past , they finally arrived at the meeting place and we could not take the next course and mess up whole valuable day for travel . moreover , i can have great opportunity to experience the unique and adventurous thing at unfamilar place . when we travel with a tour guide , they always offer u the perfect schedule for travel . however , there are many people who want to experience special thing and take some risk when they travel , not the formal course that travel agency offer . i went to japan twice , the first time wa travel in a group led by tour guide and the second time wa travel alone , the first time wa really convenient because i had to just simply follow my tour guide but it wa not that intersting . however , when i travel to tokyo for myself , i have to find my way with map and direction to get to the popular place . it took more time to get there , but it gave me a lot of valuable experinces and i saw and heard much more traditional thing in japan during the travel . to sum up , i think it is not best way to travel in a group led by a tour guide . it can be time consuming to wait other people to move to next place . moreover , with the tour guide i can not have make my travel course freely and can not get some valuable experience from difficulty or hard in travel . i think travel have to give u feel of free , and great experience of that country or place .
