taking risk is a part of business venture . if people would step back at the thought of the negative of the taking the risk there would not be any growth in the way one think . there would be no change in the pattern of people handling their business . for instance if the kellogs company which make cornflakes would only stick to it idea of making only normal daily cornflakes then there would be no change in the profit of the company . the other product like kellogs chocos that it market ha proved to be of a great profit to them . so if it would not take the risk of investing in a new business it would never be aware of the profit that it ha made . businessmen and entreprenuers are always at a risk of loss when they invent in some new business but this never avoids them from investing further money . the fear of failure should not hamper one from going ahead . besides trying new thing give u an experience of the pro and con of a particular business . trying new thing give a better prospective for growth . it is rightly said that a human being is a learner till the end . some people often think that they do know everything about a particular issue or topic . but there maybe so many thing that one may not be aware of . staying only on one side of the fence and thinking about only that one side would never give u an idea about whats kept in store for u on the other side . by looking around and trying to gain information from surroundings we may actually learn many new thing . trying our hand at something new would make u aware of the different way in which we handle our life . it could bring about an everlasting change for the better .
