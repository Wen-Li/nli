the question at hand is what help student more - understanding idea and concept or learning the fact . though i agree that mostly learning a theory is crucial to gain insight about any topic , however if it is supported by the fact , it expedites the process of learning . to start with , in many case a student can not visualize a concept unless a physical fact accomponies with it . imagine how easy it is to explain a kid gravity by showing it example compared to explaning it just in theory . so a thoery with a fact is sometimes easier to grasp for a student . another example is subject like physic and chemistry . one can not learn these subject just by reading book . this is reason all school provide practical class along with lecture for these subject . also , sometimes just knowing a concept doe not help to gain the complete understanding , fact are required to complete them . in addition , in certain subject , fact play a bigger role than the theory . for instance archeology , history and upto some extent geography too . archaelogy is nothing but fact . history can not be explained just in theory . moreoever , if we go to the root of it , all idea and concept have been driven by fact only . each theory ha been invented to explain a fact . so in order to make student think beyond textbook , it is almost mandatory to learn about fact . also , fact motivate student to find their interest . for example , just looking at star trigger some people to choose their profession a astronomy . in summary , i disagree with the opinion that learning idea and concept ha more value for the student than knowing fact . to keep their thinking broad and comprehensive , student need to be taught both in balance .
