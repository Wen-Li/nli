the stament above refers to the issue of how advertisement present nowdays the product in a certain way that make people willing to buy it but not showing how the real product actually is . i shall analyze this issue giving argument and example . to analyze this issue it 's vital not to lose perspective and to remember the fierce jungle that the economy and business ha become today . it is clear that we live in a very competitive world where free economy is predominant . if a product or a brand want to survive and succeed , it ha to raise the attention of the public presenting itself a something really amazing that is different form the rest . that is the reason why all company have a marketing department . the main goal of an advertising prepared by a marketing team is to highlight to the public what are the best feature of this product and why the consumer should inmmediately go to the next store and buy it or why the consumer ca n't afford to live without this product . of course the advertisment will not comment on the feature that are not so brilliant or just a copy of the competition . that is not the point why the advertisment wa created for . it 's a kind of a game the consumer and the company have become used to play and they accept it a something granted . the expert consumer no longer belief all that the advertisment mention and , in the long run , he accepts it a long it ha most of the thing it said it had . there is a room for disappointment that it is , of course , not accepted equally . i still can remember the frustation that i used to have a a child when i received my christmas present that were not a exciting a they seemed in the television ad . last but not least , it must be remembered that , while this dissapointment is somehow accepted it ca n't evolve into fraud or bad intention of the company by advertising something that ha nothing to do with the real product . it is in this case where public authority must look for the protection of the right of consumer in order to avoid fraud .
