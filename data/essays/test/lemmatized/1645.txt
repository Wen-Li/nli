now-a-days people are showing much interest in travelling to new place and exploring new thing during their leisure time . the people enjoy travelling in group , particularly the college and university student . in my opinion , it 's always better to have a tour guide along with you when you travel to new place . first thing when we travel in group , we will find someone to organise and host the team . it would be much easier to make the plan of the trip if we have a person who is familiar with the going destination . so , when we are going to an unknown place it 's advisable to take a guide along with you . by taking a guide along with u we have many advantage . firstly , a the guide is familiar with the place he will make all prior arrangement like accomodation , site seeing and travel direction . he will give a perfect tour itinerary . secondly , we could able to save lot of time in visiting place , where we will not face any difficulty in locating the spot . he will describe all the history , about the culture and importance of the place while sight seeing . he will also guide u the do 's and dont 's while travelling to a new place . to my personal experience when i wa in my college , we planned to a hill station in group . after taking all pain staking effort , somehow we have reached our destination . there we felt lot of difficulty in finding a better accomodation . we have no idea about the place which we have visited because it a remote place , where peole are very few . we could not even find someone even to go to the particular spot . we did not much enjoyed the trip a we have wasted a lot of time in finding thing in our short period tour . considering the above point i feel that it 's better to have a guide along with u when you are travelling in a group , so that your trip will be more joyable and interesting .
