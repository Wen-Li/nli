whether most advertisement make product seem much better than they really are is difficult to evaluete . some people think that buying a particular product only reling on it advertisement it 's completly wrong but other people do n't think so and they trust in what advertisement affirm . consequently if i asked someone if he/she agree or not , the answer depends on different factor such a the earlier experience . before i decides i wuold like to consider both more closely . first of all , when someone need to buy a new product he/she should have consider the history of the facory that have made it , in fact some facories are more valuable than others . for example if i should have to buy a new car i restrict my choose only on two or three noun of factory such a renault or mercedes , because they make me more sure of what i 'm going to buy . as a result advertisement have only a few part on my decision . on the other hand , advertisement wa born in order to highlight the feature of a particular product especially positive one . furthermore it 's quite impossible they could suggest that the product wa worse than it real wa or they could affirm that it could have a negative aspect . however advertisement are very important because they permit people to know when a new product is turned out ; besides they have the function to keep well informed all people about new procucts of usual interest . in brief in my opinion on one hand advertisement are very important and it 's just a well they exist but nevertheless , before buying an object with particular feature that the advertisement do n't mention , the most important thing to do is faconsider the factory 's product and which feature it have in detail , in order to avoid bad surpises when i have just bought the object .
