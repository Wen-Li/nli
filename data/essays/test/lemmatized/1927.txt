i disagree with this opinion . my opinion is there is the subject the student should study the concept and fact and should not study the concept . i have several reason to support my opinion . the first reason is if the student only lean the fact without idea or concept , the student may able to remember the fact and they can use their fact in the exam , but they only can use shortly their fact , in order to pas through the time of cousrese the student will forget . however , if the student learned the idea or concept they can use the idea or the concept to solve the question or the problem even though they forgot the fact . the second reason is if the student only learn the fact , when the student have to do the new type of question and problem , they can not do it , because they had not experienced those question , but if the student leraned the idea and concept they can understand the meaning of the qustions , they may not answer the question completely but they can still process to thier answer . on the other hand , i think there is the subject or thing only need to study thier fact . for example some simple algebra mathmatics fomulas , i do not think the student need to learn the concept or the idea . i think the idea of the fomulas are to complicated , the idea only cofuse the student and make the student le interest on mathmatics , but the student really want be mathmatician or scientist , the teacher at the school should teach them individualy .
