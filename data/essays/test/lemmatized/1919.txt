i hope that the number of car that travel on our street will decrease in the future twenty year . it would be better for environment and health . despite this i do n't belive that something like that will happen . the real situation is quite didifferent . i 'm not optimist about that . there are a lot more car today than in the past year . that 's because in the richer country and continent ( such a u.s.a. , canada and europe ) lot of family own more than a car . even though we know that car need fuel , and that fuel is goin to cost more and more in the future because of the lack of new resource to produce it , we need car . public mean of transport are not reliable . till the public mean of transport are not reliable people wo n't prefer them to their car . apart from that there are a lot of country whose economy and finantial possibility are growing . also people that come from country such a china or india may want to buy car and they are going to become car mass producer and user in the next fifty year . they are country that are growing . an example of why car will increase in number is the fact that from few year the gp is rode also in china . it is a fututre market where to advertise the brand . it is hard to say what the economically speaking growing country will decide to do . they may spend teir money to crate street for lot of car or spend those money to create or improve the public transportation . if they decide for the second option maybe the number of car will decrease . but car brings with them a lot of place of work and money . it 's because of that that i think that the number of car wo n't decrease in the future .
