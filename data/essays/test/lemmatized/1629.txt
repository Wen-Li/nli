nowadays there are many topic which are controversial , one of these is if student must understand idea or learn fact . many people believe is better to have comprehesion abaout what you are studying . on the other hand a lot of people prefer learn fact , maybe they have argument to support their belief . i am inclined to believe that it is more important for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them learn fact by many reason . i feel very strongly that with this method you can learn about the subject , you are creating your own knowledge of the matter and probably you will never forget this idea you have studied , for example if you are studying business you will apply the idea you have learnt in the future if you are working for example in a bank . the greatest advantage of understanding idea is you will have to memorize le concept than if you are learning fact so you will work le , for example i am studying architecture , and many subject like math , or structure , or physic you have to resolve a lot of problem , and if you use this method , you only need to understand few idea to do thousand and thousand of problem . in my opinion this way to work is easier , more intelligent and also you will obtain better score in your exam . there are several reason to support that this is the correct way , if you understand the concept or idea you could apply this concept to another subject if someday you need it , for example in my architecture study if i understand a lot of formula and concept in math i can apply this in the structure lesson in order to calculate buldings structure . if you understand one idea you have the knowledge or the posibility to transmit this idea for example one person that study astronomy and understand the concept of gravity consequently he can explain you perfectly this phenomenon . in my opinion i think this is the correct way to work and the people who learn fact is because of they want to work le , and they are do not mind the subject they are studying .
