cars are an extraordinary invention which took place in the nineteenth century during the industrial revolution . it began in united states with ford and with the taylorism and then it came in europe . today we are at the beginning of the 21st century , in 2006 . cars exists in nearly every part of the world . they have changed , improved in several way , and have become the most convienient and favourite transport of many people . can we guess that in twenty year there will be fewer car than there are today ? one of the main argument of those who think that this can be possible , is an ecologic one . in fact , today we are more and more concerned about our planet , about our own survival , about being careful to the earth . thus , people and government particularly , are trying to vote law against pollution and are tying to make people aware of all the danger for the environment . unfortunately , in 2006 , here we are : everyday we here about more and more ecologic disaster : oil spread in the ocean for exemple . moreover some state such a the united states have refused to sign the protocol of kyoto . so can we really think that there can be fewer car in use ? maybe yes if other way of travelling , more convienient and le expensive , are developped in 2026 . nevertheless the obvious opinion is to think that in fact there wo n't be fewer car in twenty year and on the contrary , there will be more car . first , because economy play a too important part in the wold . fewer car mean fewer money . and this industry is very powerful today and it is in constant developpement . industry such a ford , renault or opel are selling everyday more and more car ; they create new design , new ability for these car and people feel that they really need them in their life : to go to their job , to go to holiday with their family and so on . .. moreover , twenty year is definitely a very short time for people , and government to change their habit by something new . all we can do is encouragins le polluing transport such a bike .
