i love to shopping with internet . it is cheaper and more convenient . however i sometimes get bad item from it . it make me really mad . not only me but also other peple who do internet or tv shopping will have same experience a me too . i believe that company have to advertise honestly . people buy thing on internet or television too . tvs and internets advertise product like they are perfect . however it is not . it is waste of money if people buy that thing , because if we want to return it to money we have to pay extra money to express sorry to them . it 's unfair . we wo n't have to be sorry because they did wrong thing . it hurt many people like poor people . they buy in the internet or tv because it is cheaper . however they delivered bad thing and then they have to return it with paying extra money . in my aunt 's case , she bought expensice mink coat on television . it wa 1,000,000 won in korea . it wa too expensive but the advertisor said it is perfect and they will give back our money if we do n't like it . my aunt belived it , then she purchsed it because she think it is easy to get back money if she doe n't like it . however the coat wa awful . aunt purchased gray , but they delivered white one . also the coat wa teared ! she called that company again , but they said it 's not their fault . they said tv program which sell the coat have fault . so she called that tv program again , but they said aunt is donig lie . my aunt ca n't return it to money back still now . she got really hurt . like this , advertising better have to be banned . it is obvious lie . it hurt people to and people spend their money to purchase bad thing . it is waste of money . therefor i disagree that advertisement make their advertise too much exaggerate . they must make their advertisement with hinesty .
