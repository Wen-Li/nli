i agree that certain advertisement make product look much better than they actually are . in my opinion the basic aspect of the advertisement is to show what the product really is in a reasonable manner but there are many ad exaggarating the product they represent . detergent advertisement on t.v. set good example for this case . in most of them the potential buyer see an extremely dirty shirt that is perfectly cleaned after a single wash with the product of the concern . there can be other claim in the ad a well , such a that it doe not wear the clothes out , cause pale colour or it clean any kind of dirt on the clothes . i personally feel suspicious upon seeing such an ad , a many other watcher do probably . another example lie in cosmetic commercial . a shampoo or a make-up ad includes much more than the effect of the product and this is always untold . the watcher can not estimate the contribution of the product in what they see on t.v or on a magazine . the lighting condition , shooting process and the preparement of the model in the ad add considerably much on the effect of the product . unless it represents itself reasonably or unless the claim are supported by a legal recorder who ha observed and confirmed them , it is quite difficult to fully believe what is told in an advertisement .
