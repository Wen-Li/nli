in my opinion , the statement `` successful people try new thing and take risk rather than only doing what they already know how to do well '' would n't be apt for all situation . because to try out new thing one need to be daring enough , successful or not doe n't count much . if trying out new thing wa reserved to people who were successful , then in the first place there would be not even a single person who would be eligible to call themselves successful . success come after trying new thing , and trying out new thing much rather depends on the person attitude rather than success , all these invention which are made till date are the result of a group of person trying out new thing over a period of time , it might not be a matter whether the people were successful earlier or not . there are many example to support the above said statement , one of them being our own thomas alwa edison , who invented the bulb , before discovering the bulb , he had numerous failure but all of those didnt stop him from trying out new thing and the result being we are not sitting in dark anymore . and moreover successful people dont necessarily try new thing and take risk a they have the fear of losing it all , but whereas a person who ha nothing to lose ha nothing to fear about , and hence he would be ready to take more risk and try out newer recipe , if it work then it would be penned down in the success tip or otherwise are lost with the wind . there are many successful people who are afraid to take risk , for example a famous batsman in a game of cricket never go for risky shot because if he is caught , it would tarnish his reputation and he would n't want that to happen . i would like to conclude based on the above point that to take risk one need not be successful , and most of the successful people avoid taking risk because they have a lot at stake if they fail .
