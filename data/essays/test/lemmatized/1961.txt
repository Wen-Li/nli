`` failure is the the stepping stone to success '' this is a very practical and a beautiful anecdote . many great scientist , industrials , politician and bussiness men , have proved this fact over and over again . new invention and creativity definetly brings success in one 's life over a period of time . innovative idea will definetly help a person to be more creative and it also help to build one 's personality . successful people definetly try new thing and take risk rather than doing the thing they are familiar with . such type of people have more creativity , tenacity , a tremendous positive attitude towards life , and they are very much sincere in their effort . great people like , abraham lincoln , thomas edison , albert einstein are the biggest example of success . abraham lincoln , ha been trying to become a president since he wa 21 year old and ha finally achieved at the age of 52 . this show the tenacity of the man . thomas edison did not have any formal schooling , he attended school only till the 2nd standard , later he wa educated by his mother . just imagine a person under going schooling , ha been able to achieve and invent new thing , to such an extant that his name in history stood out a an outstanding achievment . therefore all these example show u how successful people are . there main motto in life is : '' try and try till you succed '' . such great scientist generally leave no stone unturned in their way of invention or research . `` practice make a man perfect '' is very well demonstrated by such versatile achiever in life .
