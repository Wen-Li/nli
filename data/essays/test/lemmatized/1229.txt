the number of car on the road have been increasing at a rapid pace . the per caput income is increasing , car are being made affordable to consumer , there is a constant rise in population and man will soon find mean to solve the oil problem . keeping this in mind i totally disagree with the statement that there will be fewer car in use twenty year from now . with an increase in the per caput income and availability of cheaper car the number of buyer are increasing . now a person who could earlier not afford a car in driving one . there are various scemes in place which allow people to pay off in installment . this is a growing trend and shall lead to an increase in the number of car . the population is on the rise every minute . more people mean more consumer and that mean more car . one may say that oil will run out or beome too expensive but then man ha already made a car which can run on solar energy . with advancement in technology in the year to come man will certainly be able to create a car which can run efficiently on water or solar energy . this will slowly decrease the overall expense of running a car . a car is the most convenient way of travel . one can just enter his car and start his journey whenever he feel like and can travel to any place at his will . there are no limitation to certain timing and destination a in bus , train , ship or airplane . better public transport facility can make a difference but then the car move according to the will of the owner and whoever can afford a car will always like to have this convenience . it is possible that the rate at which the number of car in use are increasing today decrease but under no circumstance will there be fewer car in use twenty year from now .
