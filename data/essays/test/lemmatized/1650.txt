i do not agree with the statement that it is better to have a broad knowledge of many academic subject than to specialize in one subject . even though what is better for an individual differs according to his personality , life style and professional career choice they make after the university , i believe that having a broad knowledge of many subject without a concentration area leaf individual unskilled . in today 's world , it is important to know what you are doing at a specialized level , in addition to being open to learn about other subject . i believe that it is essential for an individual to have a broad outlook on the world in general and to be familiar with a range of academic subject . however , being open to broad range of subject should not impede the indivual from concentrating and specializing in the one subject that motivates and interest her the most . coming from a background of multi-disciplinary study of international affairs and international development , i realized at the end of my study is that i actually lack a specialization area . in the business world , even though i knew about a wide range of issue and could easily adapt my skill set to the requirement of the position , i always felt the burden of non-specialization . this is because in every area , there are people who are heavily specilized academically and professionally which make it extremely difficult to compete if one is not coming from a similar background . that is why actually i feel that i need to focus and do further study . jack of all trait and master of none may be relevant if you are a good talker , but when you have produce a concrete outcome , whether it is in science , business , or it , specialization in a specific subject allows one to go deeper in the subject matter . moreover , specialization lead to innovation in the field . having said that , i also do oppose individual who only specialize in one subject and have no interest in any other area . one should always have the skill to evaluate issue from different perspective . however , having broad general knowledge should not deter an individual from specialization . therefore , rather than an either/or , i think the optimum solution is to have broad knowledge on a range of issue and specialize on the subject that matter the most for that person .
