i agree to the qestion which is `` it is more important for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact '' . learn the fact is just memorizing something and they do n't get the cause of the fact . also it can be forget faster . however understand the idea learn the cause of the fact or problem . i know understand something is very hard thing to do . but that doe n't mean they do n't have to understand what they are learning . just learn the fact is easy and they can learn more faster however they will have a problem later . for example , one student is learning a math . if he just learn the fact which is math formula , he can finish faster and he just need to memorize the formula . but when he get different question that using same formula , he is going to confuse about the question that where to put the formula in it . however the student understand how it work , he can be ready for any question that using same formula . it also cause a problem when student are grown up . another example that the student learn that do n't throw garbage every where . later if he get face on this problem , he doe n't know why he ca n't throw the garbage everywhere because he did n't learn why . but one who learn and understand why in this problem , he will know that throwing garbage everywhere cause a polution . like the exampleabove , just learning is good for now but cause a problem late so student need to understand idea and concept .
