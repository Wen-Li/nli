i agree with the statement that in twenty year there will be fewer car in use then there are today . the first argument for the support of statement is very obvious . everybody is aware of the present oil crisis . due to the depletion of the major oil field the cost of oil is rising at an ever increasing rate . and there is no reason to believe why this trend should not continue . in a few year time access to petrol and diesel will be limited for only the elite . and presently , the technology for drivivg car is based on the petrol and diesel engine . so if there is no oil , there would be no car . after some time only the rich will have the priviledge of driving a car . cars would soon be object of museum . of course one may argue that by 20 year , technology would have advanced and there would be no need for car to run on oil . we would have car which run on solar power . yes , technology would have sure advanced a great deal by then . but if the tecnology will advance to an extent where we 'll have solar car , we can also argue that by then man would have produced solar plane which will be within reach of common man . and obviously solar plane will have many distinct advantage over car . first , it will be a lot faster annd safer . it will also solve the traffic congestion problem due to the availability of vast open sky . moreover it will aslo help to lessen the great problem of availaibility of space due to the population explotion . obviously , the vast amount of space used up for construction of road can be used for other purpose . therefore , if you believe that technology will not develop then also we will see fewer car on road , and if you believe that technology would advance , then also we will see fewer car on roards .
