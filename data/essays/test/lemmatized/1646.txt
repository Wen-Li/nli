there are several way to become successfull . some people are always doing new thing others only do what they know how to do well . in the text it is stated that successfull people try new thing and take risk rather than doing what they already know . in my oppinion that is wrong . i think that if someone is successfull he is doing something in which he is realy good . i want to point out several example for that . if someone want to become a successfull soccerplayer he need a lot of practice . only if he learns certain ability he is able to succeed in a compitition . it is not possible for him to try out several new way of life because if he would do so he lack time he need for his training . in all field of competition people need to have special quality which can only be gained by sticking to a certain goal . the second example is a great musician . a pianist need to start learning his instrument while being a child . furthermore he ha to keep on going with playing to become better . if he would quite in order to do something else he wouldn t be a good a if he ha kept on practacing . what i try to say is even if you know something very well you can become better . and to become successfull you have to be perfect in what you are doing . another reason why i disagree with the statement is that people who stay in theire fieled of competence get to know other people who can help each other . for example a if narrator talkes to another it might raise his creativity . the conclusion can be made that knowing how to do something perfect lead to success .
