one way of learning is to understand idea and concept that is to learn the basic idea and concept that are derived from the various fact . the other way of learning is to learn fact and it is learning the fact that make up the various idea and concept . among these way of learning , i believe that learning idea and concept should be learned with priority . first of all , understanding idea and concept make it easier to learn fact afterwards . ideas and concept are derived from the similarity between various fact . therefore , learning those basic idea and concept will be a lot helpful when learning new fact . for example , when i wa preparing for my science test , i wa trying to memorize all the chemical term a a whole and it wa really difficult . then , my sister saw me struggling with those term and she let me know the idea beyond those term and it became much easier for me to memorize . likewise , learning fundamental idea and concept would be helpful when learning fact . next , learning fact only doe not have any value . although we learn a lot of fact , those fact can not be utilized a fact . in turn , to be utilized and improved , understanding the idea and concept beyond the fact is much more important . new technique or new theory are based on the idea and concept not just the acuumulation of fact . for example , if newton could not find the concept beyound the falling of apple , it would be nothing . learning that apple fall is nothing , finding the concept of gravity from that fact is important and it 's the concept that is utilized afterwards . for the follwing reason , i believe understanding idea and concept is far more important than learning just fact . through learning idea and concept , it would be easier to learn fact . also , it is the idea and concept that matter not just hundred of fact . therefore i strongly agree with the statement that it is more important for student to understand idea and concept that it is for them to learn fact .
