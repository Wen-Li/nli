i totally agree with the statement that successful people try new thing and take risk rather than only doing what they already know how to do well . the reason for the truth of this statement lie in the definition of `` success '' itself . with `` success '' we mean that a person achieves thing that are over average . a successful person is recognized because this person ha managed thing the average person doe not easily achieve . therefore it is a logical consequence that people who try new thing and take risk are more likely to be the one that are over average , because the average of people stick to their well-known way of doing thing . trying new thing and taking risk very often is related to developing new idea a well . and if these idea are of a kind that fulfils the demand of people you can become very successful with it . look at bill gates for example . he is the pioneer of the internet and computer industry . certainly he is a clever person a well , but what is more important is the fact that he had new idea and found new way in order to promote his idea in a business environment . and now he is the richest man in the world ( i think ) . yet , it is true that some people are very good in something they are doing , although it is not a `` new '' thing and they do not take any risk . they might not be the most creative person , but they are still very good in what they are doing , their work is clearly over average . these people are successful person too . still the talented people that do not leave tradtitional path and never take a risk will not be a successful a the one that try new thing and take risk . because what somebody achieves by using new idea will arouse more attention and earn more recognition than traditional idea everybody can think of . looking at it from a business perspective new idea are certainly more successful , because nobody ha had these idea before . in addition human being are curious and want to try new thing they have not heard of before . in conclusion , for the reason stated above it is true that successful people try new thing and take risk rather than only doing what they already know how to do well .
