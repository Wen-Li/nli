i fully agree with the statement that most advertisement make the product they are supposed to sell much better than they are in reality . my opinion is not only based on some personal experience , but it also make sence if you try to understand the position of the one who are trying to sell their particular product . the first reason why i belief it is inevitable for any advertisement to make the product much better than they are is that you must consider that these product have to be sold not only in order to make money , but also to achieve the amount of money that you had to invest for the production of these good . this investment make it necessary to point out only the positive aspect of the product and not to mention anz of the negative or even bad aspect about them . the second reason why i belief this is that you must consider the amount of competitor a product ha on today 's market . since there is hardly any product on the market that can sell without similar or likewise product that are competing against each other in the same meketing segment , they therefore adress the same customer . this make it necessary for any producer to advertise his or her product , so that they can be distinguishable from the other product on the shelf . another arguement why i belief this is that it is obvious how much customer are depending on image and myth when it come to spending money on the best product . and since those image or reputation are unlikely to create themselves or at least need too much time if they are supposed to develope naturally , it must be the task of advertiser to create what people want to or are supposed to belief about the product their are buying . so in consequence i think that the need to sell the product in order to make profitable , the competition between the different producer that are selling similar good and the need to create image are the main reason why it can be argued that advertisement creates a better product than the one that is actually being sold .
