i do agree with the point that successful people try new thing and take risk rather than doing what they already know how to do well . the former success foster new idea in the brain and also give the push to intiate them . there are quite a number of reason for that . first , the common notion say `` the success of the person increase his risk taking ability '' . suppose a person is well established in a business . he ha to his credit the goodwill of many customer who can buy his new product or suggest his product to the required people . his current business qualilty assures the quality of his future product . this prof that he ha a better chance to succeed . higher the chance higher the risk taking ability . second , his prior success give him the confidence to move on furthur . the noraml tendency of human behaviour is to take up a task only if he is motivated to do it . success definetely give that motivation to implement new idea . he know the basic of managing thing which ha to be applied to a slightly different situation . third , diversification furthur help him in reducing the risk . a situation in which one business fall down , he ha the other to depend on . so there would be mutual support between the two firm . so in a way by exploring new avenue he is reducing his risk . the example of mr.dhirubhai ambani prof the discussion . he ha started just with an oil refinery and then extended his market to textile , communication and also domestic product . this could be a good example of how success allows a person to start new thing . so it could be concluded that the more you dig into diverse field the greater would be the overall success of a person . this form one of the basic of business rule .
