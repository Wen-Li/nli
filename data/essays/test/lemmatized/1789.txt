how the successful people to be success ? it is because they try new thing and take risk rather than only doing what already know how to do well . why i agree with that ? this essay will discussion my reason in more detail below . first of all , when we try new thing , it mean we have a new challenge . new thing are what we did not learn it or know it before , so we will have a wish and confidence to do it . for the new challenge , we would try to use different method to achieve it . during the process of trying different method , we learn somethings new and get improvement , and become success . for example , edison wa a population sciencist who wa the first one to made of electric light . no matter others say that wa impossible , he tried to achieve it many time and never give up . therefore he is succesful and make a light for everyone from now on . without his trying , we could use the light to do everything anytime . our society will not improve and new technology will not occur . moreover , people who try new thing and take risk are always success . let me show an example for me . mary is a top student in my class and she got extremely hihger mark in every exam . all my classmate did the review of the book only and which we supposed to know a well , but she got some more extra practises for the test . some of the question wa found outside from the school book , she would like to do them and ask to the teacher . because she tried many new thing , she got a higer result int he examination . in conclusion , if we try new thing and take risk , it is more easier to achieve successful . it is because we try to do new thing , it is a challenge for you to get experience and improvenment . solving all the new thing and risk , you will be a successful people .
