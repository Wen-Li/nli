i disagree with the opinion that there will be fewer car in use than there are today . there are three main reason to support my idea . first , our society and technology are glowing rapidly . even today , we are not able to live without car , so i have a huge question how come we will be able to live without car in the future even though our society is becomming better and better . second , for people who live in suburb , car are really important transportation . without a car , they can not be out of the town or they can not even go shopping to buy gloseries . so , car are vital tool for people who live in specific area . third , people are recently climing the danger of our nature , so car company are likely to produce new kind of car which do not produce much toxic gas . in the future , there must be invented new car which produce le gas or no gas ! i believe that our future car will be friendly against environment . in conclusion , car are most convenient and useful transportation for all of u . if some green-considered car will be invented , we do not need to give up using car . from these idea , i would like to disagree with the opinion that there will be fewer car in use than there are today .
