in this text i try to essay whether i can agree or disagree to the given statement . to evaluate this statement in a economical manner , it seems best to review history and form my opinion , based on exemplification , a far a this is possible without having any text-relevant information . with the beginning of the industrialisation a shift of occupation wa possible for the first time . before , people used to stay in their surrounded milieu and would follow to run , if available and possible , the family business . but with the establishing of the capitalistic market and the end of large scale substaintial economy , high risk business for everybody were possible in a larger amount . in fact it is true that high risk business are leading to more financial success than low risk business . this , we can find at modern stock exchange market for example . high risk stock are guaranteeing a larger profit . but before the introduction of the market economy people were also able to do risky business , therefore we have to be aware that it is easier to start high risk businees nowadays , but that it is nothing unique . the fact that the given statement is not only dealing with high risk in business , but also focusing on generality , this text must include more aspect for evaluation . risky action in daily life , can cause injury and a threat to health . on the other hand it can cause attention of your peer group or your beloved . but if you are not coping with the high risk action but also take some le risky situation in consideration it becomes obvious , that sometimes it is needed to risk something to gain a new experience . a child , for example , is learning by doing . the risk to fail is high but probably a high a to succeed ( based on the kind of attempt and goal ) . this failing and learning thing is probably maintained throughout your whole life and we would not increase in our knowledge if we only stick to our known . on the other hand it is also the case that taking everything into consideration it seems that the statement is having a lot of truth . i would not go a far a the idea presented in the statement , because it too strict and doe not allow any space for the idea of being successful by acting from experience .
