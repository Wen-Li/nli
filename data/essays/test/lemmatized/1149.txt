advertisements basically are used to promote a product among common people . now it is very difficult for a brand to compete with other brand selling the same product with little or no difference in the quality of product . so whatever subtle difference that a product ha need to be exaggerated to make it look different for the other brand . in doing so , many a time advertisement make a product look better than they really are . yes , i do believe that many advertisement showcase much more than a product can do or better than it actually is . many company rope in big celebrity or sport ' person for endorsing their brand . it is not rare to see an actor sipping a cola of local brand on tv , which in real life he would even touch . it is just a way to appeal to common man 's prejudice . it is done in the hope that the common man seeing his favorite movie-star will also buy the same cola . lets take another example . there in one commercial in which a group of childern are out on trekking and they encounter so called ban man . one of the group eats a chewing gum and turn into a superhero to fight the bad man . this obviously is just a trick to play with child 's imagination and lure them to but that product . there 's one advertisement of a car which is trying to emphasize on it excellent braking system . to demonstarte that they show the even while moving at 120 km/hr , the car can be stopped by applying break juss inch before the cliff . sure the car would be having a breaking system which is better than other car . but what the advertisement show doesnt happen in real world . if anyone wa to try doing that , he would surely meet with a fatal accident . then there 's an biscuit advertisement in which the child is about to start a race . his father come at that very moment and make him eat a biscuit , eating which the chils win the race . its right that the biscuit is a source of energy but portraying that the child won only because of that single biscuit is kind of ridiculous . thus it very much true that many advertisement make product seem much better than they actually are .
