when you are student , you are likely to be in dilemna which consists on choosing between having broad knowledge ( like what is done in the french business school for instance ) , or specializing in one specific subject ( which is the case for medecine study ) . for my part , i prefer to have a broad knowledge of many academic subject , even if this solution includes the following shortcoming : you are not an expert at the end . nethertheless , attending to different course ( finance and marketing for instance ) enables you to be more open minded , to understand all the complexity of one firm for instance ( for the case of a business school ) and simply , to have a more opened vision on the society , because you are able to understand more subject , and more phenomenon . by a personal point of view , it is a way to discover different way of thinking , to work with different people , who sterms from various academic background : you are not closed in an only way of thinking . and in the same kind of argument , meeting a lot of people , having a lot and various talking with them , you are more likely to do your own opinion about one matter for instance . for my part , when i wa in preparatory class , i shared my bedroom with a student who wa in college of science , and both we appreciated to discus to various subject ; what i wa not used to do with my classmate ( because , unconsciously , we had the same idea ) . then , studying many academic subject is a good solution to break the day-to-day running , and that is important for me . i can not imagine to do always the same thing , without upheald . to sum up , i am convinced that having a broad knowledge of many academic subject is a good method .
