children are recquired to learn a lot of fact at school . later , student still have to learn some fact but they must also understand idea and concept , and i believe this is the most important for them . the first aim of study is to make people ready for thier professinal life . students can not learn how to face every single situation , so they will have to adapt . as a consequence , they will have to use idea and concept and think of a personal solution to the problem they face . for example , i want to become an engineer : it would take more than an entire life to learn the characteristic of all the product we are going to work on . instead , we learn method on sample case and we will have to adapt these method and to find new one in our professionnal life . this is why , when recruiting , a firm doe not only chek what study you have made , but they will also chek your personality during an interview . studies also help people to build their social life . indeed , interacting with a teacher and with other student is very important . on the one hand , people understand idea and concept by interacting with others . on the other hand the best way to learn fact is to study alone , with a book . students do learn how to communicate . this will be very important for them , in their group of friend , in their family but in their company too . these three area of life interact one with another . for example , someone who doe not have any social life outside his firm will lack some simple knowledge about community life . the other way round , if someome is jobless , it will be harder for him to explain his child that they have to work to live . nowadays , being jobless is badly perceived in the society so people might find it hard to tell their friend too .
