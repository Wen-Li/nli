the issue at hand is , if the number of car will be fewer in the next twenty year . i strongly believe that the number of car , twenty year from now will be greatly reduced . there are numerous reason a to why the number of car should reduce . firstly , a the price of petrol & gasoline are shooting up day by day , it will become more difficult for a normal man to own a car . therefore , economic strength will become a major factor in determining the ownership of a car & hence the middle class of the society will leave their car . secondly , a many gorvenmental & non - govermental organization are trying to reduce the number of car to help safe guard the environment . they are promoting the use of more environmentally safe mode of transport & they will be successfull in doing this to some extent . also , other mode of transport , such a metro , train , plane etc. , are becoming cheaper . therefore , people will have better option to travel in , rather to travel in their own personal car . this argument is backed by the government move to reduce the fair in public transport to make it affordable & likeable by citizen of all kind . finally , it is a well known fact that the city are expanding at an exhillrating pace , in term of populatoin . this lead to the major problem of traffic congestion in city . traffic congestion are a major ` turn - off ' for many driver a they are simply a waste of time . i strongly feel that in twenty year from now , people will face horrible traffic condition , which will lead them to give up on their car . thus this example also explains why the number of car will reduce in the next twenty year . thus to conclude i would like to state that the number of car will undoubtedly drop down by large number due to the reason mentioned above .
