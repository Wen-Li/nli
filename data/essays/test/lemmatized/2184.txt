yes i agree with the statement that successful people always take risk and show interest in new thing . the word success itself make a positive note . so , a positive person will definitely dare to explore new thing . it doe have some reason to mention . abundant knowledge , confidence in the matter , desire to do something innovative , and experience make any successful person to try new thing . knowledge is an ocean . in this competetive and timeless world we are exposed to many thing . though we specialize in one thing , we definitely show the interest in many other thing . we learn only a drop of the knowledge . yes , at a particular instance in our academic life we are sticked to one field , which later turnsout to be our career . however , a successful person never feel enough with the knowledge he/she ha . they always have a desire for the knowledge . and that thirst make them to learn or try out new thing futher . for example , rajiv gandhi , former prime minister of india , who hail from political background , initially took pilot a a career . later with the inspiration from his mother indira , joined politics , which is a very new thing to try out . since he wa successful a a pilot , he never stopped with that . then joined politics , became prime minister of india and stood a a role model for many people . confidence make person more energetic and daring . success definitely make people feel more confident . confidence lead to success . einstien called a father of science , experimented many thing and wa successful too . obviously his success brought him confidence and thus made him to explore new thing . he wa dare enough to try new thing . confidence add energy to the people . it boost the person to think of many more thing other than which he already know or is aware of . experience is definitely a source for exploring new area . experience make u learn know our mistake in the past . moreover , it inspires the people to take risk . knowledge and experience are the two thing which no one can take away from u . success brings confidence , make people think innovative . experience and knowledge make people to take risk . t
