i agree that it is more important for student to understant idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact . understanding the idea is the goal of the studying because if you understand the idea you can invent a new idea , understanding the idea is the basic of any thing to be profissional . however , just learning fact is not enogh to be creative or profissonal . understanding the idea is the best way to study , whatever you want to study . by this way , you can learn anything . for example , when a student want to learn about a complex subject , he want to understand the subject first and he will have a lot of question , that is why understanding the idea is very important . if you pay attention in an acadamic class or in the school , the professor or the teacher always ask `` do you have a question , do you understand ? '' learning fact is also important but not a much a understanding idea , learning fact should come after you understand the idea , it also good for example . very rare subject that count on learnig fact more than understanding the idea . all of them is good way to learn , sometimes student should make his own way to staudy and always try to know what is the right and the wrong .
