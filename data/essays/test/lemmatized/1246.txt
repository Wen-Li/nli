where to travel in a group or travel by people themselves is a hot topic right now . some people think it will be very helpful to travel in a group with a tour while some others prefer to travel by themselves . when facing this question , i would prefer travel by myself for the sake of the fun and flexible schedule . i would like to give my reason and evidence a following . firstly , i have lived in us for a couple of year and my english is good , these allow me to travel to the english-speaking country a all the place that i want to travel to is somewhere like perth , hawaii , london where people all speak english . i do n't have to worry that i ca n't read the sign or do n't know how to get around . i can always take the local public transportation to the destination , and maybe talk with the local on the weather in the bus or subway . secondly , travel by myself will be much more interesting . i could just go wherever i want to at any time once i arrived that city , without worrying the schedule of the group , without carring the peer pressure from other group member . or i can just rent a car in the destination , drive to the place i want to go , stop by a bar and sit down chatting with local . if i travel with a group , then these will not most likely happen . thirdly , travel without a guide will enable me from beening forced to somewhere i do n't like to go . i am person who do n't like to go to somewhere full of people . i have learnt from my lesson of my trip to niagara falls , i paid a lot to travel with a group however i wa very upset with the whole trip . the place wa packed with people and the service of the hotel wa not good , too many people waiting in the restaurant to get seated , and the food of the restaurant that the tour guide brought u to wa not very tasty . moreover , my boyfriend is very good at planning trip and i would like to travel with him rather than with a boring tour guide , a i usually got a lot of fun and surprise when i travel with him . i went to disney land with him two year ago , he planned for the whole trip and it turned out fabulous . we not only enjoyed the disney world went to a city in disney called kissemme and watched the best show i have ever seen - the arabian nights . there wa a lovely pony which play the show together with an actor , what supprised me is the pony can remember how to play the show and even put the blanket when the man fell asleep on the stage . and also after dinner we even get the desert called `` princess wedding cake '' , what a adorable name ! of course , travel with a guide will help you from getting lost , and they will provide you a lot of infomation of the place . but according to my personal experience , i am would not prefer to travel in a group with a tour guide .
