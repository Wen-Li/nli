growing with the technology and the need of human , product are increasing day by day with tremendous rate . so in order to stand in the market the company start advertising their product in which they highlight their product special quality to attract the user . in my view it is acceptable to certai extent but not the whole . by the increasing number of product now a day company have to compete with their opponent so they give advertisement in order to attract more and more customer . in this they display their special quality of product so they try to put lot of thing which is the quality of the product and some quality which is not in their product so a to attract user . lets take an example of the early 18th century when the population is lesser a a reason need is lesser and the product are also lesser at that time but with the growing population need of human increase tremendously and to fullfill that need product are increased . when their is only one soap available people go for that soap only but now a day with different advertising they go for the soap which his role model like . now a day people are not looking about the quality of the material but look who support that product . so it totally a worthwhile . secondly a the medium technology is increasing day by day now a day most of the people have television at home and they always spend sometime time in that so people got through new product their and think that if the advertise is good they will prefer that product instead of concern about the quality of the product . by this advertising the cost of the product also increase in large term a the company have to spend alot of money in advertising . as for the television advertisement , newspaper advertisement , and on hoarding . now a day company make brand ambassodors of the product in order to bolster their product so they too spend alot of money in all of this . the person who is popular in the recent time , all the company approach to the person and offered brand ambassodership for their product and the famous person demand a good amount of money to do all this . so by all this thing i discussed above result in the increase on the product but the people are not concerned about that . but on the hand when we look at the positive of this advertising that if the advertisement is not their how the people came to know about the various product , whtats new in market , what to buy or not . in order to flourish company growth the company start giving advertisement to attract people , this seems to be a well groomed reason to give advertisement of the product and bolster their product in order to strenghten it position in market . this is truelly a bussissen task to flourish their bussissness . in the end yes i agree about the statement that most advertisement make product seems much better thatn they really are , inspite of some positive area to it . now the people have to become smart enough to go for the product or not to go with it .
