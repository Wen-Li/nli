i do not agree with the statement that it is better to have a broad knowledge than to specialize in one specific subject . on the one hand , it is really useful and reasonable to know something about everything . we live in a society and an environment that we can not neglect . thus , everyone should have an idea of what go on today , for example in politics or economics , but also what happened in the past , because that directly effect one 's personal life . furthermore , it depends on the particular person and his profession . if you are a politician for instance , you are supposed to have good knowledge about everything , just to be able to have an opinion and to be able to find the right decision for different problem with a good background knowledge . on the other hand , you can not say that it is better to have a broad than a specific knowledge . the reason for that are abvious : first , during your life you are confronted with different problem and you automatically build up knowledge about the subject that are associated with them . you have to specialize to be able to cope with these problem . second , to become professional in a particular job you have to focus on a subject . it doe not matter if you are familiar with history when you stand in a laboratory and want to find out how a cell function . third , i am of the opinion that people should concentrate on what they like and love to deal with . they should not find out thing just to know much about everything . you have to enjoy what you do . besides , if you specialize on one subject , you have the ability to improve and get to know more and more and that is what make life so interesting . as a conclusion i can say that people should have both broad knowledge and deeper knowledge in specific subject .
