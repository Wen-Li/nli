students and teacher are pole apart when they come to the issue that whether it is more important for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact or not . some argue that idea and concept are so abstract that it is hard to comprehend and thus are in favor of the opinion . others hold the opposite view by stating that every idea and concept is on the basis of fact so naturally they should take our more effort . as far a i am concerned , i take a neutrual position by the following reason . to start with there are countless case in which either idea and concept or fact are ddif to follow . i remember clearly the scene of mathematics lesson in my primary school . universally acknowledged concept and idea of mathematics are difficult to understand , especially for pupil a i wa back then . so the teacher adopted a special way to teach u , relating those concept to our daily routine . in other word he encouraged u to pay more attention to the fact of everyday life that we could easily catch . had we spend a lot of energy and time learning abstract and obscure concept , our effort would have gone in vain . analogouly when composer conceive of creating musical piece what often run into their mind is idea and concept expressed a feeling and emotion . music just flow a a stream of idea and thought . more often than not either idea or fact can act a a driving force to promote one another 's development . here is a good example to demonstrate it : the great newton ' gravatational law . its significant discovery directly leaded to a myriad of subsequent key idea and concept in the scientifc field which in return fulfilled what wa just emaginary picture into fact , like the invention of steamboat and the discovery of pluto . however the genesis of this profound law wa the sduty of an apple falling from a tree , a fact ! is not it self-explanatory ? according to the dimension mentioned above we can safely draw a conclusion that both idea , concept and fact are of great importance for student to learn and understand . by examining fact we may be inspired to come to novel idea and probing into idea and concept may lead u to creat more pleasant `` fact '' . they facilitate each other with no ending .
