have you ever found that how dangerous it is to travel by yourself because there may be a lot of people steal or rob everywhere ? have you ever found that you save a lot of time if you know where to go and where you can have a good time instead of searching for interesting place ? have you ever found you may have an eye on more fabulous thing and more knowledge when you are travell with people who know the place well so that he \ she can tell you about the history of the place and where most tourist prefer ? if you have n't , you will never realize what a nice trip you will get with the help and the guidence of a tour guide . first of all , i commit to the notion that travelling with a tour guide is quite safe . i usually spend my time on travelling , and wherever i go , i wa worried that there is some people want to rob me since i am a stranger . for the crime rate hase been increased day by day , it is definitely a fairly difficult problem to solve during the journey . however , when i take the trip with a guide , i get a chance to put my energy on the sight and the magnificent tour itself . why ? because the guide promise me safty . a good guide always concern about his costomer 's-yours-safty problem instead of yourself . the guide may tell you about how to avoid the potential danger and take you away from the area with high crime rate which you do not know before . another benefit will be the convenience . take zhu fan , a great frien of mine , for example . he got a chance to get to hang zhou for his summer vacation for about one week . the bad news is that he did n't know hang zhou very much , and he even did n't have an idea about where to visit . he spent three day in the hotel searching for a tourist site just because no one reminded him where the magnificent sight are . after zhu fan find a palce , three day had gone . what a pity ! if , back then , zhu fan had a guide with him , there is no way for him to waste any time on those dull thing . you should know , hang zhou is one of the most beautiful city in china , it is unimaginable that one can hardly find a place to enjoy the sight ! it 's all because lack of a guide . besides convenience and safty , a guide could also provide mroe fun . a tour guide must have known great amount fo thing about the site , including it 's history , it 's advantage and so on . so this enables you to know a lot about the place you go , and make you have more fun at the fabulous sight you are look at . for instance , a guide may tell you the story of a strange stone , but you will never even notice the stone without a guide . furthermore , a guide can tell you some interesting thing about your forerunners-the people he \ she guided before , which will perfectly make your trip meaningful .
