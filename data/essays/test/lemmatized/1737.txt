nowadays , there arises an controversial issue about whether to learn the ieads and concept , that is to say , the soul of the something , or the fact . different people with changing circumstance will difinitely bear different opinion a the two option both have their own advantageous aspect . insofar a i am concerned , i will chose to learning the ideads without hesitation for the following reason . the first element fact which push me into chosing the former option is that i can learn their way of thinking by understand the key to the definition of a book or a new thing which i am accepting because when i get the idea of the book , it is equal to , to some extent , talk with the author , namely , get the soul of the meaning . and in that way , i can improve my ideation and embodiment my personal ability . the second sensible reason is that i need not to charge more detail . instead of put the energy on finding the fact , i should concentrate on the idea which the author ha stated and try to thingking in a more logical way , in other word , reading a book is to find out my problem of thinking and find out the plot in a book . thinking logically will virtually bring benefit for me inasmuch a i am seeking the sequence in the reading passagge , it exerts a subtle influence on me in term of spritual aspect . and in that way , i can look at something in an objective perspective . even though the previous reason sound reasonable , there also appears some merit in the opposite side . it is a contestable fact that i will get some useful imformation when i am learning fact or detail . as a consequence , judging from the previous part i presented we can easily draw the conclusion that understanding idea will obviously outweigh than learning fact .
