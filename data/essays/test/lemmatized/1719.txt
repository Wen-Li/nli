yes , i agree with the statement . as it not easy to tour an unkown place without a proper knowlege of that respective place . so , a guide is quite essential in a tour . depending upon the place we tour we may face trouble lurking around the local people a we may face difficlty in understanding their respective language and we are not aware of the people 's own behaviour . they might lead u in wrong way for instance and we may even get in to trouble if they snatch off our belonging . so , it necessary to have an authorised guide for a tour and we could know much better information through the guide a he 'll be trained for the job and know 's everything in detail about the place we tour . we can make our tour much cheaper a possible through the giude a he suggest 's the better hotel or whatever necessary according to our budget . as this world is of different culture , religion and different kind of people we ca n't asure safety . we might even hurt the people sentiment which may be against their respective culture and it a waste of time bargaining over some expenditure issue . so , through a guide we can afford our need according to our budget . we should also be aware of the guide complete identification , so that we may not be duped by fake guide who are more lethal . so , we have to be aware of the guide identity and afford him . a guide is the only source who could make are tour succesful . the guide narrates the history behind the respective place and give u vital information regarding the place of tour . without out a guide we may miss some important information regarding our travel and landup somewhere in an unknown place . hence the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide inorder to have a safer and satisfactory tour .
