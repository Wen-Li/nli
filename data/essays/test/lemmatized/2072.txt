this statement raise the issue of the specialization from an academic angle . it seems to me that having wide knowledge of several academic subject must be the uppermost of my mind , to begin with , we must bear in mind that , nowadays there is constant globalization around the world . this phenomenon is responsible for new requirement from people . it is essential for student to be prepared for many different situation . indeed , scholar who have studied the evolution of the working market , predict that future generation of worker must be ready to change around ten time their work during their entire life : hence the necessity to dispose of several option in case your employer put an end to your current job . besides , i intend to work in management , and it stand to reason that good manager should be able to deal with all kind of situation , which will not possible for a specialized manager . my aunt used to do data reconfiguration in a big company . once , she had the opportunity to sign up for a 4-week-program to learn how to use a computer . back then , she believed that there would be no use in considering applying for the program . a few year later , the development of computer software made her look useless in the company , once she realized that , she quit . there can be no shadow of a doubt that it wa very difficult for her to find a job afterwards . moreover , when you keep studying several academic subject , you still have the possibility to focus on one of subject you are particularly interested in . to sum up , i would tend to think that having broad knowledge of several academic subject would be the best to succeed in the current context . however , far be it from me to insinuate that specialized worker would not find a decent job .
