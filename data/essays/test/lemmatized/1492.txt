i do n't think i will choose the way travel in a group led by a tour guide . i perfer to go out with my friend according to our own traveling plan . i have at least two reason to reject group tour . first , i do n't like to follow the tour company 's arrengment . since no company will run their business without the intension of making profit , the arrangement of tour company offten tends to be tight . thus , the customer ha to travel for one place to another without staying longer at certain beatiful scene and taking deep breath where the air is so fresh . if i travel with my freids , we can stop anywhere , like the sea side , just enjoy the sun shine and the breeze . by this way we can find the true meaning of traveling itself , to lose our pressure in daily work and routin life and gain refreshment . second , if we traveled in a group led by a tour guide , there must be a lot of chance to go shopping something we have no interest at all . because the guide will constantly recommed to the group what are really worth shopping in that area . and , when some customer were persuade to go , we have no other choice but to follow them . i think it 's waste of time to shopping those boring thing . all in all , i like to have my trip arranged by myself . of cours it 's also not bad to consult wth some friend . but i have to say that the perfect situation is that you happen to have good freids in the place you going to visit .
