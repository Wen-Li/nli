in my opinion , idea and concept do not exist on their own , but are based on fundamental fact that we all agree on . however , if one must choose between them , i believe that understanding ideaa and concept is more important than merely remember fact . first of all , merely learning fact rarely give you general idea or concept , but if you have a good understanding of idea and concept , then fact naturally follow in many case . for example , in an introductory economics class , if a professor just tell student that the `` goverment regulation of maximum price on certain good result in a shortage of and the subsequent illegal trading of those good , '' student may try to understand it intuitively , or more likely , just try to memorize it . however , if studenst are first taught to understand the concept of supply and demand , the specific fact naturally follows , together with numerous other piece of information . by drawing a simple graph of supply versus demand , student realize that fixing the maximum price of a good mean that more demand occurs than supply at a particular price , and therefore a shortage would naturally follow . understanding concept and idea is also generally more beneficial than learning fact , because fact , especially complicated one , are easily forgotten . however , properly understood idea and concept are rarely forgotten . actually , forgotten fact may even be reconstructed from those idea and concept . typical example arise in mathematics : many student forget exact equation after some time ha passed , but the idea used in deriving those equation are not so easilly forgotten-the idea that help u form logical thought and induction . by carefully learning those idea and concept by heart and examining them , some student may even be able to reconstruct those equation . in this regard , student will have a better chance of remembering what they have learned over the long term , if they concentrate more on learning how various theory and equation are formed . in summary , understanding idea and concept is preferred over learning fact , in two respect . it remove the necessity to memorize mere fact , because fact naturally follow from a good understanding . it is also an inarguably efficient and effective way of learning , because idea and concept remain with u longer than just fact .
