concerning the written statement i surely agree . i think that a person who ha success must have a new great idea . starting from these he must take care to have the following thing : first of all a good plan concerning that idea . he ha to choose the target and to calculate and prevent risk connected to the activity he will start . he must be determinated in order to reach the final point and his determination must be so great to affect other people around him . last but not least , he must know very well the detail of the field in which he will operate . i think that a successful person should have those three charateristics . and that is why i agree with the phrase . even if , a you can understand by the word above , in my opinion it 's a necessary but not sufficient , condition . however i think that a practic example is better clarify the idea written above . if a person wish to begin a new activity ( for example a commercial activity ) he must sutisfact my three rule in that way : the purpose is to create a new product to sell . in order to do that , the three point could be that : 1. he should find the better way to get the good he 's decided to sell ; 2. he should be able to tell people why the good are better and why people should buy his good : 3. ho should know very well the standars of field where he operates and the rule of a good commercial man .
