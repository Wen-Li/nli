the statment that only those people who try newer thing and take risk are suceesful in comparison to those who keep doing whatever they do best , is something that i personally belive in very strongly . infact i agree with it to the point that i intend to pursue my career oriented endeavour in somewhat the same way . the reason that my belief for this philosophy is so strong , is what i explain henceforth . first and foremost , it is only because of such people who take risk and try out new thing that we have achieved so much in the fireld of technology so far . nowadays , tachnology is the backbone of whatever we do . and , had it not been the risk taking ability of the great scientist of the yester - year , we would not have had so many discovery and invention that have led to a better present and a promising future for u . the one person that come to mind in this case is the very well-known but often not very well remembered scientist tesla , who is responsible for the alterating current that we use to drive and run practically everything around u - gadget , machine , etc . had it not been for his vision and his want to try new thing , we would have been stil trying to find out way to transfer the direct current over long distance and provide electricity to far off distance . infact , i believe this desire to take the risk is something that drive a person to face adversity and come out fighting through them stronger and more determined . secondly , such risk taking and ` trying out new thing ' ability help an individual to somewhat define his own destiny . he doesnot simply sit back and enjoy doind what he know best , but rather through hsi personified vigor , help a larger part of humanity in a known or unknown fashion . take the example of teh world 's richest man mr. bill gates . just imagine a world without microsoft and without window . frankly , it 's quite unimaginable . bill gate took the risk of dropping out of a comfortable college degree that would have ensured a good job , payed him good money and he would have thus lived `` happily ever after '' . he instead decided to try out something new and venture into the little known field of computer technology . the result is for all to see and admire . not only ha he made a fortune for himself , but his organisation employ million of prople across the globe and hence he in in an indirect way the wage earner for million of home all over the world . it wa his conviction and belief in his ability that resulted in the ` tech-savy ' world we live in today . finallu , although there are many example of such people who have drifted from the norm and come out victorious both for themselves and many other people a a result , the one thing that common to all of them is that they believed in themselves and backed their ability to achieving greater height . eventhough they knew what they were good in , they did not rest on their laurel . infact , they took risk and tried new thing that resulted in the betterment of humanity a a whole . on my part , i aspire to one day be recalled a a member of this league of wonderful people of vision and ambition . they have made the world a better plave for u to love in and have shown the way . try to succeed .
