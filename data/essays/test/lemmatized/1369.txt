advertisements are mend to make the product in the market popular among the society . most of the advertisement make product seem much better than they really are . i agree with the statement that the advertisement make product seem much better than they really are . advertiser are most concern about the money they get but not about the product quality . the purpose of advertising is to get the popularity to the product , so they just advertise all the product without looking at the brand and the quality of product . by using graphic and by some technics advertiser show the effect of the product . the product doe not work a it shown in the advertisement . they just make to look the product better . earlier , the advertisement are used to bring the best before the people a their will be a number of product in the market for a single requirement . the advertisement are given only by some brand product , but now a day every product is been advertised without looking at the quality . the company are more focusing on the advertising than on the product . advertising make the people attract towards the product . for example detergent , which are very useful home item . their will be a number of brand , but advertiser give all advertising without looking at the product wok . as the advertising show the product that are good and also bad but it the people job to go for the better one .
