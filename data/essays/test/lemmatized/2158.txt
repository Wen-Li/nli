`` flights of fancy , my sens reel '' ... ( pink floyd , `` learning to fly '' , the division bell , 1995 ) . in twenty year time - let 's see - would we really have to look at the amazing invention of diamler and benz a a `` specie going extinct '' with the throe of time , or would be see a revolution in man 's concept of the `` car '' ? ! we are heading into what many people would choose to call `` the space age '' ; numerous invention the very concept of which might have been considered ridiculous in the distant , or even the recent , past have been beholden to men over the recent past . at the same time , however , the earth is cry out a natural resource are declining . the typical car that run today us gasoline for fuel - this wa how car started . slowly , a time moved by , gasoline started turning scarce and became expensive , and a novel idea wa to run car on natural gas instead ! - it worked out extremely well - allowing people to have the option to actually switch over to natural gas a opposed to gasoline ( petrol / diesel ) - though it did not see the glamour of popularity because natural gas can be a dangerous explosive , and people do not like to drive when they know they are sitting on a potential bomb . also , both of these are but natural resource , worse that they are usually found together , and the fate of such car is solely dependent on their availability - they are formed by chemical process that take place over thousand of year , and consumed at a pace maddeningly faster ; so that sooner or later , they are going to `` run-out '' , and we are going to be left with a lot of car that are but mere relic of the past , devoid of life - like dinosaur , or the dodo for instance ! hence , it might seem that in twenty year there shall be fewer car than we see today . but . .. but . .. but . .. lo and behold ! necessity is but the mother of invention . it wa man 's idea to use gasoline for fuelling car ; it shall be man 's undaunted resolve to survive in a hostile world that shall lead him to circumvent the limitation nature imposes - for after all - nature is not just gasoline ! man ha been exploiting the ubiquitously available resource of sunlight - which it is to the point of omnipresence ! there have been built car that can store energy from sunlight in cell , and release this energy in the form of electrical energy for running them ! - completely cost-effective , and remarkably ingenious ! it is only a matter of time before these car become commercialy viable - a the current trend do impose , the cost of a technological innovation always go down with time - because the demand increase , allowing mass-scale production to become cheaper . such car of the future shall completely replace car of the past , and a the number of the regular gasoline-cars decline and they proceed to join antique collection , the number of these `` tech-savvy '' car shall go up ; even if the cost of production is large , such car are in the long term going to be an extremely profitable possession because they can be recharged a soon a the sun rise ! - virtually maintenance free . moreover , these car shall last till the end of time for u - that is , till the day the sun finally swell up into a red-giant and engulfs the earth , so worry about the future are going to be a thing of the past ! there have also been step to somehow utilize sea-water a fuel , and since we do not have to worry even remotely how abundant that is , there 's our sister option ! both the idea of using solar energy a well a sea-water are going to completely do away with bothering about `` running-out '' . hence , even though the number of gasoline-cars are no doubt going to decline over the next twenty year , the technologial star shine bright , and foretells that the number of car on the whole is going to increase - rather exponentially once mass-production begin , and the faith of the people in a new technology ha been secured .
