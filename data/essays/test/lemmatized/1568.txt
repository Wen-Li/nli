advertisements are everywhere . we are constantly surrounded by thousand and thousand of product advertisement , and many time we do n't even notice them . this is why most advertisement make product seem much better than they really are , so that you can notice and feel attracted to them . in the product market , there are many factor that would make your product popular , but the most important one is the advertising section . nowadays , there are many product of the same kind that are in constant competition to win take the market , and , a in every business , there 's many thing in play , like money for example . some enterpices , wo n't care about not being honest in their advertising campains and probably lie about their product . advertisements should make your product look great to people , and sometimes even some exaggeration are made to win the market . an oustanding product will have all of it quality in the top class rank . if you have a very high quality , innovative product , but you lack of good advertising , it would probably not sell . in the other hand , a product which ha a quality deficiency , but ha a good looking advertisement , may capture your attention . let me use an example . there is a very common alcoholic beverage that is known by everybody , called bacardi . bacardi is one of the lowest quality rom that are in the market of alcohol . in spite of this , bacardi 's bottle presentation and tv advertisement , make the product look nice , elegant , a top class beverage , even though , in my opinion , it not true . professional people is often hired so that they make an advertising campain , in order to raise the product status , but leaving the quality of it a it is . those people know all the market , what people like , how people think . .. and using some technique , they can make people be attracted to the product . nowadays , quality standard and regulation are being applied to many company , so that product that are currently in the market , would have all the same quality . i thing applying these regulation make all product better , and advertising campains will be made in a more honest way .
