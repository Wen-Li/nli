tourism mean visiting to different place where we can see so many different place and different culture which will be a joyful moment in our life . tourism had so many way of travelling . travelling by plane or travelling by train or travelling by bus or motor car give different kind of affection and different kind of idea to think and we can gain ample of information on tavelling which will be a cardinal point in our life . i strongly agree with the statement that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide because if we are travelling to a different place where we dont know any thing such a their culture and the language and the place which are not before seen and which are not familiar to u , so in this situation tour guide should required who know very well about the different place and different language and the culture and their living style a well . moreover travelling in a group give a diffrent kind of thrilling and joyful time while in a group we can enjoy alot we can express our view to each other and we can pas the time by chating with our firends or with our group member . but we have some advantage and disadvantage of tavelling in a group led by a tour guide . firstly we will discus about the advantage of travelling in group . - travelling in group give lot of happyness - no fear of theafs - it feel like we are travelling in a family - we can gather ample of unknown information from the guide - the guide will teach every thing individualy about the culture or language . similarly we have some disadvantage of travelling in a group with a tour gide , for example a newely wedded couple can not move in group beause they need privacy from others beacuse they will have their own view and affection towards each other . some disadvantage of travelling in group which are a fallow : - travelling in group with guid my loose you privacy - travelling in group you can not move to any other place by leaving your group - you can not go beyond your limit with the permission of the guid - time maintainance should be there - and for seeing every historical place certain time will be permitted to see you can not visit or see a much a you want . so at last i strongly agree with the statement that travelling in a group and that to with a guide will provide more knowledge and it bring more happy and joyful passtime wh
