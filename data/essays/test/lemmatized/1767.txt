altough there are some people woh beleive that learning fact is more important , i agree with the statement that it is more valuable for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact for the following reason . first , we can get a lot of information not only by reading book , but also checking web site through internet . on the other hand , when we try to understand idea and concept , we have to check the fact and then consider it very seriously , which mean everyone can learning fact and it is not valuable . i am now working for a trading company . my responsibility is trading gold with future price . i can check the fact , current gold price , with internet , but can not predict the future price easily . however , i learned the concept , how to predict such price , when i wa a graduate student . i can trade gold with the concept , which is making much profit for our company . therefore , understanding of the concept is more important than the fact , the current gold price . also , we can apply our understanding of idea and concept in a certain field to another field , even though fact are just fact . for example , my elder brother is a enginner who design laptop at sony , the largest manufacturing company in japan . when he wa a university student , he learned physic , math , computer enginnering , and electical enginnering . now he understands how to manufacture sony computer using idea and concept of these subject . if he were not a serious student , and just remember the fact , such a the answer in term test and some formula in math or physic , he could not be a sony engineer . therefore , learning fact is le important to learn concept . in conclusion , i strongly believe that it is more important to understand idea and concept .
