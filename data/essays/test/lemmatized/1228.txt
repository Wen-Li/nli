i agree with this statment that most advertisement make product seem much better than they really are . for example , many product start with good comortials in the tv , the radio and the internet . many people start to buy this product after they saw the comortials ; however , sometimes it 's not that good like what they were saying . some company have another way to sell more of their product . they start to put their product in nice cover and lovely box so , they can get the costmer attention . another company specially the food company start to said they have the most healther food than the the other company which is something importnant this day . many of time , i had been bought some product and the after a while i find that it 's not that good like they said before . i want to avoid this stuff but i can becuse i saw it every where in my tv or when i am walking in the street . in the other hand , i like to try new stuff that 's why i like to see what is the new thing in the market and try it , but i hate in when i am brouk becuse i bought alot of thing that i do n't need it in my life . most of my time when i am hopping i tried to do n't look at the new product , beucse i do n't want to buy any thing more . i feel that i have many thin in my aprtment that i do n't use it . i belive that not all of the advertisemnt product are that good , it 's just how it look like which take your attnetion when u are shopping . i think that this there startgeis about getting the coustmer attention by let him belive that there is something special in this product than the others . i am planning to study markting for my undergraduat school ; moreover , i would like to know how to sale product of mine and my company . i think the smart comanies who let u think that they have something speial in this producto more than the other which it could be hard sometimes . in summmry , i belive that the most advertisement make product seem much better than they really are .
