i agree with the opinion that most advertisement make product seem much better than they really are . some people say that some product must be abolished because they have bad influence on people . however , if the product have some weakness , i think it is not right . i have two reason why i think so . i 'd like to write about them in the following . first , i think some product have a huge influence on our life . for example , cellphone , internet . the cellphone make u easier to call friend , and make u easier to meet . it is very useful because people call each other whenever they want . moreover , it can take picture , also people can send picture by e-mail , so people can share their experience immedietly . the internet can communicate with people all over the world , and it is much faster to send e-mail , so people wo n't get sad unless they exchange their e-mail address . second , whether the product have problem , it can be solved easier . for example , the internet ha some bad advantage for people , especially t in conclusion , personally , i think there are many product that changed our life extremelly . it is sure that some people believe that the product change our life in a wrong way . however , it always make our life more easier than before , and if we lost these product like internet or cellphone , i do n't think we can go through this modern society . therefore , some people should believe that how these product are important to our society .
