people are watching many kind of advertisemets from tvs , internet , or magazine . advertisements show their product which are cellphone , tvs , for example . i agree that the most advertisemets make product seem much better than they really are and they should change thier trick , in my opinion . while i wa shopping in internet , i found the jacket which would fit on to me . i finally bought the jacket from internet , but i disappointed to the product and promised myself that i will never shopping in internet . the product in front of my eye and picture wa completely different . color wa darker , and picture did not even show to me the specific part . advertisements are making their product better looking to people and the most people believe it picture . another example , the laptop from the advertisement looked the best laptop till now . the laptop from the circuit city , however , looked similar to other laptop and made people to lose faith the brand which advertised . in my opinion , every brand is advertising it produts because brand want to be popular and famous . some brand are doing with jealous , and some are trying to trick to people to buy product with little fake . as everyone realizes , most brand want to sell their stuff and be popular among people . people , however , will disappointed and not find brand anymore if they trick to them which mean make product seem much better than they really are by advertisement . on the other hand , if they show the truth and improve their product , people will slowly find them , and they will be able to be popular , even if what brand are . in summation , most advertisement should not make product seem much better than they really are , they will have to make product seem the same what they really are when people come to shopping to your brand !
