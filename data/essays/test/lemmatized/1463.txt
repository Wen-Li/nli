i think that most advertisement make product seem much better than they really are . that is kind of lie . most people belive the what advertisement say . however some seller make a faulse impression of thier product . i will explain the 2 episode about that . first , people belive what they see . television is very good example of this case . when we watching the television we can see easly commocial advertisement for selling product . it is wrap up differnt imformation unlike product . customer belive that the imformation and than they buying that . they can recognize later when they sill see and use product . for example , when i saw the some commocial , i bought computer 2 year ago , the seller introduce to me this computer batter than common computer . it is fresh and made of new technology . but it is not . he and advertisement lie to me . second , paper advertisement is good to lie for customer . our world have a lot of product and make new product . advertising is a way to sell to product . company have to sell more and more because of they want to survive that world . faulse advertisement kind of their way to make it more profit . many company cheat to customer . beside they earn the money to useing the bad way . i hope so that faulse advertisement is get away from our world .
