in my opinion , it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subject . i think it essential to understand and evolve in our current society . actually , it appears to me that it could help them to feel better with themselves and the others . firtstly , the best school all over the world provide knowledge of many different academic subject to their student . it show that it is the best way to find a good job . secondly , study are more interesting . by doing always the same thing , you get bored very quickly . and by the way , you could discover news passion and unexpected skill . for instance , i realize how important it wa for me to write by learning literature . if i had only study mathematics , i would never be able to express myself and to write such good novel . moreover , people consider that it could be hard a jod without a specialization in one specific area . but , i totally desagree with them . i do believe that the best way to learn and to understand all the topic of a subject is to be able to have a broader view . you can learn the detail by the practice of the subject . furthermore , a large knowledge help people to be more open minded . for example , you understand the different behavior when you know the different religion and belief . if everybody had a larger knowledge , they would no longer make war . finally , people have to learn the more they could . up to me , they have to be curious and intereste on everything they could met in their life . because if they did not , they would be afraid for the rest of their life . it is well-known that people are scare of the unknown thing .
