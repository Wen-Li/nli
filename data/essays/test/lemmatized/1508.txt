everybody ha different preference on whether traveling in a group escorted by a tour guide or traveling by themselves . however , i disagree with the opinion that traveling in a group is the best way to travel . i have two specific reason to support my position . by traveling by myself instead of being led by a tour guide , it 'll be much more convenient to move back and forth and and i do n't have to waste my time for other people . firstly , when i travel by myself instead of being participated in a tour group , it 'll be much more casual and convenient to move somewhere because i can creat my own travel schedule so i can go wherever and whenever i want to go . secondly , by traveling by myself , i do n't have to wait for the other people 's coming so i can save my time and also i can get plenty of extra time . thus , i can use my extra time for making my future plan and thinking of my life etc . although people have different opinion on this given issue , i would prefer to travel by myself instead of traveling in a group by a tour guide . this is because it will be more convenient and i do n't have to waste my time . these are the reason i disagree with the given statement .
