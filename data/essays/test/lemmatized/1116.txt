about the question whether to prefer broad-based education over specialisation in a specific subject , i firstly want to mention that it is not a question of strictly deciding for one of the two option . actually , it is rather a question on how much one should tend to one option . and i also think that the answer of question can not be refered to a a general solution for every person , because each person is different and ha other attribute making it better for him or her to obtain a broad education or to concentrate on a single subject . my personal point of view is that i rather prefer achieving a wide-spreaded education in many different subject and aspect of these subject . this is because i am convinced that this method is most effective . once one ha reached a certain level of knowledge in many educational direction , it is much easier to learn new thing . for example , if you want to learn a language , it is much easier if one already know thing about the related cultural and historical background . learning english for example , becomes much more convinient if one know , that it emerged from french and german and originally from latin , presumed that one speaks one of those language . the second reason for me , personally , ha to do with the attitude towards learning . i believe that learning doe not only target on the gathering of information for the sake of their functional recall in adequate situation , but that it is also an considerably important instrument for forming once character and the personal evolvement . this mean , that if zou educate yourself in various area , your personal gain from this knowledge is then also increasing with to the same extent . related to my introductional statement , it is also important to have at least one specific subject , which you are especially interested in . in my opinion , a broad education can be imagined a the personal base on which one can build and accumulate great knowledge of a certain subject . i think that this knowledge about one certain subject is ultimately necessary for one 's personality , because one can identify with it and have a subject , that is really belonging to oneself , on which one really know more than most other people . another reason speaking for the emerging of outstanding knowledge in at least one specific subject is in mz opinion a simple a the expectation one is confronted by society . a person can do so much more for society , if it ha a so-called profession , a word which fit the meaning of this described specific subject very well . without a profession , a person can probably do many thing quite well but nothing very well , so that there are scarcely any other people , that would be better in doing it . all in all , i think that on one hand one should always be ready to learn new thing and always willing to continue one personal development , which includes a broad education . but on the other hand it is definetely also important to find one specific subject suitable for becoming professional in it . the balance between both of them ha to be determined by every individual by itself .
