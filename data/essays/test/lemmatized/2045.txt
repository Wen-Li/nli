some people think that nowadays young people do not give enough time to helping their community . people helping their community are really important for the social system we live in considering our western society . there are lot of task in community that are expensive if an expert is engaged . so , community very often can not afford to hire skilled worker for every small task . as a consequence , they need volunteer who do the job . on the one hand , these job are not always pleasent one , like caring for elderly people who are very ill . thus , there is no surplus in volunteer for such job . people sometimes do not see the necessarity that living in a social community they have to take part actively and care for the community . this might be because it is not always clearly communicated . so , some people do not understand that they have to participate in the social system not a maverick and egoist , but instead a a caring and understanding person . and it would not be satisfactory to force someone who is unwilling , to do a social job . the result could be disastrous . furthermore , some people think they just do not have enough time for social work . but this is only depending on their way to distribute their time , especially it is a matter of priority . on the other hand , there are people who are very engaged in their community because they think it make sense to them . otherwise our social system would fail . these people help to support minority , for example by caring for disabled people . doing such job for free or at least for only little money , volunteer support their community not only in a financial , but also in an ideological way . nevertheless , these people are rare and these people are always the same one . finally , it is important to publish the job in a community and to say how important these job are . it is necessary not to wait until any volunteer come , but instead to actively find such person . people being already engaged in their community , could tell about their work and about how good they feel doing it , consequently helping the community to find more participant for social work .
