it is a common proverb in my llanguage the one that say `` who never try , will never make make it '' . i try constantly and in a every-day basis to be a attached a i can to this prase . doing new thing imply taking risk ; perhaps , in difficult situation . success , certainly , is not something that may come toward the person leaving him/her with the only misconception that all it take is going on the same old path , the one that everyone else transited . the person who want to succed need to take risk , i believe . the first point i would like to meet is that by doing thing that you already know , pasing through the same path may take you to a situation where you would find yourself trapped in a rutinary , therefore boring situation that could ended up turning the individual into a inneficient part of the job environment . also , by trying to reach success based on what the person know how to do `` superb '' , will not let her/him try new thing in which she/he could presented great skill and / or enjoyment . in other word , if you are used to work homogeniously throughout your whole life , you can be missing other practice . for example , if you are really good at soccer but you are afraid that you will not do that well at basketball , and you later decide to give ypourself a chance the result could be even more suprising that youy expected . perhaps , you are a good taht you are asked to joy the school team since yo didi so well basing your game in those ability that make so good at soccer . in addition , trying new thing may supply the individual with more innovative idea and more vast experience to reach the success he or she is looking for . this mean that by experiencing different environment and getting involved in , for example , different field , different culture or different stratus the perosn would obtain a am result geeting to know himself in a different a wider way . for what it wa stated before is understandable why i agreed with the notion of triyng new and innovative thing in order to reach success . having been studying in canda and been far away my home provides you with the idea of what i 'm looking for . nothing but success !!!!
