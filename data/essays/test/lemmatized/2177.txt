i definitely agree the statement . for almost all the people , it is not true that use the spesific thing that they leran in highschool or university is effective to their life , work , and usual matter . maybe spesific thing are very important for the people who major in spetiallity learning , exanple medicine , scientist , professer , and that kind of special job . they certainly need supecial education , so the have to know many fact . but if we work a salaryman , we do not need to know about sciense , history and anoter special fact . but the fact is important too , because , that is indeed occur in my own country and the another country in the world and give u and tell u some important thing and give u a commonn topic of interest or conversation , and then we can make good relationship . but , to preper of think about some fascinating or amasing idea , we need a flexibility to every kind of thing . we learn through the total education , how to make thing better , how to make good idea , how to act when we are in difficult situation . from that kind of training , we can learn how to manage the difficult situation or how to produse newly developed idea . and only such thing that we obtain from our experiense help u to act in the real life . fact is else important , but if we learn only fact , it is no way to make a significant progress . we have to go above the fact to make thing more better , to make a good progress . in conclusion , it is not most important to learn fact but make the fact to the another situation , so that we can complete that matter . we need the base of the idea and concept . to know concept mean we can manage the another situation like what we had learned .
