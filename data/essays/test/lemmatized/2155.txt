nowadays , in our society , some advertisement make product seem much better than they really are . generally it depends on what the product is . some product can be made to improve our way of life , like new technology . as a matter of fact , some product are not absolutely needed . for instance , the new apple technology called ` iphone ' is a new type of phone we have never been using before . it proposes new function and this phone is the first of his kind . thus , the iphone would be able to give u new `` thrill '' . in that case , the person who will receive the iphone will not be disappointed by the quality of the product because obviously , it would be the first time he see something like this . overall , the advertisement will not be an over `` quality maker '' thus , in that case , it will not make the iphone seem better than it really is . however , some advertisement can confuse u . actually if we take the example of school 's stuff , it is not always a nice a we thought . sometimes the advertisement say `` umbreakable ruler '' whereas it is false . for example when the child are told that the ruler is umbreakable , they will obviously want to make sure it is true , and oviously , they will break it . this kind of product do n't make our life level better . as a conclusion we can say that advertisement generally make product seem much better than they are when the product is useless . furthermore , a it doe n't raise up our way of life , or doe not give new `` thrill '' , we always get to the deduction that the advertisement made the product seem better than it reaaly is ! however , new technology wich ha just been discovered will always get our satisfaction a it is something new .
