knowledge is power and it 's playing an effective role among the world . without knowledge you can not think , learn and creat . in my opinion it 's better to have broad knowledge of many subject which make you more open minded and well done . some people prefer to specialize in one subject and some do n't like it dependes on the field . some field need to specialize and some no need . the person who ha broad knowledge and more experirnces , he is most wanted and accepted . for example , the general manager who ha mpa degree he know everythings about the business and administration he can control his the organaization unless it ha many section such a marketing , managing qaulity , advertising and others . so the wide knowledge make the person to be more creative and good decsion maker in his personal and work life . broad knowledge is giving you more background and idea about your work and your life . other thing we have to invest our knowledge in developing and improving our country and socity to be the best among the world . knowledge is great thing we can consider it a the langague of the world and the progress of any country .
