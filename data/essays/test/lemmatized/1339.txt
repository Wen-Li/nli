the memory can be a strong and usefull instrument if you use it correctly , although if a student only memorize fact his knwoledgement would never be a strong , a if it would be if he understood the main idea of what he is learning . i one hundred per cent agree with the statement that not only a student , but every person that want to learn something , should understand the idea and concept that he is being thought , because when you learn and actually get to know the main idea of what you are learning it doe not matter if the caractheristics around it change , you would be able to understand the idea or the concept . an example probably would help u to understand this : if you learn the main idea of what a table is , it would not be a problem if a different colored , or shaped table is presented to you , you always would be able to recognize what a table is . on these day , we are attacked for lot of information , that in most case we want to keep them in mind , but while we are just receiveng information and not going beyond it , we are not having a strong knowledment , instead we are only recieving fact . this sometimes could be usefull to fake that we know about anything that we are asked about , but this can be dangerous , because if a conversation of a particular toppic beggins , and it go a little profound , our lack of knowledge , would appear . considering this statement , i prefer to know le , but in a complete way , than just know a bunch of unsusfull fact .
