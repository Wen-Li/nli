i strongly agree that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide . some people may disagree this opinion but i regard this way to travel in a group led by a tour guide is more realistic and sensible than the others to travel alone . for example , when you plan to travel , you will search the new place where you have never been . you may gather the information about that place by the internet or by the book without the realistic experance . when i wa young , i would like to travel alone . i found i could not really know the place that i visited because the information is second hand . in this case , i buttress the idea of the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide . some of the people grewth le engage a the year passed and they need a professional tour guide to tackle the problem of the jounary . when i travel , i want to huddle up to my friend and talk about anything we interested . we can help each other and do not fear alone to tackle any problem or incident . in my case , i have been in the other country to visit my friend . when i wa there , i wanted to travel by meself but my friend did not agree my opinion . so did his family . we started a travel with a tour guide in a group . it wa a fun and immense jounary and we had a lot of fun . nonetheless , the incident came , i got a ailment . it 's a local sick . when i wa so bad that could not work and enjoyed the ambulatory of the lake , my friend found a medicine to cure me . i appriciated him and his family . when i leaved , i want to thanks for their assistance but they tought me one thing . however , the best way to travel is in a group
