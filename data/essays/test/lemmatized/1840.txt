i do agree with the statement that `` successful people try new thing and take risk rather than only doing what they already know how to do well . '' i do agree because i know some people that are great in their job , but they are not satisfied with the thing they have because they know that they are able to have or get more and they take risk in order to success in other area . it would be very easy to those person to keep doing what they know they do well , but they want more , they are not completely satisfied , so they decide to take risk . i think it is very important to take risk in order to success . the best example i can give is myself . i am a lawyer , i have been working in a great law firm since 11 year . i think i am a good lawyer , so i could maintain the thing exactly the way they are , but no , i want to be a better lawyer , i want to succeed so i need to take risk . that is why i have been working very hard in order to save the enough money so i can pay an ll . m in the united states . i want to study an ll . m because is a great opportunity to increase my legal knowledge , also i will be able to meet people of different country and , it is the better way to practice my english . studying a master represents a risk , because i will leave back my family , my home , my friend and , of course , my job . but i am concius that i need to take this risk if i want to succeed . of course it will not be an easy task , sincerely , i am a little affraid , but also i am sure that it will be the best experience of my entire life . it is one of my greatest dream and i have been working very hard in order to make it possible . some day a good friend of mine told me that the harder one work , the luckier one get , so i am working very hard each day in order to make my dream possible . that is why i do agree that is important to take risk if someone want to be successful .
