do you have tv in your house ? do you have heared about very sweet speaking while you wath tv ? nowadays , we can see many advertisement while we wathing tv . it is really many type of advertisement . for example food , diet madicine , move , drama and furniture . i think advertisement should involve their own function . but now , many tyes of advertisement , not . have you ever heared about diet medicine ? first of all , the most serious advertisement that seem much better than they really are is diet medicine . there are really really good example about this topic . while we watch home-shopping channel , we can see advertisement of diet medicine very easily . people who advertise person say `` it is pretty good medicine for lost your weight ! it 's very practice thing ! if you have worrying about your fat , this medicine will be solute your problem clearly ! '' it heared like really sweet . but real is not . even if you take that , your weight will not decrease that you want . for example this is my uncle 's experience . my uncle is really obese person . so , my uncle decided to lost his weight . and he bought diet medicine that seem like have really good function about lost one person 's fat . but it 's not . he lost his weight only 1kg . second , well . .. i really love to eat something . so my nick-name is `` cleaner '' because i eat every food that in front of my mouth . while i watch tv , there are very various food advertisement . and they attract me . they attract me like that is really delicious thing . but after i saw , i buy that and eat it , oh my god ! what is this ? i really hate that !! maybe you can agree with me . well , it 's okay . but , it is absolutely different with advertisement . that is decoration . in the tv , it seems really delicious and very good . but it 's not . i counld not think this food is same with advertisement . like this , there are many advertisement . yes . . i know that some advertisement is same with that they really are . but mostly , they are lier . so , i exactly agree about that topic .
