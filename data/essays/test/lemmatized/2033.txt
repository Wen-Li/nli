i do not agree with the statement becuase there is no specific formula for success in everything what ever one like to do . a person successful on a particular thing need not be successful in all the thing that he doe . i know a person who is a good teacher , he started an academic institution , because he is a teacher he know the need of the student and plan the course accordingly , his training class and material were very successful , he could attract somany student to his institute . he earned lot of money and reputation . after a while realestate business started picking up in his city , he started venturing his hand into it , a he is not experiencd in that business , he failed miserably . may the proverb a bird in hand is better than two inthe bush is more opt for him . a successful news paper owner known to me in my state entered into banking sector . loking at the success of his news paper peole started invesing into his bank , after seeing the success again here , he diverted the fund to movie making where he ha failed miserably , people who invested in his bank are trouble a he is not in a position to pay the money back . good planning and good domain knowledge can only make the people succcessful but not evry boy who try at new venture without doing a good risk analisis . a teacher should not be made a soldier there by we may be getting a bad soldier and losing a good teacher . so i strongly feel people should continue in the field where they are really expert , and should not keep moving to everything that come on their way and start experimentng .
