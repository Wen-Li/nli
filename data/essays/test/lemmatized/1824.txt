maybe most of people on this planet will agree with this statemant . because nowadays thare are too many environmental probrems in the world . many different country have many different problem . but each country ha each problem . so i do not think that if in twenty year there will be fewer car in use than there are today , it is so important thing . if in a country , there are not so many car in use , in this case maybe this country is worried about other kind of problem . for example , water polution . because of the water polution , in this country , maybe people can not get safety food a much a they want . but people have to live . therefore they might eat food which are not sure these are safe or not . and also adult give child such food . for child , such food are very dangerous . if they are onle little boy or girl , they may die because of the emvironment . in this case i do not think the number of car is important thing . besides , lately , people care about the number of car . therefore we people already did make some kind of solution for this problem . and this solution is not so difficult to solve . now , what we have to care about is relationship between country . our planet is getting smaller , the tie of country have to be cared more than the use of car . we have so many smart people who could solve polution problem or car use . therefore basically i agree with the statement . it is already started and not a big deal . i think if it will be inconvenient situation , some idea will be comming up . i believe in that we have more thing to care and we should . otherwise in twenty year , we will get a huge serious problem .
