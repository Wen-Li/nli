there are many different way of studying and understanding the topic in school . for some people it is easier to understand a topic when a teacher explains it and us good diagram or other thing to support his or her statement . other people find it easier to purely learn fact and present them the way they memorized them . teachers will always tell you that the second way is not good and wo n't help the student in a test . the question is , is the first way really better than the other ? in school teacher mostly try to present the topic so that the student understand it . to fulfill this task they use diagram and transparency or prepare interesting experiment . you can say that this kind of teaching is the best way of teaching . on the other side there are teacher who just give you the text book and make you write down everything on your own . to not get in trouble most student might memorize the whole text , which is a lot of work . at the time being this seems to be a good idea because at the very moment you have the information in your head . after a while though you get more and more task and your head will be filled with much more thing and after some time you will have already forgotten everything . this could be very bad , because you might think you still know it since you already had to memoriye it once , but if you do n't understand a topic it will leave your brain if you do n't review it again and again . the thing you try to understand are easier to be memorized , because there will be a connection between you and the topic . it is also important to understand the whole idea for test or exam . mostly test do n't ask you to only quote word for word what you have memoriyed . teachers want to see that you understood the topic and so they put question in a test that ask you to maybe draw conclusion or use your own example . sometimes you also have to explein how it lead to a problem and if you did n't understand the topic you might not know how to handle this question . all these thing actually show that purely memoriying fact is not a good way to study , but sometimes learning fact can actually help . when i study for a test i do n't always understand everything we 've covered in school and this is the point where i purely memorize the sentence given by the teacher . when i 'm done with that i start reviewing what i 've memorzed and at this point in time i finally understand what they teacher wa talking about in class . just to be clear , this method doe n't always work for sure . to get a better understanding of a topic you should try to purchase different book that discus the same problem . if you get different opinion on a topic it will be easier to understand . all in all it is alwys more important to understand the problem in front of you . the teacher is there to help you with that . she give you her \ his own opinion and she will explain everything to you in detail so that you understand it . and if the teacher should refuse to help you , you can help yourself by looking into the differnt book or you can ask classmate . when you understand everything it will be easier to write a test on the topic , beacsue even if you do n't include one fact , the teacher will still see that you understood the topic , which make her task fulfilled .
