i am strongly with the argument that assumpts most advertisement make product seem much better than they reallly are . this is a strategy which i can not accept morally . advertisements are the tool for a product to be known better by public . it ha to point out the advantage of the product compared to the others in market . so the consumer would make a proper decision on what he need while comparing the item . also , to create a repetition and a popular name is not bad at all . nevertheless , advertisement go a little too far nowadays . developing into a big sector , the disadvantage of mass advertising can be uncontrolable . the competition push the company to glamourize their brand . to replace them with some basic need . to hold their position in the market , they spend a dramatic amount of money for advertisement . the sector is one of the fastest growing in all the world . in the future , i assume that more adverisement company will be active than their costumer company . these company take advantage of all kind of art , idea and philosophy which is a misuse to my opinion . they have bartered all these for money and market power . this have resulted with not only a cultural degeneration , but also idolizing a brand to despise the consumer . and this is just because of the starting idea of making a product seem much more better than it really is . and this too is a dishonest and non - ethical action . in conclusion , i think the advertisement should be controlled by authority . one of the most important priority of the government should be protecting it people . then they have to take the responsibility in advance .
