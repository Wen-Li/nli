i disagree with this view . on the other hand of developed country which are trying to protect nature , developing country are trying hard to catch up with developed country . to begin with , developing country are developing land , such a forest and farm , to be attractive . so they build mall that have many place to play , such a shopping center , super market , cafe , and so on . and usually , those place are made far from place people live . that mean , people should achieve at least one car per family in order to play around thier country . for example , when i visited honkong , it wa not too much to say that i could see more car than people . according to an woman living in honkong , people living there should have a car a they must go far place by business , a they should go around whole country a day . secondly , developed country succeeded to make car that use le or none gasoline , which move by solar system or wind or other kind of energieswhich use le source than the usual car used these day . and also , government are encouraging people to use them . though the price of those car are high , people started to be interested in them . so if the price got cheaper by having more technical people in the future , people who did not want to drive car in the respect of protecting nature will try to afford car . to sum up , in the future there will be more people using car .
