in most case , essay start with stating that the answer for a discussion is not unique . this is due to the fact that the life is not so simple in most case and any question may have more than a single answer in most case . this is true even for a simple yes or no question like : do you agree that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their community ? the critical word in the question are : 1. young people 2. nowadays 3. enough time 4. help 5. community so , i would like to review these critical concept first , in order to comment on the reason of the final answer . how will we define the young people ? it will not help a lot if we define only by the corresponding age category . it is necessary to consider the social status and occupation . a student , an early starter for the professional life and an unemployed young person will not feel the same even if they are at exactly the same age . how will we define nowadays ? is it this year ? the last decade ? or more ? what is the measure of enough time ? if one ha nothing to do , spending a week for helping the commuinity may be very normal for him . but a 10 minute spent by a hard worker of 60 hour per week can be more valuable . what is help ? is it just giving some money or going and working for some activity ? and finally , how will we define the community ? is it correct to ask young people to accept the general value of the society and existing community without questioning ? i believe that the comment made above already have the answer in . i can not agree with this statement . most of the young people i know are trying to find way to understand and express themselves . some of them are more lucky . they have good relation with some people who can help them to improve themselves in this difficult period . they find plenty of way and spend much time to help their community . some of the young people are not a lucky a the others . they can not even think about the problem of others . they have their own problem . but this is not their problem and it is not a general case . so i definitely disagree with the statement given above and say : `` young people give a much time a they can to help their community !
