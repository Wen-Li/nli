advertisement is a tool through which the producer provide the information about their product to consumer . now advertising can be done through various mean . for instance , through newspaper , through commercial in television etc . the producer use different technique to make their product look much better than the product of their competitor . now the moot question here is that whether advertisement make product seem much better than they really are or not . according to me , the statement is actually quite true . it is not true for all the advertisement , but yes , for most of them , it is surely true . at most of the time , the producer who are just entering the market have to go in for advertising because they have to face the competitor who are already famous and whose product are well accepted by the consumer . in order to enter the market and make a place for their new product , the producer go in for advertising and thus claim false but attractive thing about their product . also the producer 's main motive is to create a huge market for their product and in turn earn huge profit . so , the longing for compounding their profit motivates the producer to advertise for their product . in that desire , at time they claim some fact about their product which are actually not true . thus the advertisement are quite deceptive . the consumer should not be carried away by the fact and attractive characteristic of the product just by watching the advertisement . in the race of earning maximum profit and achieving rank one in respective market , the producer have deviated from their main purpose . the main aim of the producer should be to offer quality product to their consumer . its not that they should not aim at earning profit . they surely should try to compound their profit but not at the cost of the quality of their product . the traditional concept of `` consumer is the king '' should prevail and only the true characteristic of the product should be advertised . such a thing would add to the company 's reputation a well .
