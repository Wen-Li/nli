the topic is mainly concerned if it is the best way to travel in a group led by a tour guide . i believe and agree with the point that it is better to travel in group led by a tour guide . it is a better way because if we travel with a tour guide , he explains u everything whatever he know about the thing or place . i can specify you a reason and an example of this . since we are from biomedical engineering we went for a visit to a place in kerala where the heart valve were manufactured . the company 's name wa srichitra . there wa a lot of research going on there about the heart valve like developing of artificial heart valve . for every group of four of batch student they alloted a guide . certain student left not considering the importance of the guide . they went on their own . our group went with the guide and fortunetly the guide explained u about the research going on , and the product developed etc . he also explained what he ha done in the development of the artificial heart valve . we put forth our doubt . these doubt of individual from group were answered by him . we gained a lot of knowledge through his lecture during the tour of the place than others who roamed individually or without a guide . a test wa conducted regarding the heart valve and we topped . then everyone realised the importance of a guide and a group . in other case when we went for a tour to delhi in our tenth class with our classmate and teacher with a guide there wa lot of knowledge gain through the question we posed to the guide . he shared a lot of thing with our group people . it wa then onwards i realised the importance of a group and proper tour guide . in some case without a proper tour guide we may end up with le knowledge of the thing and place than others . hence i agree that the best way to travel is in group led by a tour guide based on my experience .
