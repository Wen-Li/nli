in japan , where i live , some young people prefer to travel by themselves . however , i agree to the statement that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide for the follwing reason . my first reason is that to travel in a group led by a tour guide is safer than to travel alone . for instance , when i wa a junior high school student , i traveled to new york in a group led by a tour guide . in that time , i heard that new york wa a quite dangerous city . we planed to visit a famous theater . actually , the theater wa located in a downtown where wa a quite dangerous place . because i wa in a group , i wa able to take a tour bus from a hotel where i stayed to the theater . in addition , a tour guide helped me to visit there . so it wa totally safe for me . if i had traveled alone , i would have had to take a subway to visit the theater . i am not sure if i wa able to visit there alone without any help from a tour guide . this example clearly show that to travel in a group led by a tour guide is safer than to travel alone . my next reason is that i can make more friend if i travel in a group led by a tour guide than i travel alone . for instance , when i wa a studying in waseda university , one of the most famous private university in japan , i traveled to europe in a group led by a tour guide . in the group , i met a girl , shiori . aithough i never met her in my campus , she wa also studying in waseda university . in addition , i wa able to make some friend in a group , including a tour guide . a tour gude , miki , and i wa actually living in a same apartment . after the tour , i often contacted with her . she is now one of my best friend . if i had traveled alone , i would not have known them . because i traveled in a group led by a tour guide , i wa able to know shiori , miki and other people . this strongly illustrates that i can make more friend if i travel in a group led by a tour guide than i travel alone . in conclusion , i agree to the statement that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide .
