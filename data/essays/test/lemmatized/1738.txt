- hairspray that give your hair the same great look all day , during all activity - something almost every woman want . but is this realistic ? if you see a commercial for example on television , have you ever ask yourself `` is it reasonable what the poducer is adverticing , is it true ? '' in the following essay i would like to discus exactly this statement . is the advertised product a great a producer say it is ? first of all we have to consider , that the main thought producer have in their mind is to sell their product , make profit of it . so i personally think that they few a little cheating not a a major problem but make the product look more likable . second , in an advertisment you can vary the condition such a temperature and light , so the customer automatically see the best part of the product and might not even consider possible risk . third , people are easy to influence . seeing a product on a young , healthy and good looking woman or man in a breathtaking setting make them want to be there , have the same look and the same experience . so that a uninfluenced perspective is given . on the other hand there are regulation that control and narrow the range of the producer creativity . as a result there ha to be a certain truth within an advertisement . personally i have experienced that not all advertised product are better presented in a commerial than in reality . so for my own opinion i try not to get a much influenced by the medium and there propaganda .
