in my opinion , i agree it is more important for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact . firs of all , i think any student should they have many idea about how can he understand to learn . for exampel , about me when i wa studyb in high school i remember always i want get high score in all the subject , also , when i get alow scoer in some the subject ifeel by the shy from my self . second , shoud any student he want the high score shoud study hard and sugesst for any student , shoud he study hard before the test or quies . third , any student need understand very well they should write any thing write his teacher , because they help him to remeber when he take test or quies , also , should on each student reviw any lesson before he started any test or quies . in adition , in my opinion , ithink shoud on any student you need pas from any subject should continued with his teacher to keep the information in his mind , also , in my opinion , should on any student , he have parent should always take some advice from them , becuase , the parentes there have a lot of experienc in the life , also , they see some thing you will be do n't see . in the end i want say should on each the student study hard study hard for any test or any quies becaues , if you bstudy hard you will take the high score in the most examination , also , i want say if you study hard for the test they you will help you in any thing in any country and i will say ihope take very high scoer in this test and iwant say if i take high scoer in this test iwill put big big party in my apartment .
