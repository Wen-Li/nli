though i think that it 's good to have a knowledge of thing beforehand but in long run to succeed further one need to try new thing and take risk rather than only doing thing one alredy know how to do well . the first reason for my agreement with the statement is that one can not always take it for granted that he will always get the standard situation and even if he know everything about a situation he will be able to do well . one always face new situation or problem while working . so to overcome those problem and succeed one need to apply new solution and even take risk . most of the time , the people who hesitate to try new thing and take risk get stuck to the same level . there is always an amount of risk and uncertainity in new thing but i also think that everythings is evolving . so the people who are succesful are the one who were the first to do that . these were the people who explored the thing first and created the set of rule for others to follow . so when one is ready to face new challenge then his whole approach of doing thing change and no body can stop him from the success . he get new idea to implement . his whole energy is streamlined in getting thing done and he then look in to every single thing and resource for the solution . he start thinking in term of oppurtunity and making best use of it . the people who do n't dare to do new thing always keep thinking and get stuck to same routine and job . this also sap there creatinve thinking and energy from in to doing there normal thing .
