i think people generally become successful when they try new thing rather than operating on their current skill and information . i quess it is basically depends on the economy principle that high risk brings high return . how doe the humanity can improve itself in the scope of thinking feeling and living if they do n't take risk and try new thing ? the answer of this question seems to be clear for me . i believe that trying a new thing like entering a new business , discovering a new tool to do something brings need inspire and it also brings inspire for other people to try other thing . so even a person can not be suceesful by try'ng a new thing , he \ she can be amodel for other people or a source of inspire to other entrepreneur . successful initators on the other hand give courage to new comer besides inspire . in short , people can improve and complete each other and can open new way for every kind of development by be'ng a first mover . from a soc'ological perspective , it is required and beneficiary . if we look from an economic perspective , taking initiative , being the firts producer in a market brings enormous benefit in turn . because consumer always seek for better product ` in term of feature like speed , power and appearance if we take an automobile a an example . producers have to invent new way or improve the way they use to create better feature to differentiate their good to attract more consumer than their rival at the end . in today 's economic environment trying new thing is not an option but it is a must for brand and company to survive and flourish . henry ford and bill gates are two big example how trying new thing can bring success . it is completely valid for google and e-bay case . we can observe in these example that higher the risk ( depends on how new the business is ) the higher the return
