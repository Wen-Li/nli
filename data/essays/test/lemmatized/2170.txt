the percentage of successful people in society is low . rarely you can find a successful person . in order to be a successful person you have to experience new thing . i believe that successful people should try new thing and take risk rather than only doing what they already know how to do well . a successful person should try new thing so that he completes his successful life , and encourage other people to be successful . the first reason is to complete his successful life . if the person wa successful and the year go on , in my believe he start to loose his success . for example , if a person wa an excellent student when he wa in the high school and he got the hightest mark in all subject in that high school , then after the high school when entered a good university he did not do will and he strats failing his course , in that case this person is not success because he did not complete his successful life . as a resualt , in oreder to be a successful person you have to maintain your successful life and do not let any thing to break it . the second reason is to encoureage other people to be successful . many people are influenced by other people such a actor , player , singer or scientist . if the person loved a popular person he will start acting like him/her . for example , if the person loved a scientist and he wa influenced by him , if the scientist wa a successful person and he always try new thing and experience differeant thing the person will start acting like the scientist and he will try to be like him . this point will help many people to be successful . in conclusion , successful people should try new thing and take risk in order to maintain their successful life . if a successful person only do what he already know how to do well , after a period of time he will loose his success because his knowlege is still the same and he did not learn new thing .
