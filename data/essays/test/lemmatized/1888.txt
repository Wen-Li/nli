i agree with the statement . when we participate in a tour , we do n't need to get a lot of information by ourselves . it is n't necessary for u to buy guidebook since the guide will teach u about the history of the place or tell u what kind of food is good . so we can consentrate on enjoying . in addition , we do n't need care about food . i mean when we do n't have any idea about where we should buy food , we will be uneasy . but of course the tour guide know where to eat and how to order . i give you an example . i am a japanese and when i went to canada by myself , i had a lot of difficulty in ordering at a restaurant . it wa not only because i am not a native speaker of english and they could n't understand what i wa trying to say , but also because i did n't know the way people living there pay . the way they pay wa really different from the way of japanese . it is really difficult for u to know the custom the people living in the place we visit first . so it is important for u to be able to depend on the tour guide who know almost everything about the place . and , by participating in a tour , we can make friend with people who also participate in the tour . we may send e-mail each other after returning to our own house . my mother keep in touch with an elderly lady who participated in the same tour . their relationship is really good . moreover , participating in a tour is much safer for travelors than traveling by themselves . it is often said that travelors are thought to have a lot of money and they are likely to get robberd . for me , being able to have only a good memory during trip is most important . if i get robbed , i wo n't feel go there again . i am planning to visit italy this spring . people often say that there are a lot of robber in italy . i want to enjoy visiting beautiful building there and eating delicious pizza . so i will travel ib a group led by a tour guide . then i wo n't need to take a dangerous train or taxi .
