which one is more important for student ? to understand idea and concept or to learn fact ? according to my experience a a student and my working experience . i will definitely choose the second one of more importance which is learning fact . first of all , we need to discus what is the basic mission of the student ? for me , getting more paritical knowledge and information is my basic mission . take my major a an example , my major is international economy and trade , i need to learn a lot of method to handle international business in the real world . however , almost all of the idea and concept in my major are not paritical or out of date . on the other side , our professor gave me a lot of real story which happended in the bussiness world and its benifits to me . why these story and example are so useful for me ? it is truth and fact . it gave me a best way to know about the bussiness model and bussiness method . secondly , why i hold that learning fact is more important than understand idea and concept is that some of the idea and concept in the text book or told by teacher may not right . we can see a lot of idea and concept already been approved a incorrect ot limlited . after the time pas by , there are many new idea and concept will be creat and raise out . but the fact will not change so easily . it ha more value to be learned . thirdly , the process of understanding the idea and concept is totally different from the process to learn fact . students will use of their brain to think , discus , develop when they learning fact sinice it will bring them much more space . but when they try to understand idea and concept , they just persuade them to believe something belong to other people . they will lost some power of creation and innovation which stdudents should have . based on below reason , i insist that learning fact is more imporant than understanding idea and concept .
