the important fact from the learning is the quality of the knowledge . the learning ha a purpouse and it is how much a learner know from a concept or a theme and what these are involved . moreover , others importants concern are the context and the related term of a specifical theme . so , i agree with the statement that the student learn more when they understand idea and concept rather than learn fact . an important fact to advocate this is the porpouse of the learning . the basic porpouse of a learning is the quality of the information . when a student learn a theme or a topic he or she learns in order to satisfy the hungry of knowledge . so he or she want to look out for more information , then he or she start to learn and comprehend the basic idea and concept that this involve . whereas a learner start to find out information based on fact , he or she doe n't connect the idea and the context of the fact , so the learner start to hesitate about the basic mean of the theme . another point to explain the importance of learn from idea and concept is the importance of know the term and concept related to a specific topic . every single theme are retaled with others theme , so when a learner understant the main idea and concept he or she can inferr about the other related concept just making connection with the idea learned formerly . on the other when a student udenrstand only the fact he or she doe not inferr about the other topic , again this cause confussion and make the learning boring . in fact , is not important for learner to know fact rather than learn idea and concept . kwowing more about the related topic and sastifying the hungry of knowledge the learner can take advantage of the learning procces .
