when facing to this issued mention above , some hold the opinion that travelling in a group led by a tour guide is the best . other people , however , have a negative attitude . if i were forced to agree with one of the option . my choice would be latter . why doe a tour guide require during travelling ? first , the function of a tour guide is that he/she will plan the travelling schedule for you . in other word , you do n't have to waste time to do that . second , in my hometown , a travel agency provides a relatively cheap price package with a tour guide . although i agree that the advantage of a tour guide , i still insist that the disadvantage are far outweigh them . for example , you may force to arrange a sightseeing where you do not have interesting . moreover , you can not spend more time to travel the place where you like . second , if you do not get along with the people in the travelling group or the tour guide , you have no choice to keep travelling . in addition , you still have to pay tip for his bad service . it is loss of meaning of travelling . thrid , you will always suffer from an unfriendly schedule . for instance , you have to wake up early in order to comply the schedule proposed by a tour guide . furthermore , it is fun to arrange a travelling plan with your friend or family . you can tailor made the travelling schedule yourself . you can gain more memory experience during travelling . taking into account all these factor , it is believed that the disadvantage of a tour guide are obvious than it advantage . it is sagacious that it is better to travel without a tour guide .
