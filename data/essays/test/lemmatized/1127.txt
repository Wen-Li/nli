there are various type of successful people . although most of successful people want to keep do thing what they already know how to do well , and to get the best ability of their work , successful people , who always try new thing and take risk , can be the best of the successful people . when people try new thing , even though they do not know how many risk they have to take , they can not lose their focus . however , people feel relaxation and pleasure when they finish or recognize about the thing successfully . people always learn perfectly from their own experience . although people learn some thing by reading or listening , it can not be perfect . what it mean is if people try new thing a lot , then they will learn and get a much information a possible by experience of the new thing . on the other hand , people who keep do what they already know , can not be better then the people who try new thing everytime , because of lack of experience . actually , try other thing every time without knowing how to do well on the thing which people usually do , will be worse , because although people try lot of thing , it can not be clear the work and it mean people just skip every thing . however , if people do a many thing a they can do , it will bring the people more success , happyness , and comfort . also if people try many thing , those thing can be benefit of the people . for example , when i wa really young like 12 year old , i usually sketched what i could see . i wa not good artist at that time , but these ability kept remain in my body and about 2 year later , i got a project from school . the project wa to create my own dance . it wa so hard to me to create new dance , even though i danced a lot before . what i thought at that time wa creating dance with using my sketch . so i draw about 100 movement of simple dance which i made before . i cliped all the paper and flipped every paper . so the stopped movement of dance started to move like cartoon . if i just danced it by using my body , i could not get a+ on that project . as i mentioned before , trying new thing can make people more successful , even though the people fail or clear the thing .
