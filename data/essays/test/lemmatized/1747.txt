people always prefer learnig about subject that interest them . this is why , if you work in a field that appeal to you , at the end your work can not yield but success . the question to be asked is , what if somebody is interested in many subject at the same time ? for instance if you were an engineer student in statistic , you would be studying computer science a well a theoretical mathematics . a perfectionist would tell you , try to be good in both subject . you should understand statistical thoeries and at the same time you should be able to apply them using computer software . the truth is that , in general no one could do so . if you spend your time on programming , at the end you will be very week in statitics . from this point of view , it seems obvious that it is better to have a broad knowledge of both subject , or else your careeras a statistical engineer will be a failure . to have a clear and a right answer on the topic , i would say : it depends on what profile doe the person like to have . for a manager , it would be better for him to be a generalist and to know about various subject and field at the same time . whereas a passionist would be totally devoted to the subject that interest him . just think of the greatest artist , they have an outsider aspect that make them look different from usual people , this is mainly due to the fact that they sacrifice all there time to their work . the do n't look lilke normal people . to conclude , you should work according to what or who you really want to be and in both case you will surely succeed in your life .
