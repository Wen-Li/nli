i agree with the statement given a `` successful people try new thing and take risk rather than only doing what they already know how to do well '' . the reason for holding such an opinion are given below . first one is , if a person succeeds in doing a thing newly for the first time , he is called successful for the first time . but if he repeat the same thing for many time , he may not get recognition or appreciation a he got for the first time because it is usual for that person to be successful in that respect . for example , take cricket . rahul dravid is a good technical batsman . when he first arrived and displayed his skill in batting , he got huge recognition and appreciation from the great of the cricket world . it became casual and very normal when he batted nicely because it is the same thing he ha been doing from first . second one is that we must keep trying new thing to be called successful by all the people every time we succeed . succeeding in doing a new thing instead of usual one brings a huge reputation , recognition and admiration . for example , take the above example of cricket . rahul is a batsman . its common for him to bat nicely every time . but when he decided to keep wicket and succeeded in doing it , he gained a lot of admiration and recognition from the entire cricketing world . one more reason for supporting above argument is that even though , a successful person doe n't become successful when he try a new thing , he gain some recognition from the world for atleast trying a new thing different from routine . he may be appreciated for the effort he put into in doing a new thing . this may not happen if the person fails doing a same old thing every time . for example take movie . if a director fails in bringing a new view of an already known point or a new point , he get recognition from the people for his effort . but he fails in doing the same old thing , his position will be very adverse .
