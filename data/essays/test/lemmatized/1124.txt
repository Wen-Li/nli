there are two type of reaching success . the first is to do all the thing in the way that is desired by the community a well a possible and do them always most efficiently . alternatively you can try to act innovatively and handle risk with courage . that is the way i prefer . so i agree to the statement , that the way to ( better ) success is the way of innovation and risk taking . i identify the reason for the implication `` better '' in two dimension : on one hand the temporal dimension is to be researched . eternal dealing with well-known strategy might be efficient for a certain time , but after some time boredom will certainly appear . as soon a a way of acting loses it potential to surprise it will be desired to be replaced by something new - especially in the fast renewing community we are living in in the 21st century . people are constantly asking for new , more , innovative input . so keeping acting in one scheme for too long will send you automatically into a state of being uninteresting and all the success of the time of social loafing is decreasing rapidly . anyway , the second dimension of quality in innovative process is building upon the first one . kept strategy do not only bore somewhen but also lose the ability of self-reflection . a product or strategy that had worked for year might be caught by new , smaller , more simple product who have still a view for the consumer ' need and not already lost in self-adorement . let 's take microsoft and apple a example : for a long time microsoft wa the number one software distributor in the world . with their operating system `` windows '' a their flagship they walked a well-known path of software development . however , one day apple sneaked silently onto the market and from one day to the next their computer and software solution were a regarded a never before . their strategy wa the permanent review of the consumer ' need and the possibly own mistake . only through this ability to reflect the own product permanently made them now the new number one . big might be powerful - but small is , on long distance , more effective . without investment into innovation and without some acceptance of risk success is no effect of duration . always reflect your own mental model and you are going to be ( for long time ) able to succeed in what you do .
