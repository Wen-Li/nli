i personally disagree with the opinion that young people nowdays do not give enough time to helping their community . i think that if young people are strongly motivated they will do a lot and not only in helping the community . an example that come to my mind is that when last year i did a course for helping and working , of course without being paid , on the green cross at the hospital . this ha been a really interesting and challenging experience for me and i think that i gained a lot from it . this wa just an example , but i remember that there were lot of young people at this course and all of them went there for my same reason : being helpful for the community or at least being a part of it trying to make it better . when i look at my society in general i see that are usually young people that help the most in the community . i know that they must be directed or guided from people that have more knowledge in it but , again , if they are moitivated they can give lot of satisfaction . in conclusion i can say that there always been critic to young generation but in this case and based on my personal experience i do n't find this statement absolutley true .
