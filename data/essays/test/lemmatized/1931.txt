i strongly believe that the best way to travel is in a grooup led by a tour guide instead of going alone . there are various specific reason why i agree this . one reason , if you go on a tour which is unknown to you , it will be very difficult for you to see all the place in that country . eventhough you have a chart of that country , which is shown you everything in detail , may be some time you will face transportaion problem when traveling from one place to another place . another reason , it will be very difficult for you to find a proper accomodation facility available in that place . you will not get proper food so you will become sick . you will return back to your home a early a possible . it will not give you a personel satisfation of a tour which you planned . third reason , you will come to know various culture , the behaviour of the people in different place , religious notation , growth of the city , electricity facility , internet facility to show how the people are communicating with each other , education facility , job oppurtunities and so on . if you miss some where in the middle of the tour it will be very problematic for you to reach your home if you went alone . fourth reason , how effectively they are maintaining their export and import bussiness with other country , water fall , deep forest , historical place a well . you can enjoy all flavour of the food item , juice which are available . the shedule which you prepared previously will become successfull instead of getting late reaching to your native place . finally i conclude that it is better to travel in a group led by a tour guide instead of going alone .
