in japan , where i live , some people believe that best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide because it is easier to travel . however , i personally disagree with the statement for the following reason . first , travelling with a tour guide will limit time for free activity . for example , in 1995 , when i wa a tenth grader in keio high school , a private high school in japan , i went to korea on a field trip . since it wa a trip scheduled by the school , and we had to move in a group , the trip wa guided by a tour guide and all the schedule on the trip wa fixed . there were no free time and a a result , i did not have chance to go to some museum i wanted to go . if the trip had not been guided by a tour guide , i would have had chance to visit place i wanted to go . as the above example illustrates , i truely believe that travelling with a tour guide will limit time for free activity . second , there are not much suprises in a trip guided by a tour guide comparing to a trip on our own . for example , last year , i went to italy and france on our honeymoon . since we wanted to travel freely , we traveled on our own . before the trip , we incidently not decide what to do or where to go on some day . in those day we went to some place where some people usually do not go and found many beautiful place . also , during the trip i found new feature about my wife because the trip wa not all guided and we had to decide everything . if we had not traveled on our own , i would not have found these new thing . as the above example demonstrates , i personally believe that there are not much suprises in a trip guided by a tour comparing to a trip on our own . therefore , i disagree with the statement that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide .
