some one ha truly stated `` imagination is more important than knowledge . '' i totally agree with the statement that `` most advertisement make product seem much better than they really are '' . today we are living in the world of so called commercialisation . if a thing sell in the market , it is doe not matter what kind of an advertisement it is associated with . i recently met an ims kolkata mba graduate . he told me a very fascinating information . he said that people going in the advertisement industry or the management are simply taught how to make people `` fool '' . the advertisement industry catch hold those aspect of a person 's ambition that he could only fancy in his imagination . for example , a model using perfume of a particular brand could easily attract woman from all the direction of the earth flying to him . now who would not want such an experience in his life to be surrounded by woman on all side . for this particular reason people start buying that product and the brand end up with making million of dollar a profit . some advertisement even fool people through scheme such a ` buy two get one free ' or a gold coin on purchase ' peolple get tempted by such gimmick and end with a coomodity which is not worth the money spent . secondly , the advertisement industry focus on the younger elite of the society including both infant and the adoloscents . some of the product are aimed at connectiung their root with something that child fantasize . for instance they associate cartoon with the clothing , drink , super hero that provoke child to force their parent to buy those product . now this essentially becomes a problem for the parent who buy them even if they are hazardious to their child . there have been case when people have misinterprated the ad and have even lost their life of have severly wounde themselves . recently a boy swallowed a mint gum and drank a soft drink over it resultin g in an explosion in his intestine and ultimately death . i strongly feel a need to chalk out a policy to prevent the consumer from being fooled by the brand endorsement . there sould be an international board to keep na strict eye on these brand and introduce `` effective set of guidelines '' to be hailed to for the advertisement .
