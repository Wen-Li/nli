the idea are the flame that encourage people to make new thing , the concept are what lie behind any theory that want to explain the fact that you observe in the real world . the invention of the automobile is just the way humanity found to solve the problem about mobility . before the automobile wa invented there were other mean of transportation , but people realized that thy were not good enough , so the idea of improving the way they move around came up . if we think about theory that have came up while trying to explain fact of the real world , we discover that the concept are what is truly important about them , because they are the one that give the support to any theorie . concepts are the heart of the theorie . for example when it come to financial market , you should not know that when interest rate are high the exchange rate weakens , but you should know why that happens , you should understand that when interest rate are low , capital go abroad , so the supply of the currencie is lowered therefore the exchange rate weakens . the most important thing for a student should be to understand what is behind the fact . the reason thing are the way they are . this way he will be able to approach to any problem that he face , no matter if it is different from the one he wa taugh . as long a the student understand the concept that support theory they will be able to apply what they learned in college in they 're everyday life .
