it can be interesting to try to respond to the following question : `` is it better to have a broad knowledge of many academic subject than to specialize in one specific subject '' . i ' ll try to give few example of my personal experience . one the one hand , i think it 's important to have a solid generalistic basis , because we are able to solve a great lot of problem and we are much more smarter . our job often demand u to have broad knowledge in very different subject , so it is important to have solid basis in many academic subject . but one the other hand , it 's obvious that specialist are very important to our society . the first example i will develop is the doctor . generalists are necessary to make a first diagnostic of what we suffer , but they are not enough qualified in many situation . for example , when whe have auditive problem , whe have to go to an auditive specialist because the generalist can not help u . it is the same for view or skin problem . the second example i want to bring about is the teacher . teachers with a broad knowledge are very usefull for teaching the young one in the beginning of their scolarity . but since we decide to make long study , we have to be taught by teacher which are specialized in a subject . for example , a general teacher can not taught you complex algebra or differential equation because he doe not have learn to teach it . when you are studying in order to become class teacher , you are learning a great lot of subject . so you have not the time to develop a particular subject , such a partial equation in mathematics . as a conclusion , i think that it is important for everybody to have solid basis in many academic subject , but specialist are necessary in our society .
