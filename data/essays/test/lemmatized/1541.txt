i really do agree with the statement . it tell that ` idea and concept ' - so the matrix of an subject-are more important to be understood than learning detail , number and fact . my agreement is easy and logic to be explained . if a student understands the structure , the base or the pattern of a problem he will fairly can develope his own idea and thought about it which actually wil help him to understand the world in it completeness . surely he will get a better mark for writing down all fact and number in an testpaper but this is only a very short lasting success . a long rewarded success would be his comprehend of the content of all the number and fact . let me give you one example : a student learns about the governement . he study all the name of mebers in the parliament but doe neither asks himself nor the teacher for backround information . for hidden connection which can reveal very interesting or even worrying aspect of our democrazy . if there were not those people who always ask for more information , for the source and of course the concept behind everything case like the nixon-affaire would have never been uncovered . let 's come back to the student who unfourtanetly ha got other motivation for his acting . to be curious is one part of the learning progress and this curiousness brings different way of making thing memorable . facts and detail surely will make someone know about something but it wo n't make him understand it . for me it is much more important to get the idea of something because with that idea you are able to think about it yourself . i will shortly explain what i mean by that . if you for example copied an idea directly into your mind and you really understand every thought behind it you will be able to convert or make use of it concerning topic that differ from the original one . this mean you may will find better fitting area which for example can be more profitable . maybe you will find aspect that can proove and idea at another time or another place on earth . imagine a simple constellation : someone somewhere found out that wood can be used to build boat . he found that while being in europe but you life in the us . you and a friend hear about the finding of this person . your friend just save the fact in his mind that you can use wood to build boat . you yourself are a bit more curious than your friend and you ask yourself some question about the principle that stand behind the fact . you-at the speed of light-find out that wood in it natural state is able to swim . now you are able to use your knowledge about the idea of the other guy in addition to the concept you learned and you-at least theoretical-are able to build up your own boat companie . so after writing this essay my opinion remains the same > learning the concept and ( main - ) idea of something is better than just keeping fact and detail in mind for a long time with no practise use of it-except knowing them .
