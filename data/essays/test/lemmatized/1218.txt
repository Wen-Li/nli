to have a real discussion about this topic , we must remember the objective of an advertisement : it is one way to inform people , by the paper , the radio or the television , of the existence of a product and where it is available . moreover , it ha to show people why the object is necessary , and , in case , why it is better than the others . but the law forbids advertiser to express false statement about the product : so they have to find some way to sell it the most . it is the reason why sometimes , we find product much better at the television or the radio than they are when we have it in hand . if we look at the example of a child game , the advertiser put it in a way that is more convenient for the product than the child bedroom : barbie doll are put together in an advertisement to make it more interactive for the child , but in other way , without the house , the car , the sister . .. i think the little girl will be disappointed with a girl alone without possibility . for adult product , the aim is different : there are several way to make them buying a product . in car advertisement , for example , if some advertiser aim at attracting people with power and speed , others prevail design , or the spirit of the car maker . in our time of pollution and energy economy , the smart brand always put forward in advertisement the consumption of the product , which is the lowest one . but without knowing the condition in which the test wa made , the argument doe n't have credibility anymore . it is the same thing when you go to the movie or at television : in the trailer , the advertiser put together the best extract of a program , in only one or two minute , so , for action movie for example , it give an impression of continuous action , which is not necessarily true in the whole program . people who like action may be again disappointed if there are too many slow moment in the whole movie . to conclude , i would say that advertisement do n't really make the product to seem better , but they give it the best in . and moreover , if it seems particularly attractive at the beginning , a lot of people are getting quickly bored , and the product loss it attractivity .
