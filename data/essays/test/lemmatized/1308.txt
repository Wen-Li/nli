i agree with the statment and there are following reason for it . first , you can start learning something easier with intersting idea and concept surrounding a fact or incident than fact themselve . it is true that you can not study anything without learning some basic fact . for example , in history class , when you discus a historical incident and how and why it happend , you need some fact like the name of key person or the year . in this stage , however , it seems studests can not take interest in the subject and it can follow that student stop studying the subject . on the contrary , understanding idea and concept of historical dinamism will make them take interst in it and foster forward studing . therefore , in motivation of learning something , to understand ida and concept first can be effective oppourtunity for student . moreover , to learne idea and concept can lead to the possibility of development . in conclusion , it is more important to understand idea .
