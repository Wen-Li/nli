i disagree with the statement . i think it is a important for student to understand idea and concept a it is to learn the fact . these two can not be separated , because they complement each other . it is crucial to an effective learning process to combine both concept and fact . the understanding of a concept is the base for understanding fact . the concept/idea make the fact clearer to the student because then he/she ha a background supporting a particular fact they might be facing . let 's say a student is taking an internship in clinical psychology and ha to interview different kind of patient . the student will not be able to give an appropriate and complete diagnosis based on only the interview . he/she will be able to see in reality many of the thing he/she ha learned in class . for example , the body language of a patient . the student will not be able to interpret all the signal the patient is sending unless he/she know what those signal or body message mean . and this is when the concept and idea play a big role . by combining the information he/she ha learned in theory with the information provided in practice , the intern will be able to make an accurate interpretation of the message conveyed by the patient . many universities here in chile base their curriculum more on theoretical course rather than practical . i believe that a good curriculum should always have a good balance between theoretical and practical course . it is true that the conceptual course will train and shape the mind of the student to a more abstract kind of thought , but the factual world will shape other skill in the student a well . it is in the practical world where the student will end up working , and not in the world of idea and concept . therefore , it is crucial for them to face the fact of the concept they are learning in class .
