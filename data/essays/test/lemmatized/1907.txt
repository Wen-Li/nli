i believe that there is not only one route for success . to be rich may be one type of success , and to get a good wife and child may be another type of success . moreover , either the person belief that he or she is successful or not may not understood by another person . therefore , i think it is true that the ability or character that are necessary for a person to success also vary by the type of success . one of the type is that taking risk lead a person to success . one of the example is taking up a venture business . in entrepruneuring a new business , he or she must think out a charasteristic business model that is completely different from any other business model that large company have already been conducting , because the chance of success in the business world lie in creating new idea . another type is that a person can be successful by doing the way he or she already know . one of the example of the type are politician . for politician , the skill to listen to lot of various opinion and combine these opinion to the correct policy is necessary . although i admit that creating new policy is sometimes valuable , the ability of controling and leadership is more important for successful politician . after all , in entrepruneurs and politician and every other profession , successful people are able to understand their own standpoint and situation and choose the best activity for them . in order to do so , people must be clever and intelligent .
