when facing the question whether understanding idea and concept is more improtant than leaning fact , different people have their own choice over other . however , if it is up to me to make a decision , i do believe understanding idea and concept are more important with out hesitation . and with respect to my preference come three following reason . first and foremost , the reason enjoying the proprity a my optimum choice state that real idea and concept could make student get more usefull knowledge which they must equipped to find more fact . concepts , i think , is the basis of science which could explain lot of natural phenomenon . for example , i have a litter brother who always fell corious about some amazing thing which i think is just a simple work . however , because the lack of concept understanding , he always get confused of it . so , no concept , no problem could be solved . the more concept we have received , the more way we could explore our life , and then , the more chance we could invent new product and achieve success . according to a survey for the inventor who all have got several invention prises , ninty percent of them had acknowledged the real concept before they went to work on their thinking . that is true becauses a person having no specific idea will not plan their work well . no wonder many scients believe basic concept are so necessary . last but not least , idea and concept understang could be easy to measure student 's quality and how many much knowledge they have achieved . a concept repeat or exam , rather than talking about the fact the student just experienced , may test the ture ability of student by presenting the score they just got in the exam . maybe it is easier for teacher to understand their student 's study condition however , a coin ha two side and the flip side of it is that without learning the fact , student will not understand anything well . though it exsits , i state that understanding concept is more important .
