a path le travelled there are various reason to call a person successful . achieving an important object , performing certain feat , realizing an idea that is unheard of are few of these reason . one can list numerous scientist , explorer and leader who tried something novel yet precarious and were able to achieve their goal . for age the europeans and arabs used silk route a only way to trade with india . but in 16th century christopher columbus proposed an alternative route by sea . this idea though seemed possible but wa unheard of . many people rejected this idea and refused to help columbus . the voyage wa dangerous because no one knew how far india is and where exactly it is located . nonetheless columbus went ahead with his voyage and to everyone 's surprise he did find land , not india though . so by trying a new and risky thing , columbus wa successful and became famous . if one read history , he would find that many nation gained independence by mean of force and war . there were some country which used non-violence a a weapon against opression or for freedom . mahatama gandhi and martin luther king are considered successful doing something unprecendent . people are afraid of trying something new a they are unsure of the outcome . but this very unknown nature of the outcome attracts certain people to try it . the successul people are those who after knowing the outcome were able to understand the nature of the thing and use it for everyone 's benefit . so it is good thing to try new thing or do same thing in new way and at same time take calculated risk . it is possible the result of new thing can be disasterous but if one try the same thing in yet another different manner he/she learn something new and insteresting . when he/she us that knowledge for the benefit of others then he/she is considered successful .
