i certainly agree with the statement . the advertisement are , in fact , to make them better looking . we watch ten of advertisement for each day . we pay attention to them because they are persuasive . a lot of their creator , today , use many creative way to make the advertisement more attractive and conspiquous . nowadays , the advertisement are on the everydays ' tv channel . the creator try to do their best to make it looking more attractive to the consumer . if it doe not work in this manner , the creator do not even need to try to spend their zeal and time to make advertise - ment . we have , at least one time , disappointed by our newly consumed product . we bought them because it wa looking good in advertisement , but it wa not when we actually tried them . it is because there is not limitation to exaggerate for their product and the different angle will show the completely different image at time . however , the advertisement might not work well for some product . for example , the computer is the matter of it function and ability . but , the advertisement can make it better for consumer ' eye by it own magic ; it can use famouse singer or actor to advertise it . then , some consumer would buy it . we walk around street and can see many product easily . but , where do we pay more our attention to ? ; just standing object ? or the object with a fancy , designed background ? standing object want to be stand there , but the advertising object want to be bought and keep being persuaded . i have bought a lot of product from being attracted by those advertisement . but , would n't is be more important to make one to buy the same product because he really liked them rather than deceiving for that second ? but , it would be the perfect if the product is confidently advertised , and the consumer is satisfied for his decision . it is the true advertisement .
