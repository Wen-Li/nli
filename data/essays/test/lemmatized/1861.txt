can this statement allow student to do n't study history ? or can it allow them to study just sciece which is more made up of concept ? as i could think about this question , others can do it and if the answer are affermative , the school 's education can make a dangerous turn . i do n't agree with the statement above , because studyng just idea and concept without fact , student can not see how people used them in the history and they become more exposed to make the same mistake of the past . at the same time studing fact each student can also improve his general culture which is very important to take important decision in the future and make your awarness stronger . moreover , i belive that the study of concept , idea and fact ha the equal importance for a student 's mind : the flexibility of a young mind can improve thanks to different kind of study . we can easly see that studing alwas the same kind of thing the mind take an it own way to work about problem : for example everyone can see the difference between the mind of an architect and the mind of a person who make scientific resource . giving the same problem to both we can have two complete different way to solve it correctly . so , for student is equal important to study idea , concept and fact to do n't make old mistake , to do n't close their mind to a better flexibility and to improve your personal culture , which is very important for the futere career and life .
