i agree . agressiveness on marketing have developed different technics or method used by publicist that may confuse the consumer and lead them to a wrong purchasing decision . although they might be legal , not all consumer sector are the same and big part of them can misunderstood the message of the advertisement . a way how can consumer get confused by advertisement is by providing them uncomplete information , which i believe is the most common type of misleading buyer decision . a clear example are the credit card , which at the time they are promoted do not explain all their disadvantage or restriction . another type of advertisement that i am sure confuses most of people is the one that take a simple information a a fact or make a wrong statement , like saying the `` the best '' , `` the biggest '' , `` the cheapest '' , etc. or simply highlight an information , like an award got on a specific circumstance or by a specific group to label the product at thr seller ' best convenience . an example for me are the car or automobile . on the other hand , communication are now specialized in modern method , like photo , video , sound , that `` complement '' the real fact on which a purchase should be based on , but that i really consider a a distorsion or an intentional diversion of reality in order to create `` other attribute '' to the product that want to be sold , like fashion . i believe every people ha to make some research before buying something . this research should be a long and deep a the product value or is going to cost u , or really how important is for u . i would promote the consumer organization and regularly publish buyer opinion , specially of those who have tried the product already . i would also promote a constant review of the law on advertisement and general marketing method , enforcing seller to provide complete information on their product to the end consumer .
