i agree with the following statement . that is to say , i think the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide . i have three reason to show this . first , a tour guide ( or it maybe a tour company ) will make plan about travelling . when should we leave home ? where should we go and how long we should stay there ? what place should we see ? etc . .. i am reluctant to make plan of travelling , but i like travelling because i can see many building which i have not yet visited and many people who i have not yet met . so it is very happy for me to have a tour guide make plan . second , if we travel with a tour guide knowing a lot of thing about the cite , i can learn a plenty of knowledge from him / her . i live in japan , and there is a lot of place to visit . several world heritage make my mind feel good . a tour guide may explain the traditional value of that cite , and we may know much about it . third , using package tour , safety will be saved . i heard that one of my friend traveled abroad alone and encounted a lot of trouble . he lost his passport , and he had to stay there more than he would expected before . if he had gone there with a tour guide , he would n't have experienced such a event . if we use package tour , insurance to deal with this sad event can go well . therefore , i agree the idea of `` the best way to trabel is in a group led by a tour guide '' .
