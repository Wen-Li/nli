now , i am thinking that the young people do not spend enought time to help their community . reraly the young people work for upper the livel of their community . what is the rison i do n't have a very concreting idea . there is so much time to spend but the they prefer to stay at home to do nathing ( to spend time for play wich computer of on the internet not always is good spend time ) . maybe the question is `` where are the parens ? '' . often the kind competid ingored the problem . it 's the parent . nawadays all the familiar are having time only for their job ( one or more ) and the kid problem are not interesting . same parent have only one problem , the sport activity . father or mother are tired only the fisical education of their child . give time to halping their community , is my opinion , is a upper education . it is n't easy but to learn than their community is important . an a possible example to support my answer is the teacing all the religion , halping their community . all u forgotten that is jast to do when we live wich
