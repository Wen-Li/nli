i believe that the statement is true . the purpose of advertisement are to foster people to buy their product , and so it is understandable that the company are making the product seem much better than they really are . take a an example , there are many advertisement about cigarette . many of them use young and beautiful model who are smoking and beautiful place like paradise . these image make u feel that smoking cigarretes make the person seem cool and feel good . but the cigaretts have bad effect on body and even if you smoke one , you would not feel that you are cool or good and smoking it doe not put you in a beautiful place . another example is advertisement on food . in the commercial on tv , the model are eating the food a if it is the most delicious food in the world , and they are decorated in a very organized and beautiful way . but when you buy the food in the real life , it doe not look a good a when it wa on tv and it could taste normal or even bad . as a conclusion , we are attracted by the image of advertisement which seems better than the real one , and these make u buy the product . i sometimes feel that it is decieving when the company make them seem much better than they really are .
