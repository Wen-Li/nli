i absolutly agree with these statement . i think that is the secret of real success . important is allways what you whant to do with your live . for some people is it good enought to get the old bakery from her father . they know this bakery since they are child , they know what to do , and this is all they want to do through the rest of their life . that might work , to an certain point , but what if anything change ? for someone who try new thing all the time and who risk something is it easier to to make a decission suddenly . someone who alllways go foreward in his live will also find new thing . new thing bring you the success . but if anybody stand allways still , he will never find something new . it can allways fail to risk something but it can also benefit you .
