i do neither agree or disagree with the statement . i think there must be a combination of both . a student ha to understand the idea and concept related to his career . he also ha to learn fact about it , those are really important . the reason i think that both are important is because both are used in different situation and the student must be prepared for them . a person that ha learned fact can answer quicker to a known situation than a person who only understands the idea and concept . for example , i study computer science . one of the most common problem in this field is sorting a set of element . knowing that you can not sort a set in le than a certain time allows you to make quick decision like not using a certain propossed approach and looking for a new way of solving the problem . a person who doe not know this fact but understands the concept would take much time figuring the answer . now , if a person understands the concept but doe not know the fact , he ( or she ) can not react a quickly a the person that know them . his ( or her ) advantage is that he ( or she ) is able of creating new solution , since he ( or she ) doe understand how similar problem are solved . in the situation exposed above , knowing the fact allows you to determine fast if a solution is the right one or not . if you needed to build a new solution , you would need to understand the concept . the main point i am trying to express is that a combination of both characteristic is important . it depends on the kind of work you are performing which one is more important . a good example is if you are hired to correct thing , you need to learn many fact , you can not build everything from scratch . if you are hired to create new thing , you need to fully understand the idea behind other creation .
