i personally prefer going to a tour along with a tour guide . i personally feel so because i have been on a number of tour and i have faced a lot of problem without a guide . being accompanied by a guide for your tour is very essential and according to me is really mandatory . firstly , i would like to say that if we go to a new place where we do n't know the native language or the place , this is where a tour guide come into existance . he is one person who help you with all the thing you need . for example , there wa a time two month ago when i went to china and i really got lost without a guide . the language wa an alien one for me . the writing were really like those box that i used draw a a kid . i really got lost in that situation , and then i realised that how important a tour guid can be . secondly , a tour guide can help you with all the detail of every historical monument or any other place that we got to , which we could not even know without a guide . for example , a few month back my relative came to my home town to visit me and i had to take them on a local tour . i being a local could tell them all the important point and the different event related to a place or a monument which is very essential . thirdly , if we go with a tour guide then we can go to place that suit our budget . he can really help u in telling which place or a restaurant is expensive or cheap or too lavish . thirdly , i would like to say that a guide take into considerance the number of people in a group , and see to it that all of u are together and that we do not get lost . he is the one who keep all the people glued and maintains their sanity . finally , i would like to say that with a guide we feel satisfied that we have seen the best of the place around and even feel good about the fact that we know more about the place now , that we could have not even known without the help of a guide . hence i would like to culminate by saying that being accompanied by a guide is the best way to go on a tour , rather than getting lost and loosing your enjoyment to the alien land .
