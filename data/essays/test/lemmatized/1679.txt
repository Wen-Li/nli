successful people do try new thing and take risk rather that only doing what they already know how to do well . there are many people who have proved this and their success ha made me a staunch believer of this policy . mr.bill gates ha re-written all the rule of the book and ha churned out an ultra-successful business with his out-of-the-box thinking . no one ever imagined that the personal computer would take over all of the world . he realized it potential and took a risk of investing his time , resource and money in an area that others scoffed at during his time . he ha answered his critic back and his company would stand a a testimonial for this . my uncle bob wa a carpenter in his town . he had a steady business and lead a satisfactory life . with the software boom he saw computer being used everywhere and he saw a potential business opportunity here . he observed that these computer did not have a proper table and chair . so he set about to make a computer table that would hold both the monitor and the processing cabinet . the table sold like hat cake and in no time he became a millionaire . but what is interesting to note is that his monthly margin ecxeeds that of the local computer store ! he sure knew how to cash by being different . my friend peter back in high school wa a boy of variety interest . he loved trekking and had an interest in videography . he combined both of these interest and made a movie on how to trek showing the finer nuance of trekking by shooting them . the video made him the star of our school overnight and his video sold like hot cake . his difference is what earned him all the fame . through all the experience i 've been through i certainly believe that it is those who try out different thing and take risk are the one 's who succeed and are the trialblazers for others to follow .
