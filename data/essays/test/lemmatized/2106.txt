from my point of view , in twenty year the number of the car on the on the planet will lower . firstly , because the mankind will understand that it is impossible to continue to live without respecting the envirolment . then , it is a common knowledge that the too big number of car with the the big quantity of smog that they produce are killing the envirolment and ourselves . therefore , in my opinion the governaments in some year will start a valid politicy to lower the number of car . secondly , it will be possible to have least car with the creation of new regulator plan , especially for the big city . this because , in this way , it will be possible , very easy and also quite chip to build a complitely net of pubblic ecologic public transport a like a the elettic bus , the train and maybe hydrogen bus . finally , i think that in about two decade it will be possible to almost all kind of work by computer in our home . therefore , this mean that will not need to go out every day to go to work and so use the car , but , on the contrary we will be perfectly able to work at home . in spite of big industry , for example bmw , general motors , etc. , are working for create and to sell ecologic hydrogen car , i think that however , for space reason , it will be better to lower the numbher of car however .
