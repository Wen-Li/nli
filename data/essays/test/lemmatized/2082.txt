the issue stated by the topic is that whether successful people try out new thing and take risk rather than of doing thing they how very well . this issue is important because many successful people involve great scientits who are very well known for their valuable discovery . i firmly believe that successful people feel like trying newthings and taking risk . firstly i believe that successful people fell like trying new thing and take risk because they are being motivated and inspired by their earlier task which had been a great success in their life . since their earlier task is been successfully completed without a failure they get movited to try out new thing without any secondthought whether the new task will be a failure or success . they feel like taking new risk inspires them to a great extent . additionally i believe that successful person try out new thing by taking risk to prove themselves more successful in life . their confidence level get boosted due to their earlier taks and feel that they can be more successful by performing newthings . doing the thing they are well equipped might be a boring task to them . like performing a same expermient for a scientist again and agian is boring since he already gained a test result of that experiment . a new experiment will be a inspiring task to him since he ha not before and he will be quite curious to know about the new test he is performing with . finally i agree that successful people take the challenge of new task and risk rather than doing what already they know to perform well because they would like to compete with others . today in the world everyone are competing with another to prove themselves . they would like to discover new thing by taking risk so that their product get recognised in the market . and also they will be honoured for that task . in conclusion i state that some event are thogh associated with risk successful person feel like performing the task . since with out taking risk certain thing cant be performed like spending money on bussiness is a risk task . but the result may be more better that bussiness person may gain more profit than the amount he invested .
