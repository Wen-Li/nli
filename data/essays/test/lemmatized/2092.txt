i agree this statement because of following reason . first , to try someting new is really important to improve the problem . for example , it my sister . she tried to pas the exam to the colledge of london . she wa lasy and already woke up very late . she did not like study hard and talk to stranger . she wa very shy . she could not do everything alone . but she decided to try the exam and she changed her life . she study hard and wake up early for presenting the lesson for university . she becomes to be able to take to stranger and eat something alone . she can do everything alone now . to go abroad is really dangerous and including a lot of risk . but she would like to change her life for her future and she could changed her life . and that stance is the essence of the successful people . second , that is the president of nissan motor . he led the nissan the top level company . one of the thing he did is to release and sell the farelady z which is really famous car in their line up now . at that time he got the president position , that car wa not sold because they could not have the power to sell them and they could not improve the car to emotional , speedy , beautiful shape and useful one . and the people who were the staff of nissan rejected to release and reborn the farelady z because there are so many risk . one of them , if the customer will not but anymore . .. but the president strongly did his project and customer love to bought that car . finally he led the nissan to the top level company . to try new thing is very important skill to live . the risk also teach u to spend the time better than not to try . the just waitng and keep their stlye will not bring anymore . to do something new bring a valueable and interesting life for
