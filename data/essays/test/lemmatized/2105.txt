although having a knowledge of the fact is important for student , i think that a better understanding of the idea and concept that caused the fact is crucial for a student 's growth and development . first of all , a truly understanding of the fact is only possible through an indepth understanding of the idea or concept behind them . for example , i read on the `` discovery magazine '' that in 2007 some scientist have thought about the opportunity to delete bad memory from an individual brain . this is a fact that may not be understood by people that have n't had a bad experience . apparently , the idea behind this fact is that a bad experience occurred in an indivual 's childhood may have a negative impact on the individual 's life . by eliminating the memory of a bad experience the indivual may live a `` normal '' life . for example , let 's assume that a child wa abandoned when he wa 5 year old . he will remember the feeling of abandonement everytime someone that he love leaf for a trip or move to another city . such person will then be le inclined to get closer to other people because he know that if he love them , at a certain point they will leave and he may suffer . by eliminating the memory of his abandonement , he may leave better and without misconception . furthermore , knowing the idea or concept behind a chemistry or a biology fact , for example , may help the student in applying that idea ( or concept ) to other discipline and find an explanation of similar result . in conclusion , although knowing the fact is important , only a knowledge of the idea or concept behind the fact may give a better and complete understanding of why and how something happens . this is true in all discipline , from history to science to chemistry to biology and so on .
