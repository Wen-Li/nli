some people prefer to travel in a group led by a tour guide rather than travelling individually without a tour guide . i strongly disagree with their opinion , and i have some reason to support my opinion of why i prefer travelling individually without a tour guide . at first , i dislike travelling in a group led by a tour guide because then i would have to follow the tour schedule . if there is a tour guide , i would not be able to travel in my own pace and look over the place where i want to visit . the place where i could go would be very limited . secondly , i know that the information i could get would also be very limited if i am with a tour guide . for that reason , i have experienced travelling with my family and a tour guide once before when i visited thailand . before i went to thailand i wa so excited of listening to what a tour guide would teach or tell u about the place we go . i thought a tour guide would tell u something we do not know , or something which is very hard to know . however , when i wa travelling in thailand , a tour guide only talked about the history and the current situation about the place . she talked like if she ha memorized all the phrase in a textbook or the booklet , and the booklet woult be easily gained if i go to the travelling office . i thought a tour guide 's lead wa so boring , because the fact or information she said were the once i already knew . to conclude , i strongly suggest that if a person want to really explore the place he go , he should enjoy travelling by either himself or family , never with a tour guide . by traveling with a tour guide , the information we could know is very limited and it is sometimes what we are able to find in the booklet or in the internet . also , the place we can go is very limited if we are with a tour guide . therefore , to really enjoy the travel and explore the place visited , i think it is best to travel by myself , without a tour guide .
