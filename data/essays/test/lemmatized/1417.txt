i think that most advertisement make product seem much better than they really are . first of all , there are hundred of firm producing thousand of different item . the firm 's financial success and profit totally depends on it sale . thus , in order to increase sale in this competitive market , the firm can sometimes claim that their product are much better than others . secondly , i believe that we live in a world of `` imperfect information '' . that is , consumer , do not have enough information about the quality of good and service offered to them . therefore , they are ready to use any type of information they can get and the only way they can obtain some information is through advertisement . however , most of the time , it is only after they use the product , they realize that the advertisement is misleading . for example , one of my friend have been experiencing hair loss and seen a doctor . the first thing the doctor asked wa the brand of shampoo she used . she told the doctor that she wa using one of the best shampoo , one which is advertised everyday and used by many people . the doctor told her to change her shampoo because it turn out that one of the ingredient in it may cause hair loss . she began to use another one , but that advertisement is still on tv and many people keep buying that product ! last but not least , i think that there are important problem in the legal environment . the firm ' activity including their advertisement are regulated by competition law and commercial law . yet , they fail to identify and penalize the firm , which give misleading information about the product . i think it is also necessary for consumer to complain about the product they use whenever it is necessary . only by this way , the legal authority may be aware of the problem and the law can be enforced . consequently , beacause of imperfect information and legal problem , most of the firm do not hesitate to make product seem better than they are .
