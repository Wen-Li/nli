i prefer to go by myself . i like to advance . i want to go somewhere alone and have special experience . if i go to travel with a tour guide well . . there is no thrill . it will be more comfortable with a tour guide . because new place will be strange . i might not know where hotel are or how much the bus fee is . then a tour guide can tell me how to do . but i want to figure out by myself you know . if i do not now i just ask to someone . i will talk with new people . that is the special experience ! a group led by a tour guide usally visit only few place . and they have limit time to enjoy themselves . so people can not enjoy everything . when they bigin to feel excited , a tour guide say `` time to go ~ we are leaving now ~ '' it is not good . but if i go alone freely i can go wherever i want and i can stay only a hour or all day long . people have to pay for touring guide . but if i go by myself i dont need to . i do n't have to waste money so i can save money . if i have a opportunity , i want to go to somewhere by myself . hum . . then first , i need to save some money for trip . i want to go to new place and meet new people . they can be my friend . how nice ! and i like to take a lot of picture . it will be good memory .
