understanding idea and concept more important than learning to the fact for two important reason . first , student do not learn every detail of the subject . secondly , they do not have success with the detail and they do not easily reflect theirs ability . for these reason , i supported to the understand idea and concept . first of all , when student tried to learn every detail of subject they do not understant importance of subject . details restricted to the qulifications of education . in detail student do not show the important point of subject . when tehey related with unimportant point they do not completely understand next idea and concept . in these day , every person related only with his or her work and education system formed according to this understanding . this understanding related with work world and businessman want to profesional people who related only in his or her work . second and important reason is the student get in detail or fact of subject they did not improved themselves and they became lost theirs concentration . then , they onset to show le successfulls and do not reflect their skill easily . this kind of education understandig led to student memorize everything , yet they do not reflect theirs ability . for these reason , student do not see importance off idea and concept and then they became stay same position . they do not illusturated and devoloped his or her skill . as a result , i supported to the understand idea and concept more import than understant to the fact . the reason which i underlined them have vital role on the student understanding . for these reason , student would be understand subject and concept much more than fact . education system will be formed according to this understanding for higher success in the education process . this new understanding which i give detail of it brings much more success for student .
