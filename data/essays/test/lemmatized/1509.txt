i agree with the statement . advretising is some people job they are earning their money by advretising ant their job is making the product so good looking and making the people who look at it think that is a perfect product . for example a make up product when woman look at the advretisement of the product they must think it is the best product for their makeup bag it look small in the advretisments it look colorful it must look the same on their face , but it is not people should not beleave at every product they see on the advretisments are perfect a they think . it is the job of the people who make the advretisments and this is one of the legal way to earn money ( brain washing people ) . their job is to make u think it is a good product and make sure that you buy it . they do n't care care abaut you after you buying the product . that happend to me like it happend to every kid in age 8 or araund 8 year old kid , i saw a new toy advert and i loved the toy from the advert i beg to my parent to buy it and i sucsead but when i opend the the box of that toy i undearstond that it is nothing compeard the one i saw in the advertisement on t.v . so i undearstand that i should not belive evert thing i see on the t.v.specially the advertisement . i am not saying they are bad some of them can be heplful if you do n't know what is new on the shopingcenters or market , maybe i did n't like the toy but some other kid loved it , but i am still suppoting with what i say in the beginning most of hte advretisments make the product seem much better than they are . almost all of the advretisments for the kid are making the product looking better than the kid see because they can imagine way more than a teenager or a adult can imagine .
