those who think the advertisement doe not make any difference of product might say that the advertiseement ha no effect on how it seems . however , i agree with the statement that advertisement influence how product look . there are two example . advertisement can elevate the image of brand . for example , fila , which is one of the fashion and sport company , invited paris hilton to a club party to elevate it brand image . it wa very successful . fila wa once considered a boring and not a trendy brand . however , after the evet , they accomplished a dramatic improvement in their image . now people think fila is the most leading brand of young fasion trend . considering this case , although their product have not changed at all , people became to think fila ha better product before by one highliting event . the above example is a significant change in short period of time . long term star marketing is also able to make product seem better than they are . most of the sport equipment company use huge amount of money on star marketing . for more than ten year , nike invested on micheal jordan a million of dollar asking him to be their model for product . the reason of becoming a model of nike wa possibliy big money he would recieve . this ha nothing to do with how good their product are . however , many teenager think the product of nike is good only because micheal jordan wear the prooduct . moreover , some of them believe that they can be like micheal jordan someday by wearing the product . although this is a case of false image , advertisement contributed a lot how the product of nike seems . when it come to star marketing , people think a company ha a good product because of model in it advertisement . in summary , the advertisement play a huge role how product look like .
