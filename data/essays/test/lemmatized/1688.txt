i do fully agree with that statement . from my personal experience a a consumer of product and of their advertisement , i can just underline this estimation . since my father run an advertising agency , i got some insight into the world of advertising and am even more convinced that product are in almost every case better looking on tv or in newspaper than in reality . to start of with my personal experience a a consumer , i made countless experience with product or service that were supposed to be a `` revolution in their field '' , `` the one and only '' frozen pizza , cellphone contract , hair colour or whatever . .. and turned out to be a complicated , bad-tasting and expensive a every other product . by working sometimes in my father 's advertising agency , i took a look behind the scene . pictures of product are worked on with special programme until the product or the model holding it look perfect , important information and condition are often written extra small , so that one really ha to look for them in an advertisement . since i know now how that work , i know how to deal with commercial and announcement . but particularly child and older people might not consider advertisement a advertisement but a factual description of product which is a problem . there are already numerous child in depted because of too much consumption . as to older people the increasing use of english word may also present a challenge for them to understand the feature of a product . although there are many negative aspect in this regard , i do also realize that i like to buy or have product which transport a certain life style - which must be great to hear for people working in the advertising branche . .. and this life style is very often communicated through advertising . to conclude , i am of the opinion that it is important to know that the aim of a commercial or a nice picture is to make people buy the product and not to deliver pure and objective information . especially child should be taught about that by parent and in school .
