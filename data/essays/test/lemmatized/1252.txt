generally speaking , there are two approach to the learning process , detailed memorization of fact , and understanding of the idea , concept , relationship and consequence behind the fact . although both or valid learning method , and even required method , the most valuable learning experience , in my opinion , is the latter . there are many reason to support this statement . first , understanding idea and concept requires the knowledge of the fact . in other word , the second approach includes the first approach , although the emphasis might not be on the memorization . indeed , in many case the detail are important to draw general conclusion , thus , the ability to retain important fact is implicitely required and developed . secondly , it implies a broader use of intelligence , or the use of all the different type of intelligence . indeed , this method encourages critical analysis , creativity , assertiveness and sinthesis skill . ali this skill are relevant not only for the subject studied , but for any subject , in any environment , and in any stage of life . thirdly , simple memorization of fact is often a short term learning experience , because the fact are often forgotten within a very short period of time . that is specially true in these day , were information is so accesible through different source . the understanding of idea and concept , on the contrary , is usually le precarious in time . finally , i can think on one additional very important , advantage of the learning process based on understanding idea . it is more fun for the student , and even more fun ( although more demanding ) for the teacher . not only the subject are more interesting , also the teaching method can be more creative and adaptative than a lecture aimed at memorizing fact . in conclusion , learning through the understanding of idea and concept allows a much broader understanding of the subject , a long lasting knowledge of it , and the development of important skill that will be needed not only for a final exam , but throughout life .
