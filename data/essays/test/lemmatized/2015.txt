now-a-days advertisement have become , intentionally or not , a main part of public life . even if one is aware of it , advertisement follow u all the time and to any location . they want to give u an impression that the product that is advertised absolutely needed in one 's life and that one particular company ha the right and best product for one . undestanding this mechanism , i believe that most advertisement make product seem much better than they really are . one key point is that advertisement report only about positive side of product . of course , this is supposed to be the usage of an adevertisement in the common opinion . however , having seen many advertisement of product in the same category , in which one company claim advantage of it product while another company degrades it pointing out some disadvantage , one get the feeling that those product can not be such good a one or another company claim . another aspect is the lacking obejectivity in advertisement . mostly , they have not undergone an independent test . so , what consumer get told is quite subjective . in conclusion , i am convinced that the real performance of product is issue of advertisement but praising advantage of them . i think , defining some test bench for product which are published also in advertisement and avoding exaggeration would help people get trust in advertisement .
