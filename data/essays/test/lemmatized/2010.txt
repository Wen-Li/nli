first of all , i think young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their community . there are several reason that i support this idea . one reason that i support this idea is that young people nowadays do not have interest in helping their community . because in these day , the life is safe and people do not notice that they have to thanks for it , especially young people . they do not know how to help their community because they have been living in peace that there have been no need to worry about their future . second reason that i support this idea is that young people have more oppotunities of thier life than the olddays . so they spend more time for themselves such a choosing the college , the graduate school and the job . therefore they tend to lose the time for helping their community . third reason is that nowadays there exist too much community that some of them are even doing bad such a violating the law . these problem are confusing young people and making worse that eventually they do not involve in thier community . at last , i think there are many reason that young people nowadays do not give time to helping thier community . that is because , olddays were more simple and people were tend to involve in their community .
