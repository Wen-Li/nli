i actually think that you ca n't say if it is better to be focused and specialized in a single and specific subject or to be broad-minded , it is to say , to know about many subject in a le accurate way . let u take the instance of a researsh and development department manager . i dont think he will need eight person when each one know a few about a lot , but i do guess that he will be quite more satisfied by a team of eight specialised person who , gathered , will be able to give complementary information and finally do a better job in such a department . this example tends to make me disagree wtih the question . till , if i had the choice between being focused on one skill , or at contrary be open to every topic and be educated so a to have a broad knowledge , i definitely acknowledge that i would rather be broad-minded . although it is taugh , to interest oneself in various topic help to build a critical state of mind , wich is over essential nowadays to understand thing of life like politic , philosophy , economy , history . .. to be critical is to be well-constructed in our modern and so complicated society . to conclude i shall say that the solution seems to be a matter of point of view . appearently , we need both kind of education way . as i already said you cant answer the question simply by yes or not until you put it back in it context . of course it 's better to have many specific tool that are more efficient than unspecific one , but if you simply got to choose only one tool , it 'd obviously be better if this late can be used in a lot of different task .
