i think most advertisement make product seem much better that they really are because that ' s the reason of publicity . the main reason it is to sale and the second reason it is to keep costumer , no one in a commercial it is going to say `` do not use this product , it doe not work '' supossed that you are reading a fashion magazine and you find this amazing product that make your skin look '' youngest '' no one can stop the pas of time , because it is not reversible , but they do not tell you that , they tell you that the cream '' young '' make youre skin better , of course if you do not use any hidratation to your skin , make an excellent diet , quit smoke and do exercise your skin it is gonna look horrible , but for using the cream you can not reverse the past of the time . other product it is the food , on the picture the meat look bigger and more juicy , and when you get your order your meat doe not look a the meat of the picture , of course the meat of the picture wa made for the publicity , made for a really good photographer and a good program of photoshop . but other product that in the advertisement recommend no to used are cigarrets , in the adevertisement prevent the use knowing that the responsible it 's the costumer , but in the publicity they use happy people to show how you are gonna feel if you smoke their cigarrets but do not get upset , not all publicity it is bad , of course the main idea it is to sell a desire , but a costumer we have the choice to accept or not a product , we know that in the publicity are lyies , but sometimes that lyies make u happy . i
