to learn a fact implies the full comprehension of the same . ideas and concept are helpful to achieve a true and real understanding of the thing . i really believe that through the understanding of idea and concept you can reach the total knowledge and therefor , to learn fact . as an attorney at law i feel that i have an unique experience on that field . many of my career teacher , generally the olders , used to argue that the only way to be a good lawyer wa to learn by heart the entire mexican legislation . this is impossible in real life and the new teacher ' wave know that . law is a simple logical process . there is no need to learn the exact text of the corresponding article of the criminal code to know that it is prohibit to kill . it is clear that not every regulation is a obvious a the killing statement above but , every single law text ha an idea , a concept , and a logic . as it is impossible to learn everything , it is much more useful to understand how to obtain the answer needed . i rather prefer to have the intelectual tool to know where to find the precise and accurate answer , having the idea and the general concept , to repeat without any understanding fact . notwithstanding , i do believe that some fact had to be known . the foundation to understand those idea and concept might be fact that need to be learn . in general , my experience aside , i think that the scientist posture would be to understand idea and concept . this is possible in science because everything , or almost , is dedcutible and logical . however , the cultural ( history for example ) position implies to learn fact . it is not possible to understand through an idea or concept the general history of human kind . as per the foregoing i think that it is always better to understand idea and concept , with a few exception . it is always better to think than to repeat .
