i grew up in a city in the north of italy . in my city there is an highly efficient system of transportation based on bus and underground that enables people to commute without using the car . for that reason i agree with the proposed statement and i 'm well aware that in the future there will be fewer car in use than there are today . but , in particular condition , i can imagine a growing number of car in the future , for exemple in small city . i think that car in the future will reduce for three main reason . first , car are responsible for the pollution of the big city and gouvernement seems to care more and more to environemental problem by restricting the access to urban area to car . second , car are expensive and need a constant maintenance . third , the trafic jam is resaponsible for many hour spent in commuting . as a result the only way i see to solve the three problem i 've just explained is an efficient transportation system . the gouvernement of my city decided many year ago that it wa necessary to develop a commuting system able to allow the people to left the car at home and to commute with the bus or the underground . this decision had a big impact on the car sale evolution . since 2001 , starting year for the undergroud , the number of car in my city is decreasing . for that region i believe that in the future the number of car in my city will continue to reduce . i imagine that in small city , where it 's not present an underground or an efficient system of bus the increasing necessity to move will lead to an increasing number of car . at the end if i consider my experience i 'm well aware that in the future there will be fewer car in use than there are today , at least in big city .
