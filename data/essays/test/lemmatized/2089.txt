yes , i agree with this statement . products can be shown better than they really are by advertising . we all know that advertisement are very effective in increasing the sell of a product . because by advertising , large amount of people have idea about the product . and we know that there is no bad advertisement , there is only unefficient advertisement . for example , a kind of food or a kind of tool may be a part of our life by advertising again and again . repeatingly introduction of a product make the people feel that it is a good product . and this will provide of being used widely of that product . for example , in our country , there are a lot of product only selling their name , not much more . for year , we watch the advertisement of the same brand of detergent . there are possibly more effective detergent , but when people went to market , they buy the detergent most advertised . this is not the result of being a good product . this is the result of continuously advertising . and , a a result , advertisement is the best way of gaining some money . that 's it . ..
