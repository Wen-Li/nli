development start with fantasy . actions and work devoid of imaginative and creative mind are doomed to disappear from the common legacy of mankind . yes , i completely agree with this statement . what encourages me to say this in such a confident way is the history of science itself . the history of science is full of success story and outstanding figure . the common trait that made them shine so brightly wa their extraordinary mind craving for trying new thing . they all knew well that without taking risk they would n't have achieve any simple advancement . nikola tesla , one of the greatest mind of 20 . century , constitutes a great example to how a scientist can not be satisfied with what he achieved . he laid ground for the basic of electric current and discovered alternative current making huge wealth out of his discovery . but , instead of enjoying the comfort and luxury , he set out to discover free atmospheric energy and ended up losing everything he owned along with his life . we 're flying incredible distance thanks to courageous wright brothers who took the risk of humiliation . if they gave up trying new thing we would never have experienced the excitement of flying . the same thing is also true for the business .
