i agree that most advertisement make product seem much better than they really are . the function of advertisement is selling product . since every one what to buy thing with high valuse but low prise , the advertisement usually enlarge the quality or ability of the product . some advertisement only focus on the advantage of the product . for example , a advertisement about selling computer may recommend the powerful calculating speed and the big storage space of harddisk in the computer . then the customer will belive that the computer is very powerful . however , the advertisement may not mention the noisy of the computer when it is running , or the heat of the motherboard will make the computer easily shout down . all of these fault are not listed on the advertisement , so the customer will find this fault after they buy the computer and use it . this is why mose people will feel the product is not a good a the advertisemsnt say . sometime the function of the product is all listed in the advertisement . however , the limit of funcitons are not shown . such advertisement seem tell the truth , so the customer will believe them easily . after the customer buy the product , they will find the function of the product is not powerful a they except . for example , the advertisement may sell a car that can saving oil , then people can save money . even the prise of car is more expensive , the customer will still buy it in order to save the money for buying oil . however , the amount of oil saving by this car is few . the customer will feel not worthy to buy this car , comparing the prise of this car . besides , some advertisement ha some super start to recommend the product . the customes who like the start very much will wnat to have the same staff of the start . the function of the product is neglectd by costumer because the choise of super start will not be wrong . in fact , the super start usually do not really use the product they recommend . the productors just sell the product by using the affection of fan to the star . the quality of the product is hided by the star . the advertisement not always tell lie . but hinding the disadvantage and limit of function is also some kind of lie . the customer always buy product with limit understanding of the product , so they will feel the product is not a good a they think . this is because what they think about the product are coming from the advertisement which is not worthy to trust .
