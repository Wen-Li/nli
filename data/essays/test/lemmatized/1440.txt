i genarally agree with the statement that most advertisement make product seem much better than they really are . specifically , when i evaluate the new product rather than well-known one . the idea of advertisement derives from the need to promote the product . therefore , the basic goal when advertising the product is to announce to the broader number of people the brand , quality , price and adventageous result of the use . when a product is new in the market it need a thorough promotion , otherwise people will not have an idea on what actually it is . in this context , people in the marketing section of the firm , try to increase the number of customer of the product and might consider each way a applicable . advertising only the good part of the product or trying to display them much better than they are in real , may be the instrument to challange the other product in the market . to give an example , i had bought a `` magic-knife '' following to a tv advertisement . in fact , it broke up after a few month when cutting a solid bone of a chicken . the producer refused to refund it a cutting a chicken bone wa not appropriate for the knife . on the other hand , while watching the advertisement , one can easily believe that the knife would cut everything , even a stone . as the economy is based on making high profit , company may apply these strategy in order to sell their product to a wider range of people . it is understandable that they have to make better advertisement than their rival , however , consumer must be cautious when buying a new product that they do not know . having acknowledged the statement a `` generally '' , i also believe that well-known brand can not apply falsifying or misleading advertisement , a the image of the brand will be affected seriously . in the modern time , the association of consumer and state institution are endeavouring against misleading information or advertisement about the product . in addition , gaining information about product is easier on internet . therefore , consumer should be encouraged to use internet for their complaint and learn more about the experience of the others . in conclusion , i believe that misleading consumer about a product is more difficult than it used to be in the past but due to the increasing number of new product in the market and measure taken by the authority can not be adequate so it is not easy to state that firm do not apply this method .
