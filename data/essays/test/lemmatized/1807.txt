i completely agree with the statement that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide , because it doe three very basic thing right . firstly we will not get bored while travelling . secondly , we will have enough experience and option during a case 22 situation . and finally the tour guide specially will help u to know the history of social , cultural and political importance of each place . first , if we are travelling with a group of people , we will not get bored of the long travelling hour . for a example when we are travelling from kolkata ( a city in india ) to delhi ( capital of india ) by a train in a group for excursion we have a lot of fun . each one of u exhibit their natural talent and a we progress we sang and dace more vigorously . finally the journey ( about 24 hour ) wa completed and we even did not feel any sort of tiredness . in the secoond place , it is always best to travel in a group because you never know when you will feel sick or some accident may happen . let u take an example , recently when the finance minister of india is travelling to attend an election campaign in gujarat ( india ) he suddenly felt unconscious because of the scorching heat while travelling . the other group member who are travelling with him , took him to the nearby hospital and they stayed with him until he stabilizes . finally , it is very important to have a tour guide when we are travelling because a tour guide will provide immense knowledge about tthe history of social , political and cultural importance of the particular place . he will also provide important information on how to make the journey more comfortable in the shortest possible time for example if you visit a place of historical importance the tour guide will enlighten u with the historical background of that particular place . considering , the above mentioned point it is justified to travel ina group with a guide .
