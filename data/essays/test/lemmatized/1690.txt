successful people are successful people because they took a risk . i think that if you do not take a risk you can not reach your goal . many people in the world try to do the best in theirs job , but they have to take a real risk . one example of a person who took a risk is the president of `` dell company '' he started his own company using and investing his own money . he started in his garage with only one computer . buying computer part and creating or customizing the computer . now his company is one of the mo important computer branch in all the world and he make a lot of money every year . this is a good example of doing what he already know to do well . other example is bill gates , a computer software genious , actually he is one of the most rich person in all the world , he is the creator of the operative system `` windows '' this software wa created in the 80 's creating a new way to use a computer , he change the old command promt for a graphic interface . this year bill gates put on sell his new operative system `` windows vista '' an excelent software with new application , he took a risk too when he started his company but look at him now , he is a successful business man . other good example is lance armstrong he is a bicicle racer and he had cancer . he fight for his life and he is cure . he had won seven time the tour of france . now he is retired but he made a lot of money winning these championship . he took a risk and he did the best he could . these example are the reason that i think that the people have to try new thing and take risk . all of them are successful people and i want to be one of them .
