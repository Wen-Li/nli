i agree with the statement that the best way to travel is in a group led by tour guide . following are the reason why i support the statement . though travelling alone or in a group is good because it provides you feasibility to decide what to do and when to do . when you tavel alone you can not decide on your budget and you may not even control your expences . while travelling in a group you can have control over your budget and can spend limited amount in the journey . sometimes it is possible for the budget of the travel to increase since we do not know about the good and cheap hotel to stay that are available in the area . sometimes the time factor may be one concern to deal with because do not know the exact place to move and see them . having a guide along will solve the problem when we go to new place and can have good tour along with the guide . a guide would know the best place to stay which would match our budget and also plan a proper time schedule for u to see the best place around without much problem . since a guide also know the best place for u to visit we can have a brief idea of the place of visit and choose where we would like to go also when we visit the place we may not know much of the importance of that place . it is guide who can slove this problem owing to the fact that he is a localite and know each and every place over there . so having a guide along with you lessen your problem to see the place arround and also can control the budget from your end also . though hireing a guide might be a bit expensive but still u can have more satisfaction on the tour a you can see all the best place around . as i could remember the last time when i went around myself i could n't catch up with my budget and also the time . so i prefer and agree with the best way to travel is in group led by a tour guide
