the issue in question is whether most advertisement make product seem much better than they really are . this is an interesting question , different people hold different view due to their different background and life experience . as for me , i strongly agree with the assertion for the following reason . first of all , advertisement is the magic of marketing . advertisement can be showed in various of way , such a magazine , newspaper , telephone , television , radio and so on . the company can also held a product launching conference to introduce the new launching product person to person . there are several way to induce the buyer to pay the money , but we seldom find a advertisement to reveal the weakness of the product . it take a lot of time to compare all of the same category product , so we often make the buy-it-or-not decition by only receiving the strengh-side information provided by the advertisement . secondly , the need for the product can be created by the talented marketing genius . they produce attractive story , event , picture to appeal for our notice . exellent advertisement make u feel that we need the product in our daily life even though we actually do n't . for instanse , the oreo snack make a good advertisement in taiwan , they make a film that is about a cute boy eating oreo when he play with his little dog , he melt oreo with milk before every bite . that is really a impression . after my sister saw the advertisement , she buy a bottle of milk everytime when she buy the oreo snack . and she tell me that she agree in this way oreo become more delicious . actually , we all know that the product `` oreo snack '' never change , but the advertisement successfully transmit the new image about the product and make the product much better than before . considering the aforementioned reason and example i cited above , i totally agree with the assertion that most advertisement make product seem much better than they really are . though good marketing approach , everything can be better .
