some people tend to belive that advertiser and advertisments make product exact how they are . in support their idea they might say that there is no reason to show the product much better than it is or lie to the customer . however i am not in agreement with this stance . in my opinion most of the adverisers and advertisments make product seem much better that they really are . in the essay below i will explore some several example from technology and personal experience to support my point of view . first of all it is difficult to deny that any of the advertismenents make the prducts seem much better than they really are . the example of ` iphone ' really sits there . the company apple started to the advertisemnts of their new up comming product iphone 2 year before than it came . they were really good at advertising , i can not deny it . they encoureged people with the new amaizing cell phone to buy it . and than they said that it will be on sale in our store at the august 2007 . people made line for that produckt and waited week long at the door step of the apple store . they sold 80 precent of product they produce . what happend next ? after a month they discoverd a software mistake and collected all device that they have sold . this example of the company apple will deffinitely demonstrates my point of view and agrees that advertisments lie to the client . in addition to the iphone there is also an other example fron an other different clothing company which will also support my point of view . secondly , there wa a company , which allways proud of their trouser . they say that a person can wear our product for a life time . i wa really impressed from their tv advertisement and went that shop to puy a pair of trouser . it wa quite expensive for a trouser but i thought it will worth that money . after the first time i wor it i put it into the wash machine to wash it alone . after i took it aoutto dry it it got 5 size smaler to me . tis wa not my mistake i washed it exactly with the direction bu it got smaller . this example is also show that a person should not belive in what the advertiseiments are saying . in conclusion , the example above of apple and cloathing company will deffinitely demonstrate my point of view about advertisors and advertisments . there might still counter argument abut advertisments but i still belive that they make product seem uch better than they really are .
