i disagrees that staement is the best way to travel is a group led by a tour guide for several reason . first of all , i think the best way to travel is alone . this way can go to want place in your mind for free . however the way to travel is a group led by a tour guide can not yourself to place for you mind . if you want to go a see , but group travel plan doe not include a see . you can not go a see . however alone travel can go to want many place without a plan of guide . secondly , the alone travel can take more time better than the group travel . if you are without a tour guide , you would have more specific role of travel so you can get outside of night and a long period of trevel . you can walk in middle night or early morning . the situation in night or morning give you a special mood and condition . third , the way to travel is alone without a tourguide can meet a lot of people in local . you can talk to people and close them . you would be invest their home . therefore you learn their culture and life . maybe you would have relationship and make friend . so if you are a single , so lucky , you make couple .
