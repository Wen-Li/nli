i completely agree with the statement `` successful people try new thing and take risk rather than only doing what they already know how to do well '' . for example , let u take into consideration two people a and b and let u also consider that both these people are in the business of automobile that is they manufacture car . the first kind of people that is a manufacture car but those kind of car which always run neverthless of the market like the sedan segment . these car always run a they are perfect for a typical family and so their business always have good return and these car are priced normally with the standard fitting and standard gadget accompanying and also made according to the regulation keeping in mind the safety regulation . and now let u consider the second king of people that is the kind b. these people are also in the same business manufacturing the standard car . however , they want to experiment something more taking huge risk into consideration . like they will introduce a new type of car into the market making it more spacious than the regular sedan and lot more comfortable and luxurious . there is a huge risk in this like what if this car doe not run in the market ? then their whole business will go down a they have invested heavily in making the car with putting up more gadget , more luxurious item like the refrigerator or a television and putting up more safety gadget in addition to the standard one . they have taken a huge risk in launching this car a it is different from the rest and also costly . they are experimenting trying oput something new . and let u consider that the car is a hit . now their reputation in the market ha dominated others and their company rise . like the bmw , roll royce , ferrari or mercedes . these car are the dream car for many people . what if these company have jus made regular car ? they would have run normally . however with a lesser brand name than they have now . so , in order to be successful one ha to take risk and try out new thing instead of just goin on with whatever life give . and one ha to have the gutts to try out something like that which ha a huge risk invovement . as successful people do thing differently with added spice .
