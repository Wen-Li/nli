nowadays , in many job , people become more and more specialized . for example in medecin , there are more and more specialist who can just help a few people otherwise there is a lack of generalits , who are very important for litlle and frequents deseases . therefore , in my opinion too specialization is bad both for society and people themselves , for their life and job . general culture is very important for everyone and for the society . for example , if a person is very specialized in one specific subject and know nothing about other topic , how can he have a good relationship with orthers ? therefore , in my point of view , pepole have to have broad knowledge of many topic in order to be able to speak with a lot of different person about a lot of many subject . moreover , it can boring for someone to be interested in just one subject . secondly , i think that a good worker doesn ' t have to be too specialized to be good in his job . for example , nowadays , a lot of doctor are very specialized . there are some doctor who are pneumologist , one specialization , and specialized in one desease : tuberculosis . therefore , they have just patient with tuberculosis . if a patient go to see one of them for a little thing , a a pneumonia , he doe n't know what to do ! he is specialized in his specialization and that is too much . i do n't thinkthqt , even if he is very known for tuberculosis , he is a good pneumologist and at least a good doctor . so , i think that is important , to feel good with people and in your job , to have different knowleges .
