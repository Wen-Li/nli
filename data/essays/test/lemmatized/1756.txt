nowadays , with even more people deciding to study instead of working , it is essential to know how your study should look like . is it better to gain a broad knowledge of various subject or should one specialize in one specific subject ? in my opinion , it depends on your status of your study . if you are still an undergraduate student i would agree with the statement above . at the beginning you should get a broad impression of the possibility the university offer . you should take a much class , from very different subject , a you can to find out which is the best for you . this broadens your experience , basic knowledge and make you maybe more mature . i am studying business in the 4th semester and during my basic study i can choose between 14 subject , like accounting , data processing or marketing . you have to pas all of them to further your study . but after finishing your basic study you reach the point to focus on one specific subject out of these 14 . now i do not agree any longer with the statement above because you have to deepen your knowledge of your favourite single subject . this make sense because this is the point when you have t decide about your future profession . it is quite obvious that if you want to work in a bank you should choose a subject like accounting or finance instead of marketing or tourism . you certainly will not benefit from your knowledge about the clima in italy or how to improve your sale of trouser . therfore you will need your specific knowledge . to sum up , there are probably some example that do not support my opinion , but i am sure that a mixture between the knowledge of many subject and specializing in one subject is the best way to be prepared for your career after university .
