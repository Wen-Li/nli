marketing is an unstoptable phenomenon which is everywhere and the most alarming thing is that the leader of this subject do whatever they want to do . one of many example are the advertisement campaings which show the product in an extraordinary presentation , so people go inmediatly to buy it and surprise ! . there 's no relationship between what you had seen on the advertisement and what you really get in reality that 's why i 'm completely agree with the statement that most advertisement make product seem much bette than they really are . although some product are not too bad in reality , they always confirm the statement , the advertisement are never realistic , in most of the case this is because if they were realistic they would n't have the acceptance that they had , that 's why they have to implement these extravagant idea to the product , the awful truth is that human always have had the feeling that they need more , they are never conformed of what they have , a a result we have this campaign which try to sell nothing but what the people is willing to have , furthermore they know that at the end , the product are not going to full their espectatives . actually , the current number of advertisement in the city , for example in mexico , ha no limit , every little business try to create their own campaing and sell it , no matter if it available , if it will be dangerous or cause damage to people in general . many year ago there wa a medicine here in mexico that created very damage to the people who used it , and it wa after many people were affected that the company accepted his error and had to pay an exhorbitant amount of money to all these people who were affected . to conlude , advertisement product are going to be much better thatn they reallly are , the only point that marketing company should be aware of it , should be that the product wo n't affect the people wealth .
