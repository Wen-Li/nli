with the desire to be the best in one 's feild we put in all our effort and try all our mean to reach there . advertisements are the most common and believed to be the most effiecient mean of conveying one 's product to the public . advertisments can catch hold of viewrs imagination and can even manipulate ( to some extent ) his liking and dislikings . it may sometimes happen that product is not a good a it is potrayed in the advertisement . for example there may be a certain brand of cooky that claim to give 25 % extra free of cost . regular buyer of the cookie are elated and some others are attarcted by this discount . but there have been case where customer are disappointed beacuse the quality or the size of the cooky have decreased or sometimes the cost of packet is increased . purpose of advertisement is to make the society aware of a certain product . but it can be used to trap customer by stating that which is not true about the product . for example there are advertisments about wrinkle removal cream . they claim to remove wrinkle and age mark within say 15 day of uasage . but u wont know how efficient they are unless u use them . it may also be possible that they have certain side-effects which may be mentioned on the package and will go unoticed because of the small size they are written in . at the same time there are product which are genuinely good rather a good a they are presented to the viewer . such product are successfull in the long run . these are trusted brand which are liked by the user . thus i agree that most advertisement make product look much better than they really are . reason could be any from launching new product in the market or relaunching the older one . there are case where the product efficiency is exaggerated . while keeping in mind that there are certain exception to this and some sort of genuine advertisement is still done .
