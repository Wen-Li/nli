i strongly agree and recommend the statement that it is significant for the student to recognize basic concept and idea than to learn brutal fact . accordingly it is found that concept is important more than the fact , because the student have to first grasp the meaning of the basis and better learning step by step . if a kid in a neighbor of yours ha a vast knowledge of univeral system and you give him a task of how to make the universal system different from what he already know , he will be relutant to do so . because it is hard to break someone 's knowledge , fact . that ha already proven true and letting him to go beyond the fact and seek for imagination . if fact are important , it is only important when they have to take examination to enter a certain school . however , it is misleading since it is rarely associating with the student 's life . if a student ha a great imagination toward everything when he wa young , he will have positive mind and he will get to design a better world . if there are fact that the student learn , the student will not try to give a defect to the truth since they will feel no obligation toward of eliminating the truth . sometimes our world , can be imrpoved directly not only by the fact and how it work , but risk of idea of what will occur according to what we deed . usually , the fact tell the student of blocking their dream and developing himself or herself . it reduces the chance of the child of ability to perform a certain action . with concept , the student know how to organize but the concept doe not eradicate the thingkings of a student but requires a further thought of the student . by learning fact a student can be known to the world and can be known for the best person . on the other hand , we can simply interpret this person a a person who ha good memorizing skill . with idea , it is more valued since it is not emulated from someonelse , it is from his or her own identification of thingking . ideas give confidence to the student that there are infinte possibilites of doing a particular activity . as a conclusion , to summarize my opinion , i repeat that the better idea the better to be suitable to be socialized . if the fact are first than the idea or concept to a child , it is inept for a child to be globalized or socialized . as a result to grasp the idea and concept are more essential than to value the fact .
