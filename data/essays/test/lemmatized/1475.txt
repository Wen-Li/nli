sucessful people try new thing and take risk rather than only doing what they already know how to do well , this is true and i support it a i do have somany example before me in my life . me my self from an electric and with a good accadamics . so , i am going to learn the software language rather than improving my core subject . sucessful people ha the eager to know each and every thing . so they try to do or try to lear new subject and theory . my friend too is a very sucessful person and he now doing in a software company but with a electrical background . this is how we can say that the sucessful people try new thing risk rather than only doing what tey already know how to do well . if a person is sucessful then his mind just alters him from the present stream of work . a he is sucessfull he too in a intrest to jump or take another project or field . a man doing business in a field like eatable item and he is very sucess in that then after some year or month he just keep his investment in other business . this is because that he is a sucessful person in his field and want to try his sucess in another field . no man jump or try to change his present stream of work unless he is sucess . if he is a sucessfull person he he dare and try to do another business even . these people even dare or take risk rather than only doing what they already know how to do well . this is because of that the person is sucessful he dare to to the other work even with dare . when we consider the example of mr.pullareddy who is the famous business men in andhra pradesh . he is famous for his sweet and became very popular in india and all over the world this is due to his sucess . and people like this can dare and run new industry and make them sucess under the risk even
