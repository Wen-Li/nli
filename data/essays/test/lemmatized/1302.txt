advertisements i agree with the following statement '' most advertisement make product seem much better than they really are '' . there are many type of advertisement , the main and the common type is the visual advertisement , also it is an effective way to attract the people and to take their attention about specific product . for example , there is alot of amaizing advertisement in television about a different type of trade . a simply the person will sit in front of the television and can see different short clip about a certian product then they immediatly go to find it and buy it even they do n't know exactly what is the detail of how to use it or where it made . alot of product seem much better than they really are in the quality or how they looked according to the technology and photoship . alot of adjustment were done to these product before they show them to u just to attract the people . nowadays , the life is change and the people trying to find the new and the strainge whatever the quality is but this is not applicable at all only at a specific level of the society . the most effective advertisments that one which combined alot of thing to attract the people , visually and soundly because the human being is emotionally , can be affected . also the advertisement could be attractive , attract the one who watch it or can be in the opposite side . finally , a that mentioned above that the advertisment if it used in a proper way it will be most effective and attractive .
