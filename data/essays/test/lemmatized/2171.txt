for me it is a lot more important that student undestand idea and concept because with that the can formulate or have their own concept if we are talking in an specific subject . if the student just learn fact , according to my point of view they are only memorycing that fact , they are only repeating and repeating the word until they finally remember that word . but what is the point of doing that if he is only memorycing and not learning ( the main importance of any school ) i do sometimes memorice thing for my exam and to tell about my own experience , that thing that i wa studing the next 2 day i completelly forgot all of the thing i wa studying for my exam . if we adopt this way of studing , about only memoricyng , later that will make a problem for other of the clases that the student is coursing , i had some of those problem . of course this is something the teacher are in some way responsable of . some of the teacher doe not leave homework to their student , they just wait till the exam show and he just tell the kid to study . for me homework is very important ( however this doe not sound good for many of the student ) to make student have their own analicys and could do thing by their own , like for example thing by their own , not only to responce of what the teacher said . also it is very important that , during the class seasion student can be allow to participate a many time they want to . to make something like a discussion on class , for example a topyc about some student are agree with and some are not . but finally make an equal conclusion , of course one that the teacher could make the last idea and of course the better idea . but not taking out the student idea . the thing here is that student learn something and by doing that they necessary ha to have their own point of view .
