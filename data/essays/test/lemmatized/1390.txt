i think that it is imprtant for student ti undarstand idea and concept than it is for them learn fact . nowadays student are said that they ca n't think logically , and ca n't use knowledge what learned even in elamentary school . why to understand is imoprtant ? if the people who doe n't understanding idea , they ca n't use that idea in any situation . i mean , if pepole who do n't know tha idea abou number , he ca n't count even . people who got the idea can use the idea at least his life . on the other hand , the fact are just one thing . if studens learned one fact , they will just memorize it . it ca n't be conect the other fact . because they do n't know that how should use it . when i wa in elementary sholl , i learned idea about how shoud i use tool in householding class . so i can handle the idea and concept on my life . cook skill is really useful for me . in conclusion , to understnd the any area 's the idea and concept is usefull for everyone in whole life . so , i think more important for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact
