`` i 'm loving it '' that wa the slogan for the mcdonalds . on tv , in magazine , on billboards all they showed wa this slogan and how tastey the food looked like . how yellow the fry were , and how clean there kitchen wa . but , what they do n't show is what ggoes on behind the scense . what they do n't show is that the chicken burger is not just pure chicken from a breast or a thigh of a chicken but actually her beek and finger and skin all mixed in together . mcdonalds is a worldwide community that make million of dollar each year . the advertisments that are made about it show it to be the most delcious , most water dropping meal ever ! it make the person looking at the advertisment rush to the restraunt and order all the best ! one of the most important figure thatn help with thier advertismnt with child is there famous clown . children can certanilly not read . but , when they see a clown , like the one in mcdonalds with colorful hair and a yellow jumpsuit , they get all excited hoping and wishing that he would be proud of them if they eat a meal . another product that make you want to rush to the supermarket after watching the advertisment on tv is the pepsi commercial . it make it seem like when a person drink pepsi he suddenly is god ! with the energy he gest after drinking it , and the celbrities he meet after drinking , it certanilly make it worhtwhile . so , a i stated before those two example clearly show and prove that most advertisments make product seem much better than they really are . unfortuantley , that is the whole point of advertising . if a product look exactly like the way it is on tv and in real life no noe will get juiccied up to buy it !
