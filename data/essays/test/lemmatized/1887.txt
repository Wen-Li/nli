since the transportation system is developing day by day and connecting most of the world road , travel became very common icon to people . as the travel became very common , i can see that people around me always look for the most memoriable and the best way to enjoy their trip befor they go travelling . in my opinion , there 's two big choice of travelling , free tour and group tour with guide . and lot of people choose the group tour for their safety , but i do n't think that the group tour led by a tour guide is not the best way always . and here 's the reason why . first of all , i do n't agree with the statement that the best way to tracel is in a group with a tour guide becuase free tour in private ha more choice to enjoy certain culture of country truely . for instance , i 've been in bangkok last time with grop tour agency and also touring by myself alone . when the tour guide brought me every historical and cultural place in bangkok , i could n't feel the real atmosphere of bangkok . however , when i travelled alone with grabbing the city map on my hand , i could find much more interest thing . moreover , if you travel any country in a group led by a tour guide , you would only see the typical advertised area and shop such a restuarants and shopping shop . for example , i noticed that the area i 've been in bangkok with tour agency always asked u to much more than actually it is . so you could save money if you travel alone in private . thirdly and the last , it might be safer to travel with the big group and tour guide , but since most of county ha very fast , convinient and easy trasportation system , it 's not risky at all to travel in private . in addition , let 's say you 've lost . if you are lost , you would meet very interesting and various people from diverse background . and if you discovered certain really exciting area , your travel would be much more memoriable and valuable in your future . in conclusion , i do n't agree with the statement that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide . it 's becuase of the reason that you ca n't feel the real atmosphere of that country by group touring and you might have much more memoriable trip by having free tour than group touring .
