i ca n't really say that i agree or disagree with that statement . on the one hand young people are very engaged helping their community and on the other hand there are also young people who do not really care . i would like to give two example to explain my opinion . i have a neighbour he is sixteen year old . in his freetime he go to the mainoffice in town and work in a group of youth that try to help creating our community . his name is marc , he is very helpful and open minded . after finishing school he want to study politics . since he wa a little boy he dreamed of being a politician someday . he is the leader of this so called political youth group and ha some interessting idea concerning the environment of our town . this group plan new place where teen can meet and talk about family problem . furthermore they help a agricultural group to collect some idea for the new park . it is very interessting to see how much he like his freetime activity . besides , the groupe increase month by month because he is able to motivate other boy and girl to enter the group . my second example is about another boy who is the opposite of marc . his name is andre and his freetime activity deal with hanging around the whole day . he is an aggressive person and provocates the people around him . he doe not care for his community . sometimes i believe he doe not even know what community mean . last week his class went to the mainoffice in town and watched the work of some politician . some pupil seemed to be very interessted in visiting that office . he and his friend doe not . they ran away and started hanging around again . in my opinion andre is a very lonesome boy . both , mum and dad have a fulltime job . they do not really care for him . marcs mother , for example , spends a lot of time with him . you can see in my example that there exist different type of young people . sometimes it depends on their social environment and their family how they act . because of these two example i can not really agree or disagree with the statement .
