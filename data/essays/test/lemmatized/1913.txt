i think that most advertisement make product much better than they really are is a very true statement . on the one hand , i understand those who make advertisement . they are paid by a society to promote their product , so they obviously focus on their best charateristics and maybe do not talk about possible problem . probably the society itself give them such directive . and if most society do this , the remaining one must do the same if they will not want to go outside the market in the near future . on the other hand , i put myself to the side of the consumer . if i have buyed something , because i wa impressed by a very well made advertisement , i will be very deluded if when i tried it out , it doe not work a well a in the spot . and if this happens again and again , the consumer will doubt of every spot he will see . in conclusion , we understand the policy of seller , always making their best effort to make their product seem better than they really are , but if they will continue this way , i am sure that consumer will be tired of all these `` false '' advertisement and then will not believe to any of them , nope the realistic one .
