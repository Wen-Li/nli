i agree with this statement . in my opinion it give you many advantage to have a broad knowledge in many academic subject . first having knowledge in various different area allows you to be more flexible . the advantage of this is shown for example at finding a job . when you are specialized on just one specific subject , and in this area there are n't too many job available , you have a huge disadvantage compared to those who have the broader knowledge , since they can just switch to some other area , and be a successful . another important argument is that knowing stuff in various subject improves your skill in problem solving . since you are taught in various area , and know many way to solve problem you can think outside the box , increase your knowledge and evaluate problem much easier than people who are based on one subject and decreased with their possibility and way on solving the same problem . because the people who have a broad knowledge can apply to higher thinking skill , with combining their knowledge , and thus have a higher chance that in their knowledge there might be a similar problem they already had solved . people who have a broad knowledge can be sure that they wo n't find the problem of not liking there proffesion anymore . what if the person who specialized almost all his life on studying and specializing on one academic subject doe n't like his subject anymore ? what if he find out that there is something else , something he would be more interested and better in than his specialized area ? this can be a destructive problem , that people who have a broad knowledge do n't have . in the end i want to conclude that in today 's world people with broad knowledge are more in favor of getting a job in a leading position compared to people who are specialized on one subject . since today 's world is very flexible it also need manager and leading people who are a flexible . having a wide knowledge increase your chance in the present time .
