i agree with the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide . because , it is help to create think and leadership . even though it 's not successful for tirp , it can be given good experience , and also this way can give a social influence such a a relationship . person to person 's relationship is n't simple . but if you are plan that which place is prefered , which route is high advanced for travel place before begin to trip . so , leader should think about these thingsm , meanwhile , he can develop more than before being plan . a leader also have to concern about how much spend for having a food , transportation fee , using facility rate and so on . therefore the leader is able to have a evaluate and calculate capability . besides during the travel , they can meet a risk situation such a a car accident or someone got a sick . in this case , also a leader should have a obligation , should effort that how to overcome this situation . these thing can grow leader 's responsebility . there are several reason , that 's why i always try to lead for travel plan and everythings .
