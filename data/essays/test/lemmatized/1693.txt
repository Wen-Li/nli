i studied law and i think that in this kind of study it 's more important for the student to understand and assimilate idea and concept than learn fact only by one reason : the fact can be modify . it 's a simple reason but not easy to understand , so i try to explain it well . in my point of view if you understand and assimilate an idea or a concept you can understand what is the essence of the idea and then you can create in your mind a general structure of this idea . if you do it , you have the main idea , the general idea , and you can change the elemental structure if it 's neccessary for the situation , because the situation can change , but if you have the general idea , the basic knowledge to solve the new situation , you can do it . and to have this general idea , first of all , you must understand the problem , the idea and understand too the basic concept . i think that is worst to learn fact by one reason , it 's impossible than one fact will be repeated , it could be similar , or very similar if you want , but the fact wo n't be the same fact , and in this case , when you find something very similar but not the same a you know , you can be blocked because all is not the same a you know , and then , you have a new problem , similar than the other that you know , but not the same , and you ca n't resolve it if you do n't open your mind to the idea or concept , so in this point , it 's better or easier to start understanding the idea and the concept than start learning the fact . as a resume , this is my idea and my principal reason to think that it 's better to understand idea and concept than learn fact because it permit you to have an open mind and more point of view about one problem , and if you have the base , you can see a situation , think about it and solve the problem , in the other case , you will see a situation , but it 's not the situation that you know so it 's probably that you will be blocked and ca n't solve and hipothetycal problem .
