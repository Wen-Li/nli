there are many successful people in the world and these people succeed because they risk themselves using their intelligence in a wise way . i agree with the statement that say `` successful people try new thing and take risk rather than only doing what they already know how to do well '' . in the business world , many famous businessmen started their work by risking and taking new thing . risk challenge people and those who are capable and confidence enought to do it will success . for example , my father 's friend who wa a worker in a company wanted to open his own business , so he gave up his work and opened a small clothes store and the following year he gained a lot of money . however , he wa an ambitious man and he wanted to expand his business . he invested his money in by fabrication the clothes and a the time went by , the store became very popular in the town . i believe that if this man would have never risked himself in the business field he would still working in the company and be an ordinary man . but now i realized that if a person is wise and smart and know how to do business , taking new adventure and risk are a good chance to success .
