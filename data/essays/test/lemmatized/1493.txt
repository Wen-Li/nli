yes i agree the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide onlly . because we have went to the new place ever we have seen at that time we need a guide to tell u about that place and the important thing and the history of that place and why it got the name for it . for ex ample i and my friend have went to mysore and we have ever seen the place till now and we want the detail about the palace and other detail and why that palace had that much name so none of our fiend have no idea of that place and about that area . so we have ask a guide to tell about that palce and show u the city which have been visit . using the guide we can learn more thing and we ca n't face any problem . because the guide know about all the place in that city and we can easily know all those and we wo n't miss the important place . for example i will take agra we know that there is an tajmahal built by shajahan for his wife a a gift . but the people who are uneducated will some time come for tour to visit at that time it is the best way to travel with the guide and even they do n't know how to travel also due to this we have to need atour guide . ok it is no problem for the person who know about the place they go with out the guide . the guide will show u every part in that place . even the guide some time will say lie but it is better with the guide . visiting the tour with out the guide facing so many problem . for example we want to visit the state like u or canada ofcourse we got an visitor vissa for 15 day or 1month upto the air port we can visit and after we ca n't vist any other city . and we have to return back from that airport only . if we ask a tour guide with u mean we can visit all the place we want to see by not asking the tour guide mean we have to make an enquiry how to go to the place we want to visit and have to know about the local train and the bus we have to face so many risk . so the better way i prefered is to travel in a grouped by a tour guide .
