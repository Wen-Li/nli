the most important part in business these day is advertising . companies advertise ruthlessly to take advantage of the first mover option in the market before their rival company doe and due to this there ha been an increased role of advertising in making the end customer aware of the product . in most of case , i reckon , they succeed in doing so . these day , the market being so competitive and ruthless , there are instance where in the company try to potray their product a something else than what they really are . take for example the advertisment for abc cola which is being showed on national television and the print medium . the cola company is potraying the abc cola ha a thirst quencher . this is not toltally correct . as suggested by the independent reasearch done by the national health institute , it ha been found that the cola actually do n't quench your thirst but make you more thristy later . this is completely contrary to what the cola company want u to believe and the sad part of the story is that people fall for this and the sale of abc cola have been rising ever since . there are instance where advertiser try to paint a rosy picture of the product working on the sentiment of the people . like those advertisments for la fairness cream that promise fairness in le than a month . to worsen the problem , the rival company often come up with a notion which is further preposterous . like the advertisment for the fairy fairness lotion that claim to make you fair in le than a week . reasearch on this ha shown that fairness ca n't be achieved overnight by the use of such external application but there are people out there buying these product . as mentioned earlier , the competition in the market is driving company into selling their prodcuts without paying much heed to the fact that they are actually duping the end customer . all said and done it becomes the responsibility of the end customer to weigh their option well . the good thing is that now the institution of consumer court in well established in the society and the customer is aware of it . it would not be too long when the advertising company would realize this and would ensure that they do not hype their product
