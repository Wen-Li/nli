i totally agree with statement which say that successful people try new thing and take risk rather than only doing what they already know to do well . first of all , if someone is doing something like they always do and what they know better , they ca n't see different thing . of course some people could think that trying new thing could bring unexpectful risk or demege , so it is better to do what they know aready . i saw a lot of people like that , but they do n't even know they really like what they do . they just do that becuase they know this only and better . and they do n't want to take any risk for that . but i believe that someone who brave will eventually have what they want . i think life is too short for doing same thing . i believe that we have to do what we want and try a lot of thing to look for what we really have passion . furthermore , if we try new thing , there are more possibility of getting oppurtunity for diffent and new thing . unless you try new thing , you woul n't even know what they are and how it will make your life change . we have perverb in my country which is `` frog in bowl ca n't know out side of bowl and believe the inside bowl is wolrd . '' it represents that people who is not try new thing and routine what they know and stick with it . if we take risk and look for others thing to do , we can see more than even we imagined before . and finally find what we want to do . they that will lead u to success . to sum up , i stongly believe that successful people try new thing and take risk rather than only doing what they already know to do well , because i think that brave one will get what they want and success .
