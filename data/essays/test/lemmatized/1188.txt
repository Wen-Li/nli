do advertisement make product much better than what they really are ? yes of course ! i agree with the statement . let me line up the reason and explanation why i agree with the issue at hand . advertisements in fact influence people to buy the product that are being advertised . moreover , these day in television show or serial most of the time that is spent is for advertising the product . few channel are just for advertisement . i do not really say that advertising is something wrong , but it should not exaggerate the real quality of the product . most of the people are unaware of this exaggeration shown in advertisement and would generally be tempted to try out the product . but it is once they use it then they will know the real quality of the product . by the time they realize it , they must have spend lot of money on that . in case of rich people who just want to try out various upcoming product it doe not matter , but in case of middle class family it is quite a waste if they spend on worthless product which ha been exaggeratedly advertised a a very good and useful product . recently i saw one advertisement which i can say is the maximum of the exaggeration i have ever seen . it is the advertisement whish uabout a teeth whitener , which show the person who chew it can go in to the darker region without light , using their teeth a light and also they are showing these person are used a street light . this is the exaggeration of what it really doe . it might help in whitening the teeth , but it can never be used a light a such . my niece wa asking me the next day to buy that product , so that we need not use light and can go to darker place with out the help of light . i struggled in explaining her the fact a she is too young to understand . i can still remember that day when a person in our colony bought a juicer that have been advertised by some local company at very low price . it ha been advertised to have different kind of aplications like cutting vegetable , making juice with all kind of fruit with out even peeling their skin etc . but once he bought then only they came to know that it 's not that worth to spend that much amount of money in buying that . they faced difficulty in using that juicer and moreover it is not the way they exaggeratedly advertised it . so i strongly agree with the statement that most of the advertisement make product seem much better and exaggerate than what they really are .
