i do not agree with the statement , that in twenty year , there will be fewer car than nowadays . in my oppinion , it will be completely the opposite . i think they are getting more important for the people . the human like to arrive everything quickly and also if there are other possibility a train , bus or plain , they will probably never reach every place in your country . you have also to pay attention to the development of human behaviour , the people are used to get more and more a much comfort a they could have . many people do not like to walk very long , because they are already too lazy for it , so that 's why some people get also to short pathes by car . probably , there will be some people who will not drive anymore a car , because of enviromental reason . but i think there will be much more , who do not care about such thing . also if the industry do not produce a much car a it used to be , there are other reason . for example financial aspect , because people often buy used car . cars are also not only practically for your movement , but also to transport thing , for example if someone want to buy food or furniture . another reason is , that some people use the car to go to their work , because it is the fastest and most comfortable way . it is also important to notice the development in techniquesalways progress , that is why there will always be new , safer and better car and there will be a lot of people who would like to have them . i think the economy will always support and influence the people to buy car , because they also do not want to sell fewer car and to earn le money . in my oppinion , car are very important for many people in many different part of their life and so intergrated in their doings , that they will not miss or substitute it . that is why i would not agree with this statement .
