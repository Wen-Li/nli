helping community is a topic , which is discussed very often . especially young people do not give enough time to supporting of their community . there are three main reason for this statement . first , young people have a lot of other interest that take a lot of their time . children nowadays are more interested in computer . many parent complain that their child spend most of the day in front of the computer . therefore the child do not have the chance to participate in social life a they mainly stay at home . this brings me to my second point . kids consider it more important nowadays to know the latest computer game . it is not considered to be `` cool '' to help other people or even to support the community . today it is very important what other people think . especially child do not receive a high reputation from their friend when they help the community . it is therefore not very popular . finally , there are not many possibility for child to support the community . i know this problem from my own experience . i tried to get involved in social activity in the city i live in . i had difficulty to find institution that offer possibility for me . in addition , i only have the possibility to support the community during my free-time . most activity take place during my normal workday and it is not possible for me to participate . as i have already had those difficulty , how much more difficult will it be for child to be engaged in social activity ? as a result , young people may get discouraged when they try to help the community . in summary , nowadays it is unpopular for young people to support their community and they may have other interest . it is also not easy for young people do be active in the community . therefore , i agree that young people do not give enough time to help their community .
