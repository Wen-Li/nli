cars are importhat in life especially at work whether it novate or used . every year new development occurs for instance car , train , and helicopter . i certainly agree that in twenty year there will be fewer car in use than there are today . ther are two reason that support the idea below . firstly , every year new tecnology development appears that mean car sold are increased day by a day and no more used car are available for sale inasmuchas people feel exicited to look for a new car rather than old , cheap and used . what attracts people the most after many year are the name of the car , it 's color , and it 's size whether big or small that make a sense a a whole . secondly , used car may have problem that make many people to refuse buying it . for example the gas may not fixed unless it 's taken to the car station ; therefore the person will spend more money to fix the gas problem rather than having a new car cleaned and well organized from outside and inside and not paying so much money if a problem appeared . that 's why after many year there will be fewer car in used and new car will be sold . in conclusion , new car are more beneficial and valuable than used car . what i have shown below is very essential for now and and next year . at least new car are warranted for some year and that lower the percentage of paying money on the car . without a doubt i agree that used car will be le available in sold .
