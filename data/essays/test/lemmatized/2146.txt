advertisements are so common in modern time that most people are guided by them . as a shop-hunter , when i go to shoppling , i always pay much attention to the good whcih have lot of advertisement . however , i wa misleaded once and once again . in my opioion , the advertisement make product seem much better than really are . sometimes the differents between the product and them in advertisement are just result of misunderstanding of language . the purpose for the company to advertise is to introduce their product and attract customer to buy . to reach the goal , they need to use attactive word and explanation . however , sometimes we change the meaning of those word . a famous product in china , which called brain gold , ha some advertisement say that it make people to have a good sleep . people get the idea that it may improve sleep condition a a medicine and have a good impression on it . however , the real function for the product is that it contains some organic material which can help people sleep but not have lasting influence . also , somem product look better than it really is because of the comfortable light in the advertisement . once i saw a beautiful hat on tv and thought it wa really suit for me , bright and opening . however , when i saw it in the supermarket , i found it wa not a well a on tv . it contributes to the light in the advertisement which make the hat much bright and good-looking . our eye lie to u and give u some wrong informaiton . on some other case , the advertisement always use method of phycology to give u wrong detail of the product . when we sit together and have a lunch , there is some product on the tv , for example , an video . the advertisement is about what great view and happy time of a family that the video can catch . all of u will feel comfortable and make an good impreesion of the product , even though sometimes the video doe not act a well a on tv . in sum , i really think that the advertisement always mislead u and make product seem much better . the company catch our attention by using language skill , light and the phycology .
