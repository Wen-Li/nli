nowadays we live in the era of the communication , and the advertisement are an important element in the communication . surely i agree with the statement purposed in the question : i think that it is true that many advertisement present product better than they really are ; nevertheless , i would like to underline that , in my opinion , people know this process , and they do n't believe that the advertisement present the product exactly a they really are . i would like to discus this point to explain adequately my point of view . according to my experience , there is no doubt that during a normal day we read , or listen , or watch many advertisement ; in fact , they are everywhere . surely many advertisement improve the imagine or the quality of their product : however , i would like to say that it is normal . everybody know that the aim of the advertisement is to increase the number of people that will buy a specific product . therefore , an advertisement must be interesting , because it goal is to catch our attention . therefore , on one hand i think that it is not important if an advertisement present a product not a it really is , but , on the other hand , i also think that there are limit that must be respected . in particular , i think that it is not correct if an advertisement deliberately present prize or payment condition that are not true . thus , i consider negatively an advertisement if it tends to do n't respect the law . for example , usually the bank present their purpose not adequately , and it is a problem , because people can sign contract where the financial condition are written ambiguously . on the basis of these consideration , i think that my point of view is clear : every advertisement make product seem better than they really are , but , in my opinion it is a problem only if this process tends to not respect the law . however , today we live in the era of the communication , and we have to consider this risk and be careful about the content of the adverttisements .
