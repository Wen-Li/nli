in my opinion , the successful people is the person who try to challenge new thing and is willing to take risk . i agree that knowing how to do well is importamnt to get a good evaluation in a sopme situation , such a daily job routine . however , i think the meaning of success is to get something it seems to be rather difficult for him or her by challenging it . there are two reason to support my opinion . first , in this competitive world , getting a stable salary doe not mean success , i think . we need house . we want to go abroard . we want to manage our own company . if we make effors , there is a possibility that the dream come true . for example , some of pur successful business exectives in my country had a hard time when they were young , but they studied very hard invested their property in their future . second , successful person is someone whom other people want to be . i do not want to be like officeworkers who come to the offiece at nine a.m. and typing many document and talking telephone , and leave office at five p.m . . i want to think how we can increase profit , and how we can win in the copetition with other company . successful people always try something new , even after being a successfull person . they seemes to be full of energy and dream . finally , if you try new thing taking risk , you sometimes face the different situation . such experience make you stronger . today 's success doe not mean that tomorrow 's success . therefore , to be a successful , we should be enouogh strong to bear the difficulty . you can not survive the difficult time by only doing what you already know how to do it . you need challenging spirit and experience of overcoming the difficulty . i think that the road to success is not easy . if you can investigate your time and property in your goal , then you have a chance to get it . the success is the fruit of challenging . to get a sweet frut , we need to try new thing and take riskes .
