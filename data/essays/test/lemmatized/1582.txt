people like change and to do le work . they also have diffrent opinion for everything . new scientist most of the time change and hope for a better way to make life easier . maybe in the futere people will live in the sea or another planet and they needdiffrent transportation for this new enviorment . also car can have some accedint and people may die so the people may think another vehicle which is safeir to invent . thats is why i think in twenty year later there will be fewer car than it is today . in old time people used to drive horse and camel backthen . but now people driving car for transportation . so in the follwoing year i think people want to change from diriving a car to a diffrent thing which easier and faster . some people like to do le work and acheive thier goal quickly . like before they used to take alot of time to go to another place on horse but it take le time and work by car . so evuntually they will want something faster . scintest are diffrent in their way of thinking from time to time they always look for solution to make the people life easier . before when the people ride on horse scientist wanted to find something faster thats why they invented car . so eventully they will think for a better way to invent something will make the world smaller and every one an use it and sometimes cheaper . nowdays somepeople want live in the sea because it beutey our outter space because it is a new experince and some people want a new thing every now and then . today you can find several car accedints thats why i think people want to a safer mobile . in conclusion i thnck they will be fewr car than now
