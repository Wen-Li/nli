for many people , especially parent , child or young people play a rather significant role in their life . but how high is the contribution of young people ? in the ensuing essay i would like to deal with the topic if young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their community . my answer is simple : i agree with the statement . now i would like to give reason which support my point of view . nowadays many young people spend a log of time in playing computer , using the internet or watching tv ; therefore they have n't sufficient time to concentrate on their community . a few century ago young people had another role in their community . they had to work hard in their community because there wa an interdependence between each member of the community . it wa inevitable to interact with everyone . nowadays the community ha a different organization and structure . it ha the semblance that interaction doe n't play such an important role like in the 18th century . that is why young people doe n't see the sense of helping their community because other people can do this job . another argument which strengthen my viewpoint is the lack of interest in interaction with other people especially people from the own community . young people have no interest to help other people because they concentrate on their own . as a result of my argument you can record the fact that young child doe n't spend sufficient time to helping their community because they are sidetracked by the medium . the medium like tv , internet or the computer are more attractive than than the community . the problem can be solved if the society concentrate on traditional value like respect , affection and loyality . this value should be maintain over century .
