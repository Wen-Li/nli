according to the context , i could agree and also disagree with this statement . on the one hand i agree that open minded people who try new thing tend to be successfull because they gain from each new thing they try , namely an experience or a profession . it is in fact important to have knowledge in many field in order to work with people from different sector . nowadays , in fact , in the labour market it is very important to have knowledge of several subject , in order to be able to work at high level , where a more general understanding of several aspect of a firm is needed . on the other hand focussing on one subject , field , profession can also lead to success . being an expert in what you do , make you valuable and able to work at a higher niveau . furthermore a deep knowledge of a subject/field/profession is also necessary to develop it and inferr implication , often very important and applyable in the practice , that a non-specialized person would not notice . a person who doe n't specialize in something never really know the subject deep enough to exploit it knowledge in a valuable way , and often doe n't really know what he is really interested in . therefore , i personally think that both approach can be positive , depending on what a persone really want to reach . at today i am still trying to understand what i would like to do , and i do n't know if it 'll be better to specialize in one topic or have a general knowledge of several subject . nevertheless in my personal life i prefer to try new thing whenever i can because i consider new experience essential for my personal growth . the best way to make new experience for me is to travel . travelling in new place , with new culture and different people in fact ha always fascinated me , and helped me to strongly grow personally .
