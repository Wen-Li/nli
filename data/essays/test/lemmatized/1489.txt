the best way to travel is in a group led by atour guide . traveling is going out side your country to dicover a new place , enjoy discover . and i agree with said : the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide . when you have a tour guide you will not have the think where ever you might go to the all historical plasces in the country you are visiting , and he will provide the history and the information about every place you go to . the guider will take care about that , also about going to amusement place . also the traveling with the group doe n't let you waste time because it is a scheduale trip , but if you travel alone you may spend long time in relaxing and preparing to go out . another important matter is about money , with the group you spend le money than if you traveled alone , transportation fee , the hotel cost and many other thing will cost you lessso , you will save money and by more gift . and with the group you have much more fun and good , happy time . you meet meet new people and have new friend . acctuly i have tried both way , and i found that with the guider is better , met new people , never have to worry if i can visit all the important place , the scheduale is always full and fun .
