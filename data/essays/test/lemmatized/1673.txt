since thirty year , the number of car increase all over the world , but is it true to say that in some year there will be fewer car in use that there is today ? firstly , the real problem today with car are the petrol and his pollution . yes , the level of petrol decrease quickly and some scientist say that we have petrol still for 80 year . if i stop my reflexion here , i can say the number of car will decrease in the future because people will can not use theirs car . we must to find new carburants to succeed petrol . we have found it , and we call that bio carburants . they are clean for the earth . today they are not ready to use , we need to improve research and development because car have n't a long autonomy . and it 's expensive to make this carburant . we need a big place for the culture of plant . with this crisis of petrol a lot of people take care about the environnement now , and change theirs behaviour . the town of la rochelle in france is a good example . you can find a free acces of bicycle . so , a lot of people use it , change theirs behaviour and stop to pollute the environnement . even it 's easier for people to take theirs car for going somewhere , a lot of people ( in france ) are ready to use bus , railway , plane , boat , bicycle . then a car is practical but expensive . before the price wa cheaper than today and everybody used car even for make a short travel . now it 's different , petrol is expensive . to conclude , it 's hard to plan if there will be fewer car in use than there are today because all the time we need car 's . in france , maybe we can say yes because politics are developing new way of transport in town ( ralyways ) and behaviour is changing . but in china , for example the market increase all the day and they use all the year more car than the last one . human need car because now he need to move all the day . i do n't know if the numer of car will decrease but i am sure that pollution car quality 's will increase . and it 's the most important .
