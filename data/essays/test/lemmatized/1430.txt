learning knowledge ha two step of study processing - understand the idea and concept , and then learn fact . i disagree with the statement that to understand idea and concept is more important for our student than to learn fact . i think that they are both important in our learning field , such a science , art , phylosophy and so forth . the first step of study is to understand idea and concept which include the sagasiousness of our human being . when you are reading a technology textbook , for example , what you want to pursue ? what you want to get from the book , in main point , is that you want to know the principle and mechanism of technology in the book . in other word , you want to understand the idea and concept showed in the material . moreover , you want to , in some case , get the idea and concept and then use them to address or figure out the problem you face in any field . after understanding the idea and concept , you exploit to learn the fact included in them . just understanding them is not enough while you learning them . another aspect is that you should to learn the fact . how to and what to learn fact are the main domain in learning the fact . because of understanding the idea and concept , you have to apply those to real world , object , and subject and so forth . though applying the knowledge you have studied , you can learn what the fact are , and also , you can revise the idea and concept which are of fault and foible . then , you have learned the fact presented in the idea and concept . in sum , we can not separate the two step of study processing . we can not decide which of the step is more important than the other . the one that we can confirm is that understanding idea and concept beyond learning fact .
