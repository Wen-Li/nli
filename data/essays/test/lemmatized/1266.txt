whether most advertisement make product seem much better than they really are ? there is much debate over this question . some people claim that advertisement are responsible for providing some engaging and wonderful picture of product to most audience for entertainment , while any other people hold the oppiste opinion that these advertisement would confuse the decision of people and make people purchase some useless good . in my opinion , i think i would side with the latter opinion and the good appearing in most advertisement are actually not real . first of all , usually the main purpose of most designer of advertisement is making the good or service designed by them seem like perfect and they also want to see the result that everyone who after looking this advertisement is willing to buy the good and service they want to public . in a word , all of these delicate design are ready for owning the preference of most people and earn the more commercial benefit . secondly , under the strong competition , which advertisement could stand out is the key point of getting the success in the field of business . so i believe that all of these large advertise company would try their best and make the biggest effort to produce the exaggerate appearences of the good and service for attracting people . what is the result ? the available advertisement turn out to be more and more out of real situation . at last , we must admit people prefer viewing some beautiful and attracting picture . that is to say , if advertisement are not engaging enough to grasp the eyeball of audience , their advertisement would not make sense a well a the product they will introduce . so seeing from this angle , making unreal advertisement are unavoidable . all in all , there is no doubt that more and more people would come to arrive at the same conclusion with me and begin to realize the real situation of advertisement . all the point discussed in the above argument demonstrate that the real advertisement with loyal introduction of good ' funtions or effect are not existent .
