i disagree with the statement ` the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide ' . although a tour guide is helpful in some case and it is true that this save a lot of time and avoids common mistake which people often make during the trip , i believe that travelling alone is a better choice which give more freedom to people and is easier to get involved into the local enviroment . firstly , it would be cheaper to travel alone . one of my friend , who work in a travel agent , told me that they charge differently to people in order to retain their profit at a signicant level . he ha calculated the cost for me once , the basic cost is le than fifty percent of what a customer actually paid ! what can you say more about that ? secondly , travelling individually can lead you to place where you desire to go , not place with full of junk . tour guide alway take traveller to place where are cheap or where they can share dividend from . regardless any meaning of the place , they often recommend traveller to buy some soverniers or local production which is to be fake and much more expensive than anywhere else , just simply they can share a percentage . thirdly , an important issue of travelling is to see what people 's life like in the other side of the world , travelling alone ha the benefit that where you go is where you have chosen . for instance , you can walk to anywhere in a small town to see how people 's life is without any time limit , it give much more freedom to you . in general , although travelling alone ha some disadvanges such a need more time for preparation . i still believe it is the most efficient way of knowing the world .
