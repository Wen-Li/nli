i disagree with the statement , and think travelling without tour guide is better . i have travelled with my friend a lot , and i wa in a group led by a tour guide for several time , and it have a number of weak point , while travelling without tour guide have strong point . there are two noticeable weak point of travelling with tour guide . first of all , the quality of explanation of tour guide is not good . i compared the explanation of tour guide with the explanation of a local person , and the explantion of the local person wa more interesting and had more detail . second , tour guide have strict plan . while travelling , we may have some spot that we want to visit . however , the tour guide only visit some landmark of the area , and we may miss some spot we want to visit . in contrast to travelling with tour guide , travelling without tour guide have two strong point . first , we may visit where we want . for example , we may visit place that no tour guide visit . next , travelling without tour guide is more likely to have our own experience . if we use tour guide , the experience that we have may have several similarity to other people who have used the tour guide . however , if we travel without them , we may have our own unique experience . in conclusion , i travelled with tour guide , and they have have two weak point , while the opposite case have two strong point . if we travel with tour guide , we have to listen to low quality explanation , compared to explantion of a local person , and we may miss where we want to visit . in contrast , if in the opposite case , we may visit where we want , and we may have our own experience . i disagree to the statement for the reason above .
