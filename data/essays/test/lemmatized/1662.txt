many people in japan , where i live now , believe that succeful people do not try to new thing and take risk . however , i strongly agree with the idea that the the successful people try to to do that . first , the successful ha a lot of imformaiton and way of thinking . for exsample , when i wa in tokyo university , one of the public university in japan , i took professor tanaka 's english literature class . the professor had a lot of knowlege , not only english litterature but also modern international industry , japanese history . because of his widespread knowledge , toyota corpolation , one of the most famous car maker in japan , invited him a a ceo . i learned from him many thing and the most memriable message of him is that we need to get a lot of informaiton to be success in society . as the above exsample show , if we want to be successful , we have to learn a lot of knowledge and information . second , i believe the rule `` high risk , high return '' . presently i work at smbc , a japanese commercial bank . hideo , one of my coworker , quited from this company and began to work a a fund manager . characteristics of job of fund manager is very risky , hard through using million of dollers . however , if they can deal with their business successfully , they can get a huge amount of money and become famous toward medias . on the other hand , work a banker is generally very boring and repeatiung to do same thing correctly . therefore , i am not able to get a meny money because i continue to work at the bank now . as a result , hideo got a lot of money a a fund manager and is trying more exiciting work and therfore , i definetely agree with the statement that we need to try new thing and take risk for success .
