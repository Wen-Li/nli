personal achievement and success never come without risk . when seeking personal success , there are two alternative approach . a person can stick with familiar situation or take on risk and venture into completely new path . although this decision heavily relies upon a person 's unique characteristic , i believe that success call for courage and availability to take risk . first , personal success may entail a fullfilling job . if this is the case , and a person realizes that his or her current job is not conducive to the desired outcome , the person ha to be willing to change job . for example , a person seeking international exposure might have to resign and look for another job . alternatively , he or she might have to travel and relocate to another country . this will require the ability and willingness to adapt to new situation , like learning a different language or living far away from family and loved one . in turn , the person take a risk . second , personal success may entail experimenting with choice and situation that are very different from those we grow accustomed and come to master . for example , i have always wanted to play the piano . although i have studied the guitar for several year , thus becoming proficient in playing it , the piano proved to be a very challenging and different instrument . however , being able to play it wa very important to me . had i stuck with what i knew best , i would have never started piano lesson and never enjoyed the pleasure of spending night playing it . whether it be picking a job or a hobby , the definition of personal success and the degree of adversion to risk shape a person 's approach to life choice . however , successful people tend to be those that embrace risk a a part of a le predictable but certainly more fullfilling life .
