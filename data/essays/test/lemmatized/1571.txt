well , `` most advertisement make product seem much better than they really are '' , i am gree with this statement for the fallowing reassons : some company try to sell the producte maybe giving a impact in the client , like puting a powerfull color , maybe the brand 's name will be tagged from a popular person , and making such a expensive comercial and even paying people to talk about how good the product is . well this can have a good impress in the poeple but what about when this productes ha a while in the market place and everybody is using them ? if the producte doe not satisfide the client the prestigious of the product and the demand of the product will decrease . wich mean lost of money ( for the comercial ) and expensis and the product soon wont have demand at all because of the unsatisfied client which were consuming them . but if the producte is a good a the advertisement , so this productive will last longer term in the market bacause in the beguining people will be atracted by the propagands or the nicely of the productive , people will start consumed or buying it because look very good , and when they start using them one after another they will see how good it is and they will keed adquiring them because this producte it is useful . so company wich really want to investement in bussines and growit in they schould think about it . company schould think farthermore . if a make a deficient producte the client will consume but just at the beguining and later on they wont be satissfieded with it . i think most of the poeple will agree a me in how advertisement make product look like . because of many thing that peple adquired but they are not satisfied with it . and do you know what they will do next time ? ... they will not get the same stuff or thing . so this should be a warning for company before they put their product in the market .
