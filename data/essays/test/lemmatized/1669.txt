yes , i agree that most advertisement make product seem much better than they really are . advertisemnts are a great mode of propaganda of thing of various kind , ranging from food stuff to high technology machine , like plasma tv . with the ever increasing competition in the market , the manufacturer have diverted to option of advertisement . but not everything shown in the advertisement are true . this is true because every manufacturer try to lure the consumer by branding his/her own product a the best in the market . but a small market survey and a small study on the product would reveal that there are in fact many better product available . also the advertiser always depict the product very differently and in a graceful manner , a if it wa the only `` rose in the garden '' . this is done to make the product more and more attractive . the advertiser also fail to indicate in what way that product wa different from the other one in the same category . for example the content and ingredient of a particular drink , or even it nutritional content are not clearly expressed . and even if they are expressed they are exaggerated to a very high level . while advertising , there is a lot of technological assistance implemented . for example a tv advertisement clip can be processed to increase the appearance and contrast of the clip . using various tool the saturation level of colour of the clip and it contrast can be changed to make the product look more colourful and more attractive . nowadays , there is a trend of having popular personality in the advertisents appealing and recommending , the consumer to buy the product he or she is endorsing . movie star , sport start are commonly found in the advertisents . these are several of the way of advertising and an attempt to lure a person into buying that product . i would like to recommend to buy only after true examination of the product and comparing them with the other product of that particular class . also since the manufacturer invest heavily on advertising , this add to the selling price of the commodity increasing it value and becoming more expensive . so we should go for quality of the product and not for the quality of advertisement . the consumer should realize that it is always better to personally view the product and buy rather than to watch the product in the advertisement and going for it .
