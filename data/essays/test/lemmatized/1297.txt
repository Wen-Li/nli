i agree that generally advertiments make product seem better and more desireable than they actually are when you buy them . of course this is no wonder : for each product there are ten or hundred of people who work just to make it look better than it is , and many of them are good at doing their job . exactly a with any other profession , they have been trained for the purpose , and know many technique to convince people that their product is particularly good . a fact that support the view that the advertised good are often much better than the real one is thay many country have regulation concerning `` deceiving advertisement '' . this is beacuse soon it wa realized that many advertised product were so different from the real one that consumer were , in fact , completely deceived . nonetheless , generally advertiser know the law and can therefore succeed in emphasizing and over-emphasizing the quality of their product without breaking the law . the law , however , is not so strict . for example , a far a picture of food are concerned , often the advertised product is presented in a wonderful way : one instance of this could be some kind of cheese with lot of vegetable around it , which make the cheese look very attractive even if it is rather the dish wich is . in this case , regualtions in many country barely demand to write in rather small type `` suggested preparation '' . even so , l'oreal ha been quite recently condemned for advertising in spain a kind of mascara with a picture of penelope cruz wearing fake eyebrow ; this way people were induced to believe that they could use l'oreal 's mascara to obtain such long eyebrow a in the picture , while actually they could n't . but even with a revised advertisement , the mascara will of course look better on penelope cruz than on the mean spanish woman . in conclusion , i believe that advertiser are usually quite good at doing their job , so that the product look way better in the ad than in real life .
