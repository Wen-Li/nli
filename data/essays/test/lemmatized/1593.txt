the statement is not completely true that `` young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their community '' . i am a very responsible person towards the society . i agree that there are irresponsible people towards thier society . like for example , i am a member of a blood group camp which is held monthly . i go to differrent place with the camp and serve many people who are in need . and i donate my blood every month due to lack of avalibility of blood . mainly , student should feel responsible towards there country by helping people . due to lack of communication between the society and student , they are ignoring and unable to find the right need for the society . there are different communties by which people can serve there nation . like joining blood bank , keeping there surroundings clean and tidy , following traffic rule by preventing accident . and people dont want to come by themselves , someone have to start something . who will this someone ? that someone have to be every individual in the society . some people want to help the society they dont care whether they get any money or not . but some are so concerned but there personal life , they forget the duities of a citizen . every citizen have to feel responsible and have to think in a postive way towards there society . for example , in india people are not at all worried about the problem happening in and around u . they think why should we care for them , a they are not my family member . and people get corrupted for doing wrong thing and they hurt the people living in the society and even they can kill a preson for the money . so i conclude that young people are responsible but they have to be reminded by the society . and the responsibility for the young people towards the society should not go down and they have the right to protest , if anything go wrong and encourage the society for forming more community to serve there country much better .
