in the middle of the last century it wa an undiscussable fact , that everyone ha to help with his special skill in his own community . nowadays le and le people are going to help help their own community . some people agree with that development , others do not . let u have a closer look to the advantage and disadvantage of helping in your own community . a first advantage is , that you learn a lot about the people in your community , their special behaviour , their profession and their importance in town . that also mean , that you are able to make friend or get important cantacts for your own business during the time you are helping . you also get a psychological connection to your home town and you feel responsibity for example , to keep yout town nice and clean . another good thing is , that you are informed about all the event which are in town . you can combine duty with pleasure when you help at special event in your home town . the disadvantage are , that , if the connection is to strong to your town , due to giving too much energy in community event and problem , you will perhaps not be able to leave your home town . which make it more difficult for you to make a decent career . if you never leave home town , you might stay narrow minded and you can not enlarge your horizon . i disagree with the statement , that people do not help enough their community . all the work that need to be done is done by employer . in time with such a high unemployment rate , it is better to employ someone , than do the work vith volunteer . i think , nowadays it is more important to get a wide range of knowledge through a lot of different experience from all over the world and not only from your own community . you can not make these experience , when you spend too much time with helping your own communitiy . i also think , that you learn the same what you would learn in your community , when you help organization somewhere else . when you work in a foreign environment , you also have to show , that you are the best person for the job . yoou will not get it due to relative connection or friend . another fact is , that the whole development lead u to globalisation . i believe that it is a waste of time to put our energy in small communitiy problem . we should see the whole . when we support globalisation , small community problem will be solved by themselves .
