i agree with the statement , that successful people try new thing and take risk rather than only doing what they already know how to do well . when people only do the thing they already had success with , they can not get better . in a dynamic environment like it is nowadays , with a lot of market change , globalisation and internationalisation it is more important than ever to try something new . if you do not try thing out , you will stay were you are and the world change around you . there will be other people , who take risk and one day they will become better than you . of course taking a risk is not always easy . it requires courage and you do not know whether you succeed . there will be time , when you take a risk and you flop . but this should not stop you from taking risk . taking risk is another meaning for taking a chance . a risk is also an opportunity and out of an opportunity many thing can develop . when you look at successful people , you realise , that they have always discovered something new and invested in a field , that wa uncertain . nobody became successful with old thing . for example the founder of ebay . nobody would have thought , that a secondhand market on the internet would work out . but it did ! this wa a new thing and the company is very successful now . i also always try new thing . while other student stay in lueneburg to study , i did a semester in finland . during my holiday i go to other country for internship , i try new sport or i visit friend abroad . i have experienced , that when i try out something new , most of the time it wa good and the others envied me afterwards . and the few time new thing and taking a risk turned out to be a failure . what doe it matter ? of course it depends on the kind of risk . taking a financial risk for a father of a family is something else , then the kind of risk i do a a student . but overall i agree with the statement .
