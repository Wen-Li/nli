what is an advertisementds ? what is adverstising ? it help company to sell there product . thanks to this , there are able to compete with other firm , to battle against their rival and show which product is the best or at least to make you think so . `` most advertisement make product seem much better thant they really are '' . i will start my response by saying yes , i do agree with this statement . most commercial want you to think that you will never find the same product anywhere else , that this is the one . in order to make you think so they but an enormous budget into advertising . to make it look like a movie for example where you could perfectly picture yourself in . lets take the example of a food product or a beverage , they make it look like it is a real extase a if you never felt such a sensation before . the problem is , it might tempt you but i dought you will feel the same a they show you on an advertisement . on the contrary i partially agree with this statment . i think company canot lie to the public , of course they probably exagerate a bit , sometimes a lot , but they have to sell their product . that is the reason why i would say that they do n't allways seem much better than they really are but it 's just a question of taste . companies main purpuses are to aim a certain public that is likely to consum their product . people who like a certain product and it advertisement will remenber it and in consequence buy it . therefore
