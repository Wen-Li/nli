a very important question for people whose have the opportunity to travel is how to do it ? in a fixed group with a fixed program and a tour guide or alone . each answer ha it owns possitves and negative thing . to analyzed them and after decide which is better ( actually , i will give my personal oppinion , which doe not mean it is the correct for everybody ) i will first described the two option . when you travel with a group and a guide , you have the opportunity to learn some thing that the guide know . for this to be true , it is very important to get a good guide , because if you do not get a good one it will be a waste of time and money . if the guide is very , but really , very good , you will go to place otherwise you will not have the opportunity to know . other benefit is that you will be with other people and maybe it is possible to find some new friend . for this , it is important to try to travel with a group composed of people you thing you will find identify with them . the negative part is that you will be fixed to a schedulled , that probably you do not like it completly , and will not have the opportunity to make some change at the act . if you travel without a guide and alone or with a known group , you will have the option to do whatever you like at the time you like and the rhym you want . in the other hand , it is possible to do not learn a lot of intersting thing and visit some place . but , all this could be fixed if before the travel , you make a little bit of research . i think is better to travel without a guide ( to have some liberty ) but with some friend cause , it is always better to not be alone . but it is very important to know , before the travel , something about the place that is going to be visited .
