people who have choosed to specialized in one specific academic subject think that generalist people are superficial and that their knowledge is just an illusion . personly i do not agree with that idea . i am convinced that it is much better to have a large academic knowledge than to be specialized for several resons : generalist are open-minded , they will have no problem to find a job and to adapt to unexpectd situation . to begin with , i think it is better to interest in several different subject because it prroves that you are curious and above all open-minded . it is more pleasant to have a conversation with a people who know few thing about a lot of subject than with a people who know a lot but only about one topic . people who are specialized are often boring because they think they can not afford to talk about a subject they do n't know abo , so they are often not very talkative . then , the point is that it will certainly be easier for generalist people to find a job than for specialized people . employers expect more and more for job applicant to be polyvalent . as an executive for example , you will be expected to control a lot of very differents business topic like accountability , marketing , management skill , human resource . .. finally , it is really better to have a broad knowledge of many academic subject because it make you deal with different way to see the world soon a you are a student . i mean that you will be far more flexible than your specialized collegues and it is real additionnal value nowadays . the globalized world we are living in is instable and the student must be aware of the fact that they probably would have to change job serveral time during their working life . therefor , it ha becomed necessary to be open-minded and flexible . to conclude , i would say that having a broad knowledge in different topic is worth it for personnal and professional reason .
