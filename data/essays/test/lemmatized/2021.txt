i agree with this opinion that say that some of the advertisments make many kind of product seem much better than they really are because the people who make these thing want others to be sure that these product are excellents and they should buy these thing because they are the best and they are advisable . but the truth is that some of these product are not the same a we see on television , some time when we buy some of these product we discover that they are not the same a on television so these people lie to u they want u to buy their product . a good example for this kind of lie is the advertisment that encourge people to buy special kind of cigarette , that everyone know that they harm out health and cause many kind of deseases to human . anothergood example is the drink that contain too much sugar that we know that it very bad for health .
