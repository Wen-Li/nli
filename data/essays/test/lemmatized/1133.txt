a first and foremost quality of the human race is ominpotence in this world of fusion , communication and progression , i firmly believe that a persion with the possession of a wide spectrum of knowledge overtakes the one with only a specific knowledge in only one field . research in this currently advancing world requires u to have a broad range of knowlege . as we can see in the case of newton and hook , it is hook that raise the discussion of universal gravity , while newton is the first person to give the mathematical proof . hook is only a empiric physicist , which contribute to his narrow-mindedness in his field-he do not own the same mass volume of mathematical knowledge a newton doe . as we can perceive in the history book , newton utilize calculus in completing the proof , which make him a great difference in the science history . a second requirement derives from our own self . for instance boethius , the catholic sentenced to death by the theodoric , innovate the neoplatonism and brought forth the traditional `` liberal arts '' in the medieval time . liberal art conduce to the holistic development of a successful individual , at least in his time . even university in middle age are based upon that idea . according to his work , the realm of knowledge can be divided into the tier of theology , philosophy and science . let 's take a switch from late antiquity to modern time . it is already clear that einstein 's innovation in the field of physic ha much to do with his music training and philosophical thinking , through the careful anatomy of his brain . a scientist , especially a scientist in the field of theory , share the basis of creation with musician and artist . that is the hominine essense within human-beings . then what is hominine essence ? we human-beings are distinguished from the brutal beast in that we create with intent . this creation , if viewed on macro-level , including all aspect of human knowledge . it 's a splendid star with the combination of art , history , science , mathematics , philosophy , theology , et cetera . therefore a representative of the human race should posse all aspect of human knowledge , with nothing omitted . to be one member of the human race , how can one person only posse a limited amount and a narrow range of what is essential in the foundation of hominine essence ? therefore he or she should get accoutred with anything , or any aspect that characterize the whole human race ! whether considering the respect of research or pondering the aspect of hominine essence , a human-being , if he is eager to become a member of the human race , should equip himself with a wide spetrum of knowledge . a man , by definition , is the master of all existing art per se . he , without any doubt , should be omnipotent .
