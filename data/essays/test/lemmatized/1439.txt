i think that in the student life is more important understand idea and concept that learn fact for two reason : the consecuences to the real life or working life and to the other hand about the way to learning of the human being the first reason is because the concept is tha base of all knowlegde and with the idea you can imagine all that other thing that compane that . when you are student you need the concept and idea to react to any situaction of the life for example when i were in the college i learnt about how a coul 'd sell my service a designer , in this moment know all the concept about the merchandising of the product and when i finished my university and i followed to the next step the work i had to show my idea and sell my owns product and all of the concept learnt wa aplicated and the second reason is the way to learn the human being becouse since we are child we learn the concept with the hand to the fact , but without the concept the fact change their form and they are transformed in only a moment with importance to u for example the learning to clean the teeth , if the kid dont konw the importance of clean their teeth they never will learn the habite in conclution we couldnt separate this the fact
