the statement wa made a , most advertisement make product seem much better than they really are . i agree with the statement mentioned . many company try to attract the people by making some sort of advertisement when they newly introduce the product into the market . as the product initially may require some sort of increased populartiy and to be wellknown to the people , many attempt will be made to get into the market . in this process , the product will be prepared in a careful manner and will be shown in a better way . for example , a perfume made by a company attracted me a lot by the advertisement made in the tv show . really impressed with the advertisement , made me to buy the product . but later on when i started using the product , it wa found to be le prodcutive a i thought to be and le smell i thought to be . another instance , where the clothes look very attractive at the store seems to be good but little attention is needed in looking at the quality of the cloth made . the company try to make a better quality of product in the beginning used for the advertisement but may not be the instance when it actually come to the market . generally people go by the way it wa shown in the advertisement that appeal a lot . the product may seems to be in a better way a it is shown in the advertisement infact it may not be true when it is really concerned . the company put an extra effort to make it more alluring to the people . finally the statement mentioned above abruptly concludes me that advertisement make product seem much better than they really are . i prefer to make a careful review of the product when you actually wanted to get that product .
