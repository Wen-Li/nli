i 'm absoloutly agree . only people that try new thing and take risk will be successful people . i think the best example of this stament are scientist . they spent their life to search , study , and try new law . gaglielo galilei is one of the most important and relevant scientist of ever . he obviously take many risk , but without experiment he could n't find the success . a successful people want to do always better in it life . he 'll try to do always new experience , to meet new e different people , to study , to invest money , time and energy in a new project of work or life . he risk but he do . you can have success only if you do and risk . people that do only what they already known will remain always at the same position . for example , we can still see fantastic engeneering structure of ancient romans in italy , like colosseo or pantheon . these are great bulidings that have passed century of time . maybe who project the pantheon before made other building that fall down . he risked , he had n't success but he could see were he wa wrong , until ha the capacity of made something wonderful like pantheom , that is still on after more than 1000 year . but not only scientist and engeneers can find the success . every people in it life or work have to try to find the way for the success . altought this mean hard work , le time , le money , we have to try every day beeing a successful people . try new thinghs is the best way to known . we could make mistake , but surely we will find the success , more than who do what already known and no more .
