it is not easy to say if in twenty year there will be fewer car in use because main reason will be the developement of the different society and the economy . in this time you need a higher mobility for work , i know many people which have to drive a long trip to their working place and ticket for bus or train are still too expensive , so it would make no difference for them at the moment . and of course it is more comfortable to ride the own car . but the natural ressources get le and so we have to look for other and better possibility . i think in high economic standard region like europe or the usa will be fewer car in use in twenty year , but in other region where the birth rate is much higher and the economy is not so developed at all , there will be very very much potential car driver in future . one example is africa , there are so much people without anything , but when the economy will boom , they want their own car . so even if the number of car is reduced in some nation , there will be more car over the world . for discussing the reducing of the car twenty year is a too small time period , perhabs in fifty year this will be the case . but then perhabs natural friendly method have been developed , we have to see . so i do not think that we will have fewer car in twenty year .
