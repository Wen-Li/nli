successful people allways , we can see difference between all the people . some german lawayers talk about opportunity , and they think that only successful people have new and great opportunity in any job or in any place , it just depends of the intelligent idea and the cappacity of the person . a first important aspect in this topic is the academical preparation . when a young person finish the high school , the first feeling is the confussion , and in this aspect , succesful people have other special skill . this people have an special plan for the future and it consists in a special preparation , they preffer read more than have party or another similars way to fun . successful people prefers to buy a great book than go to the beach in the summer season . when this people finished the university , their first hope is do a postgrade course , it mean more and best preparation . however social relation are extremaly important in this context , because a person that havent friend is a person that havent opportunity in the present , and of course , in the future . this new study represent new opportunity for this people , represents , also , the possibility to know more people and grow up more idea . risk is other important skill for this kind of people . in spanish we have a rally intersting quote el que no arriesga no gana . it mean that if a person want to start with a new bussiness , this person should take risk because is the only way to demostrate that his/her idea wa great . finally , i think that succesful people try new thing , try new idea , and also want to develop the intelligence with new course , and with new friend . is important to want the development of this kind of people specially in south america .
