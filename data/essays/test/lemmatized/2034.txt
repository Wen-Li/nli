i agree most advertisement make product seem much better than they really are . 21th century is the age of technology . by the tremendous development of the technology , new product are made day by day . more product lead to a huge competition between the producer since the customer make a decision of which product they have to buy . the company most important strategy turn to make an attractive advertisement to win this competition . first of all today it is much more easier to introduce product since the increase of the television and computer . for example when a person come from work and want to have a rest , after the meal she firstly watch television to enjoy . by watching television she see the advertisement naturally without any wanting . therefore she can be impressed with one of the product she see and decides to buy it with no doubt . also in television or on the internet the colour and voice effect are sometimes very attractive . any body can give a sudden decision to buy that product by only the effect of the good-written story of the advertisement . also there are lot of advertisement , put on the wall . when the time of travelling or going to work they are seen every day . for example last year while i am in the bus and going to school i saw an advertisement about a cellular phone . the advertisement say that it always work whenever it fall into see . but after three month that i had bought it i dropped it accidentally in a water and quicky picked it up there . after the that day i could not use my phone . therefore advertisement are not informs real quality everytime . as a result we can always impressed and attracted by the advertisement . but they are just an advertisement a it name implies . if you look at them with wisely , it can be easily understood that advertisement make product seem much better than they really are .
