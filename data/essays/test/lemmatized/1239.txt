i completely agree with this statement . understanding idea and concept is in several way much more important than just learning fact . my first reason ist that student should do more than just learning fact . nearly everybody can choose what subject he or she want so study . that show that the student are realy interested in the subject they study . just learing fact would not be a satisfying a understanding the idea and concept of all the different theme . although people can more easy remember thing when they understand them . learning fact is unfortunately mostly for the short term memory . the second point is that understanding idea and concept is much more usuful in real life then learning fact . when you understand idea and concept you can use this basic knowledge in many different situation in your everyday life . just because of the way you take on problem . a very simple example is when you want to find a bank for your money . only if you understand how it really work , you will find the right bank for you . the fact e.g. sparkass , a german bank , is the best one will help you nothing . the last and most important fact is that you can only use all the stuff , you have learned during your study , on the job when you understand the idea and concept . in everyday business every situation will be at least a little bit different from the situation you experienced before . therfore it help you nothing if you know about standart way to solve a problem . for example , you have to lead a team . just knowing about some fact about teamleading will not help you to lead the team to a good , or even better , great success . if you know the fact - treat every person differnt - help you not much . just because it dont show you a to treat e.g. peter . in conclusion i want to say , that there are a lot of point showing understanding concept and idea is much more important than learning fact . and i hope all professor around the world think the same way and try to teach concept and idea not just learning fact by heart .
