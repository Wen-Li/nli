no i do not agree about this subject for many reasones , and what might happen to the market or the compeny when they lie or repersent their product in better than a it is . firist the compeny when they create a new product the should make advertisement for thier product , but they do n't have to make it better than how doe the product look like becuase if they make it better than how doe it look like the people will be supprised and they will not trast them on their new product any more , becuase the lied to the people about their porduct . second the compeny will not success in there probuct and they people will not buy it , for example one time i saw a product on the t.v and they said it is the best and when you try it you can not leave it , but unfortunately when i went to the market i saw a guy who wa talking to the salers about the product and how the company lied to the people and then i desieded to not buy the product . and this a semple example how the company might lose thier money in their product and no baddy buy the product . so the compeny ha to get more customars to successed in thier work and get mare money , and to make the people trast thier product and them , too . i suggest that if a company want to make an advertisement on the t.v or in the road or anywhere they do not have to lie to get more money to thier company ha to foces in the money and how to grab them not to lie on them , so the company want to sale a new product the people can trast them more than any company because the represent thier product and they did not lie to the people about it .
