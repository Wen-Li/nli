the statement that most advertisement make product seem much better than they really are is convincing to me . when i think about main purpose of advertisement , that is to maximise profit , i can get clearer picture a a whole . these are two reason that support my opinion . firstly , advertisement use ` quoting ' but do not use it a a simple way . in other word , advertisement do not tell whole truth about the product that company try to sell . for example , movie producer often quote some critic ' review of their movie like - `` funny and thrilling , but no more - xxx news '' . in this sentence , advertisement us only part it need like this - `` funny and thrilling '' . in part it is still true but the advertisement is not giving potential customer the whole truth about it movie . the advertisement make the movie seem better through quoting critic 's review in a distorting way . secondly , advertisement use exaggeration to maxise an impact of their message to cusomers . for example , in the advertisement of car insurance , a car accident occures to mother and daughter in the middle of the night where are no passign car . this advertisement make view , who have a car , worried and scared . however , when people carefully think about the situation it is not convincing because there is no explanation why the accident happened and why the mom and daughter in that dangerous situation . the advertisement express only extreme situation which we might never meet in life time . in conclution , because main goal of the advertisement is making profit most advertisement make product seem much better than they really are . quoting and exaggertion are two main solution of advertisemet .
