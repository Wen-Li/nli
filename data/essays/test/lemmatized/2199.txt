as we live in the era of information , the chance of learning thing became easy . because of this , we have to choose between just memorizing or to understand from the basic , in my opinion , it 's more important for studnets to understand basic idea and concept than just listening and memorizing the fact . because we can forget easily , and ca n't develop fact in the reality , first , i think learning is not just memorizing fact . because fact are result came from a variety of experiment and test . so it 's really important for student to redo that process once again to learn the basic way how the fact were find out . as a result , they can truly understand and memorize more effectively . in my opionion , i failed my test because i just learned and memorized fact . so i tried to understand how the fact were find out , then i could memorize more effectively and get higher grade , second , if we just learn the fact , we ca n't actually use them in the society . for example , if we just learn the fact , `` two plus two is four '' we ca n't develop anymore like multiplication or divination . which mean we ca n't use the fact effectively . in my experience , when i wa in the elementry , i wa only memorizing the answer from the book . i always got perfect . but when i get test given by the school i go , i always get 0 % . so i thought that i need to understand idea and concept by learning how to solve the problem that wa given throughout the test . in conclusion , i think that understanding idea is the most important than just learning and memorizing basic fact . if we have learning mind to understand idea not just memorizing fact , we will able to memorize more effectively and can develop the basic fact to make it more logical and complicated .
