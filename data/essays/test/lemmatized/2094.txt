i will first discus both interest of broad knowledge and specilization and will then give my personnal opinion . to have a good broad knowledge requires a lot of work and interest in many subject such a math , english literature , politics , foreign language , etc . .. broad knowledge of academic subject sure can be useful and is even required if you are planning on teaching . it could also be convenient to pose that kind of knowledge during a conversation with a friend , or a representative , or at a dinner . that way you will not feel lost and will be able to discus the subject even if you do n't know everything about it . and this point will lead u to the specialization into one specific subject . to specialize in a specific subject doe n't mean that you do n't have pre-requirements in other field of interest . it just mean that you are willing to learn more about a subject more than another plus it mean that you are passionate about something , and to be passionate is often the key to sucsess . because you are eager to learn everything on this particular topic , it may ask a lot of work , but what becomes work thanks to passion ? amusement ! i 'm sure everyone experienced this phenomenon at least once in his or her life . i will take my own experience a an example . i used to detest english and i 'm now studying it . i remember that what triggered everything wa my first experience of watching a movie in it 's original version - since , french dubbing on a foreign movie really annoys me . a couple of year ago , if i told anyone that i would become an english major they would have laughed so loud . and i am today passing the toefl in order to candidate to an isep program . so my opinion , strictly personal and again only based on my personal life experience tends to disagree with this statement
