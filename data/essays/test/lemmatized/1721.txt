the main function of the student is learning . learning includes the understanding of idea , concept and the fact . i stongly believe that student should understand the idea and concept , eventhough , it is important to learn fact . when we need to write the exam it is required to understand the idea and concept . and also it is useful when we work in particular company . firstly , today there is a lot of importance to undestand the idea and concept in the student 's life . for example , if the student is taking his graduate course , definitely he need to understand the concept and idea to answer the question in the examination . because , without having the concept of the particular topic he or she may not be able to answer the question effectively . and also if the student know the idea behind particular theory he can be able to present the idea in his own word or also able to develop the new thing with the same idea . secondly , today most of the company are offering the job to the student who have the knowledge i , e concept and idea of the subject . in the company , you need to work with your own knowledge . so , without having concept on that particular issue you may not be able to perform well and also it lead to stop your growth in the company and sometimes you may lose your job because of lack of idea and concept . to sum up , understanding the idea and concept about the particular subject or issue is more important than learning the fact . but learning the fact give u to know what is happening in the soroundings and also able to know how the thing have gone . eventhough , it is more useful in real life to have concept and idea everywhere .
