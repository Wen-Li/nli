in the following i am going to discus if jung people nowerdays are giving enough time to help their community . i think that this is a difficult question but i would definetly answer it with `` no '' . in my oppinion jung people nowerdays often just care about themselfes . they are not really interessted in their community and in other people around them . to give you an example : i am speaker for the student in our school and we often have new idea which could make our school better and our building nicer . but most of the people around me never care . they like to have longer break and coulored wall but they would never do something to change the situation . they always think that there will be others to work for them - and most time they are right . i think that is one of the reason jung people changed , because they know that there will be no following if they do not care about their community . and they know that there are always others who will care . i red an article in the newspaper `` die welt '' yesterday . there it said that jung people have not learned to help others and to be responsible . parents simply do not teach it them . so they grow up without caring about anyone else , they seem to have their own problem . so i might have a very negative oppinion , but i think that many jung people nowerdays are very egoistic and there are often just a few who care about others . in germany there are some organisation to care for the community , they clean up , help old or disabled people and they try to get money for that . the number of jung member decreased a lot during the last ten year . it is the same in churchprograms . there are a lot of jung people who are not interested in making work without beeing paied . a reason for that might be , that everything is getting more and more expensive and living is not that easy . so jung people habe no time or no money to care for others . but i think that is a very unimportant reason . years ago when people had le than we have today they also cared about their community . i think the vallues of the people had changed and what is important in life . so a a conclusion i would say that jung people nowerdays do not give enough time to help their community and i think that should change .
