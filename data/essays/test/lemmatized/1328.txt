diffrent people have differnt idea about the statement that traveling in a group a with tour gide is the best way . however , i disagree with this idea because traveling alone give you more experience and traveling in a group led by tour guide will force you to visit place where you do n't want to go . to begin with , if you travel alone anywhere , you can experience many thing from start to end . while traveling with tour guide need you to prepare just extra money and time , traveling alon make you learn many thing about the place that you want to visit . you have to find a flight ticket , hotel and information about the place . for example , when i traveled india , i planned by myself . to prepare for this , i had to book a flight ticket , find a youth hostel to stay and search information on the web . it took my time and wa not easy , but a good experience for me . in addition , traveling in a group force you to visit place where you do n't want to go . because you have to keep to a schedule and keep up with the pace of a group , you can not enjoy the time enough . also , traveling in a group is usually cheaper than traveling alon because of commition , so if you travel with tour guide , they usually bring you certain restaurant which give commitions to guide . for instance , my mother visited china two week ago . when she came back from the trip , she wa so angry because waiter in restraurants she visited required too many tip . in this respect , it is hard to think that traveling with a guide is a the best way to travel . to summarize , traveing alone give you many experience and allows you to visit the place where you want to go , so it is better than traveling in a group led by a tour guide . there is a saying that a jouney make people grow up . what can you learn from traveling led by a tour guide ?
