it is a controversial issue whether having travel in a group led by a tout guide is better that travel alone . some people might agree with this statement because it is cheaper and convinient with regular schduel . however a far a i am concermed i stronly belive that having a trip alon is have more advatages in that it enables one to evoid controling and to schedule by one 's intention . first of all , having a trip alone people allows them to enjoy thier free time . taravel with ldeing by a tour guid demends some rule to traveler such a when they have to wake and have a meal and it sometimes very stressful . forexample , my brother jun kim traveled japan last year whith tour guide . first , he enjoy that time because he do n't worry about his destination and time , however later the guide let him get up early and even when he waked up late the guide did n't give meal . it prof that group travel with team requiered following their controll . inaddition , individual travle let people have a chance more think about themselves . the real meaning of travle is taking a break from routin day and have a chace to reschedule . for instance , i travle to regularly alone whenever i think i need a break . last year i fired my jop so very depressed . however throug my travel ma gain my confidence and could found new jop . it is due to the individual travle whidh give me a thinking time about my past , now and future . in brief , i think tarvel with leding by a tout guide is not better than having a trip alone . first , individual trip let people avoid conroling by others . on top of that it make people take a chance to look back and reschedul about themselves .
