deceiving advertisement ? there are a number of different type of advertising . some advertisement make u believe that a product will make u look gorgeous or some try to make u believe that a certain product is simply the best available solution on the market . on the other hand there are some advertisments that simply tell u fact and figure . there are product such a lipstick or clothing where advertisments tend to overstate the quality of a certain product . when somebody look at the current h & m advertising for their new jacket he or she is usually overwhelmed . this is not because the jacket itself is of incredible quality but because of the beautiful girl who wear that jacket . this is an example of advertising which try to make a product seem better than it actually might be . and it is easy to find a lot of other example . on the other hand there are some advertisement which consist of sober information to an large extent . for example when somebody read the brochure for a certain type of expensive machinery or a car he or she will find quite a few page which simply state technical specification . i think that most advertisments try to make product seem better than they are . are the company actually abled to make people believe their advertisement though ? in case of consumer good such a clothing or car it ha proven to be very important to advertise heavily and in very emotional way . i personally do n't like advertisments filled with beautiful people and shiny product though . i usually care more about thing like price and objective quality . and if the advertiser do n't give me information on these issue i simply wo n't buy their product . the bottom line is probably that advertising ha to provide what customer care about .
