this is not an easy question because i think both point are not correct on their own . at first i think it is very important to understand the main idea and concept of a topic . this is true with no doubt . but in my opinion some main fact are essentially to get the main idea . it seems to me impossible to accept all main idea without the knowledge of some main point from the topic . for example my topic of research is quantum mechanic . in this field exist a few main idea and concept like the schroedinger equation and it interpretation . but with no fact about the topic where it is important to apply this equation you may run in trouble . the fact is that many of the interpretation will not help you in special situation . in these situation you have to know how fact to handle the problem . now one may argue , that if someone know the main idea he can look in some book and will be able to solve the problem in principle . but if you do not know further fact on the situatuation it will be possible that you have to look in hundred of book before you will find the correct solution . an other important point i want to be mentioned is the task of someone to connect different result . if you only understand the main concept of the broad topic of quantum mechanic you may not be able to connect different field of research of this main topic . to do this you have to know fact from both field . summarizing my argument i want to say that to understand main idea and concept is very important but without the main fact , which one ha to learn , you may run in a lot of trouble while you are doing special research .
