i totally agree with the statement because , to begin with , it is not useful to learn fact if you do not understand them . you would not be able to apply these concept when you need them , for example , a theory or a mathematic formula stored in your head would not be useful if you do not understand how to use it . i believe that for applying a concept in a real life case , it a must to know how to develop that concept and get the most out of it . i will support my view the following - social environment . talking about ethics in school , if a student do not know completely understand the value and the content of the course he will not be able to respect and tolerate different point of view or idea of people in the real world that can be joined with different background and experience . - professional environment . it is important for a professional that he applies all what he learnt in his career and practice every day to improve in those area needed to success in whatever responsability that demand his full performance . for example , it is not useful to learn all the economy principle if you do not know how to apply them in both the business environment and the nation environment . furthermore , this comprehension of a whole subject or theory will give the student more confidence of what he is capable of doing ; thus , improving his performance in every aspect of his life . if a student want to enrich his education in all aspect he must know how to use these concept by understanding them . i think that the best way for an student to achieve this is not only learning the fundamental of the theory , but also practicing them in in real life .
