although some people think that is more important for student to have knowledge based on fact , i think that is more valuable for them to understand idea and concept . i support this because in this way , student know a variety of topic , can use this knowledge in order to develop their own point of view and also using this idea they can develop their own concept . in the following paragraph i am going to explain this benefit and also give some example in order to explain my position . first of all , understand idea and concept is useful because student can discus a variety of topic that their teacher have transmited to them in class . for example , i remember one opportunity , i wa in my work and i had to discus about marketing and by using my knowledge about a theory that my teacher explain me i culd support my opinion . another benefit is that when you know concept , you can build up your own point of view , this mean that you evaluate different idea that you have recibed and decide what is your position . for example , when an student is learning about the difference among a variety of religion . they leanr about the philosopy of each religion and they can decide which one is better for them . moreover , using idea and concept student can develop their own concept . so , they not only evaluate information , but also create new information . this is what happens in many chemestry lab , they have the knowledge and discover new theory . as a conclusion , in my opinion is more important for learnears to understand idea an concept than learn about fact , due to the reason that i explained before . i think in the future many school will follow this method because student learn better than learning by fact .
