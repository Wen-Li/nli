when someone want to teach , the proffessor want to give student more advantage , so he want that they understand the idea and concept these are the basis of a good knowledge . concepts many of time are easier of explain than the idea . if you do not undertsand the idea you can not understand the concept or viceverse . a chemistry proffesor want that the student understand the concept ot the three state of water solid liquid , gas . these concept are very important because of wheter the student doe not undestand this , he is going to have big problem in his future . this feature of water are easier to explain because student can see the liquid state in ocean , the solid state in iceberg , and gas state can feel when they bolied water . but sometimes , it is hardest undertand idea . for example the idea that all material have small unit named atom . this part of chemistry is difficult to teach , this is something that is not material , this is abstract idea due to the student can not see the atom . however if the student understand the atom , whith this knowledge is easier that he can understand why and how the different chemical element can combined such a na and cl to form salt . understanding the idea and concept , people have a deepest knowledge and can figure out many thing only knowing the basis . because of that proffessor give a major emphasis that the student understand the idea and concept . i
