i completely agree with the statement that most advertisement make product seem much better than they really are . this is very obvious because the major intention behind the advertisement is to promote a specific product among the public . so definitely the product will be projected with high value rather than displaying what actually exist . firstly let u consider advertisement for a company x which deal with mutual fund . they highlight only the attractive benifits that can be obtained from the investment in their company . they do not portray the complete detail in the advertisement . so when a person see this kind of a attractive advertisement he is tempted to invest in such a company . let u consider the company x a a new comer and so he go bankrupt in few month . ultimately the person who invested in the company will loose his money . thus the advertisement misleads a person to invest in a wrong place the food product are yet another example where people get fooled easily by the look and the appearance of product shown in the advertisement . when a advertisement for any food stuff is displayed the product is shown with great style and attractive color . this misleads the people to buy such product and ultimately they get disappointed when they find it doe not have such good taste a shown in the advertisement . finally let u discus regarding the advertisement for garment . it is well known that when a new brand of clothes are released in the market , people easily get attracted to the newly released product . they take advantage of this common nature of people to attract them towards their product . thus they end up creating really fascinating advertisement with all attractive offer and display garment which are really attractive in their advertisement . but doe the company actually sell product with the same quality that is shown in the advertisement . no , they certainly aim at higher profit and so fool people with attractive advertisement . to conclude the advertisement definitely make product seen much better that they really are . why do business people spend so much on advertisement ? it is to show the cheap product with higher value . and surely advertisement is the most effective tool that is used to inplement this strategy .
