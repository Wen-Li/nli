that ' s a very interesting statement . i think that 's a problem we have to solve in our nowdays life . but i do n't agree with the statement when it say that young people do n't give enough time to helping their community : i think they do n't give their time at all !! today young people are not involved in the problem of their community because they do n't have time to realize what 's wrong near them . they are too much occupied by following the last music trend or to mimic one of the `` television hero '' . they are just worried about how to be trendy ; how to be fashonable and they don ' t care about anything around them . i think this phenomenon is very common in the big city : in this kind of reality is more easy to be fashonated by advertising and all the material stuff that everyday keep bombing in our head . when people grow in this atmosphere is very difficult to make change their point of view during their life . i think the situation is different in a little city where you live more closely to the society . in this kind of reality i think there are le way to escape from the everyday problem . so people are much involved to help their community and to get interested in what they are surrounded by . the `` tragedy '' is that the big city have more problem than the small one so they need more people to get involved ! they need more people to be motivated to solve some condition . i think this is one of the problem of our era : to be too much far from the society we live in and not to realize that if everyone of u give just an hour of our time to help our community this society could be better and our life too .
