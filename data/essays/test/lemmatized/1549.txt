i agree with the statement that successful people try new thing and take risk rather than only doing what they already know how to do well . in my opinion , people do feel bore by doing the same thing what they alreay know . i always try to learn to do new thing and divert my knowledge in different thing to improve my knowledge . for example scientist , always try to do new thing and implement new thougts to find out some thing new to this world . i really like their hard word and during these process they also face many risk but they wont give up their work and finallly they will acheive their goal . if people going to scare because of the risk and if they follow the same thing that they already know then they would not go ahead in their life . we have to think a bit forward in this competative world and we have to prove our self , for this we have to do some thing new without scaring for the risk . at present we are in a successful world and we are enjoying this one because of many people hard work . many scientist and many politians doing their best and introducing many thing and pollicies which were helping u to live comfortably . after learning one thing perfectly people have to learn new thing without satisfying with the single thing , then only we can able to elaborate our knowledge in different kind of field . finally i conclude that people , in any field have to learn the process of exploring new thing without satisfying with their existing knowledge , and in his process they could also face many difficult situation , many risk but they dont have to stop their work and finally they must achieve their goal and become successful people .
