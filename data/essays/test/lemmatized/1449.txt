in my mind , specifying itself on a specific subject can enables a global development . if freud had not been specified in psychology , einstein in science or bill gates in economy and data system , would our world be the same ? if nobody had wanted to specify in health care , would i be here right now ? they would not be the same result , the same impact on the world development if everybody wa working on several subject without developing them widely . specialization became part of human nature the day when we understood that everybody need each human characteristical strength to go further . development of exchange market from salt price to globalisation illustrate this phenomenon . people realize what he think it will be better , what interested it the most and what will enable some other person progressing . my personal desire is to study finance , to learn more about trade and create a firm . this will permit some employee to live , even if some problem can occur , and will allow me realizing what i desire the most . this specialization doe not imply that i 'm going to forget other subject but that i will develop a specific subject widely . we need each one specification to do a world . we must not realize all the specifities that an other person implement every day , it just going to serve u for a specific need . trade reflects very well this idea . countries try to produce good or service that can not or are difficult to be produced by another country to complete it need , and the inverse . in this way , each country increase it productivity on a defined sector and exchange with others to complete it need . even if a human dream is ubiquity , nobody can know all about everything that 's why human are specializing themselves in activity to create together a global knowledge which will satisfy everybody owing to exchange .
