yes , i agree because it is unbelieveble how many car are on our street are nowadays . especially in germanz if you heard them cry over the bad job situation . on the other hand if you see on the street you can see a lot of expensive car . i think the most important thing why there will be much le car on the street than today is that the oil and gas recurces getting more le and le every year . this is like a circle if the is not enough gas the price will be increase . if that happend le people will buy a car because it is too expensive to drive it . that will be the biggest reason why there le car in the future . the only way to stop is to find a new recurces with which car can drive , too like the bio gas or the sloar the sun energie . here is the next problem to find alternative you have to look for new techologies . that 's very expensive , too . if the poeple do n't like the new stuff zou waste a lot of money for nothing . i think a lot of company are littel bit scared to finace into new product aslong there are still the old recuces . an ohter factor is that the people have a certain life standart and thez do n't wonna leave it . it 's the same with me i have my car with some extra which can drive 250 km per hour . it 's very hard to change this life standart if you grow up with it . there are some way i had explain what could the company do to sell there car in the future but i do n't believe in it . everz companz what to make a much money a possible at the moment and i do n't think the are thinking that much about the future . .
