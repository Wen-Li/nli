in my opinion , it is more important for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact . first af all , if student can understand idea and concept it is enough to take high score on exam and student need to pas a lot of exam for along their whole life elemenetry school , undergraduate and garaduate study . they need to take standardized exam . on these kind of standardized exam ask about idea an concept so student must know them . in addiction , if the student understand concept and idea they can improve their knowledge on it and they can be successful .
