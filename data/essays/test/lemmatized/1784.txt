i think that this statement is a good interpretation of the reality . a good advertisement ha the great responsability to give the best image of the product that it is promoting . throught it , the consumer must be sure that the product that he is buying is what he need . most of the advertisement are created with this kind of goal and to fulfill it , they also don ' t tell the truth about the really nature of the product . when you see the mc donald ' s advertisement on the tv , they show you very delicious food !! everything seems to be very special and you want to taste it ! but when you go to the fast food you realize that everything is different and the food is not like in the advertisement . the product that you saw on the tv wa unreal ! the big cheesburger is not so good and the flash it ' s not so soft ! i 'm not agree with this kind of policy . i think that when you buy something , you have to be aware of what you are spending money for . i know that it 's impossible to pretend the truth cause business is business ! but at least , not to emphasize something that it 's not the best !
