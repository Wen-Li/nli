education is a very complex issue . many professor , scientist think a lot about the subject of education . how do the student learn ? what is the better way to learn and what are the most important thing to know ? the issue about the importance of idea , concept and fact is essential . some think that idea , concept are more important than fact . others think it is wrong . in my opinion , i agree with the given statement . understand idea , concept , is more important than to learn fact . facts are not sufficient to understand the world , or school matter . in my opinion , theory ha to come before practice . if student want to understand all the point of a problem , they will need idea and concept . first , fact are necessary in education , they can help to better understand , but at the beginning there is a real need of idea and theory . in chinese culture , student always learn in this way . theory then practice . i will illustrate my point of view with a more specific example . in chemistry class , student first , learn the theory , how it work , why product react like that . after , they will make some experience to verify the idea and concept already learnt . ideas and concept are really the beginning . moreover , i think that there are a base . without such a base of idea , concept , research are impossible . for instance , sustainable development . there is a theory but no real big scale application . concepts and idea allow to product fact and practice . however , in primary school , fact are essential . children learn better with fact . the teacher begin to show them a fact and child discover from this fact , concept and idea . children will not forget what they have learnt if they discover by themselves idea and concept related to the fact . so , to conclude , idea and concept come first in university and high study but are second for child .
