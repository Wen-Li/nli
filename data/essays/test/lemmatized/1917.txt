yes i do agree with the statement given . the product that are shown up in the advertisement need not not be real or they can be virtual . which can cause people to get tempted to buy them but afer that they come to know that the thing that are shown in the advertisement are just virtual to attract the customer . for instance if we take up an example of a very famous chewing gum called boomer . in that particular advertisement there is a person so called boomer man . when a group of child are in trouble , they chew this particular gum and call boomer man for help . and this boomer man appears all of a sudden and start helping the people . most of the child by watching this particular advertisement think that if they eat this chewing gum they can call boomer man so they turn up to buy this gum . this example illustrates how virtual advertisement can be . as we all know that in advertisement the product are given more care and are brushed up with all the possible extra arrangement to make them appear a good a possible . if we consider the example of a car advertisement the car is shown with the best interior design available in the advertisement which may not be possible if we wanted to buy a car in real . or else we might be charged more than it is shown in the advertisement . the most common thing we overlook or donot notice in the advertisement which make u tempt to the product shown in the advertisement and make u feel very bad when we go and plan to buy that particular product is the pharse `` * contions apply '' . this phrase make many customer confuse about the product . as the condition are not given in the advertisement the product shown in the advertisement seems to be more attractive . but wen the condition are on then the real product can be noticed .
