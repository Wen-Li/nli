today few people spend their free time to helping their community , and there are some reason that explain this situation . first of all , modern life style is the most important reason . today each person must to do many thing in their life , and there is many enjoy activity that people can make in their free time ( cinema , disco , pub , sport ) . if people spend a lot of time in this activity they have n't time to spend in community or in other few enjoy activity . another reason is that some people do n't like helping their community because they think that is not enjoyed , and that is not interesting for them . they always think that it is difficult but , it is incredible , they never ask what or how they must to do ! in my opinion spend a time to helping community is importan . people can be necessary in a differente manner and i am happy if i can help someone or i can make anythings that can be useful for the community .
