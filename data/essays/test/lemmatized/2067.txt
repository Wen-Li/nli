some people think that it is better to have a broad knozlegde of many academic subject than to specialize in one specific subject . as far i 'm concerned , i prefer the second statement , in my essay i wil begin to explain my opinion and it limit in the study and then i will discus this question in the daily life . first of all , i have a such opinion because i exactly what i want to do in my life . from the on , i learn all i can in the field and i do n't see why i 'm going to choose several different subject whereas i can focus on what i like . futhermore my field of interrest , which is biology , in very huge . so i have a lot of thing to learn if i want to know everything about it . however , this statement have some limit . indeed , if a person if not sure about what he want to do in his life , he ca n't focus on one subject because , one day he will find his way and if he wa n't in the appropriate field of study , he will be very disappointed . so to avoid this situation when you do n't know exactly what 's your way you had to choose the most general way . in the daily life it is better , of course , to have a broad knowledge on many academic subject . as a result , your are more abble to help others people such a your child . as a conclusion , i think that it better when you like something to do it even if you can be in the zrong way
