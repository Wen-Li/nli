communication and industry brings u some new concept , selling product and advertisement of these product . advertisements can be very helpful for understanding what the product is . however , usually advertisement make product seem much better than they really are . advertisements may be necessary but they can be checked by some mechanism if they reflects the reality or not . i want to give you a torch example . a seller wa standing on the corner of a street in ankara , the capital city of turkey , advertising torch which do not need any energy source like battery or electricity . i think they were all made in china and they very extremely cheap . one of them wa recharging by shaking the torch , one of them wa recharging pushing an arm on torch etc . there were three kind of torch which do not need energy source according to the seller . i brought the torch which can be recharged by shaking . that day the torch wa working properly . but one or two day later it did not work . because i understood that there is a small battery in it and it take energy from that battery and shaking the torch change nothing on energy source . when the battery dy off , the torche also doe . i gave e very simple and small example which can be ignored because of it cost . however you can see such advertisement on tv or on internet or even you can listen them on radio . you should ask for help to your friend or experienced costumer who bought that product . you should read the warranty statement of the product and if exists user manual . becuse if you read the user manual you can understand what the feature of the product are . i had mentioned about some mechanism which check advertisement are true or not . finally i will say this mechanism : trust yourself . not only on the advertisement , if you want to learn the real feature you should talk with other customer , make a little investigation . after all you can make a decision whether the advertisement say only the truth or not .
