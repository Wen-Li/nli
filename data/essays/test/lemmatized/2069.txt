i must say that i agree with the statement . the student have to understand idea and concept when they study something . i have several reason why i agree with that . if you understand the idea and concept , you can expand your acknowlege , learn the true meaning of the fact and memorize longer . i will illustrate about that in detail . first of all , you can expand your acknowlege if you understand idea and concept . for example , here is an word , ` outdoor ' . when i wa middle school , i just memorize the meaning of the fact . however , if you understand the concept of each word. ` out ' and ` door ' , the word , ` out ' mean outside of home and another word , ` door ' mean home or inside , you can expand the word outgoing , outsider and something like that . you just understand the each concept of word and then you can also understand other word that ha similar pattern . second , when you try to understand idea and concept , you study much more a lot . that will simply be explained because just learning fact is easy . however , it is really hard to understand the inside meaning of the fact . you have to look up the internet or book at the library . that mean you should do researh more on that and also you can learn more . through the this time , you can exactly know the fact . finally , you can keep something that you learned much longer in your brain . through doing research on it , you may look the fact many time and ponder on it . these thing make you think and last something you learned . in conclusion , i totally agree with the statement that it is more important for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact . as i mentioned , the reason are that expanding your knowlege , learning the true meaning of the fact and keeping the knowlege longer . i really want student to study and understand idea and concept when they study . if you do that , i 'm sure you will be more logical person .
