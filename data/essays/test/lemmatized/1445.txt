i agree with the statement that it is more important for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact . three reason will be explained for this agreement . firstly , everything is changing at any time and any place . the fact that student learn at this time may be different after a certain time , or if the condition are changed . a good example will be weighing an object . as we know , the mass of an object will not change , while the weight will be different at different place a the different effect of gravity . assuming one weighs himself or herself in egypt and finland , the result can be surprised . if he or she know the different effective factor of gravity , it will no longer be a surprise to `` changing the weight so much at different place '' . moreover , the idea and concept are the basic principle that we can apply to many other system or condition . for instance , the copper-aluminum alloy with the same composition vary much from each other in their property of hardness under different treatment , but the strengthen principle is the same . the hardness of one alloy can reach a high a 120 after annealing at 600k for 10 hour , which is taught by a teacher in the class . then , what will be the situation if the temperature change to 400k ? obviously , it will not be 120 . the student can only use the idea or concept of strengthen to solve this problem and get the right answer . additionally , it is much easier for u to remember the knowledge by understanding their idea and concept than by just reciting the fact . as our brain can only stor limited contains , there will be too many thing for u to remember . if we can tell how one thing work , we can also tell how other thing work , which mean we can remember a series of fact instead of one . for all these three reason , i strongly recommand that every student need to understand the idea and concept that you learn from your professor or classmate or other resource , rather than just to repeat what you get .
