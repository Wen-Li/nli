sometimes my friend from univeristy and me do have a discussion about the best way of learning . a frequent mentioned topic is the question if it is more important for a student to understand the general idea and concept than it is for them to simply learn fact . on view on this topic is , that a student is only able to talk and think about a certain subject if he ha the necessary backgroung knowledge , which consists of basic fact . to give an example i could mention the historical topic of the second world war . how would a person talk about this topic , if he lack completely the most important fact like who wa involved in the war , when it started , when it ended . .. therefore one could argue that student first have to be taught about the basic detail of the subject they study , before they can go on and study about the main idea and concept behind this subject . another view on this express rather the need of a student to understand the theoretical concept and idea of his field of study because this will provide him with an overall understanding of the topic . in addition he will have a deeper understanding of the whole subject , which he can later perfectionate by reducing his lack of factual knowledge . the knowledge of the concept will also make him able to analyze and calssify new topic more easily , because he know the mechanism and role of the overall subject and he know which detail have to be obeserved more carefully . a short look on student of political science can contribute to this point of view : political science student first learn to classify a political system by learning about the most important element of political system and the different structure these system can have . after knowing about these different stuctures a student is able to analyze and categorize every single political system in the world even though he doe n't know the detail and all the fact about it . i personally think that everybody should get a adequate knowledge with the main fact of many different field in school so that he will be able to first start his study by learning about the concept and idea behind a ceratin area and not ba learning fact . facts can later always be added by
