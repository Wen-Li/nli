we know a saying that `` getting a idea , getting three fact '' in the china . the idea and concept are the core of the fact . we can learn more and more fact by the idea and concept . so to the learning fact , i prefer the understanding idea and concept . firstly , the idea and concept are the core under the surface fact . for example , we know the cloud can brings u rain , also you can find the water dropping from the leaf in the moring . how could we relate them . if we undersand the concept that either the rain from the cloud or the water in the leaf are the some . both of them are the result of the cold tempture making the water occuring . if we get this idea , we can remeber fact for ever and never to make mistake secondly , if we understand the idea and the concept , we could learn fact easily and fast than we only get the fact . while you know the heavy and small object have same speed when they fall from the high place and the object is moveing more fast on the smooth surface than on the rough surface . and further more , if you get the idea and concept of the thing that they have the same idea , the force law , you can tell you friend easily and fast how the object move in the world for you have the core which make you to undersand the same topic fact . in addtion , should we only learn the idea and concept ? i don not think so . the learning fact can help u understand the idea and concept more better . we can think the idea deeply when we use the idea to tell why the fact is this . in conclusion , it is more important for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact . but at the same time , we shoud use the fact to test if we fully understand the idea .
