it is an undeniable fact that increasing number of thing are available and therefore we need to learn those thing in order to widen our knowledge . however although it is important for student to understand the concept , i personally believe that it is much more important to learn fact rather than concept for the following reason . thus i partly disagree with the statement . first of all , without knowing the fact , we might make a wrong decision . there are various of incident are happening nowadays and we need to know them in order to plan thing well . when i am watching news , i realised there are so many thing are happening everyday . those fact will change our behaviour . secondly , although understanding idea is a important aspect for u , learning fact will change our behaviour . when i am applying univerisity i need to know how good the univeristy is . i do not need to know the idea of the uiverisity . as a result o however , on the the hand , learning different kind of idea can widen our knowledge . sometimes if i do not have any idea i can not do thing well . for example , when i am studying psychology i need to know the idea of the study rather then that fact . in conclusion , even though it is essential to understand different idea , i personally think that learning fact are more important . moreover , the fact are actually happen so it need to know about it .
