there is a debate on whether it is more important for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact . some people say that learning fact is basic step of process such a studying . however , i agree that it is more important for student to understand idea and concept . first , if student understand anything , student naturally would know fact . second , learning fact is limited that fact is not absolute and changeble . i will explain these reason in detail . first , if student understand anything , student naturally would know fact . in general , student is not understood the fact and they are not memorize concept and not solve the problem . let me take my experience for example . when i wa first year of university , i wa a member of club which is studying computer structure . naturally , i understood computer idea and concept . my senior always said `` do understand . '' so , i took the class of computer structure , i did not a lot of studying but my grade wa a+. for these reason , i think that understanding idea and concept is very important . second , learning fact is limited that fact is not absolute and changeble . the recent survey show that comparing class of understanding idea with class of learning fact . the 74 % of woman and 85 % of men prefer understanding class . after take the class , content of class is changing and take the class , again . result of second survey is changing . both of them , around 90 % , prefer to understanding class than learning fact . this is because people who take the understanding concept and idea class not hesitate fact . but , learning fact as a result , it is more important for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact for these reason . first , if student understand anything , student naturally would know fact . second , learning fact is limited that fact is not absolute and changeble .
