yes really i agree with this argument the medium is the main reason for this problem . hence the telivision show and paper advisiments are doing their business for their commercial reason . any one can go and advatise his product in telivision program by giving money . the manager wont see the quality of the product and he advatises in his channel . my personel experience on this is once i am thinking to buy a refrigator . and i am thinking of which brand to take at that time i am watching the television in that the advisiment came on the refrigator . i watched it and byed that refrigator withen one month it got repaired there is no warranty for that brand . simpley by this advisement daily nooff people are getting tefted by the dealer . in my view government should only rectify this problem by keeping some strict rule for advising . the rule must be like this . government should keep some grading to the product , the product must be checked by highley trained proffisionls , then only the product must be released into the market . government should also give grading to compinies , and also any advitisiment which is been viewd in telision or printed in news paper must be registred . then only it ha to be viewd or printed in paper . by this process the product see better than the advisiment . lastly in my view i really agree with this question .
