i partly agree with the statement , that young people do not spend enough time to helping their community . from my personal experience i know , that there are lot of young people engaged in working in their community . i grew up in a catholic community where i spent a few year on voluntarily looking after child in weekly group meeting or even multiweek holiday . i think there would be even more people getting involved into community life , but there are just too many other activites you could take part in . many parent try to push their child too hard to achieve reward or to get trained in certain area ; this might range from sport club to music lesson . therefore they might have little time or little interest of spending even more time on extracurricular activity . apart from that , there is an increasing number of child who spend most of their time with playing video game , surfing the internet or watching tv . additionally , there are those people you who do not see the point of getting involved in community life : firstly , your are not rewarded with money or mark to do so . secondly , working with people from all walk of life can be difficult and sometimes even hard work . at last , there are people who work after school or work to maintain a better income or an income at all . so choosing to work voluntarily in your community might not give you a direct benefit . therefore i agree with the statement above , but it need to be mentioned , that it got a lot harder nowadays to choose from the variety of activites on offer . i think it is benefically to your personality and even your cv , because spending time in your community might reward yuou with so called `` soft skill | , you might need in later life .
