it is quite a widespread opinion that our western society are becoming more and more self-centered . that thesis of course extends to the youth , making it neccesary to ask oneself whether it is true or not that young people are not engaged enough in helping their community . it is possible to find some evidence that the comitment of young people to their community significantly diminushed over the past decade , but that this may be due to a shifting in the definition young people have of `` their '' community . it can not be denied that young people seems to be le integrated in the community than they used to . young people , at least in the european country i know , are not often to be seen in religious manifestation : that is an evidence that the feeling of membership in a religious community is way weaker than he wa for 50 year , leading to a reduced amount of time given to support this community . moreover , it seems to me that people , especially young people , value more an more the time they have for them own , so they are more and more reluctant to give him , for any cause . this could be seen a a consequence of our way of living , that give an huge value to leisure , but it could also be linked that a large proportion of young people are doing study that require a significant amount of working time at home . even if those fact tend to argue in favour of a desafection of young people from their community , it can not be overseen that young people sometimes give large amount of time for none traditional `` community '' , that absorb the time that would have been devoted to other community for a few decade . for example , the non-profit humanitary organization have a large prportion of young member ; the student association are more active than ever . this trend to chose one 's `` community '' rather than to adhere to a traditional one can be quite dangerous : it is an explanation of the recent increase in number and power of the gang . to put it in a nutshell , it 's not true that young people do n't want to spend time for a community , but they do it for a community they have chosen rather than the traditional one
