personally , i agree with statement that most advertisement make product seem much better that they really are . the reason for my opinion are several and i will attempt to explain some by mean of example contained in the subsequent part of my essay . in general , the main purpose for an advertisement is to promote a brand or selling the particular product featured therein . this motive might prompt the need to portrait a product in a way that will make it more suitable to customer ' interest . in fact , it is not unusual to note that advertisement set a product in an ideal environment or situation . various advertisement employ notorious figure , for example a well know actor or sportsman , in order to put forward a positive image of a particular brand or product . the host will naturally inspire confidence in the particular product and thus facilitate it purchaise . rarely such advertisement focus more specifically on the feature of the product , because the customer ' interest ha been already solicited by the host . the format of an advertisement can also be used in order to solicit the perstective customer 's attention or interest . a simple example could be that of a tv advertisement featuring an anti-age cream , showing in rapid sequence the alleged beneficial effect deriving from the long term use of such cream without pairing it with a objective assessment , scientific or medical a it might be , of the effective benefit deriving from the use of the cream . in addition , advertisement might also specifically target certain area of the population or age group . an example in this sense could be that of a car portraied a being particularly fast and fashionable , thus attracting the interest of young people , while avoiding to focus on the vehicle 's cost or possible inefficiency . for these reason i am of the opinion that advertisement make product seem much better than they really are .
