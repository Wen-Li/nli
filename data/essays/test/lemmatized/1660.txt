in my view , i think that advertisement are always make product seem much better and more benefical than they really are . first of all , what advertisement really want is to show the importance and the effect of their product in peopl 's life so they can sell it easily to them . sometimes they may lie to their customer just to let them buy it a quickly a they can . it 's like a great movie that they show the most beautiful sceans and forget about the rest of it . therefore , advertisement will display what is good and positive about their product and put everthing is bad and negative a side so buyer will not figure it out until they try it by themselves . moreover , advertisement are carrying about the money and the profit of their product more than the product it self . in addition , they dont care that much about the people need or what they really want . thus , they will focus more often on their product profit than it benefit . in conclusion , advertisement are a way to earn some money even when it 's wrong and untrue .
