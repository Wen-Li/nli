i disagree with the statement . indeed , advertisement make product seem better than they really are because it is the purpose of the advertisement , but i think , for most people , they do n't seem `` much '' better than the reality . first , advertisement today emphasize more on their good image than the capacity or function themselves . for example , an avertisement of shampoo which show that a famous actress use it improve their image but do n't indicate the function is much better than other one . an dvertisement of soft drink show just image of cool feeling but it do n't say it is much better . secondly , most advertisement ca n't make product much better than they really are because most poeple know that most advertisement include exaggeration . for example , even if an advertisement of an airline show that a man on a first class seat sleep well , poeple do n't mislead because people know that the noise of airplane and the fact that few people can afford to buy ticket of first class . for example of shampoo above , most lady know they can not be a beautiful and charming a the actress even if they use the shampoo . moreover , consumer can get more information on the internet directly from other consumer nowadays . they are no longer ripped off . third , here in japan , the law forbids false advertisement including too much exaggeration and too misleading expression . i think it is the same in many other country . the japanese government became more concerned about protecting consumer . recently , the director of the company which make the false advertisement showing that everyone can easily their weight by their suppliments . the people demand company moral about advertisement more rigorously than the past . that ' why i disagree the statement .
