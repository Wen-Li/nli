in my opinion , i am agree with this statment , because i think that if do not try to made new thing you will never learn to make new thing . some time when you make something by the first time the most probable is that it do not will be a good work or will be a you want , and you will have to do in a better way the next time and you will be learning many new thing and will obtine new experience . for example , i from quetzaltenango , and i live ther all my life , but some day i have to drive to guatemala city , and i never drive here , and i do not know this place very good and the fisrt time i wa lost , and i do not know where i wa , but the experience of drive many time here you will go learning new place , and the same is with all , for example , i work fixing computer but the fir time that i made it almost burn a computer , but the experience that i have now is a lot , and in cluse i can repair that in a few minuts ; but if you only made only one thing , the most probable is that you will made it very well , but you can not do any thing more , and is important thath you know many thing , because for example if in your house the tub in your bathroom is not work , you will call at the person that will repair that , but if you know some thing about it , but you can not rapair that because you do not have time , you can leave the work at this person and you are sure that he will do a good work because you know what it ha and what happen with that . in conclusion , i am agree with the statment `` successful people try new thing and take tisk rather than only doing what they alredy know how to do well '' because it help you to be a better person , and if you take risk in your life you will take experience in many thing , and if you do something wrong , you will know that the next time you will not do it again or you will do it in a diferent way .
