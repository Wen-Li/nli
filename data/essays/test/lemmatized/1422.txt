one could think that in the future the using of car will be increased , because people today become more and more lazy , so they buy car and they drive whenever they are able to take the car . and there defenitly are people with that opinion , but the prize will increase also , so not everybody will able to drive by car the whole day . so my opinion is that i agree with the statement that there will be fewer car in use . in addition i think there will be law about driving everytime because the gas which is coming out of car is disturbing the nature . politicians nowadays are discussing that problem and they are talking about a law that forbids the using of car on sunday . furthermore the standart at train and bus is getting more and more secure , comfortable , faster and flexible so there will be many people who decide to take the bus or train instead of an expensive car . although it is not really cheap it is cheaper than buying more and more oil for the car . another solution for that problem is that many people will build up driving-communities to divide their cost with other people . i also think that the number of people who experience the result of the gas of the car will grow . there will be more and more people who will die in fact of getting cancer or else . so there will be more and more people , who decide to `` forget '' their car , too . i am a perfect example ! i started to learn for my driving lisence but now i do not want to get it anylonger because it is too expensive so i continue driving by bus or by train , not only in fact of the cost , but also because it is often faster because i can not get into a trafic jam . to summerize my thought i finally say that i agree with the fact that in twenty year there will be fewer car in use than there are today .
