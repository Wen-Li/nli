i will be discussing the statement under the business 's umberlla . i , personally , agree with the stated statement which say that successful people try new experience and take risk . i think that not all successful people are risk taker , but taking risky thing might be a very good idea to start business . no one know for sure that his or her business will be a successful one , but a person , of course , will know after being involved in business world . most of businesspoeple had encounter difficulty at the beginning of their business . they would not be successful if they had not take the advantage of taking risk . for example , a a personal one , my father started his work in the field of real state eventhough his expertise wa in software programming . so , he took the risk and made his personal dream to be a business person . he ha been working in real state for thirty year and he owns some house and land . trying new thing is also a very beneficial in business world . for example , the youtube founder were not sure that their web page would be that success . at first , they thought that the web page would not grap people 's attention because it wa a new idea in that time . after it using growth among people , google corp. paid more than $ 1 billion dollar to the founder . this prof that trying new thing might be a key to be a successful person . therefore , trying new thing and take risk in busniess world are sometimes a very winning equation .
