different people have different opinion about whether traveling in a group is better or not . in my opinion , traveling alone is better because i think the flexibility is one of the most important factor in travel , and we can remember the travel longer if we travel alone . first , traveling alone give you flexibility . when you travel in a group , you have to keep up with a schedule and keep the pace of the group . however , if you travel alone , you can plan your own schedule and go to every place where you want to go . when i traveled europe , i wa in a tour group . i had to move on the fixed schedule , and the tour guide forced me not to escape the group because of safety . i wa very uncomfortable because i wanted to go to ordinary area in the foreign country , and watch their daily life . however , i had to visit only familier place due to the fixed schedule . if i can travel europe again , i will not join a tour group because i want to visit whereever i want to travel without any interference . also , traveling alone provides u with longer-lasting memory . traveling in a group give you only passive knowledge . if you go on a trip with a tour guide , the tour guide always say what the artifact mean and why it is valuable historically during the travel . nevertheless , when you come back home country , you will recognize that you can not remember some part or even whole of the tour guide 's explainations because you do not make any effort on the travel . in contrast to this case , if you prepare for the travel by only yourself , you should choose the artifact or relic that you want to watch , and find the way to get to the destination before you begin traveling . of course , this preparation is hard due to lack of expertise , but you will not forget your effort even in the future . thus , i believe that longer-lasting memory can be gained only through such personal effort . taking all those into consideration , i think that traveling alone is a better way in term of flexibility and long-lasting memory .
