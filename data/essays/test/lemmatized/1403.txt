i disagree with the statement mentioned . you should not compare helping in the community and helping in the family . in former time it wa tradition that the child live together with their parent and grandparent and they helped each other . today it is not like this anymore and therefore many people think that this generation doe n't care about social life . this is not true , because there had been never so many organization in the world which help depressed country or transfer money to disabel person or spend money for the reaserch of method against cancer . this show that the people nowadays are interested in helping other people . perhaps it seems that young people are not so interested in the community because they look more to the problem of the whole world and not only on the problem in their city . this ca n't be seen a a negative point , instead it is a positive achievement due to the globalization of help . additionally , i know many people who work in organization or elderly home to help there for no money . people who have no time to help personally because they have to much work to do by their own , mostly spend money to those organization i mentioned above . another point that emphezis this opinion is that nowadays the boy prefer to do a sozial year instead to go to the military a year . today the boy can choose if they want to work in a sozial organization like elderly home or hospital or to go to the military . i knew more boy who prefer to help other people , although this type of work is harder and although this is more work than to go to the military . thus , it can be seen that there are many people who give enough time to helping not just their community , they want to help out by problem which occures over the whole world .
