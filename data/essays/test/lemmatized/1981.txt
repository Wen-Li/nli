advertisements usually look for way to sell their product without concerning if what the are using is a true fact or not . in real life , it is true that people often use any mechanism they can find just to get what they want , without usually caring about the consecuences behind their action . i do agree with the statement that say that advertisments make product seem much better than they really are . when it come to selling a product , advertiser look for the best way to make that product look . even if the product ha a defect on it , they always try to find something good of it . obviously , adverstisers will not accept that a product ha a defect on it , because people will not buy it , so they will always sell their product a the best thing people have created . for example , commercial present the product that is trying to sell a to be better than other product . people watching the commercial always think the best about the product presented and buy it without having in mind that what is said in the commercial may not be 100 % true . it ha happened that after the person buy the product , he realizes it is not `` the best thing created '' but unfortunetely , they can not do anything about it . practically , advertiser tricked the person into buying a fake product . although advertiser make product seem much better than they really are , however , if advertiser do not present their product this way , people will not buy them , and advertiser will not acheive success in their work . in these day , there exit a lot of competition among worker from similar area . people have to make radical decision and do whatever they can to gain success . anyone who doe not make an effort in his work , will not be prosperous in it . what need to be done , need to be done , but it should be done right : finding the best way without leaving behind one 's moral value . the best way to do this is making a product right , if a product come with a defect , is best if it is not selled . advertisers should present their product in a good way so that people buy them . they should look for the best thing in it , without lying and making them seem better than they really are .
