i agree with statement `` the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide '' . for example , you went to egypt to explore the beauty of the pyramid . and with you , you have a book which contains the information about the pyramid and the history of them . and you go and explore the whole place all alone . now you are missing very important information like where all the mummy are buried and exactly the whole story . even though they are stated in the book unless shown in real you can not have a nice experience . taking a real life example , i once went to see the belaum cave in india with a friend of mine and began to explore the cave and we began our tour all alone and saw what ever came in our way and kept admiring the beauty of the cave and after seven hour we completely saw the cave and returned to our room in a hotel and i accidentally overheard people talking about the interesting thing about the cave like the miracle that happened in the cave due to the constant flow of water and the mark done on the wall by the water and then i dont remember seeing all that told by them . and the next day i again went to the cave with the rest of the tourist led by a tour guide . as the guide wa telling all the important thing about that place then i began to notice all the thing and also saw the marking done by water and a huge stone cut beautifully in a nice shape which i thought wa done by a man when i went with my friend but wa actually cut by the constant flow of water a told by the guide . if i had no tour guide accompanying me i would have definitely thought that those marking and beautifully cut rock wa human made . and the whole place wa shown to u in just four hour which ha previously taken me seven hour . from then onwards when ever i go to explore a new place i would hire a tour guide and make him lead my way . after all , the expert know everything . so , it is always good to have a tour guide guide you in a new place instead you leading your own way so that you will never miss out the beauty of the place and get to know the amazing thing about that place a the tour guide know much about that place and can guide you through place or thing which otherwise you would have missed out .
