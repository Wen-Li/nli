in it first period advertisement wa about introducing the product or giving the needed information on the product . with the competition in the business and the recently developed way of communication and the information that scientist gathered on how the brain work and how to affect the brain ; advertisement became the art of influencing the buyer . in 1930 ' , the idea that the `` need is created '' ha been introduced by frankfurt school-a neo-marxist school in germany - . it meant that not only the product wa misrepresented ( in a better way of course ) , but altough people did not need that particular product , marketer made them believe that they needed to buy it . for these purpose , psychology and neuro-sciences is used to get to know people ' buying habit . these day , marketer are writing book on how to deceive buyer , how to create an `` image '' of the product , so that the emotional reflection of the product will be similar to the emotional reflection of the buyer . in this context , there is no meaning of saying that advertisement show the product a they are just like that it is a fair observation . as an example , we can use important brand such a mcdonalds or coca-cola company . mcdonalds empasises in their advertisement the healty food , the friendlyness in their restaurant and the delicous taste of their burger . taste is personal , but just a few year ago a documentary movie proved that their food wa not healty , contrarily it wa really noxious . let 's take coica-cola company , their product is also noxious , but they emphasise the feeling like liberty or freshness during their advertisemnets . this stress on feeling is the result of another thesis in neuro-science : it is believed that remidnng feeling is important in order to draw attention to the product . this examles show that even recent development in the science is used by the advertiser ( marketer vagualy ) in order to create a false concept about the product and to disguise it ' negative side .
