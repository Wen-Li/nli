in response to the question , i strongly agree with the opinion that it is important for student to learn fact than it is for them to understand idea and concept . there are several reason that you would be satisfied . some people say that imagining thing is good for child , and i can understand what they refer to , but i think that body action is better for them to memorize thing . for example , when you have to study for the exam , there are two type of people . first , some people just learn in their hears vocablary , and second , others try to repeat writing what they should memorize . i always do a second method . also , learning fact is good for people 's future because child can learn good manner such a how to eat a meal correctly , or how to respect senior . i guess that most people learned manner with body action by their parent , and parent did the same thing by their parent . manner might not be imagined in the brain , so we have to imitate what parent do . in the conclusion , i agree that it is important for student to learn fact , and child have to know why understanding idea and concept is not better than that .
