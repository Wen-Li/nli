i strongly agree to this statement that it is more importang for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact . this may be supported through several idea and point . firstly , understood idea and concept are a much more reliable and useful type of knowledge rather than memorised fact . having spent my school life in two very different country ; japan and australia , i have experienced both way of learning . an effective example of this would be the way science wa taught . in japan , we were expected to memorise all the scientific terminology and definition of key term . the exam were focused on how much information student were able to memorise from the text book rather than how much they could understand and develop . at my current school in australia , the teacher expect u to understand concept and develop them in our own way . the exam are frequently based on basic concept that were taught in class and how we can adopt that to a situation in real life or a new scenario provided . i find that the knowledge i have gained at my australian school ha been more useful in real life and make sense , whereas the information i learnt by memorising never made complete sense to me , or connect with the other fact i knew . in addition , i think that idea and concept that are once understood are more difficult to forget . memorising can be an effective way of studying in the short term , but these fact are often forgotten in a short period of time and it is unlikely that student will be able to remember those fact in the future . opposed to this , understood fact enables student to develop their own idea based on them and expand their knowledge . also , a these form of knowledge will not be forgotten easily even after a long period of time , it make it easier for student to link what they have learnt in their previous year of study with what they are studying in their later year of study . although learning and understanding idea and concept are more important , i think that learning fact still play an important role in gaining knowledge . no matter how well the concept is understood , if the key term or relative definition are not memorised , it make it difficult for the student to demonstrate his knowledge or convey his idea based on them . thus , i think that a minimum amount education should focus on making student learn fact by memorising . in conclusion , although i agree to the statement that it is more important for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact , i can not deny that learning fact also play a significant role in studying a well . they each cover different type of information and thus is benefitial in different way . therefore , i reccomend that education should be primarily based on enabling student to understand concept and idea but also it is required for a minimum amount of some basic definition and terminology to be learnt by making student memorise them .
