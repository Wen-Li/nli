when it come to knowledge , some people presume that it is better to have specific knowledge in own subject to accumlate detail . in contrast , i think that to have broad knowledge of many academic subject is more heplful in our life . broad knowledge give u not only having wide overview to look at the world , but also helping study many kind of academic easliy . we need to have broad knowledge for two reason . first of all , a lot of background knowledge may lead u to look at a world with wider and various view . to know huge knowldge of many academic help to have abundant commonsense in a world news . for instance , when we watch a news at night , it is really hard to totally understand about accident or problem that who ha only knowledge of own major subject because of swallow commonsense . second , to know broad knowledge is so advantage of studying many academic . because almost academic are related and connected , so if we understand about many kind of academic subject , it will be aid for understanding easily . for instance , i am major in broadcasting and journalism . during vacation , i study various field of academis because of applying for broadcating company . and it really help for me to study and participate on selcetive academic which is not required . journalism is related about every academic such a politics , management , business so on . to have broad knowledge ha many benefit for living in a world . old people always say that ` knowing is a medicine ' . it totally correct . to know broad and wide knowledge of many academic subject is good medicine for all of u . becuase it give to u varity background to see a wide world and think more deeply to our own mind .
