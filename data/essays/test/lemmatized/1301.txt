i totally agree with the following statement that state that all successful people try new thing and take rick rather than doing what they already know how to do well . well this statement totally correct because every person who start from the bottom , or let say who start from scratch and became successful with it will eventually get board of it and will want to start something new . in my point of view he will be showing his friend that he is a very successful man am a challenging person who is not affraid of trying new stuff . taking the risk of doing something new it need a successful strong person to do it and accomplish it . to be successful in all the field you must start from scratch and start growing up . start going to the new business and to a new field . while , not taking the risk and opening a new business and staying on the field that you are worokingon for your whole life in wont take you anywhere you may still be a successful man , but in your on field where you cant go and do business with the people that are more successful than you . to prove that you are successful in your life and your business you must take and do some risk in your life to prove to yourself that you can do it , that you are up to it , and not being affraid to lose it . just the feeling that you have for knowing that you are up to it and you can do it , will definitly make you do it no matter what is in your way you 'll end up doing it and being a well-successful man in all the field . standing at place where you are well at doing at not moving forword will not help you to become a successful man .
