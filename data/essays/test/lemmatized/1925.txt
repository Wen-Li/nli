first of all , we need to explain what an advertisement is . an advert is a manner to communicate about a product by using different type of medias to express what you want to tell about the product . when you create an advertisement you inform the people about your product , you show it and explain why it is better than the others . by doing all of these thing you want to convince people and make them buy your product . i agree with the statement because i think that an advert should give a product the best opportunity to be purchased , and in that way the advert should give only the good point and create a good atmosphere in order to make the people buy it . firstly , an advertisement should highlight a product , by showing the good aspect of it [ and certainly not showing the bad side ] . it is made in a manner to bring people think that the product is the best . this is not objective , so people only see the best side and will sometimes forget the bad side of the product and in that way see the product better than it really is . secondly , an advert creates a particular atmosphere around the product , this atmosphere should help the potential buyer to adhere to the image of the product and identify themselve to the product . if they adhere to this atmosphere they will think that they need to purchase the product , even if they do n't need it all ! in that sense the atmosphere make the product better to the eye of the buyer . thirdly , i think that even if the product seems better than it really is due to the advert , an advert should never tell lie . nowadays , people are getting more and more aware about the marketing technique used to make people buy . in that way you should be very careful when making an advert on what particular aspect of the product you want to highlight and which atmosphere you choose . if you are too optimistic about your product , people can have information over the internet an that mean that the more time go on , the more the people have the impression that marketing people try to lie to them . so a a conclusion , i said that in lot of advertisement , the product seem much better than they really are because of the technique used to enlight the product . but it is important to contrast this statement with the fact that nowadays , people now how communication is working and in that way , advertisement should in my opinion become more objective ( that also depend of which product you are advertising about ) .
