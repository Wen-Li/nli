in my country , korea , student are busy memorizing all the number and other specific information . it is , however , now changing and people give more credit on creativity because creativity is necessary to succeed in the global society . for creativity they should have open-mindedness and for this , student should know the idea rahter than fact . i agree that it is more important to get the idea of concept that to memorize fact , because idea result to innovation , and they can be remembered for a long time . nowadays , it is a global trend of education to try to make student more creative . they stimulate child 's imagination and make them become more innovative . in order to do this they teach general idea and background knowledge that would be fundamental for further imagination . edison wa n't an well educated man , but still , he could invent more than 1,000 invention . he thought if he would be able to transform sound into physical form , and this made the phonograph . he did n't know specific detail but he had some basic knowledge for creativity . he had the concept of what he should do . moreover , he found out fact , and did n't learn them . facts such a number or year are easily forgotten unless it 's repeatedly memorized . whereas idea stay in the memory much longer . for long term consequence , it would be better to know the general concept not the specific fact . the fact can be found through researching , instantly through the internet , a long a you know the what you should look for , which is the idea . once , i had an important math test . i tried to memorize all the equation which wa nearly impossible unless i 'm an i.q. elevated person . instead of that , i tried to know the concept , not the fact for a few day before the test . during the test , i could find out the fact a solving the problem , understand how those equation came out more detailed and also recall them longer that the other time when i tried to memorize the specific detail , through my experience , to know the idea seems better . knowing the concept is the same a being able to see an entire maze and knowing the fact is the same a just looking at a wall . to come out , you should be able to see the whole not a part . as far a i 'm concerned , i believe that to have the knowledge of the idea would be more beneficial .
