yes i agree with the statement `` successful people try new thing and take risk rather than only doing what they already know how well to do well '' . here i would like to discus about few great people in connection to this statement . let u take an example in the field of science & technology , the graham bell who is invented the telephone if he were not taken the risk of inventing the telephone we could not have been able to communicate and the field of communication could not have been so easy , it all depended on the amount of risk and time he dedicated we have the telephone now . let u talk about sir edmund hillary if he were not taken the risk of climbing the mt everest in himallays , we could have not known the height of these mountain because he ha taken such a risk now we now what is the height of it . even in the feild of serving we have the mother theresa who stand a a symboll of serving humanity she risked her life came from europe to india just for helping the poor and needy in the strange and total different situation she ha shown the world that without taking risk there can not be success . the people do get success in bussiness only after having taken some risk without that he can not have success . if a child doe not take a risk in standing fearing that he will fall , if he doe not doe such an action he can never stand and what to speak of runing or walking , so there is risk in all our daily activity also if we are scared of them we can not have success , and people get successful only after taking risk .
