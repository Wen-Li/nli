i do agree with the given statement due to the following reason . the word ` advertisement ' ha become self-explanatory . it basically stand for promoting a product or a service by emphasizing or in this case over-emphasizing on it good characteristic . the advertisement are primarily to help to attract the comsumers and to increase the sale of the product or service . for this the people usually happen to exaggerate a lot and try to manipulate the comsumers ' thought process . the main motive is to show the product in a good light and to make it woo the comsumer into buying it . many a time this may work but it may also make the product look unattractive at time . for example considering the current advertisement for the beauty and fairness cream . you are shown a girl who is very dark and soon a she applies this particular cream , she becomes a fair a milk in a week . these are not acceptable to the consumer a they claim to totally change the skin tone of a person . how is it possible for a girl to become fair in a week time if she happens to be wheatish for the last twenty year ? a sensible person would always know what the truth is . at time these advertisement happen to exaggerate to such an extent that they feel unrealistic . take the case of the advertisement for slimming product . one day you are this fat , obese individual weighing around 200 pound , and a soon a you start using one of these product , you will be around 130 pound in a fortnight . considering that these product may be effective but how do you explain their claim of helping a person slim down so soon . still many desperate people do buy such product and later realise that they made a faux pa . these advertisement should instead be more real and show the product a they are meant to be . the feel good factor should always be there but it should not be blown out of proportion .
