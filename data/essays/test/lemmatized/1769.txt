i think everyone could be `` the world 's master '' , or at least he ha the quality to gain that title . what is the meaning of this phrase ? it is easy : i think people often give up for varied reason . sometimes there are no way to overcome the difficulty , sometimes they have fear and create a lot of thoughs to justify themselves the absence of try . often men need a justification . for instance , now i am fighting to realize a dream . it is the same reason why i am here now , answering this question : i need toefl certificate for sending the application form to chalmers university in sweden . yes , it could seem easier to rest here in italy , with my habit , the italian typical food , the brilliant sun and so on . .. but at chalmers there is the master 's programme of my dream : `` bioinformatics and systems biology '' . the laboratory , the subject and the teaching way i would find there are impossible to find in italy . and the snow , the long artic night , will be not so terrible , al least i hope . now i am trying . .. i think there is a bit of bravery in everyone . .. but we need to find it . i am so resoluted because year ago , after my high school degree i made a big mistake . i did not try the admission test for medical faculty : that summer wa terrible , my dear aunt wa dying and so i did not want to live in future other similar situation in hospital with an ill man/woman and his/her family . so i decided to attend telecommunication engineering faculty . after three year , my medical interest came back and the unique possibility to do not loose the exam i have done wa to change to biomedical engineering . step by step i am correcting my mistake and i am putting my life on the way i desire . if it is right or not i do not know , but i will check , you can be sure of this .
