travelling is one of the main source through which we can replenish our feeling . the best way to travel is to travel with a group and also led by a tour guide . travelling and visiting new place is the best recreation time for anyone . and so it should be justified with endless fun and entertainment . this is the reason which pose a condition on the way we travel . travelling to place alone doe not make the right sense of enjoyment . i would like to explain the reason for my opinion in detail . to start off when we visit place with a group we get to know more people and thier behaviour , thier lifestyle , thier like and dislike . this make the best time pas in travelling in a group . also we need to learn a lot about the outside world which is possible only when we travel within a group . at time of rest or liesure many game will be conducted and lot of competetions are put forward which are the ultimate source of fun and entertainment . also a tour guide play an important role in such tour . without the guidence of a tour guide we may not know all the best place which are worthwhile of visiting . a tour guide give a lot of information about the place we visit which includes the detail of the place 's history . as such we gain knowledge about the famous people involved in the construction and development of the monument . in most of the tour , those involving water and greenery give u immense pleasure . the sight of such place create deep impression on our heart . one such place is the kodai canal . thus i would like to conclude that travelling in a group with a tour guide give u the most valuable experience which remains everlasting in our memory .
