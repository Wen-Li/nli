in my opinion i think that successfull people try new thing or take risk rather than only doing what they already know how to do well is correct . people they are rich or have a good reputation , have a big selfconfedent . so it is easier for them to try new thing and take maybe risk . i think they have the money and if they loose somthing , by doing riskfull thing or trying new thing , they take not so much damage a le richer people . they have the chance to try out new thing because , they are save because of their money or wellknowness . a good example are actor like brad pitt and angelina jolie they adopped child form fare country , like cambocha . the risk is that these child have dangerous illness , or other people see this adoption a a bad thing . so maybe some people hate them for adopting these child and so pitt and jolie get problem . they can lost their good reputation and will maybe get in future not good actorrules . an other example is paris hilton , she act very provocant and a lot of people hate her because of her character . she i often drunked , or make a lot of embarassing thing . so i think she do this because she ha the oppurtunity , she is rich , wellknown and ha a big name . but she could take also a lot of risk by doing such provocant thing . people ignore her more and more and say she is crazy and did not want to see her . so i think her reputation status will be more and more le . in my view the rich and wellknown people can do such thing , i stated at the top of my report , because they have the money and the reputation . their social live is saved and they will not get so a lot of problem like `` normal people `` if they fail sometimes .
