i completely agree to the statement that successful people try new thing and take risk rather than only doing what they already know how to do well . in my opinion only when you try new thing you will be able to learn new thing . one of the most successful person we have today is mr.bill gates . had he been content with what he had and what he knew , this era of information technology would have been unheard of . but because of this change he brought , he not only benefitted himself but also the entire world . small , under developed country are developing at a faster rate because of this technology . trying new thing is very challenging and is often considered a gamble espesially when large sum of money is invested . it go without saying that monetary gain are very crucial in any business . so people often refrain from taking risk . but it is very important to take risk when you want to try something new . lets consider a simple example of a small shopkeeper . the shopkeeper can allure customer only when he ha a very good range , quality and a variety of product . if he is ready to take a risk and store product a per the customer ' satisfaction he 'll be largely profitted by this . his business will be successful . even when you consider in the field of science , most of the theory proposed by the successful scientist were not approved in early stage . but the zest to do something new ha kept them going and got them all the accolade they have won .
