successful people try new thing and take risk rather than only doing what they already know how to do well . in may opinion i think that should to the people to dp the best of themselves to be an important parson in his socitey . and it should for each on in the univaersal to have his on thing to do to be a famuos person in his time i mean in this tow line that when thes person will died after long time the people after him will study what did that famuose man did in his life . and also what dose he did all the people will study and took for what dose he did in his life they well study all his low in what he did . many people in the world but each of them have his own behavior and his own think . for example one is intelegance think in his brain like one is inteleganse in the mathe , one is intelegasnce in the baiology , psycology , phisices , since , arabic role , linustic , ... etc . in this ca we understand that every one can do every thing in his life for his socitey and for the the world that we life in . take rikes rather than only doing what they aleady know ... thes mean that every one do what he want and he didnot say iwell donot do that becase some one did it . ok someone before you did what you want to do . you can do anything ale or do the same but in ather way in easly way in this woy you well have your own thiory and your own study at the end i well say that it should for any one in our life will exam himself in many thing maybe he will be somthing in the futuer .
