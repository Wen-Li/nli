i agree with the statement but i do not think that this is a negative fact at all . when a company advertises a product it aim is that a many people a possible afterwards want to have the product . to reach this aim the company need to show and describe the product in the most positive way possible . therefore it is absolutely legal to them when they try to make the product look better than it really is . the people that are looking at an advertisment on the other hand need to reflect what they see . adults are able do so . over the year they have learned that not everything told in the television or in newspaper is directly the truth . children may sometimes need their parent to figure that out . the company try to make up a many new surprising advertisments a possible to convince the people so that they run into the store to buy the product . when the company extand the abilies of a product too much in the advertisment the consumer will be angry and will not buy the product again . therefore the company need to find a middle way between lying and telling the truth so that the consumer will not be disappointed and start to buy is product regulary . this lead into a daily fight and there are even rule made up by the goverment telling how far the company can go with their advertisments to make sure that some truth about the product appears in it advertisment . sometimes it is even nice for the consumer to look at an advertisment when the company ha made up beautiful place or funny situation to attract the product to the consumer . all together it is quite normal and important for the product that it advertisment make it seem better than it really is and the consumer learn fast how to handle the wrong fact made up by the company .
