i agree with the statement that there will be fewer car in use in twenty year than there are today . i have three reason why i think so . the first reason is that another transportation system will be more comfortable than now such a train and bus . in some country it is impossible to move to another place without car . and so , many people have to use car . however , 20 year is long enough to spread another transportation system . there are still few transportation system in the country side . in some place , there is no transportation system at all . the secound reason is that people will care about environment more . cars are not good for earth 's environment . even now many people care about earth 's environment , i think there will be much more people who care earth 's environment in the future . trains is better than car about environment because train can move much more people than car with same enogy . and train work with erectricity which is better than fossil enegy for environment . recently car company are deveropping new car which are good for environment , but i think even such car are not better than train . the third reason is about population . population of the world will not increase any more . and the ratio of elder people is increasing . older people doe n't prefer to drive car because it is dangerous . these day many elder people were killed by car accident . because of above reason , i think there will be fewer car in use in twenty year . i also wish there will be fewer car because of environment and reducing car accident . many people wish there will be fewer car a i think . this is another reason why i think there will be fewer car in the future .
