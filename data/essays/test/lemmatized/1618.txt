as to me , i prefer travelling alone to travelling in a group led by a tour guide . the reason is that i can enjoy the travel without restriction and also can experience foreign culture themselves . first , if i travel alone , i can enjoy my leisure time fully freely . the most frequent complaint of people who are travelling in a group is that they have little time for their free activity . however , travelling alone can guarantee that you can go around anywhere you want to go and can stay there until you want to stay . this is somthing that group travel can not offer . second , travelling alone provides more opportunity for traveller to experience other culture . if you have guide who can help everything you need , there is few chance to experience the region you are travelling . on the other hand , if you do n't have such guide , it is you who have to communicate with the native people . through this interaction , you can really learn about the area and people in there . all in all , i would like to choose travelling alone rather than travelling in a group with guide . not only can i enjoy the time freely , but also truely experience other culture .
