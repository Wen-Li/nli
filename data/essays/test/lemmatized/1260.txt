the easier way to be success is to use tested way and tactic which the successful people give . on the other hand , this is the easier way to be usual . i prefer to create my own style to be successful . the first reason to choice is personal improving . the second is that wanting to get new thing . the last one is about being uni first of all , all the thing we do for improving ourselves and getting new expereince day by day . if i want to learn how the successful people had their success , i could figure them out in these people life story . and then i can use their strategy when creating my own style which is occured a a mix of them . secondly , if i walk the street which wa walked by another , i will get same route and arrive same place . but i want to discover new place and get new success about what i am interested in . the last reason to prefer to try new thing and take risk is about being unique and unusual . until keeping the key point of being successful , people use usual way . by the way , he failed because of these false tactis but do n't feel sorry about it . he know it is the experinces and pattern of the success . after the all failed , he should ask what the problem about the problem and how he will solve this problem . in end , all this falses and other successful people experince come together and the unique style will apper . in conclusion , i prefer to get risk rather than doing something which already known . it is about my personal improving in using others ' experience and creating my own style . after the year , only uniqies will be remembered .
