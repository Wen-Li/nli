in my opinion , most advertisement or commercial give a better image of the product than what they really are . it is normal , because the aim of a advertisement is to sell the product , to create a desire among the population to buy them . more the product will look fabulous , advantageous to the consumer , more the population will want to have and buy them . it is particularly true , for instance , for washing powder , every advertisement say that their powder can wash cleaner than the others , and that all the dirt will go away easily . this phenomenum increase because every company want the best advertisement for their product , therefore will add some advantage to the product , that the product doe not have in reality . to answer to it , the other competitor will add new advantage . therefore , it is like a race between competitor to have the best advertisement . but there have to be limit to this race , company should not be able to say everthing they want about the product they sell , because then the advertisement become a false statement of fact and no more just emphasize of the reality . then there is misrepresentation and the advertisement become lie , and people without a lot of information or knowledge about the product will belive the advertisement . that is the reason why i think some rule have to be settled in order to give a legal frame for the creation of advertisement . the rule should be written by the parliament , because it is a national matter , and the parliament should receive advice from special comitees , which have more skill to appreciate the `` advertisement world '' . in france , for example , there are a lot of regulation in this topic . firstly , it defines an advertisement , compared to a false statement . secondly , it establishes different action in justice to claim for damage for the loss suffered by buying product at a very high price for a very low quality . to conclude , i totally agree with the statement and because it is a reality , rule should provide way to frame it , so the advertisement of the product remains close to the real quality of the product .
