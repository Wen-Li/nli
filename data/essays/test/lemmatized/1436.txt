publicity ha a huge impact on humanity , yet it work for many company that work on ti and create it . a lot of thing are offered thoughout advertisement and sometimes they are not what they seem . those `` ad '' often manipulate million of people and persuade them into spending money into generally , useless stuff . most product , such a `` weight-loss pill '' or a `` multi-functional-frying-life makeover-pan '' , are really expensive and their `` ad '' often show effect that may not be real or the function that , later on , may vary or fail . so it is somehow unfair and scaming for the recievers , or the one that get and absorb the advertisement . maybe those pill have side effect , and a the ad doe not mention them , someone can be severely affected or sick by just consuming them . or maybe the innovating pan doe n't expose the risk or warning on the reciept , and someone decides to leave it , or to exposed to innapropiate heat - because they forgot or something - and that thing expotes . .. what happens then ] the advertisors will not respond for what happens to you nor will they give your money back . so that is why the published product can result very risky or dangerous without u knowing about it . if someone like to consume the product a much a the `` ad '' then that person will be probably satisfied with the result - if the product actually work - . if not , then that someone would probably like to think about what he \ she actually need , instead of throwing money away for a long time - if payed with credit - or suffering possible harming consequence . advertisements simply do their job , because for me , it all depends on the level of cosumism we may have . so i believe that most of those company should not sell and offer all of those lousy thing that may be broke in a couple of week after-purchase , or that cost a lot but have technically low quality result . nothing is what it seems and neither is something that we do n't know and just get because we want to . so let not face the risk , neither waste our money or time .
