i disagree with the statement that it is better to have broed dnowledge of many academic subject that to specaileze in one specific subject for many reason : well-organized for the main subject , avioding student from what they do n't like to study , and other academic will be forgotten . initially , if a student study only the academic subject which he like , he will definitely be creative in his subject . for example , i have a cassmate who adores chmestiry and get a very high mark in chmestiry . unfortunately , he ha to study biology which he really doe n't like , he failed in the foundation year in the university because of the biology albeit he got high mark in chemistery , as a result , he could study only chemstery and pas the foundation year , second , if a sudent study only one subject , he will definitely be a well-organized in this subject , in addion , he spare their time doing the same subject and have extra informatoin about the only subject which he chose to study . third , the extra academic subject , which are not used during the jod , will be forgotten , so the student do n't need these academic subjents which , in my point of view , waste of the student time . from the infomation given , it 's not true that a student can have broad knowledge of many academic subject if he study many subject because student get bored of the subject which are mandatory to study in the university and we can aviod them from failing in the couses which they do want to take . in brief , we can make better and creative student if we let them study the subject of their faild .
