yes . i completely agree with the statement and it is a fact that young people do not have enough time and support for their community . there are lot of reason for their avoidence . firstly , the work life of the people now a day , there ha been a drastic change in the style of working compared to the older time . for instance , the young people who are now working in the call centre in india are hardly able to find some time towards their social life . since this people are work during the night time and get back from the work in day time and go to sleep . this is process of working in the working in the night ha been a major reason why this young people are not able to help their respective community . secondly , most of the young people now a day are involved in various activity . such a going to the party , movie and lot of activites that is keeping them away from their community . the carefree attitude of the young people is one of the reason why there is not enough support is given to their community . most of the young people now a day are very le worried about their religion and all the ideal and principle taught by it . most the of the young people which also includes the student are also not able to find time to help their community . it is not that they are being taught in the school about the moral and value but the way the teaching technique have been modified and the assignment given to them by their respective school , would keep them busy even on their weekend . in earlier time people where were very much concerened about eachother and their life . they use to extend all possible help to their community that they could . but in modern day society and life had become so fast and thing are changing so rapidly , where , people would get a hardly get time for their social life and from where they would find out to help their community . i would like to conclude that it can be fairly understand by the above mentioned reason , why , young people are getting time to help their community .
