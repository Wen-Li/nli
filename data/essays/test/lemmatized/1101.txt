have the ability to speak about different subject can be better than to speak just about one subject but all depends on the situation you are . 1 ) be more polyvalent + speak with more people 2 ) be more specialize + speak just with a little number of people it depends on the situation you are because on the one hand it can be better to speak about different subject but not in deep and in the other hand it can be better to talk in deep about a subject with people who know the subject to introduce this subject we can said that being open minded is very important in a person personality to live with people . first have broad knowledge of many academic subject can be better because your can talk about a lot of different kind of subject for example in a dinner you can speak with everybody and talk about a lot of different thing so learning different kind of thing . on the contrary if you focuse your attention just on one subject it 's not the better way the meet people because if they do n't share the same interest of the subject it would be not an enrichising conversation and you could not speak always for the dinner example with different kind of people which is very enrichising . it 's a pity to ca n't speak with interest with other people . people who are intersted in the same subject a you are probably the same type of person a you so the mix of culture or just the mix of different personnalities are not applied . moreover find a person who is intersted in the same subject a you is not very easy because there are too many subject in the whole world to find this person ! to conclude to have broad knowledge of many academic subject seems to be more interseting to focuse your attention on one specific subject . but eat an apple evry day keep the doctor far away so it can be good to have a subject that you know better because if you find the special person this one can be very important for you !
