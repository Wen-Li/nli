in my opinion , i doe n't agree that there will be fewer car in use twenty year later compare to today . the reason that i said this is mainly because people are going to have higher living standard twenty year later compare to today 's . because of this , they will have higher demand asked for vehicle a now they can afford to purchase luxury and very expensive car . because of this , car became an neccessity in their daily day , no matter they want to used it for travel , to show off or maybe they just want it a others have it . the following reason that support my idea is we will have the more advance technology in twenty year time . this will make the issue of the petrollum which will polute our enviroment might not be an issue anymore , so everyone who want to purchase a car will need not worry about this issue anymore . furthermore , there 're techology that make a huge impact on our daily life such a we can just simply switch on a button and pick up a location from the map which we will like to go and the car will then move by itself and bring u to our destination . by this , we can do many others thing within the travelling period instead of driving a car . we can even get change or take our breakfast in the car while outside wa having a terrible traffic jam . if this really happen , then waiting inside a car might become an entertaiment instead of something that drive people crazy . therefore , the last reason that i think the number of car will be increasing in twenty year compare to today 's is because the price of a car will be much more cheaper compare to today 's situation . the reason that make this happen is mainly because , when there 're high supply in the car industry and people are overall rich , there 'll definitely a decrease the car pricing . to further explain this , when people do n't take car a a symbol of their wealth a all ordinary people were capable to purchase luxury car , the demand for luxury car will fall . developement of the technology might also become one of the reason that cause the car price fall . due to all the reason above , i think that in twenty year time , there will be an increase in car used compare to what we have today 's .
