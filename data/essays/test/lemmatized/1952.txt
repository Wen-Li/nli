if i consider my own experience i will definitely agree with the speaker 's claim . companies today are motivated by profit and sale , whatever the mean . advertisements act a medium to inform the people about different product along with their special highlight . this ha led to increase in competetion among company . the company whose product sell most emerges a the leader . its due to this competetion that advertisement is being misused today . it doe not give customer an assessment of product but tell them it is a panacea for all their problem . let me illustrate my view with an example . whenever we watch our television set the advertisement about a fairness cream is fairly common in between programme . these advertisement show a model who previous to using that cream x wa dark and wa shunned by girl because of his complexion . but within week of using x he becomes a college heartthrob with girl dying to get a date with him . but is it possible to get a fair complexion in such a short time or to even get a fair complexion . to speak the truth i could not notice a change in my complexion in even a year . arent our body , our character , our behaviour a result of genetic material ? but these advertisement refutes all the scientific theory because their main purpose is not to support them but to increase their sale . the reason behind making such claim about their product is profit . we all think that when we are spending money we should get the best . but how we are going to decide which product is best ? we are not technical expert of the field . we can only see advertisement and make decision . so for any company to prosper this medium advertisement should be utilised or to say misutilised properly so that the customer get convinced that this company 's product is the best . so instead of actually improving the standard of their product they take the easier route - to make u believe that their product is the best . this strategy ha worked well and is still working well . but these company should understand that it their moral responsibility towards the society from which they derive their bread and butter ; that they should not deceive the society with such exaggerated claim .
