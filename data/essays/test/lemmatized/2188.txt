i agree with the statement that most advertisement make product seems much better than they really are . it is because the advertisement is a tool for company how can they spread the product the most effectively . i will give three reason to support my opinion . first , the advertisemnt is for sale . the company need profit to suistain their company , so that they want to sell their product a much a they can , and maintain the high price a much a they could . to make it effective they need a good advertisement which turn out most people feel that advertisement is better than a actual product . second , the advertisement is for commercial reason , which i mentioned a little in the first reason , so that to make an advertisement leaflet they just take the best picture of the product . for example if the company made a package of 10 special tasty apple but they do not have to show all of them , what they can do is , they can simply show the one best picture which they have taken from all of the apple . third , most of or all the company want to maintain the high price for their product . they tried to advertise more effective to more people get attracted . i wa encountered several time , i can give an example which i still remember , i ordered a chocolate box but the size of the product wa much smaller than i expected , which wa very unexpected . in conclusion i agree with the sentense from above three reason . the sad thig is even some company , made a good product they can not sell effectively unless they are successful in marketing , mean good advertisement . so that every company need to success in advertisement which lead to most advertisement make product seems much better than what they really are
