i personally do not agree with the statement that `` the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide '' . the primary reason i do not agree with the statement is because i believe that while travelling a certain element of adventure is needed to make the travel enjoyable and memorable . i think when you travel in a group led by a tour guide the element of adventurism would be lost . the thrill in exploring and travelling new place on one 's own would be more rewarding compared to the comfort and pleasure provided by a guided tour . i might be willing to travel in a group but without a tour guide . i would prefer to take along a travel book , if necessary , a a guide . it would be more fun to explore new place with friend and family , but without a guide . it would bring out the adventure spirit in member of the group . though there would be a chance that we might get lost during the journey it would be worth the trouble once we complete the trip . we can reflect back on the trip and share all those happy moment . i feel a guided tour would only expose u to the most popular location at a place . but when we make the tour on our own we would have have the freedom and time to explore the place on our own . also the experience would be unique and different from what anyone else would experience if one opted for a guided tour . i speak partly from personal experience . i troughly enjoyed my trip along with friend to the `` burra caves '' near vizag in my home state . while a guided tour would have provided u with a visit to all the popular location on the our , we decided to explore the place on our own . it gave u the chance to see many place which were not included in the guided tour but nonetheless were more exciting and memorable . on the other hand i do not remember much about the guided tour to the `` golconda fort '' in my home town of hyderabad .
