some people may not consider that most product look better than what it is due to the advertisement . in my understanding , advertisement is one of the effective tool to promote the sale of the product ; hence i assert that producs are made seem better than usual by the advertisement . i base my assertion upon the following three aspect : the function , the appearence and the price of the product . first of all , the advertisement will impose on the good point of the product and will not reveal the bod point or effect . an example that make this clear is that the recent advertisement of the laptop computer . some japanese manufacturer imposes only on the endureance of it battery whereas the battery is heavy . some korean manufacturer imposes only on the mutiple function of the laptop computer whereas it work very slowly . secondly , the advertisement make product look better than what it really is . for example , car maker us the most good-looking color of the car in the advertiesment . and , they designate the angle that the picture of the advertisement is taken . in addition , the product are located in delux surroundings in the advertisement , which contributes to good a appearence of the product . i have found this true from my own perosonal experience , too . i bought my car because i wa attracted with the good looking in the advertisement . in the advertisement , the car wa exhibited in the city of paris , one of the most beautiful city in the world . after delivery of the car to my home , i have found the car not to be attractive in the advertisement in the suroundings of the rural area of japan . thirdly , advertisement impose on the inexpensive price of the product in spite of the fact that the price is not compared in the advertisement . in japan , where i live in , fair trade coimmision , which corresponds to the federal trade commision in the u.s. , prohibits the advertisement from comparing the price of the product . therefore the customer can understand the meaning of the price of the product are expensive or not only after they compare by themselves . considering all of the above factores , i believe that most product seem much better than what it is due to the advertisement . as i see it , advertisement is the potent tool of manufacturer and seller to attract the customer ; therefore we have to deduct the bottom-up of the product by the advertisement when purchasing the product .
