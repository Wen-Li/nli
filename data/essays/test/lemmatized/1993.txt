i agree that traveling in a group led by tour guide is the best way . the reason ha two . one reason is that we can more enjoy the trip . the other is that we can get our safements if we are led by tour guide . now , i will discus about the reason . at first , if we take part in a tour travel , we can share feeling with our group . for example , we are moved by great building during our travel . we want to convay our feeling to someone . if we have a group , we are able to talk about our thinking or feeling with group member . furhermore , a tour guid tell a lot of knowledge about history , building , traditional thhings in the place which we visit and so on . if coming along , we can not know many interesting knowledge . these thing may make u more enjoy . next , when we meet a dangerous accident , a tour guide give a good advice . because a tour guide is a professional of traveling . for example , if our wallet are stolen by someone , the guide tell how i should do . so , we can travel safely . moreover , i group member encourages with one another . a tour travel ha a many good point . we can travel happily and safely . as described acvobe , i think that traveling in a group led by a tour guide is the best way to travel .
