i strongly aggree with the idea that successful people try new thing and take risk instead of doing just what they have already know . success can not be gained just by repeating the same procedure that have been already known . for instance , scientistists would never find new technique just by repeating the same procedure . the more one scientist try , the more he or she ha the chance of finding new technique or better treatment for disease . nobel prize is also given to scientist who find a new method that contributes to human health . success of course is not limited with science or research , if a person just want to be successful at kitchen , he or she should try new thing , like creating his or her own meal . otherwise , everyone can prepare the food with known procedure , however to make a delicious , unknown meal , one should try new combination of vegetable , new combination of sousages and just should try to be creative . you may have the risk of obtaining a terrible meal however , without takig this risk , it is impossible to create your own kitchen . if you want to define a common characteristic for all successful people , you will certainly see that these people tried new thing , these people tried to be creative . actually this is the only way of being successful , you may be doing your work well , you may be hardworking enough , however this doe n't contribute the real success . i strongly belive that real success is the one that contribute to humanity a a whole and so it is appreciated by all others . like invention of electiricty which is certainly an important success and everyone know how much risk edison had taken to find it , and how different way he tried to accomplish this . to sum up , a successful person is the one who ha the ability of trying new thing and the one who is brave enough to take responsibility of all possible outcome of the risk .
