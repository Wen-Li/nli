i agree with the statement , but still think that it varies in it importance from different subject . of course it is always better to have a holistic perspective on a subject that a student is studying . in subject like social science , humanity , history or law it is important to have a certain degree of an overview of that subject . so it is important to understand idea , certain time period or theoretical concept in order to be able to think in the context and language of that subeject . in more technical subject and maybe natural science their is huge importance on knowing certain fact and figure . an engineer for example ha to be able to reproduce certain formula or data whenever he is asked or a biologist should know certain fact about for example animal population . but still , all fact fit into idea , theory and concept that important people have developed in the evolution of the different academic subject . i think the problem with fact is that they may turn into a kind of weight for studying . they can also lead away from the research aim if concentrated to strong on them. a lot of researcher start with an idea and do experiment a long a they have a proof for it . this can be a supporting proof or one that eliminates the idea . theoretical thinking and theoretical concept can be brought to student via professor in lecture . that is the important function that university have to fulfill . but the learning of fact should be the responsibilitiy of the student , whether he or she is interested or not . even if you compare university to university of applied science it is still important to set a focus on giving student the opportunity to understand idea and concept if they shall be able to work with them in a scientific , but also in a productive way someday . altogether i think that fact can always be changed , but idea and theory have a much longer lifetime . even if nowadays an idea ha turned out to be wrong , student should still be informed about it in order to understand why it wa wrong . such a mode of education is not possible by simply learning fact .
