although some people may say that having only one specialized knowledge is helpful , i believe that having broad knowledge is better . it is because that the wide knowledge can be useful on people 's job and even creates a new field . the first reason is that people may adapt the broad knowledge into their own work , so the work can be done effectively . for example , one of cousin had graduated from a medical shool . however , after the graduation , he realized that the one thing he truely want to learn wa music . therefore , he reentered the university a a music major . he enjoyed the music for the campus life , and when about to graduate the university again , he worried about his career . every musician close to him suggested him not to be a just musician because musician do not earn much money in a reality . therefore , he decided to be a doctor again . other friend said to him that he wasted time on music . however , he became a doctor who work in musical clinic . no other doctor could know about music better than he could . thus , he is a number one doctor in musical clinic now in my country , korea . the music which is very different from medicine help the diffent job . as i explained , much knowledge can be significantly useful in any other field . the second reason is that even a new field can be created by a person who ha broad academic knowledge . mr.dalson is a famous artist . however , even 20 year ago from now , he wa a mechanic . he always wanted to become an artist , but reality doe not let him be . one day , he quit his machanic job and started his art work . according to what he had done for his whole life , machanics , he combined those two work , art and machanics . no one supported him and said the creature are wield . however , now , he is considered a a artist who created a new artform `` machanic art '' . as mr.dalson did , different academic subject can combine and be a novel subject . having broad knowledge is not only useful on one 's work , but also creates a new field .
