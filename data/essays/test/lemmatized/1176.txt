people can go to the trip with a guide or go alone . in my case i would like to travel with guide . becasue we can get lost and can not comunicate with other people if we travel to the forgine place . most of all , we could get lost in the unfamiller place . we can get lost easily without guide . thus we could not go to the place that we planed before . for example let say that a group of girds go trip to the america . they planed to go to the statue of liberty . but they had trouble getting a right bus . they miss the right bus so they had to spend time and money for that . and another problem wa that they do not know way to back . so , they had to spend whole day walking the street . in addition we could have comunication problem with others without of the guide when we travel to the forgine contries . furthermore , since we have different costums and culture , both u and native could misunderstand . for example with comunication problem , we can not even buy the thing . buying a small drink of can would make u cost lot of energy . the guide who is able to speek their language will help u processing some work such a buying stuff , hotel check in . and hitting softly between friend is no big deal in korea , but in japen , police might get you because of your violence . guide can give advice to u what to do and warn to u the thing we should not to do . to sum up i strongly support that it is better to travel with the guide , because we could get lost , and reduce comunication problem .
