with the spread of new way of communicating the medium let u become like target bombed by advertisement . with the increasing number of people that watch television , read newspaper or go into the internet making commercial became a real ( and well paid ) work . people that do this work often let u know that their product is useful , also if this is false . there are lot of advertisement that let u think that changing our breackfast made of milk and cereal with one made of bread and nut paste will let become u happier for all the day . but they do n't tell u that we may have problem with our diet because the content of fat in these product is higher than the normal . for example when i started eating nutella for my breackfast i took three kilo in two month : that wa n't writed in the label ! another example of erroneus message provided by advertisement is the one that if we use product of beauty we will seem beautifuller than the sun . this is very common with the cream used by woman , they use lot of these product convinced that they will seem 20 year old younger in few time . but a recent experiment made by an english laboratory demonstrated that a woman wich stopped to use these chemical and very expensive product for some month had the : she had to spend lot of money and lot of time is using these product with the only effect that her wallet now is thinner . so , i can say that i completely agree with the statement , but i also believe that the work of producing advertisement is one of the worst in the word : they have to make u believe that the product they are selling is the best on the market also if this is not true ( and if they do n't do this they get fired ) .
