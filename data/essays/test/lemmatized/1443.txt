the link of successful people and people taking risk to try new thing is not simply a connection . it is a causality , which the following argument are going to demonstrate . `` new thing '' , or , more eloquently expressed , innovation are in fact one of the main reason for economic development . in the past , society would never have developed the way it did without important industrial achievement such a the `` spinning jenny '' , the steamboat or the automobile . nowadays , the technological improvement are crucial for our current form of society . all these industrial and technological improvement required courageous men , who had a vision of how thing could work and who took a lot of ( often , if not always , cost intensive ) effort upon them to make it happen . although success wa not guaranteed . they were finally granted with huge financial success and renommation for their economically innovative courage . however , successful courage for risking new thing doe not necessarily have to occur in an economic sector . it can also happen in politics . the european union provides a very good illustration for this point . after the second world war , european country were politically and economically weak . it took courageous men such a the frenchman jean monnet and robert schuman to openly express an at that stage entirely new vision of integration and cooperation between european country . almost 60 year have passed since then and although the european union still give birth to a lot of criticism , it achievement and improvement concerning political importance and effectiveness of the member state , a well a a surprisingly high level of economic wellbeing and social contact between the citizen of the different country . the political figure which played a role during this development are still honoured today for succeeding in the risky task they took in their time . does trying out new thing and taking risk automatically result in success ? surely , the answer would be no . but the connection definitely work the other way . highly successful people , more often than not , have taken risky decision in their past in order to implement new thing they believe could work .
