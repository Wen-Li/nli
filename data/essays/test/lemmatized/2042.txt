typically , it is more important for student to learn about idea that help them with up coming event in their life , however , if student learn about the idea without understanding them , there will be diffculties that will face them . being a student , i believe that understanding the idea and concept of thing is more preferrable that just learning them . less mistake occur if the understanding of the issue is there . although , if the understanding is not present , mistake will occur . for that , student will only know the little detail behind the action but will not know from right or wrong . learning fact is like having a world where anything is possible . nothing will seem wrong to people because the reason behind the fact without understanding , will lead to people doing wrong from good . furthermore , understanding the concept teach the student to choose the right decision without think about the fact behind it . understanding the fact will lead to an understand with people that have different issue that ca n't be solved . for example , war is the wrong thing to do , but they are still happening . if an american solider were to kill an unarmed man from palastine , for the fact that he did nothing but protect his family , that solider is considered to be stupid and heartless . the fact that this unarmed man is the soliders enemy , where he is in a helpless position , without understanding the concept that killing is wrong , that man is dead for just that fact . to conclude , i believe that understanding the issue or concept of thing is better than just learning the fact . it give the student a chance to learn from right and wrong without hesitating . they will also have the chance to know the reason behind the choice made because without that understanding the concept , wrong will be right .
