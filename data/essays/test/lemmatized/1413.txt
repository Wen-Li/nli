i disagree to the statement . i understand that company watnt to get attension from many people to promote thier product . once they are in the mega competition . they have to defeat thier rival to make profit than others . if they fail in making profit . the company will over . however if we looking at consumer side . i think consumer is usually little knowlewge about the product . so it hard to understand about it perfectly . these kind of advertisement cause misunderstanding to the custmers . i therefore consumer should be give the precise information about any product to carry out thier consume effectivery with no trouble . accodding to this my oppinion , company advertisement can be restricted . i want to add one thing , althrough i mensioned about restriction of the company side . it seems me that responsibilty is not going to only the company . even the consumer should have attitude to get ability of distingusih which information is right , once we are in huge information in the daily life . otherwise we can not point out the worng thing with company . which mean we have to clever to against commercalism in the business .
