today advertisement is a typical way to support your product . but this do not always mean , that you make product better then the realy are . the advertisement is to convince the consumer that this produkt is the right for him . this could be for several reason . one possibility is , it wa mentioned bevor , that you convince the consumer by making the produkt better than it is . so the person buy it becaus he espact a very high return to his investment . television spot for cleaning product are a good example . in this spot it is typical that advertisement describe there product a very affective . possible more effective then than they realy are . it is shown a very dirty clothing and when you use the advertised product , your clothes are cleaned completly . this may not occour under practical condition , like in normal house . for me , this is not the right way of marketing . this could effect to an angry consumer . an other , in my opinion much more important function is , that you inform the customer . there are product , that have to be introduce , because the are new and unknowen . if you do not get to know the product by advertisement , you would propably never have heard from it . for this point of view , it is important that you look on advertising not like forcing the people to buy . normaly a product should have a recognizeable value to the consumer and for that , you realy want to buy it . now it is clear that at first he need to know the advanteges of this special produkt . to conclude , i would not criticize advertisement in generally . you have to look behind the reason . in some case it is an usefull instrument for boath site , the producer and the consumer .
