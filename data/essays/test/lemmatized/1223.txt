i agree the statement `` the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide . '' there are two reason , safety and the satisfaction of watching spot . if we travel in foreign country , we may be in not safe conditons , because we can not understand foreign language very much . being in foreign country make you much more dangerous than being your own country . the thirf who get only foreigner ' purse insists . futhermore , we regularly be corrected our passport by the guide for our safety . and at the one more other point , when we shop foreign country ' shop , we often would be shoped at unsuitable price . the last one , because we do not know the way much , we often get our way lost there . however , if a tour guide is by u , he/she would save u by these thing . second , we would be able to visit many watching spot if the tour guide teach u . if we travel alone , we do not know where we really should visit . if you had searched where to go by book or internet , there are no one that can be better than the real voice . they always lead u whare we really want to go or experience . if we want to talk and make friend with the people who live there , it is difficult for u to make it real when you travel alone . in addition , there are some place where just only foreifners can visit all the time in japan . for example , kyoto gosho doe not allow the people who do not have any paper that can show who thay are . however , because foreigner always have passport , thir foreigner tour member can visit there any time . besides , we can ask our historical or culture question to the guide , and he/she ha much amount of knowledge . by these point , i think the best way to travel in a group led by a tour guide .
