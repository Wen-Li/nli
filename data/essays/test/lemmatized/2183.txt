i traveled about 20 country in my life . traveling around the world wa fun and very good experience for me . sometimes , i traveled by myself or friend and i used group package tour with a tour guide . some people said that travling group led by a tour guide is the best way . in my opinion , there is no way for best way for traveling and you can enjoy your trip without a tour guide and not invloved in group . traveling in a group led by a tour guide , there is n't much free time to enjoy yourself . you have to follow a tour guide and listen what he say . after that , you have to ride a bus right away and go to the next place . these are all scheduled by a tour guide , so you can not enjoy yourself . personal taste are all different , and you might want to stay more time in some place . however , it is impossible to do whatever you want , because it is a group tour . traveling is series of unexpected happening . i think it is one of the reason that people are enjoying the trip . a group tour ha fixed schedule , so experiencing unexpected accident are very rare . some people might do n't want to have this kind of situation . however , when you look back your trip in the future , i can strongly say that unexpected accident give you more memeries and portrait on your trip . tour with a guide are more expensive . all the package tour fee are including payment for guide , so it cost more that traveling without guide . thesedays , many traveler go to the trip by themselves to save money , and there are a lot of information to help them . there is no best way for traveling . everything can be changed depening on trip of purpose . i think best way to traveling is not a group led by toyr guide , but for you memory
