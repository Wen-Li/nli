i agree that the product appear much better than they really appear when advertised . the business company who manufacture the product make the value of it equal to a diamond in the hand of the brand ambassador a man is the creater of god and early superstition , by which the stone ha improved it value to gold . the telivision channel are profited by advertising and exclusive interview of great film actor , industrialist and telecasting live programms of incident that are not useful to the common man . the business tycoon are largly dependent on the film star to help them telecast their product and the influencial citizen are attracted by seeing their most liked cenema actor and without any suggestion of their suppurters they just buy those product that are promoted by these telecast . the item for example we consider coke bottle which are advertised by the celebrity can be produced by just 50paise per 200ml of coke but the available cost in the market is for 10rupees for each bottle , which mean after all the 50 paisa drink we are just spending 20 time the value of the item . this show that the present market is totally dependent on the advertising market and the celebrity are paid an amount of crore without any estimation for every short on the screen . the other side of the coin is the effective development of company atr the expense of the people
