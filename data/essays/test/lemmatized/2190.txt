i do n't think you have to choose only one learning method . that will be kind of radical . let 's better to develop an idea that probably would be more productive at the topic of learning . for understanding the statement , let 's define with two word the method of learning : `` theory and pratice '' . karl marx in the 19th century developed some idea about `` theory and practice '' and he supported that the best for learning , it 's to make a combination of this two concept . if i decided just to say which of the two word is more important , maybe i would be making a mistake . i think that there is not a unique learning method that it tell you anything about a acknowledge . one you get the acknowledge you need to practice what you learned . that 's the part where the practice get intro the process . i ca n't understand theory without practice and viceverse . the school are made for teaching student and the objective of this , it 's that after the have been in the classroom the will be able to work and produce , for they bringing out something good to the society . but some researcher have found that if they reforced the knowledge gotten in the classroom with laboratory , practice and proyects , the learning proccess would be more effective . actually around the world research , teacher , psicologist , have developed study method . these method are now used in some universities , and ther are effective . if you had the opotunity of joining two or more different universities ( of course not at the same time ) , you would distinguish between each method , and probably you would be able to choose the best method for your learning . i recomend from my own expirience not to choose just one method .
