in my opinion the statement `` most advertisement make product seem much better than they really are '' can in some case be true , in others not . it always depents on the kind of product the advirtisement is referrring to . one problem with advertisement nowadays is , that many thing can easily be changed and improved with computersoftwares . if you look at an advertisemnt of a cosmetic product , like an anti aging cream on tv for example , you will always see a pretty woman with a perfect skin , which should be caused by that certain cream . so somebody who really ha a problem like that might think , that if he us this cream , he will look like that a well , which is probably not true . this case show that the advertisement definitly make the product better than it actually is by using visual thing like a pretty woman to convince customer . the same count for example for washing powder etc. , where washing result can easily be faked by using a computer programme or just using a clean piece of cloth instead of the cleaned dirty one , which they could never get that clean . another kind of product may be service . companies can always tell a lot about which advantage they might bring you , but in reality everything might be different , like it happened to me when i went to australia with a well known work and travel company . they promised help with jobsearch for example , but in reality they did not help me to find one job , they just had a very convincing advertisement . apart from the group of product mentioned above , there are also product like electronics , car etc . if there is an advertisement about a product like that , there will not be much to fake about it . you can get technical fact about the product , which can not be faked , otherwise it would be against the law , and if you buy a product like that and it is doe not work like it wa supposed to be , you can easily complain about it and ask your money back . so if you look at all the metioned point , you can finally say that it always depents on the product the advertisement is about and if it is possible to make it appear better than it actually is by visual effect .
