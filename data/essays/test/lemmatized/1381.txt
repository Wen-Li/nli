i do n't agree with statement . success doe n't depends on trying new stuff . it depends on how much effort that person put in . even if some people take risk all the time and try new thing , if they stop right there with just experience , and not study about it , that 's not going to help with their successful life . it 's just wasting of time . as i mentioned before , it depends on their effort . sometimes , people learn from taking risk , but not often . plus , people can be successful through discovering new thing without taking risk . people learns from past , including how to do well . they learned from past first , before they take risk . let 's say i wa reading art history book and find out how to improve my art project . then , that 's learning from past , not learning from take risk . learning from taking risk , could look cool or creative . but is doe n't always work that way . if someone doe n't have any common sense , and trying to find out new thing , that person can end up die , not just taking risk . of course , it 's not healthy to do `` only '' what they already know how to do well . but important thing is , they have to know thing in the book that people from past found out for u before they take risk . people call person , who take risk and find out new way of something , `` inventor '' inventor is only one form of success . to be successful people , we do n't always have to take risk , but concentrate what they are doing , and trying to find the way from experience , not risk . ( of course , i 'm saying taking risk and experiencing is totally different . ) everyone ha their own talent . they should trying to find their talent before they take risk by trying new thing . we have to improve from thing that already say how to do well . not starting over . taking risk could be starting over . i disagree with the statement. ; `` sucessful people try new thing and take risk rather than only doing what they already know how to do well .
