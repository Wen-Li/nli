nowadays , with benefit of technological industry and development of vehicle , many people can travel to other country or travel far place very easily . some people like to travel in group with tour guide , but others like to travel by their alone . i prefer to traveel in a group led by a tour guide rather than travel alone for three reason . first of all , it can be more academical travel with guide . one would be the first time visiting the place , but the guide know very well about the place because he or she guide the place for long time . the guide can led people to many kind of museum or famous place that we must visit . for example , when foreign people came to korea , they would not know well about popular place of korea , but guide can lead them to interesting and academical place such a kyung-bok-gung . secondly , you may not worry about lost way in new place . some people are very bad at looking for way . in my experience , i have lost in new town where i visited for two time . if i were traveling with guide , maybe i would not lost my way . finally , traveling with lot of new people in group will be very meaningful . visiting many place and having own time can be reason of travel for some people , but making new friend can be another good reason of travel , too . for instantce , the group of people are first time to the place a same a you , except the guide . so usually in that kind of trip , guide give free time to make people to become friend and know with each other . if you make a friend in a trip , you can keep in touch and get to another travel together if there is another chance . for three reason i mentioned , to make a trip more academic , to not lost way , and to make new friend , traveling in a group with tour guide is the best way .
