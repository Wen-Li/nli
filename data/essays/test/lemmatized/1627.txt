we live in a time where value change or even get lost . the young generation is more focused on entertainment and other selfish wish . therefore it would not be unusual that young people do not give enough time to help their community . but indeed , this is not the case . we just believe this because we do not realize how many yought attempt to help their community . certainly , there are young people who are not interested in helping their community a well , but those youghts are exception . now i am going to explain why we have the feeling that young people are not social enough . in fact , many people do not like that the common value change in their society , me too . most of the elder people think that the young generation cause these change . thus it is absolutely understandable that the young population is associated with the new value , which accure instead of the common value . in fact the new generation get more individual . they even are supposed to get individual . the problem is thaht many people do not know what getting individual accuretly mean . in fac , it doe not mean that everybody think selfish . getting individual mean that everybody ha to choose his or her own way of life . and that is where the misunderstanding start . many elder people get more distant to the youth and thus do not see that new value mostly refer to the way of life but not to the relation between an individual and the society . indeed , a person can like heavy metal and be social in the same time . the relationship between an individual person and the community doe depend on the socialisation , but the way of life depends on education and on the decision the young person take . therefore it can not be said that the youth generally doe not help the society , but it varies from person to person .
