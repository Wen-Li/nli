human being is very ambitous and creative creautures . they always want to learn more and find new thing . if we examine the prominent people of world we can understand this more better . for example let 's look at the life of christoph colomb . he wa a very ambitous person and he wanted explore the untouched part of world . for that he applied rich person and king to encourage them to support his voyage on the sea . after support from one of them he started his great voyage . having poor navigation technology he dared to lethal side of ocean and storm . but finally he realized his dream and he founded new land for human being . a we learn from his life to be a successfull person we must brave and ambotious . but this musnt be bravity or risk of a stupid person . first of all everyone must know what he want and what he or she ha for that in his or her hand . so we must have a target and calculate how much risk for it and how easy way to achieve this target . on the way to the success we can have so much risk and obstacle but first we must be brave and creative . if we think classically we can just survive our life a a normal people . but if we merge our knowledge with creativity and behave brave we can be a successfull person and we can realize our dream like colomb . when we choose our target those must be reasonable target not fantastic and unachiavable . for that we must know our ability and capacity and then we must complete our lackings . if we think conventinally we cant change nothing in our life . but if we will be in search of new thing and untried method we can change whole of our life . for scientist this is very important . their success is related with their creativity and finding new thing . if they just do what they learned before they can be a good teacher but if they add something new what they learned before they can be historical person like einstein .
