i agree with this statement because we all should know some of the academic subject even if it is a little knowing . from there we can be a broad-minded person with a knowing of differents type academic ( from mathematics through history ) . in my case , i don t like at all science but i am always looking for scientific magazine about the new technology whose coming out or look at he survey about differents disease whose inceasing or decreasing each year . it help me to get inform of what is going on around me , how it is evoluating . i n general i am a diverse person , i mean that i don t have a specific subject that i like most but in contrary i am trying the best that i can to learnn a lot a thing , because everything is interesting . that s why maybe i am still undecided in major for the university because i am split with the communication field and the acing program but i also want to study spanish and italian and i want to have a knowledge in the american history which i have never studied . as you can see i am in a dilemma . but it don t restrain me at all to study through book or through people by traveling . i n my opinion specializing in one specific subject is like withdrawing oneself . it is not interesting to have a talk with a person who is always talking of the same topic isnt it ? in fact to specialize in only one subject mean to me that the person is confining himself in some area and might to get any acquaintance with other person . finally to have broad knowledge mean also to have more inteligence and guetting more knowledge help me to talk to different type of person . i can debate about a burning issue because i have inform myself of the actualties . in fact knowing a lot of thing is really enriching for me and i can fulfill in life .
