i do believe that successful people try new thing and take risk rather than only doing what they already know how to do well . many reason explain that is . among them certainly figure the importance of motivation in one 's success and how risky experience often turn out to be very positive . i firmly believe that people are much better at doing what they are passionate about than at what they are not . motivation is an important factor in people 's general performance in their occupation . doing thing we know how to do well is certainly very compfortable . however , that often becomes redundant , not to say boring . we then lose interrest for what we do , and our performance begin to decrease . successful people will not accept to stay in such a state and will try new thing even if they are risky . it brings challenge to what they do , which is very motivating . that put one back on the track of success . a good example of that is my friend dominique 's . until mid-2007 , she wa a pharmaceutical representative . she wa even rated first pharmaceutical representative in canada by novartis in 2005 . over time , she started finding he work repetitive and challengeless . rapidly , her sale went down sharply . that is why she decided to resign to persue a new goal . that is how she became a physical education teacherin august 2007 . she left her employement security with her easy routine behind to explore new avenue . dominique is now very successful at her new job and keep being given excellent evaluation by her employer . this clearly show that successful people are open to living new experience . it highly motivates them . other than that , it can easily be seen that participating in new venture is beneficial for individual growth . living new experience rather than continuing to do what we know how to do well allows u to enhance our knowledge . an example of this could be the arrival of technology in an accounting company . even if no specific reason is calling for change in work method because they always turned out to do fine , shifting to computerized work is desirable . companies , even if they found the change wa risky because their employee were more likely to make accuracy mistake with a new system than with the older one , decided to go on with it . they quickly realized that their efficently augmented steadily and significantly because of that change . that is the key of success . in brief , successful people don < t relie on what they know but t
