the biography of successful people from various area , such a businessmen , scientist and artist seem to support the above statement . indeed , looking for example at a person like steve jobs , the founder of apple , many example can be found in his life for the necessity to try new thing and take risk . it is the continuing invention of new and innovative good that fuel the success of apple and mr. jobs . and of course , new invention are not safe from risk , a it will always be challenging to predict their success . the analysis of another biography from a different field support this theory . galileo galilei , the rennaissance scientist , who explored and discovered many revolutionary idea and law of nature , took such high risk in his work that he wa even sent to prison for his belief . after all it can not be neglected that galilei had become one of the most successful ( in term of the impact of his finding , such a the functioning of the solar system ) scientist that this planet ha ever seen . in the search of reason to this apparent relationship between being innovative and not risk averse and personal success , the field of financial market and especially the functioning of share trading may be a useful allegory . it is very straightforward ecomics that teach that return is related to risk . in fact , the riskier an investement is , the higher the expected return from it . but what doe that tell about personal success ? completing the picture it can be said that the more innovative i am and the higher risk i take in my attempt to be successful , the more success i can expect , similar to the above described investment . but at the same time , not only the return of a risky investment may be higher but also the possible loss related to it . for a personal biography this mean that there might be a lot of people who take risk and loose , and hence end far le successful in comparison to others who avoided risk and remained , a the statement say , `` doing what they already know how to do well '' . this implies that the statement is only true in one direction . history prof that the majority of successful people have been rather innovative people with a strong willingness to take risk . this should not lead one to the conlusion that taking risk will automatically lead to success . in fact , a brought study , involving the life of many people , would very likely lead to the outcome that in average the success of the `` risky '' portion of the sample would not be higher than the average success of the risk averse portion .
