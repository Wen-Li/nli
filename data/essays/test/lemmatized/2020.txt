today the number of car on our planet is really high . some people think it will increase in the next year , others are convinced that this number will be smaller than today . i feel strongly that the second position is more realistic , and one of the most important reason is that the cost of natural resource a petroleum and gas , will increase in the future . theese kind of resource ar not everlasting and they are the main resource used in a car 's motor . a second point is that also the cost of life is increasing . actually it 's really expensive to buy a car for a common family and in the future many of theese family will not have enough money for a cheap vehicle . another point is the lack of parking place inside a big city and traffic jam . theese are seriuos problem in a urban center and they will lead to a reduction of the vehicle . otherwise the life of citizen will become an hell : they will spend all their spare time in searching of a parking or in the middle of road , crowded by others ' car . finnaly i think that some problem could be solved . for istance the structure of motor should be change , permittng them to work also with a different fuel : water will be the best candidate . however i think that a reduction of car could be consider postive for our future life .
