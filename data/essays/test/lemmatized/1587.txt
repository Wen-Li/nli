some people like to travel in a group such a a tour guided by a spscialist who know a lot about the place , and some like to travel on their own . if they do n't have enough time to travel , then it might be good idea to go with a specialist because they do n't spend vain time wondering or getting lost . however , there are more good reason why it is nice to go without tour guide in a group , and the reason are a follows . first of all it is because that tourlists can spend time a much a they want if they travel by themselves . they do n't need to worry time or other tour member if they are by themselves . on the contrary , if they go on a tour , they ca n't stay or visit the place even though they find on their own because they are always with somebody and need to follow the rule or time . as a second , it is because that they have more opportunity to meet people or touch the culture there if they go by themselves . for instance , tourlists are not familier with the place if it is the first time for them to visit . so they need to ask the direction to the local people . then they communicate with people there using foreign language , which is great opportunity to feel the culture . also , it is common that people use tour bus if they travel in a tour group . so , it is hard for them to have a opportunity to talk to local people . on the other hand , tourlists use public transportation such a bus or train if they go by themselves . in this case , they can see the local people or even talk to them . nobody know what happens in this conversation , maybe tourlists can get great information about place to visit , or some nice restaurant to try . finally , some people say that a tour guide ha much information . but there are many nice tour guide book which are avairable at book store . those book are enough to cover this matter . and moreover , it is easilly for them to get a map the place to visit . therefore , traveling alone ha many good point , even concluding the good reason of the tour . there are limit about group tour with a guide , but not for tous alone .
