in my opinion successful people try new thing and take risk in deed rather than remaining at their used thing and behaviour . there are several reason for this view . first of all , those people have earned enough money because of their success and so provide the main condition to trying something new . the most people can not afford to speculate because they often have to care for a family which depends on a regulate incoming . so there is usually no space for creating new and revolutionary idea and making those real . that doe not mean that le successful people are not interested in alternative thing , but they often have not the possibility to live like they want because of different duty . secondly , it may be decisive that people who have experienced a great career only became successful in this manner since they tried new thing or took a risk . without that behaviour in our time there is almost no chance to achieve your aim and finally succeed . perhaps it is a way of life they had choosen in young year and which helped them to reach their goal , therefore it is now one of their characteristic reaction to try something new . other people did not get this chance to experience the advantage of risk by their own so they are more frightened towards them . last but not least , successful people have already reached what they have dreamed of all the year . so these people may come to a point where they have to decide about going on . because of enough money and their positive knowledge about those risk and new chance they will probably take them and set a new target to their own for what they can work more hardly than ever . there are so many career men and woman who can not live without working and putting everything behind that aim .
