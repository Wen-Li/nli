why do people agree with student to understand than to learn fact ? if these student learn fact instead of to under stand the lecture in class , they will get bad grade and fail . for example when a student study the word of the lecture by fact it wont help him or her with their test . first student who are listenning to the lecture and understanding the concept they will be succesfull with their grade and make their parent proud . when a student really want to make their parent proud of them they should study well and understand the note that they wrote in class . on the other hand , if student just want to learn fact they will get lower grade than the student who under stand the idea of the subject . students whom doo this instead of taking fact in stead of understanding they will be weak in their subject , in their school subject , and in the whole school year . to sum up what i have just said is that student should listen and at the same time to understand the concept of the subject in school or in university .
