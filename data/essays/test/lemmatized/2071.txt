i prefer the travel by myself to the one in a group led by a tour guide . i have three reason to suport my opinion . firstly , i can visit the place in a city that match more to my taste in a travel by myself . if i travel in a group , i may not be able to visit all the site i want to see . since i am especially inerested in art and music , i would choose to visit museum and go to live house rather than to see historical building like old church . of cource i understand the importance of such building and there are many people who want to see them , but if i go to a foreign country , i want to go the place which attract me more . secondly , i can make my scheules more flexible . if i feel comfortable to be in a museum and want to spend a day there , i can do this . it happened when i visited new york city . i first scheduled to see moma for a half of the day . but after i started to look the fantastic picture in the museum , i wa fascinated by them . i quitted the afternoon schedule and spent a whole day there . it became the best day in that trip . lastly , travel by alone offer many chance to communicate with the people who live in the city . i often asked how to get the destination where i wanted to go , and many of them friendly taught me the way . when i visited thailand , i asked the woman the delicious restaurant around there . she not only nicely told me the name of the restaurant , but also took me there and had dinner together . she said she is also had interested in japan , where i live . we had very nice time in that restaurant with nice food and valuable conversaions . i think it is not so often the case with the group tour with a tour guide .
