i agree with this statementthat most advertisments make product seem much better than they really are . there are two reason to support my oppinion . first , when we buy something , we tend to decide whethere we buy it or not by it image . so the company which made the product try to show their product more attractive and more useful and more availableand more high quality . they make effort to give attractive advertisement of their product to consumer . they pay much money for the advertisement than the inovation the product . but image is not which really it is in way of the function and the quality . secondaly , advertisement never represent their lack . they show only their good point . because of the reason given above , i think most advertisement make product seem much better than they really are .
