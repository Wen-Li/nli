being successful in our life is the most important thing . everybody should have enough power to try to do new thing or to take risk . first of all , if a person want to be successful in his life , he must have interest and should look for new thing to learn . being successful mean being passionate about something . you need to be attracted about new thing . a teacher in geography , for example , will need to be always interested in geography news but not just for himself but also for his student . he will be successful and proud when he will know that he can answer to student 's question . second , there is another way to be successful . people have some goal and some project and they need to attend them . attending his goal mean being happy but mean also taking risk . for example , if someone is working in a company , since 7 year , and he is bored . he should try to find a better and more interesting job . he will take risk when he will change it but he will be proud of himself , and he will learn a lot of new thing . attending his goal is the best grateful thing that you can do for yourself . however , there are some negative thing about being successful or trying to attend his goal . first of all , you need to manage your knowledge . it 's really good to be interested in everything but you have to try to not border everybody with your knowledge . second , if someone is taking risk for his goal , it 's possible that he wo n't be successful and it could be dramatic . for example , if a person quit his job , it 's possible that he wo n't find something . therefore , peolple need to be careful when they want to take risk because it could be dangerous . in conclusion , i think everybody should take risk or try to learn new thing but we must find the correct way to do it but not over-do something .
