i agree whit this subject for the fallowing three thing , first is that the traveler can get lost in the place that they are looking at , the second is that the traveler can know much more about that place , the third reason is that traveler can find interesting the place by people that allready know that place . travelers can get lost . the person that do not know a place , they can get lost verry easy because they do not even know the street , and because they are jus new at the place , and they may do not know the languaje that they speak in that country or oplace . travelers can know much more about that place by a tour guide . they can find it more interesting if they see thing that they wanted to see , like if a tourist want to see the statue of the liberty if better to get there by a tour because if you do not know how to get there you can get lost . but there is also a way to get there just by asking , but in this time you can not believe in anybody because you never know that is that person tell you the truth or just he want to mess whit you . i prefer to take a tour guide i thinfk is safer an better . travelers can find interesting the place by people that allready know that place . you never know what a traveler spect of the oplace he is in . but you can allways show him what you think is good for them to know about your place , like i will show to the tourist the best museum or the best shopping center ( mall ) so he can get a expretion of what is like . also i will show him the best restaurant so he can get a good taste of the food that they make where i live and finally i will take him to a nigth club so that we can have fun . i think that is a good think to show the tourist what it is like in your town . this topic is verry interesting , there is a lot of thing to talk about . it is a good think to show the people where do you live so that they can have a good expectation of how is your town like and you and the tourism can get fun together , and they can tell people about your town if they like it , and people could make your town very famous .
