i agree with the opinion that most advertisement make product much more better than thay really are for the following reason . first , this '' believe '' sound quite logic beacuse the firm that created the product want to have the biggest benefit a possible , therefore it accepts to '' tell lie '' to people to achieve this goal . second , by adopting this method the firm doe n't violate any legal rule , at least for many kind of product . in fact there is no rule stating that what you tell about a product need to be prooved , except in case of pharmaceutical on other product of this type . for example , to create e commercialise an advertisement showing that a perfum can render a man irresistible you do n't need to make a resarch and obtain certain finding to proove it , you can simply tell it . that 's a good point for firm to adopt this method . third , there is a lot of present research focused on finding the best way to control mind . these area of research is called '' commercial neuroscience '' and it is trying to find out how to manipulate the brain of people and to convince them that a certain product is good and is valuable to buy it . finally , the firm doe n't risk anything by presenting the product better than it really is . in fact the nice and positive image given will increase the number of people that are curious and want to try it and if it will work , meaning people will continue to buy it , it is good . on the other hand , if people ar enot happy once tested the product , they will just stop to buy it but nothing dramatic wil happen to the firm .
