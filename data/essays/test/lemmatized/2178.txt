with the development of chinese economy and the exploitation of more and more natural and historical site , it ha become an irriversible trend for people to traval across the country . traditional travelling only involves group action led by a tour guide , while in recent year it is more and more popular to travel by oneself . from my perspective , i regard it a best way to travel by my own rather than being led by a tour guide , since i have experience concerning both method of travelling , i have summerized the advantage of travelling by my own a follows . first of all , travelling by my own rather than being led by a tour guide make the tour more flexible and convinient . guide in some case , did nothing but confined my freedom . when i went to yellow mountain led by a guide in a travel group , i wa eager to spend a night at the summit of one peak since it wa said that the sunrise view wa so magnificent that anyone who visited yellow mountain should charish the hope of witnessing it . however , the guide simply told me that we could n't make it because the schedule wa tight and we had to leave yellow mountain that evening for qiandao lake . i wa too disappointed to say anything in that case . by contrast , when i travelled alone in chendu , the capital city of sichuan province , china . i could just enjoy the lovely and delicious snack anytime and anyplace a i liked , which made it a fairly memorable tour . apart from making the trip more convinient and flexible , travalling alone could also light up the whole trip , turning it from a long and arduous journey to an thrilling adventure and insight into a specific culture . by forming my own travelling team , recruiting my acquntances who shared the same passion with me , we can design the routine by our own to visit some distant place where ordinary tourist ' group barely go to . imaging travelling to the jungle and shaking hand with the tribe member , will a guide grant this sort of interesting experience ? the last but not the least , travelling without a guide is also cheaper . the money could be well-spent on article and better accommodation . from above it is apparent to draw the conclusion that travelling alone is much more superior to travelling with a guide . ready to join me to go on diy trip ? come on !
