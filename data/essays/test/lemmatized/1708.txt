in today , people are looking too much the outer than the inner side . an ugly girl can be shown a one of the most beatiful girl by some makeup . the advertisement are same a the make up used in the girl , it is not understood until it is cleared or tasted by some way . although some people can believe that most advertisement are trusthworthy , show their product a they are , i disagree with that . i maintain that it is only a finger in the hand in amount because of the competition between producer and social result . first of all , there is always competition between the producer . in order to take a big slice in the corresponding area , they should advertise them a if they are the best in their field . they need a better slogan , if you are in front of a tv and zapping the channel , you can easily see that all firm claim that they produce the most powerful product , no one mention about the minus they have . the side affect of the product are not mentioned also . secondly , i wa confronted too many feed back in internet . the consumer are applyin to the consumer right . such a that she bought the hair cleaner because it protects the hair but her hair becomes more unhealthy buy using . the ad are not correct . as a result , the advertisement are not showing how they are , in stead they act a how the consumer expects from them .
