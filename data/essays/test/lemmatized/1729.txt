ideas and concept are very important for student than just to learn fact . ideas and concept are pracitcal in real life than just learning the fact . i totally agree with the statement that , it is more important for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact . few reason and example are illustrated below to hold my opinion . fistly , understanding idea and concept make the student more practical and applicable in respective field or subject . for incidence , take medical surgeon student , if the student surgeon know the idea and concept how to do the surgery , when the student become a surgeon , he or she can perform surgery very easily than learning the fact about how to do the surgery . another incidence computer programme student , by learning idea , and concept it is easy to develop new computer programme when they become the programmer . secondly , understanding the idea , and concept make student more innovative . for incidence , if the student is a chemistry student and the student learns the idea and concept regarding the chemical compound than learning just the fact , student can experment the idea and concept that she or he learned and innovate new compound that would be useful for mankind . for example medical compound etc . finally , understanding the idea and concept make student understand the subject . no matter how the question are framed regarding the subject , student are able to answer the question and attain good grade in class . for incidence , if the student is math student , by understanding the idea and concept of math , it is easy to resolve any type of math question on exam and can get very good score . but learning just the fact of math do n't help the student much in solving math . to summerise , understanding idea and concept is important not only to improove the grade in class but to practice and apply in real life , and also to make student future innovators , reaserchers and scientists .
