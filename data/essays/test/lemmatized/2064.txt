i agree that most advertisments make product seem much better than the reality are. i have many reason for that : first of all , what is wrettin in the lable of the product most likely do n't mintioned the disadvantage or side effect of the product , in the contrary we fined unaccurte information about the component 's quality , amout , taste . .. etc . the second thing that support my openion , like in the case of medicine or pesticide , we fined some word or information that show the product a the magic solution for the disese or the pest , more and more they use some religous article to support ther claim , for example , it is written in the lable of a particular pestcieds `` if water esist , then no need for tayamum '' which is a relegous article that implies that now need to use any ather pestcides when this pesticide is exsist the picture which is used to be in the advertisment or even in the lable of the oroiducts in maney wayes show the product in a non real show or at least not the same a the product is . i can say the producer use advertisment to complet the missing value of the product by the un reality advertisents
