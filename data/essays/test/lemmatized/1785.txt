some people believe that only doing what they already know how to do well is sufficiently for success . in my opinion , however , the opposite is true . to be able to successful in life we must try new thing , take risk and have knowledge about so many thing . if we want to be successful , we must try new thing . in the bussiness life , we always do regular thing . so , we earn same money . i am electronic engineer . when i started my new job , we wa buying some rudimentary electronic board . they were very simple , on the other hand , very expensive . i told to bos about designing our own board . he permited me , and i succeed it . now , we make much money than before . we must take risk to be successful . risk is the most important part of success . i went to bos to talk to him about designing our own board . this wa very risky for me , because if i could not achive to produce this board , i may be fired from my job . we bought new machine to produce them . in addition , i spend my time for only this work . these were very sufficient reason to be fired . but i had taken all these risk , and i achived it . the last action of the way of success is that we have to improve ourselves in many way . if we have good knowledge about our major , we can try new thing , and take risk . i mean these go hand in hand . if we ignore one of them , it is impossible to be successfull . in conclusion , i believe that there are three main component of succeess . these are to try new thing , take risk , and have good knowledge . however , everybody ha a different opinion about this issue , and i respect all of our view .
