advertisements are a big part of our life . we see them in the tv , on big board and even on building and we are greatly influenced by advertisement in the way we see and think about that particular product that is being advertised . it is very easy to think that a certain product look much better than it is , just by the way it is presented in advertisement . it can be misleading to solely believe in advertisement , because they may not be true . the advertisement are prepared by the company which produce the product . they can not be objective on this product , because they want to sell and gain profit from it . so the advertisement of a product may be prepared such that only the advantage or the good property of the product will be pointed out and disadvantage or bad property will be omitted . advertisements of fast-food company are an example to this situation . these advertisement only state how tasty their product and how much you would enjoy eating their product , but they never state how unhealthy their product are . people are influenced more a they watch the same advertisement over and over . because we see an advertisement for product at least hundred of time , we start to believe that the product ha quality and it is a thing that we need . it actually diffuses into our brain and after some time when you hear the name of that product , you have an urge buy that product . therefore if two company produce exactly the same product and they make it advertisement but one company ha more money to spend on more number of advertisement , the people will have a tendency to buy the latter product . this is the way big beverage company use to sell their product . people see the advertisement of these company so much that , whenever they are in a position to buy two beverage , they buy the product of the big company , thinking that it ha more quality and taste .
