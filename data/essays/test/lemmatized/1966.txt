along the history of mankind innovation wa very important to the human civilization . i agree on this because if we look at the history we will find that the maker of the history from philosopher , artist , scintests and leader refused to be ordinary people , and refused to make the thing the same way that every body make it , they took the risk of making some thing new , althought the risk wa some time very high and could affect their life and family , but they refused to be only copy of ancissors and they took the advantage . there is many example that demonstrates this fact along the history in the history of art for example we will find the expressionist who refused to make the classical style of drawing and painting and they tried new way depending upon color theory , althought there wa a complete refusal for what they are doing , and wa considerd completley unusual , we consider them now a the forerunner of the modern art , in scinece also we can notice this galilio for example had had a very diiferent prespective about the science and the earth however the people living in his time refused his idea , but a the time go he wa considered a a very sucsessful person . these people sacrifice with themselves in order to proof their idea and also they become a part of the history . even on a smaller scale in copmpanies and busniess we will find different example of yong people who tried new way in marketing , advertising , communicating with client which led to a dramatec change in the market . this is a part of the nature of the human brain to find unusual way to solve problem and this what we call creativitey when the idea is very new the pepole can refuse it in the begining but the future had always the final dessition .
