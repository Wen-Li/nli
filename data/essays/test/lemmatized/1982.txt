when it come to how to be a successful person , different poeple have unique opinion . some think that trying new thing but others hold that only do what they know and finish effectively . although both of them have advantage , i prefer to choose the secon doption . the first reason is the efficiency of finishing a work . ones we know how to complete it fluently , careless mistake or accident are easily prevented . their customer or client will admit they have a professional skill . these element can provide people the confidence and is worth to trust them . for example , if you are an engineer , people pay you to fix a car a they trust you have the knowledge to solve the problem . once , you make mistake or cause the problem even worse , no one will pay you anymore . the second one is the timemanagement . when we alrady know how to complite the work in a proper way , we save a lot of time instead of wasting time to ask people or look in reference book . for example , when you look for a job , you might find the occations that you know them already becaues you do n't need to spend extra time on learning new skill . you think you can handle it in a peroid of time . for sure , most employer prefer to employ an experenced worker . in conclusion , i suggest that only do the job what they have the skill on it . these element can lead a person become successful .
