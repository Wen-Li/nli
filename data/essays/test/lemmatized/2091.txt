being successful in something ha been a comman goal of human-being for century . success ha it criterion that should be possessed by any possible candidate . some people ha some certain kind of personal chracteristics that make them successful people . i agree with the idea that successful people try new thing and take risk to be able to see and reach what others can not do . first of all , being successful mean having something in hand that others do n't have . it can be a quality , a property , a skill etc . in order to have something that others do n't have people are supposed to try thing that were not tried before and they try to be the first . i mean if somebody follows the same way that others followed before he will arrive exactly the same location where others arrived . but instead of doing this if s/he take the risk and decides to take another route , s/he might arrive there faster or s/he might arrive some new place that everything is much more better compared to other place . for instance. a business man can not succeed in today 's business world by using the traditional trade technique . one who want to be successful should come with a different idea and risky plan . because all the others were tried before . secondly , people who are used to try new thing are innovative people searching the way to get higher . on the other hand , people who are doing the thing just how to do well are old-minded people and it 's very difficult for an old mind to be successful in a new world . even the sentence doing the thing that he know well sound strange . because if somebody is not a risk taker and doe n't try new thing how he might know that he is going to be much more successful in something else . by considering these i should say successful people are mostly from those of risk taker . as a result , success is having or doing something that others doe n't have or can not do at certain level that you do . i think that successful people are not afraid of taking new idea into consoderation and applying them . they try .
