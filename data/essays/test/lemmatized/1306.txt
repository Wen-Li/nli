i am completely agree with the statement , because when you undrstand idea and concept , you can learn logicaly the thing taugh . it happened to me when i wa in highschool , i had a history profesor that always said that the date are important , it is true , but when you understand the global thing , the logical chain of event , how one event in the past is linked with the next one , like a story , you will remember naturally the date in which the event ocurred . so that i followed my profesor 's advice and i start to understand the process of how and why the thing happened in the chilean history . suddenly , history became a very interesting subject , like a story and i barely could wait to the next class to continue learning . then , when i gave the test the date and fact just came to my head because i undertood the whole thing and why it happened . i think that if you only learn a fact , maybe you can remember it for the test , but some day you will foget it , because a rationale being , it doe not have many sence remeber thing only because . at least for me . maybe there are people with better memory than i , i used to study with a class mate that just keep fact and he repeted them once and again , i almost went crazy and realized that i can not study wth him anymore . with the pas of the year i become veterinarian and i still have some of the history knoledge that i once learned . but my classmate doe not remember a well a i the fact that occuried in the chilean history . nevertheless , we wa and are only two people and maybe my classmate did have the interest that i had in history . so that i think that is very important to understand idea and concept , it make easier the learning process , it worked for me then and it work for me now , but it is also very important the motivation that every person ha to face one subject .
