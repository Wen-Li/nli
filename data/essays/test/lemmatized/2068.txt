this is an era of cut throat competetion . be it education , sport or earnings . everyone is vying to get to the top and in the process might not desist from being slightly to overtly pretentetious . the same go for any company which is in the market to sell it product amidst competetors who are waiting for the slightest of the chance to cut into their sale figure . so one need to constantly try to convince their client or consumer that their product or service are the best available . to realise this goal the advertisement need to project more than what the product actually is . taking a more pragmatic look the whole behind an advertisement is to blindfold the consumer in buying the product . like the advertisement about a biscuit which claim that four piece of it will suffice the daily need of a growing child . or how about a soft drink advertisement making people believe that on having it will lead to a sense to pride for the motherland . the whole idea is to make the multitude believe that we offer something which is truant in other product . a big sized company spends millons of dollar on these advertisement just to create a buzz in the place in order to attract more consumer hence generating more profit even if this call for a slight over or incorrect representation of the product quality . if the end result is profit everyone is game for it . i feel that the over accentuation is the major objective of any advertisement and the onus lie on the people to identify those point and make an educated choice . just going by what a company is projecting on medium can prove to be too ignorant a decision . a more researched pick is what is needed in today 's world where nothing is real .
