abundant thing in our life are worth analyzing and judging . when it come to whether ha a tour guide is the best way to travel in a group . some maintain that it is rational while others advocate that the reverse is true . adittedly , there can be some notable truth in both argument . yet my experience account my preference that it will be better if having a tour guide in a group . now i will list some point to support my preference . first of all , one strong argument is that it will be very safe if having a tour guide . when we have a tour to go to a place , it maybe unfamiliar with this place . having a tour guide can tell u where is danger to travel , however it can make u de safety and prevent dangerous thing to happen . beside , it can be reasonable to say that we can learn a lot of interesting thing from a tour guide . be a tour guide , he must be well-known about this place , so he can introduce many historical or amazing thing about that place . so we can know some knowledge from the tour guide . what is more , there is a good evident that having a tour guide can make me friend with the tour guide . for example , i travelled tokyo in the last summer vocation , my parent and friend did not accompany with me . i made friend with the tour guide , he told many thing about tokyo , i wa very happy during the vocation . so that wa why i think having a tour guide is a good way . taking all the factor into consideration , i think it is the best way in the group led by a tour guide . of course , carl marx teach u to take a dialectic view , it will have some good aspect touring alone , such a more cheaper . it can prove there are merit in both attitude . well , depending on my personal idea and experience , i think it can be better to have a tour guide rather than travel alone .
