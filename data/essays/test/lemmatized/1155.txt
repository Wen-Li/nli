now-a-days for every person knowledge should be there in every aspect with out this we can not do any work . depending on person knowledge will be differ . i prefer to have broad knowledge of many subject than to specialize in one subject to support my opinoin i have strong reason and example . first if we have knowledge in only one subject then we cannoy score on other subject . at present competative world for the success of any person he should know every subject . second we can not get a rank unless we have to study all subject . if study one subject we will certainly fail in remaining subject . all subject are important for a school student and a college student . for example i have perosonal experience a week before i went to a entrance test for embedded course but i shocked by seeing the paper because in that paper vlsi subject also given even it is not necessery for embedded course . lastly from this i know we should have knowledge of many subject instead of one subject . and many great people say that it is better to learn more subject then only we can improve our knowledge . by studying more subject we can know more information in different aspect . for the better result we must know different subject . particularly in academic subject we must learn all subject then only we can know lot information form it . in my school day i learn all subject so i got good rank in my class . so , i think that many advantage are there in learning more subject even it is strain to study all subject . for the better result of a student he must read all subject which will increase his knowledge .
