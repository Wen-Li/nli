i am agree with the statement cause i think that all the new tecnology and new discovers around the world are being made for people who try new thing and take risk . as a good example some of the cure to a dissease a malaria were inveted for a great colombian investigator whose name is mauel elkin patarroyo this doctor with limit resource and a lot of criticals ahd the ability of discover a vacun against the malaria , this dessease appears most comon in african people cause they style of life . thanks to this discover people in africa could be able to have a solution to that terrible dessease . after this manuel elkin patarroyo becomes a great scientis and move on in new researh for dessease . other intrepid person wa cristobal colon who wa the discover of america , he tougth that it wa arrived to africa but a resolt of try to find another way to get there he dicovered a new continet . many people tougth he wa crazy but at the end he got a lot of excellents rewords a gold and a new culture . people who do not want to take risk are person that thik that everything is done and that it is nothing new to invent o discover , this people are going to be unsuccessful cause they do not work for the progress of their county or ther own life . they expect that people who try new thing doing their job , then they can enjoy the new discover without an effort . some people tought taht if they try to do new thing they are going to fall down , but if you do not take a risk you are not be sure if you work is good . it coulbe a good a you can win a nobel price for it . so take risk and discover a wreat world full of fantasy .
