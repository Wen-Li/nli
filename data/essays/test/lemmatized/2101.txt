i disagree with this statement and am quite sure that the number of car world-wide will even increase . one plausible argument against my assumption could be the energy resource of the world , especially the currently main resource for running a car , oil , is running out in the future . but this objection can be easily wiped away with the argument that the oil resource will definitely last longer than only 20 year . even when the consumption of oil is rapidly increasing currently this wo n't lead to the drying out of oil well within 20 year . big oil company invest a lot of money in detecting always new oil field . now a this objection to my statement ha been discussed i would like to sum up some reason for my supposition . in the industrialiyed country mobility is a decisive factor for people to get a job . without a car the job search is nearly impossible nowadays a mobility is a capability which is expected from all job applicant . as wife and husbond often work at different place there is a basic need for both of them to be mobile and therefore even in the industrialized country the number of car will even rise . but when i am thinking of a rising number of car , in the first place i have country like china and india on my mind . both country have booming economy with record profit each year . this will automatically result in growing income and growing prosperity of their population . chinese and indian people who will have more money will definitely feel inclined to spend their money on luxury good they were not able to afford a few year ago . that people in these country behave like this can even be seen nowadays . the booming economy ha created meanwhile an upperclass which spends it money on luxury good . cars belong to these desired luxury good also . when the booming industies of both country will go on like this with yearly economic growth rate this will generate higher income for more and more social class in these country . these people a well will then be proned to display their newly won prosperity with a luxury good like a car . if we consider the gigantic population which both state have , we can be very sure that the number of car in the world will certainly rise very quickly . even when this behaviour will certainly result in more air pollution and the running out of resource , this will be a fact which will be disregarded by most people . to appeal to the reason of people will be useless .
