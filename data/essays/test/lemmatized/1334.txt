effect of advertisement on the apperance of goods and services i agree with the idea of that most advertisement enables to the good and service seem much better to consumer than they really are . advertisements are created and planned very carefully to attract consumer to look at that specific product and affected of that introduction . thus people who work in this job try to persuade consumer to buy that good or service . unfortunately this motivation of advertisement personal mostly force them to exaggerate the product 's quality . the effective way of advertisement ( ad ) which are usually introduced at tv program try to affect the target audiance like child , young people , woman or men . for example , ad that mainly trying to capture young population and persuading them to buy some specific product like parfumes or deodorant usually use the school or party location in that many student are together and the girl or boy who use that adverted parfume can affect his or her friend by the marvelleus smelling effect of the product . so the boy or girl believe that the product is so different that everybody will aware of his smelling even at the walking way , restaurant or even in a very crowded happy year party . thus the ad reached their aim to eanble the boy to buy that product . but the consumer like this boy will never satisfy with that parfume because mostly nobody will ask him about what kind of parfume he is using , so he will become dissatisfied and will think that the product is not good enoug a introduced in the ad . the job of advertisement is unfortunately includes some kind of exaggerament of the the product 's quality to affect potential buyer and force them to select that product when they go to the shopping place . thus most consumer usually do n't satisfy with the product of they bought bt the effect of ad on tv or other medium tool . so consumer should be aware of the ad they watched or seen are not reflect all the time the right quality of that product .
