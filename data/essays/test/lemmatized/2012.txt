actually , i agree with this idea because many reason . first , i think when the student understand the idea and concept the subject he will able to work well . for example , the chemist , if he understand the idea he could explain the chemistry . on the other hand if he just learn fact about the chemistry he will not be able to explain . second , if anybody understand anything he will never forget it whatever time long but if he learn fact that will make him may forget it after long time . and even if the one who understand forget , he wo n't take long time to rememmber what he understand . for instance , you can see the scientests who very old can remmeber , explain and express many thing which young people ca n't mention it . learn fact look like momerizing . if there is any exption you will not be able to figure or distinguish it . understanding idea make you able to solve or obsorve any quistion or problem you will face even it exption . for example of this tow case , we can take the mathmatics a example for subject . even you know all fact about it , and if you did n't understand it you will fail by any treky quistion . finally , i think learn fact is old method to study . when the people did n't have the ability to understand thing and many phenomna over the world may they have to learn fact a it a . but today , i think we have the ability to understand and we have the book and many recoces we can u it to explain thing . so , understanding is demand in this time and learn fact will not help peple to prduce
