life is full of experience and adventure . some people rely on their main knowledge and try to improve it . on the other hand , some people try to take risk and prefer adventure . i think the first group , who do what they already know , are better for several reason such a the accuracy , the chance and the ability to expect the result . when someone is spontonous and doe everything without deep thinking or try to take a risk in a feild he or she know nothing about . sometimes , they acheive succeed , get lot of money and be famous without lot of work or even with it . it happens by chance , however it is infrequent . the probability of succeeding is very low . in addition , if they failed after a long working , hoping and trying , the damage might be severe both finicially and emotionally . on the other hand , there is a group of people who like to keep doing what they are used to do . in this case , these people try to improve and build on their previous knowledge . they invent , enhance invention and make innovation . for example , thomas edison , he tried more than a hundered of time before inventing the electric light bulb . it wa not a chance , it wa the harvest of hard continious working about something he already knew . another example is the mobile phone , it is an innovation that have come after the home phone and sattlelite . the people who invented it were not taking a risk . they had an idea and tried to improve it until they invented the mobile phone . moreover , what have come from the hard working and doing what they know to do is most of the time expected , accurate and well-done . finally , improving and enhancing the previous knowledge and doing what you like give you a better chance to do something more successful . in conclusion , i prefer to do what i already know how to do well , because the failing chance is much le . also , most of the time the result are more satisfying . in additon , at least you can expect the result and you know what are you doing .
