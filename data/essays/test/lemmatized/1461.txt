i do agree with the statement that `` most advertisement make product seem much better than they really are . '' some might argue that advertisement merely educate the viewer about the availability of product but i appreciate the fact that advertisement also place the product and make them look better than what they are . in fact the purpose of advertisement have graduated from educating the potential buyer to make the product look better and create a need for it . that is exactly why there is a boom in the advertising industry a more company hire professional advertising agency to design their advertisement . let me consider an example of an apparel brand to establish the above mentioned fact . an apparel company when advertises a shirt or an undergarment , employ a good looking model to wear and display the product . it is quite obvious that the outfit would look much better on that model than it would look on any other common buyer . another example that i would like to use in strenghthening my point is of ` celebrity endorsement ' . in the last few decade and increased number of company have started to employ celebrity to advertise for and endorse their product . even in t.v commercial we often see sport or movie celebrity using or talking about a product . this , is my opinion is an attempt made by the comapny or the advertising agency to make the prodect look better than it is , because it possible that the celebrity himself never actually think of the product a highly a he appears to in the advertisement and never us it himself . he is merely used by the brand to suggest the viewer of the commercial that the product is a good a for a celebrity of that stature to use it . conclusively , i feel that advertisement nowadays primarily make the product look better
