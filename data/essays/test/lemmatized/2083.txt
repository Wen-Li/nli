most advertisement make product seem much better than they really are . it doesnt matter what product , it could be fondations , eye shadow , lip gloss , eye linear and many more . in magazine , we see girl that look amazing out of the lip gloss , so we buy lip gloss , and it end up looking way different . the eye make up too a well . though there 's some advertisments which are real , like hand cream , accessory and many other stuff . but most of them are just waste of money and time a well . however , woman that are interested in such thing , they would keep on buying and getting stuff , thinking that they look way better with the product . though they dont know that it no good for their skin . i remember a friend of mine went once to this huge skin care , and she knew that she 's going to pay way more than 200 buck ! but she said , `` oh it ok , it going to make me look good , i really want to try this cream on . '' it wa this browny cream which look extremely disgusting , but because she saw that picture of a woman who used it , she believed it ! she spent over 250 $ to get her face done and it ended up having this brown thing stucked in her face ! and her skin is really bad now , it like a cream that burned her face not fixed it . though in the picture she looked so sexy , hot and no word would describe her . i do n't really recommand to get product without making sure it ha in , what it made of , make a huge research about it , and ask people who tried it instead doing it blindly ! its really interesting to get our skin cleaned , and take care of our beauty ! but i guess it 's much nicer to make sure what we are using before going ahead and doing it ! right , most advertisement make product that seems nice , but my point is to make sure of it , dont look at picture , look at the main skin !
