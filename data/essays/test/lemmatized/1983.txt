advertisments what is the real main of the adversiments ? and why every commany or producer make adversiments for there new product ? and is all the adverisement is true or some of it true ? and is the protuct is really good in the real like in the advertisments ? these question come to our mind when we read this topic ( advertsiments ) . ok i will discuse thes question in this essay . first of all i think that the advetisments real main is to show how is the thing is good so the people can bye it and producer get from it alot of money , but is every advertisments it not true i think some of it true but in the advertisment the make the thing more better than in real than is not wrong they just want to sell there thing , but there some of the advertisments make the thing look realy good and in the real it not hafl of the good in the advertisments . however i belive that if the company want to sell something they have to make for it an a good advertisments because the some of the people or you can say all of them like thing from looking to it in the t.v or in the paper , so from that in the bussines world every comany make an advertisments better than the other and presuade the people to by there thing and last not least in those day every new comany need a good advertisment to sell there thing . i think you know that i agree that most advertisments make product seem much better than they really are . and in my opinion every time the advertisments lie or not show the truth about the product sell more than the advertisments that show the whole truth and nothing more , it just my opinion .
