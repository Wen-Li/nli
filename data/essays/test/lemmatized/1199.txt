some people say that it is better to go on trip alone without a tour guide . however , i do not agree that traveling alone is always beneficial for someone . first , trip in a group led by a tour guide can be more convenient . second , it will be time-saving . above all , traveling in group is convenient . of course , traveling alone can give a poeple a sense of independence . however , trip in a group led by a guide is more convenient than trip alone . let me take my last year trip to erope can be an example . when i wa in the second of college , i decided to travel to erope alone . at first , i thought that i will be able to find where i am supposed to go by myself . however , i will not be able to know how i have to go . i did not know where place is good , which food is better . i regreted that if i had traveled in group with a travle guide , i would have had convenient trip . this show that traveling in group with someone who know that place is very convenient . next , traveliing in group can be time-saving . some people argues that trip alone is effective . however i disagree that it is time-saving . most of people go on trip to somwhere they never had experienced . as a result , when people travel alone , he or she will use a lot of time to decide where they go to and what they do . my parent ' last trip to america can be an example . their trip to us is first for them , so they decided to travel with a tour guide . a guide helped them trip to more easily giving the useful information about america . after traveling , they talked me that it is more time and money saving because of a kind tour guide . they were able to reduce expense and time by doing so . in conclusion , traveling in group with a guide can be beneficial to traveler . first , it ' convenient . second , it 's time saving .
