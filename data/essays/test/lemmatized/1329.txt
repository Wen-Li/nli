if i were to answer to this question before i attended the university , i would definitely have answered yes . however , in course of time , my judgement of advertisement became more strict and a my understanding of advertisement have changed in considerable amount . back then , i assumed that advertisement , no matter what their level of quality and sophistication are , could warrant that a product would look better and be sold immediately . think about it ! at the time , you see the product being advertised , you get influenced and are convinced to buy it . however , what if the way the product is made look better than it actually is , is totally silly ? would it not fail to now that i think about my previous thought and try to answer the question above , i realize how wrong they are . as a more critical consumer , i believe that the advertisement aiming to fool consumer by showing the product better than they are , do not go unnoticed by the consumer . in other word , consumer can easily recognize when advertiser are exagerrating the feature of a product . then , the reaction to the advertosement would be : how silly is that ! in order to prevent such reaction , the advertiser , especially the one that are expilicitly tried to fool the consumeres , should take the consumer ' intellectual level into considereation . maybe , they manage to make the product seem better , but they forget to pay attention to the attidute of consumer . as a counter reaction they might reject to buy the product not anymore . to sum up , my insight into the advertisement is that they try to make he product look better than is but most of of them fail to succeed to convince the conscious consumer . as a result , the product would seem exagerrated and some consumer could reject to buy it .
