young people are very busy with buzzing job or academic schedule nowadays and hardly find time to help their community . the people are so much involved with the work that they hardly find time to attend their family even . these busy bee mostly reside in busy locality or apartment where it would even matter if the person stop and wish his/her neighbour leisurely and ask him/her about her weekend plan . the work at the office take place in different shift which run aound the clock and they hardly find time to atleast see one another . there are some kid who leave for school early in the morning and hardly find time to see their own parent . the young people who study have their school and college run for such long hour and also the growing competition in world compels them to stay way from the community affair . each individual should firstly realise it by himself/herself that he/she is responsible about working and helping the community which can include the grooming activity , cutting down cost on resource utilised by the community , spending time with the older generation , taking to them , learning from their experinences ; organising gathering regularly , conducting game for kid , etc . there are community which organise some gathering for these busy people on weekend . for example they can organise some indoor or outdoor game for these people to relax and spend sometime together so that they can share some of their experience , problem which can be resolved through eachother . there can be mythological gathering like in india there are festival celebrated like ganesh chathurthi , dusshera and diwali many gathertings are organised in the holy name of god and people get sometime to spend together . but one point should be highlighted that being , blaming the people completely for the busy schedule will not be fair . as the competitive world requirement are soo huge that people try to work out everything in the 24 hour day and sometimes even use up the weekend to meet up the deadline for their project . so , according to me it completely how we manage the show because nothing should be given least importance a everything come up to give a wholesomeness or completeness to something important in our life .
