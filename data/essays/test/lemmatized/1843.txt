i strongly agree that successful people try new thing and take calculated risk . however they strive hard and generally continue doing what they do well . i would say that the ability to take calculated risk is a trait of a successful man . successful people have the unique trait of taking calculated risk and learning new thing . a wider learning increase their horizon , leading to opportunity to grow and becoming more successful . for example richard brason ha been a extreamely successful man and he ha taken immense risk both personally and professionally . he started out in the music industry and took the virgin group to aviation industry and now looking to capture outer space . he took the risk of entering the aviation industry without training or knowledge and created a unique place for his group . personally he took high risk adventure like ballon flying without having been trained professionally . however with determination and focus he learnt the trick and skill to fly . another example of successful people and their ability to take risk would be ratan tata , chairman of tata group . amid strong opposition and discouragement he led tata motors to take the risk of a making the cheapest car and successfully completed the project by creating the nano , the cheapest car , costing le that $ 250 . there are numerous business house that have risked their business with calculated decision and opted for the risky takeover of company for larger maginitute . for eample the tata corus deal and the arcelon mittal deal . admittedly there are numerous successful leader who continue to do what they do best and devote their energy to their core business such a technology , finance . these industry sustain and gain a competitive edge in the industry thus requiring their leader to take risk andsome tough decision . for example , narayan murthy the software tycoon who started infosys a leading indian software company focused on transperency and ethic in the industry . he risked losing project by going this way and ha taken some tough stand to lay the foundation for these principle . in sum , successful people always take calculated risk and learn new thing and widen their horizon . some go further and diversify into other area to grow their business while others grow leader in their core business .
