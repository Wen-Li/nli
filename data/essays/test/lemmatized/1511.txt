without a doubt , it is more important for student to know idea and concept than it is for them to memorize fact by hard . by just learning fact , student may only remember them for a short period of time . after a while , they will forget everything . this is not an effective way to study . i believe the most effective way to study is to learn how to derive fact . first of all , in my experience , i have suffered a lot from memorizing formulars in physics . even though i can input all formulars before exam , i always forget after exam have finished . but there is an exception . for those formulars that my physics teacher ha derived for me , i still remeber completely . he ha taught me the way to find one formular by combining and calculating using different formulars . by doing this , i am able to remeber the origin of formulars which always alert me when i see them . moreover , student can learn more if they participate in class discussion . during history class , i did not participate in class discusison just because i wa too shy to say my own opinition . however , after a while when i got use to situation , i have began to say my opinion . and that moment , i have realized that i can learn more if i interact with other people because they have different view , perspective and answer . from then , i have always been trying to gain other people 's opinion . in addition , bill gates , the creater of microsoft is one of many who ha absorb idea and concept by himselves . he ha been studying in harvard university , however , he quit schooling and ha began to study about computer on his own . he ha formed a team to interact , communicate and learn more about computer from the perspective of concept . at that time , there were only few computer developed in the world , so he had very small amount of fact . he ha developed idea on his own and ha acheived to create personal computer for home use . learning fact are only useful if student want to remember only a short period of time . but when it come to research , they should use many kind of source and teacher to understand idea and concept .
