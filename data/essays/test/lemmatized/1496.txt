success is somthing that all people in the world are looking for . it is not something easy to success in the world . thus , people who successed in somthing may try new thing because they are looking to be successful in every thing . however , i agree with statement which said that `` successful people try new thing and take risk rather than olny doing what they already know how to do well '' for certain reason that i am going to mention in this essay . first of all , how did they success ? when we ask ourself this question we will know that not all successful people successed because the know thing well . some successful people successed because the take the risk of trying new thing . for example , a milionener in my home town maid all his miliones by taking risk when he bought a piece of land by all his money . he kept it for some year . then , he sold it with miliones of dolars . secondly , some people who already successed in some filed love to try new thing in another filed . let is take an example the basketball player miechal jordon . he acted in some movie in hollywood and he successed in that filed . he made miliones of dolars by trying a new filed . also some successful football player who started acting in some advertisement . of coures , no relationship between the advertisments and the football . in conclusion , to be successful in one filed doe not mean stop trying new thing and depened on that filed . no it is mean more than that . it is mean that you are a successful person and you may success in a new thing . this is my theory in this life . by taking all the reason that i have mentioned and my theory that is why i agree with the statementh .
