the industry of advertising ha developed so tremendously that advertisement and commercial have become an inevitable part of our daily life . there is not a single day that we have not seen an ad on a billboard a we drive our car , or we have not encountered a commercial on television while we are wathcing our favourite tv show . but , the question is that are the advertisement really decent and reflect the reality ? or are they simply the product of some subtle strategy to deceive u and make use of our money ? i have the opinion that advertisement are really convincing u that the product are much better than they are in reality . firstly , the purpose of an advertisement is to persuade u to buy the mentioned product whatever the quality of the product is . for this aim , it is very typical of advertisement to exaggerate the desired property of the product . it may even happen that the product do not have the marvellous property suggested in the ad . for example , i once saw a commercial on television about a shampoo claiming that my hair will be so soft a it ha never been if i use that shampoo . consequently , i went to the market and purchased the product . however , when i washed my hair with it , i saw that it wa even worse than my ordinary shampoo that i wa already using . another reason why i am convinced that advertisement are deceiving is based on my observation about the industry . the industrial process of sale , which cover a wide range of phase like the preparation and the production of the item , the transportation of the product to several market and selling the product , involves a huge amount of money . production and sale is an industrial process , and the unique aim of this process is nothing but making money out of it . as far a money is concerned , the producer will do anything to cut down on the capital spent to prepare the product . so why spend a treasure on the production phase to implement product of exceptional quality instead of producing something with just moderate feature and being persuasive enough to make people but it ! these point bring me to the conclusion that the advertisement are not reliable and accurate enough to believe in them and plan our purchasing habit based on them . we must not believe what we see and what they want u to believe , but we must behave according to our own reasoning when we are spending our money .
