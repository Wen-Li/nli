from primary school to highschool pupil have to work on many different subject such a mathematics , biology , litterature . but when those pupil become student , they generally have to specialize in one or several subject . thus , it seems to me that knowing lot of thing about lot of subject is necessary to obtain a good generall knowledge and to chose what to study at university . first , when somebody go to college , he ha to think about what his professional future will look like and about what it would be better for him to study . on the one hand , i tend to think that to concentrate on one subject is not enough to acquire a good competence in the working market but on the other hand it seems hard to have an extremely good knowledge of many subject . for instance , if one want to be a manager and if he just study management he will not know why he ha this fuction and why he need to do this . he will not have a good knowledge of his job . furthermore , though one is a very good manager and doe not have a good knowledge of foreign language it will be very hard for him to adapt in business . moreover , nowadays more thant few decade ago the master of few subject is required to obtain a good chance to have a job . some people thing that if they know thing about lot of subjets they will be prefered to people who have been specialized in their whole scholar education . it is not always true . the student 's personnality is very important but , of course if a student is very good in few subject and that he ha an interesting personnality it will help him to find a job that 's why to specialize in two or three subject is essential for me .
