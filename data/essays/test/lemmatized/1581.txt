it is often said that advertisement is a form of lying , that most of the time consumer do not buy their expectation . i do not agree with this assumption . first of all , advertisement are made by salesman and woman . their final goal is , logically , to sell a product . in order to sell a product certain thing are needed but the most important one is the envy of the customer . a good salesman will present his product in a way that his customer will get the feeling that he need that product more than anything else in the world . every good salesman ha an ethical code and so is not supposed to lie to his client , but logically he will always emphasize the positive feature of his product . normal salesmanship doe not start with citing every negative aspect of the product . second , i call upon the responsibility of the buyer . it is very easy to blame advertisement for misbuys , but in this modern age information is everywhere . consumers can inform themselves about product in numerous way and they always must take into account the point of view of the advertiser , which is to promote their product . when a consumer ha not informed himself properly he must not play stupid afterwards . do advertisement make product seem better that they really are ? yes , but everybody should take that into consideration when purchasing something . the rule of the game are clear , when people feel cheated on , they should reread their manual .
