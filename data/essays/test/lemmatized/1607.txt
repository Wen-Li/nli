i 'm surely agree with the statment . i think that very often advertisement lead our perception of reality in the wrong path . and there are different way , i think , that buisness , or company in general , use in order to convince u that something is really good . i think that one mean they use is the amount of advertisments . in fact we you can find everywhere a picture of a product , or you can listen to a person who speaks about another product , and so on . for examle when you wacth the televison or you read newspaper you will surely find at least half of the information about something that someone want you to buy . thank to this tecnique you are led to buy something . however , very often , if you buy it , you will be disappointed just because the good or the service you have bought doe n't correspond with the thing you had seen before . moreover , in my opinion , it would be interesting understand also the reason thanks to someone lead u to buy something even if we know that very often they do n't correspond with the reality . however i think that this is one difficoult problem because it 's related with our faculty to choose freely and it should be explained with some psychologiacl aspect . i do n't think it would be appropriate to speak about them . i want rather exaplain an example that happend to me just three day ago . i needed a new brush for my hair . i wa wathcing tv in the evening and suddently an adertisement occurres on televison . it described a vary multi functional brush with battery included ( there wa a beautiful girl in the spot ! ) . of course i 've bought it but i 've soon realized that it wa very different from televison . it wa very small and above all it wa everything except useful !
