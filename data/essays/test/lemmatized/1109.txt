the education system or education board in most of the country encourage ( most of the time without wanting to ) student to learn fact instead of understand idea and concept . i strongly dissagree with that method of teaching student . the student should be abble after graduating to use their brain to look at situation from another perspective and reasonably find a solution to a problem in the working enviroment or how i will call it `` the real world '' . in the academic world with the educational system of the country have the promote the student to learn fact of just memorize answer to pas the the test and the forget it all . a person that it is capable to reason a topic instead of just memorazing fact about it , will have to study fewer time or prepare for a test in a more calmly way , whereas the one who just memorize the subject ha to study a large ammount of time so his brain can storage the information . besides that employer will rather hire a employee whose grade were not that good but he can solve problem just by thinking throught it , that having a employee whose grade were excellent but he can not solve a problem a simply a the other one . the real world it is much more than just fact , is using the brain and feed it with idea and concept and thinking about it through . that is way i think the education board on each country should prepare and give the student 's brain tool to really think and face the real world . a change need to be made if we want to have success people and reasonable person in our every day enviroment and it all beging whit the tipe of education we give them .
