many people travel in a group led by a tour guide in my country . it wa more poppular than travelling alone about ten year ago . however more and more young people want to travel alone because they prefer to having free time and to deciding by themselves when or where to go . even though i prefer to trvelling alone , i agree with the statement `` the best way to travel is in agroup led by a tour guide '' especially for first time traveler . there are many advantage if we travel in group . first of all , we do not have to worry about the schedule , transportation , place to go and stay . it is not easy to handle them . the tour giude and company provide them in best way . they are professionalists of traveling and have a lot of experineces , so in many time they provide perfect schedule for situation . and then safety is the most important factor that the beginner travlers are concerned about before departure . they might be worried about the place where they are going because they do not knoe about them . however , with a tour guide , it would be safe . he or she must have experince and knowlege about it . in addition , the tour giude can give a lot of information of the place to travel . it make the travel more valueable and exciting . if we travel alone , we should study the place where we are travelling . we should find out where to visit . some time the tour guide have various experinces and usually have great knowlege about the place , so he or she can explain other story . in conclusion , i think it is a good idea to travel in a group , especially it you are a beginner traveller . when we travel , we can face various situation unexpectedly . it might be stressful to slove them , so it is not possible to enjoy the trip . it can be a waste of time and money . therefore , i strongly recommend trvelling in a group to some people . after then , you can challenge to a travel alone . it would be wodnerful .
