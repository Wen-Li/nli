while i am a child , i wa always thinking about school and how unnecessary they were . i think the reason that made me think this way wa , i wa memorizing the information that is tought me for my life . i can still hear my idea about my complaint from my childhood . now i understand better , i should learn , whatever i need , by understanding . at first , we should know about that why we we are learning , why we are going to school or why we are sending our child to education place . are they , for our entertainment or in order to keep our child from bad habbits or hazardous thing . absolutely no . of course our idea base on knowledge we want them to learn or we want to know . what is knowlege ? the knowledge , information , is the thing we experienced before . we are learning because someone already discovered , found , experienced and lived . `` there is no big stupidty , testing the thing experienced before '' . we are always providing better knowledge for our nation and generation to hepl them to advance to superiour and while we doing this we are racing with time even we do n't realize . when we focus on our education and the way we learn also a a comparation to my childhood year we should understand idea and conceps we learned . when we understand something , it mean to i consume that knowledge and digest and make it my part . if learn something a a fact , it can change with another fact we met at the future and it doe n't be stable . in addition , it doe n't help u develop our future . we always play with same idea because we we did n't learn it when we are suppose to . finally , it is more important for me to understan idea and conceps than it is for them to learn fact . it 's more helpfu
