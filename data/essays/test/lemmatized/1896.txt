although it is more important for student to learn fact than it is for them to understand idea and consepts , i believe that it is more important for student to understand idea and consepts . there are two reason for this : more useful and more edicational . first of all , to understand idea and concept is more useful in the future . for example , to my experience , when i wa a jonior high school student , my math teacher did not tell the answer immidiatry . i would to know the answer fast . however he teach u importance oh thinking . second , to understand idea and concept is more educational than to lean fact . when student learn concept , they can think of matter . if a lecturer thought student only fact , student do not consider . for example , according to the survey in my country , in the case that a teacher do not tell fact , 70 % student try to find fact in their own . for these reason , i agree that it is more important to understand idea and concept .
