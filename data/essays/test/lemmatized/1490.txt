once upon a time , a man said that the earth is not the center of our solar system , but just a planet orbiting the sun just like the other planet . now we know that it is the fact , but for the time this idea wa presented , it wa n't accepted that easily , a we now think of it a a daily fact . facts are there for u to realize , but the idea are the ignition model for them to be realized . i remember a story about a native shaman , showing the habitant of an island a ship coming from far , the citizen do n't actually recognize , or even see , the ship first , because they do n't have the concept of a ` ship ' in their mind . the shaman is the only wise person that is guiding the community to realize a new fact . as this is a story whether true or fabricated , i think that the idea are really important for student , a much a fact . in the mean of further earning a life , student ca n't actually make a living out of idea , but they are the thing that provide success for their work . think of a physic student ; in school , he or she learns concept , notion of the nature law , and then cook whar he or she learns us this a a basis for understanding mathematical model of the universe we live in , and applies this information to older model to investigate the world we live in further . after many year of research hard work , eventually , a fact like gravity , or little particle called atom come into the focus of the science field . without an idea of a ` city ' , i think that the theater played , or the road we walk would n't be around . the important thing is to understand concept , i would probably agree with that ; although the fact that i do n't have any money to buy ticket for a movie that i definitely want to see .
