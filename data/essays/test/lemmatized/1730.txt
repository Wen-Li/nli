in my opinion , i agree with the statement ` it is more important for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact . ' first and the foremost , fact sometimes change over time , but the basic theroies do n't . for example , in the past , according to the classic physic , the earth is the center of the space ; however , scientist discover that the earth is a part of solar system and is not the center of it . likewise , many observation and technology currently teached in school will change . for instance , the appliaction of computer in two decade ago is so different from today . yet , the basic theory are the same . so , understand idea and concept can train student 's ability to adapt the future . in the like manner , reasoning and critical thinking are the essential skill for student to succeed in future career . the real world have so many unexpected thing , that can not be learnt from the lesson . without the understanding of the basic concept of the surroundings , it seems not possible to deal with the change in the real world a well a future career . in particular , the business world , nobody can tell the best way to do thing . there is no book can teach the fact for solving problem , because every problem is unique . students have to apply the skill they develped in school . last but not least , basic theory and concept are the root of knowledge , they are imperative for development and invention for the new techologies . for example , no medical and biological concept , people can not invent new drug . in short , understanding of the basic theory and concept not only can train citical thinking and reasoning skill of student , but also can help them to prepare their future career . so understanding the idea and concept are more important in the education .
