a difficult moment for a professor , when he prepares his lesson , is often to choose whether he will be more attentive to teach his student a particular fact or a general idea . i am conviced that the main point is for student to understand the idea and concept . first of all , a particular fact always contains particular piece of information that are not necessary to understand one fact , and risk to make trouble in a student 's thought . for example , to explain the concept of legitime defense , it is always difficult to find a perfect example because fact can be interpreted different way . on the contrary , the idea itself contains the essential that must be kept in mind , without perturbating element . moreover , a concept allows a student to get a more general knowledge ; free from particular circumstance , he can use his new concept and adapt them to what he see . a concept give a general informafor example , he can recognize a case of legitime defense more easily while comparing a precise event to the definition he learned , than while comparing it to another particular event , that could have difference or similitude that have nothing to do with the point . this example can be generalized not only to justice , but also to mathematics and physic , that must be conceptualized to be understood . of course , a concept is le easy than a fact to understand , because it is more abstract . but a student should know how to use his knowledge in different circumstance and how to adapt all he learned to what he is confronted to . therefore , fact can be a good way to understand concept and idea , but they are not the most important to be remembered in the end : they are just a step in the learning of concept , that allow u to really understand phenomenon . once understood , an idea is more powerful than a fact .
