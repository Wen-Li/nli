although i can understand people argueing that there will be more car in use in twenty year from now than there are today , i support the idea that there will be fewer car in use . there are three main reason why i think this will be the case . first , during the last ten year oil price went up constantly . this wa mainly caused by political tension arising between country providing and consuming oil . i think this development will continue since most political conflict causing these tension still exist today and because there are no easy solution available to solve these problem in the near future . therefore , with oil price continuing to rise , le and le people will be able to afford to pay the fuel needed for their vehicle and a a consequence , the number of car in use will decrease . second , global oil resource are shrinking . it is becoming more and more difficult to bring oil to the earth 's surce and to find new source of oil . this is backed by the fact that already today an increasing amount of off-shore oil platform are built and that oil is already being explored in life-threatening area like the polar region . therefore , since fuel supply come to an end and since alternative technology like hydrogen powered car will probably not yet be publically available , shrinking global oil resource are a further reason why number of car in use during the next twenty year will decrease . third , air pollution will continue to dramatically increase in the future . this put a serious threat to people 's health and a country 's citizen ' living quality . therefore , it is very likely that country start to restrict and even reduce the number of car allowed on their street . as a consequence , in twenty year there will be fewer car in use than there are today . considering all the argument and development mentioned above , i think it is very clear that in twenty year , there will be fewer car in use than there are today . personally , i hope that i will still be able to drive my own car , since i would miss the convenience of unrestricted mobility very much .
