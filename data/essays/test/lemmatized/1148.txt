even though some people might disagree , i strongly agree with the statement that most advetisement help product seem better than real value . first , i , recently , bouhgt a new car because it advetisement is very attractive . i just wanted simple designed car which ha only basic function . i did not need any music instrument in my car . one day , i saw a tv commercial of the car i considered whether to buy . in the promotion , one cool guy wa driving very fast . soon after that , i dicided to buy it because i admired the man in tv commercial . even though my ha basic function that i needed , it looked very stylish more than the real car . second , i also bought new computer . in the store , i talked with sale representative about some kind of computer . he strongly reccomended to buy dell one . he appealed swift reacion of keyboard , high-speed access to internet , and light weight . i recognized that other type of computer that i considerd to buy were not so much different from dell one . however , his promotion deipicted more multi-functioned and useful than others . then i bought dell one . in conclusion , on the basis of reason i discussed above , i disagree with the statement that most adverstiesement make product look better than those of reality .
