i do agree this statement . taking risk make u successful . if we do n't try new thing or we scare a lot from changing , we won '' t be able to get what we want . for instance , in business life , if somebody want to be an entrepreneur , but scare to lose his/her money , he wo n't even be able to start a business and will keep working for somebody else . and probably he wo n't be productive and motivated to be successful . especially , technology effect our life . my mother is a kind of person who doe n't like to try new thing . since we are pretty far to each other , she had to learn how to use computer to communicate me . now she is able to use the computer for her work and this make her work life easier and faster . so she ha time for her social life and she doe n't have to worry while she is working . so , trying to learn computer make her more successful . risks also give people enough ambition to succee . i like to try new thing and take risk . and in the life , we have to be a little adventurist . if we dont ' try , nobody will give our wish in our hand . we do n't have magic creature to have three wish in life . we have to be our own magic creature . according to the researces , one of the property of a successful manager is taking risk . if he wait to be secure for a decision , he will be later than the competitor and the company will lose it market . so taking risk and trying new thing are important for both our self improvement and business life . also , in my opinion , it is quite boring when i do the the same thing over and over . to do new thing keep me alive and make me positive . and if we are positive , we can get success . trying new thing give u the patience , so we can keep studying to be more successful .
