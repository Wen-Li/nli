i disagree with the statement that in twenty year there will be fewer car in use than there are today . i can quote many reason to support my statement . in a modern society , it not possible to restrict anyone from using car because of his busy schedule . with population growing rapidly , the increasing need of modern society are increasing and hence the number of car are growing , also , because of growing population the unemployment problem is increasing and hence is demanding a busy schedule from the employee and thus forcing them to go for easy and safe mean of travel . so , this search for a mean of transport might end anyone with usage of car . also , with growing technolgy the people are moving from old mean of transport by bus to new and advanced mean of transport . the youth are easily influenced by new technology car and race car and might force their parent to buy him one . everyone in this society want to improve their social status by saving something for their later need . the social position is measured mostly by the person 's wealth and this endures to the vehicle they are using . so , in general people want to go for a car discarding their old two wheeler , given a chance . in some case they may be forced to take a car just because the family member are increased from two when they are married to four after having child . in some case when someone get married , though the dowry is prohibited , because people are not used to it , they give some present , in general a vehicle so that their daughter doe n't suffer . if one get an oppurtunity to buy a car this way , i do n't think he will refuse to take one . in the current situation , i do n't see any possibility of reduction in the usage of car , if the population increase this way and people do n't change their way of thinking .
