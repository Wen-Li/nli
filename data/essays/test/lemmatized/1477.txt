travelling is one of the important activity for entertainment and to gain knowledge . it is better to take the help of a guide who is familiar with the fact and event that occured in the history in a particular place . so in my opinion travelling with a guide along a group is the best way . first to know about the tradition , custom and civilization about a particular place is quite difficult without a person who is familiar about the place is a difficult task . so to explain and illustrate the importance of a place a guide is necessary . in many case the guide will be a local person of the place and he is much more familiar than a stranger and he know what the particular place is prominent for . second , mostly the tourist who visit a place will not be knowing the local language . so to help them a guide is essential . a guide act a a mean of communication between the tourist and the local people . for example , if we go shopping we dont know much about the value and cost of a product which is famous there . therefore taking this advantage about the stranger the seller may cheat the travellors by saying too much cost which it doe not actually value for it . in this case a guide may help the tourist without being effected by the seller . in a group if any individual suffer from the health problem the other person may help and the guide help to consult a doctor for the problemand there is lot of co-operation among the fellow person and also the communication skill develop a lot in a group . finally a a tourist guide is very helpful in travelling for knowing better thing about a particular place which it is prominant and famous for and also a the tourist are not familiar with the local language a guide may help them in many way .
