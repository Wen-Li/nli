i totally agree with the view that successful people try new thing and take risk rather than only doing what they already know how to do well . human being are social animal and most of the people have same knowledge and study same stuff . most of the people lead an ordinary life by doing thing they are supposed to do based on the society in which they are living . but few people race ahead in life , become more successful and famous . the underlying difference is the attitude these few people have towards their life , the attitude to take risk and try new thing , to rise above the level of commonality and ordinary thing , the courage to be different . their want to challenge the set notion and ability to go beyond the ordinary make them successful . i would like to quote the example of two great men who have changed the course of their nation by trying new thing and taking risk . mahatma gandhi wa an ordinary laywer who studied law in london . like any other lawyer he went to south africa to fight a case . as the racial discrimnation wa at it peak in south africa , he wa thrown off the train inspite of carrying a first class ticket . the most convenient thing for him to do wa to forget it like any other normal person at that time would have done . but he took risk and tried thing differently . he used the force of non violence against the mightiest military force which eventually led to the freedom of india . not only he wa successful in his time but even after his death people look upto him in reverence . it wa his attitude to do thing differently and try new thing that led him success . martin luther king of usa tried thing differently when he stood against the racial discrimination prevalent in the american society , . he formed the organisation and fought for the civil right of the black people in usa . the discrimination wa present in us society before him also . he dared to be different and he succeded . i feel that it need one person in a group to try new thing and take risk and the rest follows the person . thas how a successful person and a leader is made . history is written by successful poeple and they change the course of civilization . they are always remembered and looked upon .
