from my perspective , it is true that successful people try new thing and are willing to take risk rather than limit themselves to doing what they already are able to do well . it is fundamental to recognize that the chance of being successful are significantly increased by trying new thing , since the potential opportunity provided by an effectve invention are most probably higher than with persisting thing . a good example in this context is the bill gate 's creation of computer operating system `` windows '' . this new technology provided personal computer user with a formerly unknown measure of effectiveness in how to operate their computer . accordingly , this `` invention '' enabled an effective and straighforward usage of computer , a fact that drove demand for this product to an enormous level . as a consequence increased sale of microsoft windows drove the success of bill gates . by simply sticking to and slightly modifying the persisting ms dos technology bill gates would have not been able to have such a great impact and such a high level of success . furthermore , successful people are better in dealing with risk . when risk can be handled in an appropriate way they would not limit the winning-potential of new thing to an extent they could do . correspondingly , if risk can be managed and limited , the incentivation for not doing new stuff is lower . let u imagine a project involving the construction of an entirely new type of bridge - spanning a much larger gap and being much more filigrane than any other bridge before . a good project management would always have various way and tool to manage and reduce risk . for instance , a detailed and accurate time plan for the management of time risk . in addition effective project manager also have created contingency plan of what to do when certain planned process fail to work . by having tool that at hand the level of risk can be reduced in such a way that the project success can be facilitated .
