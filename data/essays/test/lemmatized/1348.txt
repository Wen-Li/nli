i agree to the statement that it is more important for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact . i can say from my own experience that i often tried to learn just the fact . it wa easy . i reviewed the material at home . i wa not very active at class . just had some day dream . i did not joined class discussion . one day we wrote an exam . i got an very low grate . we needed to express our own idea and concept . i did not know this i just knew all the fact . then a started to change my behavior . i tried to understand the idea not only of the teacher but of the other student a well . that realy made an big impact in my educational life . i started thinking by myself . it wa fantastic . it wa not about leraning fact , it wa about a higher understanding of a tobic . i even joined discussion in class . i could not belived it , school started to be fun . i loved to be there . i wa realy motivated . by the way , my next exam wa great ! a also like to motivate other people to concentrade on the understanding of idea and concept . when my younger brother went to his first school day i just explained these leassons to him . i said to him : try to understand the idea of the teacher . my brother asked why and i gave him different reason . first , you will enjoy the school more . second , you will learn more . third , you will join discussion in class my brother did so . i also liked school a lot . in conclussion , i learnd that school is much more fun when i understand the fact . i love to debate with others . i love to understand there idea . i believe that understanding of idea is not only important in school but also in professional live . in my work a an sale man i need the ability to understand other people . i learnd it at school . i am very gratefull for this expierience .
