i beleive that learing fact and understanding concept & idea are correllated , and all are important for student to learn . however , this importancy might vary among the differrent level of study . for example , while teaching student in the very early year of school , study should concentrate more in teaching fact , besides basic concept that would be easy for student to understand . on the other hand , for higher level of class , idea and concept should be studied more , since student ' mind will be more able to analyze and understand the differrent concept and idea . concepts and idea are used to of analyzing fact ; their reason , their viability , development of fact . . etc . basically , it 's too important for student to understand cause and reason of fact , but they should be fully understanding what is the fact all about . teaching fact should be prior of teaching concept . for example , it is important to teach student about gravity and emphasize that they are fuly aware about it , then they should study the concept of gravity law which wa made by newton . if study wa only concentrating in teaching concept and idea without illustrating the fact , student will feel that they are lost . it is also to be noticed that many concept and idea can be available for one certain fact . therefore , study should start with illustrating the fact , and then teaching the various concept and idea on it . it is too important for student to be aware of all concept and idea , to understand the principle & purpose of each . students will get a brilliant idea on how to think and analyze by studying the differrent concept . this will make their mind to work more and will help them to manage and organize their analysis in case they face in their future . as a conclusion , studying fact is too important to clarify it to student , and teaching concept & idea is also too important for many major reason .
