do you believe that successful people try new thingd and take risk rather tan only doing what they already know how to do well ? some people love to try something new and enjoy creation . some other love to do what they already know because they do n't want to take risk of fail . from my viewpoint , i think that people can success because they try new thing and take risk . i will argue this issue with the fellowing reason . first of all , i think that dream make people great . children have more possibility because they love dream . for example , a child dream that he want to be a baseball player . he may ha no idea how he should do will become a good player , however , he will try to reach his goal . if a child do n't have such a dream , he will never success . secondly , i find that these successful people have one character . they love to solve the problem . for instance , my father is a professor . i always find that he love thinking . he always try to solve the problem in his resurch . not like me , i always hope someone will help me to solve the question . so my father can become a helper , and i always depend other people help . thirdly , i think that creativity will make people success . sometime people have some new idea , some people will do it , some people do n't , then those people who love to try their new idea will give them chance to success . maybe they have a lot of bed experience during the process , but they learn more lession . so this knowledge and experience help them success . if people would n't tp try , maybe we still think that people would never fly in the modern age . in the summary , i believe that people will success because they will learn more experience and knowledge , and they hope to solve the problem . and the most improtant thing , they have dream to try that they don , t konw about . so these people will success .
