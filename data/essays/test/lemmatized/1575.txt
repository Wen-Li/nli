the main idea of the above topic is that wheather `` most advertisement make product seem much better than they really are '' . i agree with this opinion . the reason for this are described a follows . firstly , most of the advertisement are just for the sake of sale . the advertisement are to increase the value of the product which in turn increase the sale of the product . by this manufacture of the product are benifited . the advertisement are made in such a way that the tend to bias the people . for example , consider the most famous add we see on the tv , `` gillete mach 3 razor '' . in this , the advetisement bias men to buy a gillete mach3 by showing a man with cleanly shaven beard find a girl easily . this may not be true in most of the case . the man would have used some other razor or might have got it done from a barber . this appears to u a though that the product is much better . but actually this might not be the case . there are many advertisement which seem better than they really are . secondly , the truth behind the fact that the product is good one is not known to any one . for example , consider the soap we use in our day-to-day life . we are biased by seeing the add that show people turning bueatiful and into star by using the product . but in reality , this might not be the case . when we try these product by ourselves we can know the truth behind this . another thing is that they provide information on the concentration used on the product . by seeing this we might believe that the product is good and buy it . but the actual concentration may be different and this may be used to grab the attention of the people . in this way most advertisement make product seem much better than they actually are . there are a lot of example which and lot of advertisement that mis-lead u . from above reason and discussion i conclude by saying that `` most of the advertisement make product seem much better than they actually are '' .
