there are advantage in both understanding idea and concept and learning fact . if you learn fact , your knowledge about a certain fact will increase . it is very important element in the life ; however you need to know why fact are created . in short , it is a process to reach a fact and i think it is more important than just knowing fact . therefore i agree the statement . of course , learning fact is a very significant factor in your life . if you know more fact , you can learn more about the world ; however the process is more important because if you do not know the process or concept , you can not say that you fully understand fact . if you understand well about the fact , you can explain and apply them to the real life . students are younger and they are going to participate in the society in the future , so learning is the time for them to prepare for the future . they need to learn skill to apply their knowledge in the society and then they should know the idea and concept behind the fact . personally , it wa very difficult for me to understand the fact without explaining idea and concept . if i do not know concept of the fact , i can not explain exactly what it is including it background . also the worst thing is that you can not connect a thing from other thing . for example , you have learned the history of american independence . if a teacher explain the flow of the history , you can explain a he did ; however if you only know the word `` american independent '' , you can not explain exact history . it is not efficient for your life , and you can not broaden your knowledge more . therefore you need to find the connection between the idea and concept and the fact . in this sense , i think student should understand idea and condcepts rather than fact . therefore i think understanding idea and concept is more important than learning fact . if you understand well about idea and concept , you can broaden your knowledge more by yourself and apply them to the real life . it is one of the most important thing to be able to combine idea and concept with the real problem in the society , so it is not enough to know only about fact but you need to know the idea and concept .
