there is a general debate over student ' learning method throughout the whole society , especially among those parent and educational expert . one important question under debate is that whether the study of idea and concept is more important than fact . from my perspectvie , it may be a little too hasty to draw an extreme conclusion without regarding the different stage the learning process contains . the first truth , we have admitted , is the fact that idea and concept is much more obstract that fact . so at the beginning of study , learning from fact might be a better choice . besides , learning fact will stimulate student ' interest easily , which will paly a far-reaching role in their further study . to illustrate the above point , i would take my study about physical a an persuasive example . at the first few class , our teacher are forever demonstrating some intersting experiment to u . we just find lesson are so attractive that our interest are acumulated day by day . we would even be allowed to do some of experiment by ourselves . from some magical phenomenon and vivid experience , we began to dig out some knowledge by ourselves . gradually , these discovers accumulate to a big one , the knowledge we should learn in this class . on the other hand , along with the development of our knowledge based on obsevering fact , we need to summarize the idea and concept involved in these knowledge , which will help u to have a solid foundation of what we 've learned . in fact , concept indeed produce more important effect on the construction of our knowledge system . still take physical a an example , the majority of people will not to use an experimental fact to build his knowledge . instead , we tend to use some unique concept such a ideal state to explain our knowledge , which is more efficient and of extremely importance . in retrospect , it is reasonable to confirm that we should apply different learning method to different situation . only in this way can we learn happier and more efficient .
