risk is what make people prosper . without risk we would always be doing the same thing and having the same routine . people have to take risk to be acknowledge and to be respected , without it you would be a nobody without the courage to fight for what you want , always having people stepping on you , eventhough you are smarter and do their work . as in the legend of sundiata from african culture . sundiata wa the king 's son that could not walk until he wa seven year old , he did not had the necesity to walk , eventhough he wa not going to be the successor of his father 's crown . one day his mother wa insulted and nothing could have her gain her hoor again , unless sundiata could bring her himself some leaf . he took the risk of walking at age seven to please her mother and by this fulfilling the profesy . then he became the king of his kingdom , and he wa a just and brave leader . as the time passed a new threat arrived , the sorcerer king of sossa , who wanted to conquer evrything including his father 's kingdom . sundiata confronted him and defeated his army . the sorcerer king wa never heard of again . meanwhile sundiata went to the sorcerer king 's capital sossa to destroy it . by razing it 's capital , sundiata became the legend he is today . without taking the risk of walking sundiata could not had done all his heroic deed and would be without the ability to walk the rest of his life . as sundiata teach u , we have to take risk to change our life and the world . risks are essential in our life . we have to take them everyday , with every challenge we encounter during the day . we must take them with courage and knowledge to be sure we made the right thing to do for our completion of our goal .
