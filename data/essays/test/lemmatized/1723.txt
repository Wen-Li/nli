in my opinion ther would be le car in twentey . i see that because of tow main reason that will affect all the country in the world . the first reason is that the government of each country in the world espicially the le developed country will try to reduce the number of car on the street because of the increase of the pupliation and the bad affect that car cause it to the enviroment . the number of pupliation is increasin every year and the most increase is on the le developed country . for that the govrenment of these country will try to find a trasporttion way that will transport a lot of people in le space . also the higher number of car on the street the higher effect that it will do for the enviroment . so the govrenment of each country around the world will try to solve this problem by finding a transportation device that will cause le rush and le harm to the enviroment . the second and the most important reason that i thinck there will be le car for it is the price of gas . the price of gas is to high nowadays and how will it be after twenty year ? of course it will be even much higher . for example i am from dubai , uae and i see the price in my country that produce oil is high and also i went to austrailia at summer and the price wa much higer than my country and the last example is that my cousin mum is from the usa and he is a us national and when i asked him about the price of gas in the us he said that i shoud sell my shoe if i had an egiht sylender car in the us because of the price pf the gas . finally these are the main reason that i think that the car will be fewer in the next twenty year the number of people and the price of oil .
