there are too many advertisement that show the product or service in a better way rather than it 's when you are going to use it . if you are going to buy something and the reason is a specific skill that an advertisement show about that product , with a strong probability you 'll be not satisfay after the purchase , and you would like to be refund of your money . when you are looking a spot you always have to think if the product/service that is show will be able to attend your aspectation and before buying something , when is possible , you have to try it in . in my opinion we can solve this problem , and it 's not difficoult , with a strong regolamentation that fix what a company can show during an advertisemant and expecially that fix the admitted difference between what is show and the real use of the object/service . this is the way to figure out a problem taht exist since the advertisement ha been created and that cause not real axpetation expecially in young people . we have too many spot on the tv , radio , newspaper if we do n't want reduce the amount of this we have increase the quality of what everyday we see , listen or read and this , for sure , will increase the imagine of a company becuse what did you see is exactly the same of what did you buy or what you are going to buy .
