it would be tough to differantiate the product without the advertisement sticked on them . this doe not neccessarily mean that the advertisement make the product seem better , but it definetely attache something that is not in and of the product . that is to say , advertisement differentiates a product from the others serving a similar purpose with something which is actually not a part of the product . the thing that is not in the product itself , the one that is attached to the product by an advertisement is everything about the product but it 's value of use . in other word , a watch is to keep track of the time , but a `` rolex '' symbolizes a status besides serving a a regular watch . it is understood to be something more than a watch because the value assigned to it by advertisement . advertisement doe not always serve for the much `` better '' image of the product . the thing that are attached to the product help them to artificially obtain different value than the one they hold . those added value are not neccessary for the `` best '' of the product . the racist advertisement of soap during the industrial revolution era in united kingdom did not change the view of the quality of the soap , it served for the re-production of the emperial way of living and strengthened the belief on `` the burden of the white man '' to change the uncivilized . once a product can wear imaginary value and belief , it may well be used for other purpose . like the one mentioned above or basically the everyday-sexist advertisement visible all around the world . the advertisement of `` for him magazine '' or `` diesel jeans '' are not there for the making their product better , they serve for the reproduction of patriarchal power relation . therefore , it is obvious that the advertisement make product somethingelse than what they really are . but the new thing they become with these ad doe not neccessarily mean they are better , it only mean they are not what they were .
