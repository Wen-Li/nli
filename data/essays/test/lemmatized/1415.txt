i disagree with the statement that it is better to have a broad knowledge of many academic subject than to specialize in one specific subject . for this opinion i have several reason . first , i think if one specializes in a specific subject , one will be able to spend a lot more time on this subject than one would if one studied a wide range of different subject . this extra time can then be spent on studying the one subject one ha chosen even more detailed and get deeply into it . if one is real good at it , one may even do some research on it and discover or invent new thing , which can be enourmously helpful to society . this is to say , education will be more effective and productive this way . secondly , if one doe not specialize one will never become real good at something but more likely perform average on most of the class . this is just simply due to the lack of time . being average is not a cathastrophy . however , one will never get the sense of achievment one would have when inventing or discovering new thing and would thus probably at some point become dissatisvied with oneself , always working pretty hard , but never having a real breakthrough . one may even feel kind of stuck . finally , there is proven evidence for my first argument of increased productivity : our society ha developed this way . back in the time when primitive human being were hunter and collector , the strong men had the task to hunt and the woman had the task to take care of the child and collect berry and so on . later , job specification took place , because people noticed that if one person ha to do all the job by him - or herself , he or she will have a very low living standard , a there is no way in which one person could possibly be a cook , a hunter , a plumber , a farmer , a dentist , and so on at the same time . however , one 's living standard can be improved bz job specification : if everybody specializes in one special job , everybody will be a lot better and thus a lot more productive at his or her job . if then people start to trade , everybody can be supplied with a lot more and better good than he or she would have produced by himselelf . therefore , job specification is more effective than doing everything by oneself . this idea can also be transferred to academic subject : if every student know a little bit about everything , there will hardly be any progress in research , because the student will be busy studying what ha already been found out . but if student specialize , progress is more likely to take place and help the other student a well . for example if a student in physic or mathemathics found a way to store sun energy , then this would be helpful to all the other student a well a an alternative source of energy . so after all , i mainly have two different reason for preferring specification over broad knowledge of a variety of subject : first , the increased effectiveness and secondly , the sense of achievement one get . moreover , the first argument can even be proven by the fact that society is organized in the same way .
