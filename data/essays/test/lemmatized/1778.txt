is more advertisement make product seem much better than they really are ? as company spend astronomical amount in advertisement , i would say definitely yes ! the main goal for a company to advertise a product is for sure to sell more of it , but first , it ha to convince the customer of buying it . they have to make them believe that they need the product , and once that goal is reached , they have to convince them that the product is better than the other comparables . as i mentioned before , the idea is to increase sell , but a company want to make profit , and this is done also by reducing cost . unless we are in a monopolistic environment , the competition can be very strong , a well a the incentive to make profit . due to a reduction in cost , the level of quality may seem alot better in the advertisement than it may be in reality . the best example for me would be a cosmetic advertisement for a face or body cream . the apparance of the young model seems so perfect , but in reality , doe that cream make them look so young ? the model do not represent the specific group of user of the product . they are much younger and the photo are also corrected . the intention is to convince the user that the cream is efficient a it look like in the advertisement , but in reality , it is not . an other example is advertisement for a natural supplement . as it look like , those product help you live longer , healthier , and it doe n't make sense . in my opinion , what make you live that way is a healthy way of living , a eating healthy food , practicing sport , enjoying life in general . as i mentionned before , the main goal of company is to sell more of a product , and unfortunately , this is reached sometimes by lying to the customer .
