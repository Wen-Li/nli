i 'm totally agree with the statement expressed . in fact , i truly think that people that do well something could do it better if they only do n't suppose the way known is the best one . what i ' trying to explain is that who is satisfaied about , for example a job or an activity , in general use known and common method to reach his satisfaction . otherwise who us experimental way to do thing is usually a person that get in discussion current method because he belives himself to be able to find a better one . these kind of people always take the risk of their choice , often really discover better way to do thiinks and so they have success . i think that no one can ha success if doe n't belive in himself and doe n't refused way to do thing learned from other people . if you uniform yourself to what is commonly considered a well , you will never go beyond the limit of mass thinking and exploit whole your capacity in order to outstand the mass and so reach success . for example , in art , impressionistic style wa very uncommon for it age in wich realistic style wa considered the best . impressionistic artist , trusting in themselves and completly unlinked from the common use of color and painting , demonstrated u a definitly better way to show human feeling and nature . they took the risk and the win the challange with other painter of that period because they deeply trust in themselves and did n't give attenction to critic . in definitive success depends by self trust
