according to me there are reason that support this statement and reason that do n't . trying new thing is a good idea mainly because also if you can do very well something , you must know that there will always be somebody that can do the same thing better and faster than you . this must push you not to be always stable on your idea , but to be opened to change , to be faster in adapating to this `` rapid changing '' world . for example , in electronics business technology are in a very fast evolution ( according to new discovery and research ) , and if you doe n't support change , probably your succes will come to an end . another reason for what change is good is the concept of `` new idea '' . customers are interested in a product for a serie of characteristic of the object and among them there is the importance of new . new thing attract people a well a well-done thing . using the situation of electronics business , you can say that innovativity is one of the most impostant aspect that make a customer choose a product instead of another or that push him to a certain way of living is free time , for instance . on the other side , leaving a route to take another you do n't know where it go is n't always a good choise . in fact if you are strong in a business , it would take a risk for you to begin a new `` business-path '' , because you can lose part of your money or even lose the carismatic importance you 've got in a certain field of the business world . in a conservative view of business , leaving the old route ( or giving more importance to new thing ) can be destructive : it cost you a lot of money ( new technology , research . .. ) and , of course , you ca n't know how your new business area can evolve . but looking at all these point , i think that in our society , with so much change in action , an economical politic of renewing thing and smart `` gambling '' is absolutely needed . this image of the smart gambler is , according to me , the best position that successful people must assume : someone who ha to take strong decision without forgetting that reason ha to be the background of his behaviour . we need gambler . without them , our modern society is going to fall down in a terrible hole of routine and inerthia ( dead calm ) .
