in the following essay i will deal with the question of the development of car sale within the next twenty year , for it ha been suggested that , in twenty year from now , there will be fewer car than there are today . in the process , i will touch on such issue a environmental polution and technological inovation . in my opinion the idea that there will be fewer car in the future can not be seriously entertained . on the one hand people keep getting more and more convenient . despite rising cost for oil and petrol , people tend to go by car even if they are just going around the corner to do some shopping . of course gas is becoming more expensive every day , but recent poll have shown that this doe not prevent people from riding their automobile . another reason for my thesis is that especially in the western world the car ha become a symbol of status and money . families tend to posse two or three car , one for every member of the family . also the period of time a car is used by a single owner is becoming more and more brief . money is lacking everywhere - but there is always enough to afford a new car . of course one may argue that there is a new awareness about environmental polution caused by car and motocycles . but , in my opinion , there is always a difference between what people say and what people do . it is understandable that everyone want to preserve the environment of our `` blue planet '' . but most people tend to point the finger to their neighbor or fellow-citizens instead of changing their habit . new technological inovations might help to preserve the environment . but that doe not necessarily imply that we will see fewer car in twenty year 's time . on the contrary , the amount of vehicle driven through the street of the big city of this world will increase . one only ha to look at the figure of the population growth the united nations anually present . whereas the population in europe and also in north america seems to stagnate we witness an explotion of asia 's and africa 's population . china alone host more than one billion people in 2006 , with a growth of 2 , 5 child per woman assumed for the next couple of year . as an emerging economic super-power the standard of living in china will rise over the next year a well . the implication of this development will be far-reaching , though they can not be grasped in all their impact , yet . but it can be easily imagined that the new million will want their fair share of the world 's prosperity . it is only a matter of time until the will long to posse their own car and vehicle . in conclusion , it can be assumed that in twenty year from now there will be more car carrying more people through steadily more crowded city .
