nowdays , more and more people will go travelling during their holiday . some of them will travel in a group by a guide . others will travel alone or only with their friend . and in my opinion , travelling with a tour guide maybe my first choice . among various advantage that travel with a guide are comfortable and convenience . because the tour guide often own lot of knowledge about the travel , if you travel with them , comfortable is obvious . for instance , when you want to travel in a foreign country , the language barrier is the most improtant problem for you . i ca n't learn the whole language in the world . but at this time , if a tour guide is with you , the problem will solve easily . most of them have strong ability to using foregin language . you can communicate with local people through the guide 's translating . and you also do n't worried about you will cheat by the local people . because the guide often have responsibility to prevent their travel 's member cheating when they travelling . and all of these will make you comfortable . equally important advantage is it is very convenience with a guide . first , the guide will book the room when you travel in some place of interest . you do n't worried about you ca n't live near the place which you will travel . sometimes you ca n't find any hotel to live in some famous place . and guide will solve the problem for you . futhermore , the guide will make a very good plan for the traveller and you can learn lot of information by them . after the guide 's explaintation , the understanding of culture , custom and histroy will increase greatly . and you do n't bring a very heavy book which is introduce the place ' interest . and you will feel the trave is a very convenience thing . and in fact , if you travel alone and do n't with a guide , you may feel freedom . you can go any place that you want to go and get up at any time that you want . in my opinion , everyone ha different choice for the way to travel . if you like travel very much and want to be more freedom , travelling alone is good , but on the other hand , if you want to travel easily and comfortably , letting a tour guide with you is better .
