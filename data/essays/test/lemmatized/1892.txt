in these day , people can see a immense amount of commercial and advertisments . a researcher said that one human see average of 80 thousand commercial in his/her life time regardless of the kind of item or product people try to advertise , they point out that their product are excellent , and are better than others . but , is it really true ? reviewing my past event and other information , a lot of these advertisement are not actually true , and are just trying to make customer attracted . in other word , they are bluffing . here are some example . about a year ago , i bought a digital camera from one internet shopping mall . the advertisement said that this camera come out in various color and with a free memory card . because this camera seemed cool , i bought it . and when i paid , it clearly said that the company will deliver this camera to my home exactly a week later . after two month , the company delivered me a pink camera ( the color i wanted wa silver ) without any memory card . it is clear that advertisement are making their product seem much better then the reality because advertisement doe n't show u the bad side about the product . they point the better quality and hide others . actually , advertisement are made to point out the product ' best part . for example , company sometimes point out that the price of their item are low while hiding the fact that the quality is low too . my uncle who use to work in a pizza store told me that people use cheep ingredient to make more profit for themselves . while doing that , he told me that the advertisement of that pizza store clearly say that they use fresh ingredient . to conclude , most advertisement bluff about the product and make them seem better to attract more customer . and , i want to warn others that the advertisement are made to be pointing out their best portion of the product .
