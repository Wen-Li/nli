my country is knowen by people living in there . becose people in my country are very hot and helpfull . nowadays there is a common question , ' do young people nowadays give enough time to helping their community ' . i believe that our people are changing by day by . nowadays young people become le helpfull for their community . firt of all , young people must behave more helpfull in their community because , they must know that one day they will be old . last week , i saw an old woman in the street and she ha lot of lagguges . her lagguges were very heavy for her , there were lot of young people in the street however none of them ha not helped her . this was'nt good behaviour for me , i do not appreciate this kind of behaviour when i saw that occurance my thinking had exactly changed . before that occurance i wa thinking that our young people are very helpfull but after that my opinion changed . now i think our society is going on a bad way . why young people think only their benefit is very important and it answer must be search . in a community , people ' s behaviour develop a an early age . young people in community mus't be helpfull all the time . we must not teach young person when they were young . if we do n't teach them such kind of thing in early age , they will not be good citizen for their country . to some up , our people 's behaviour are changing nowadays . we should do some thing for this situation . we must educate our childrens in a right way and teach them not to think only their benefit .
