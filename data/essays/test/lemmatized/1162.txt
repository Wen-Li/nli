humans are social animal . this saying ha been true from the time immemorial . individuals need society a much a the society need individual . its a symbiotic concept which ha been a gospel truth and would remain so , for the generation to come . it is expected from each and every member of the society to contribute towards the growth and development of their community and society . young people form a significant portion of the society . it is a disappointing fact that recent year have witnessed , a remarkable decrease in contribution from this younger lot towards their community . well , i completely agree to this unfortunate decline in younger generation 's enthusiasm towards their community . this remarkable decrease in partcipation from the younger generation is quite evident from the fact that there are hardly any youngesters helping in old age home , destitue center , orphanage . these growing up kid are least bothered about the current event going on around their community and neighborhood . they are like silk worm who are happy in their own cocoon , their self made protected world where they enjoy their life and are not answerable to anyone . very rare do we come across volunteer who raise their voice for a social cause or for the benefit of people at large . there can be many reason , which have made the younger generation so apathetic towards community service . first and foremost reason given by these young people is the paucity of time . earlier generation wa more active in community welfare program , because they had ample of time after their day 's work . this era ha witnessed an all time high in the mass medium propogation , electonic medium through advancement in information and technology and many such thing . the younger people who are impressionable at this age , tend to get distracted with so many avenue of utilising their free time . there is internet , gaming parlor , online chatting , blogging etc etc . . the list just go on . they find so little time to themselves , that they are unwilling to go and do some community service . on weekend these people consider to socialise in disc and party with their college buddy rather than spending a quiet evening in an orphanage . well , blaming it all on the younger generation would n't be a fair judgement to pas . there ha been a tremendous rise in the competitiveness all around . the student have to slog right from their school day to college day to get admission in the university of their choice . the pressure of study ha become so tremendous that these people really fall short of 24 hour . also these kid are brought up in such protective environment that they really do n't feel the need to stand up for the community cause . everything is readily available to these student . for a society to progress , it is important that the younger generation show an active interest in development of the society a a whole and rise up from the concept of individual progress . only then we can all expect a more humane and better place to live in .
