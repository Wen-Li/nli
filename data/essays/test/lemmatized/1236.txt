i strongly agree with the above statement that is true that most advertisement make product seem much better then they really are if the product came into the light with more advertisement that enriches the quantity and quality firstly a normal product or a cheap product came in to the market , the cheap product mean it ha some flavour added which are not better purified so it will not be applicable to all the people that mean that many not work effective that product also will come with little influence . for an example considere an axe deodrant and a local or home made scent , when the government issue licence to them only they will fix the rate to it because a they made which type of flavour which is worthful etc . so the most of the people use the axe deodrent rather than local scent because of it effectiveness not only is effectiveness but also it is really seems better than advertisement . so it is also true that the advertisement also move to the better product ofcourse to fulfill their pocket also another reason . secondly a better brand and a worthful brand only come to the market with highly influencial it is true that the static always vote to the advertisement brand only i feel that is nothing going to one favour , if it is so why many people turn towards the influencial product it is not only for their advertisement they are turning towards their quality . for an example colgate paste we can see the number of advertisement regarding about that paste a day the most of the people in the country using thisbrand only apart of numerous advertisement this product is the better example to suggest that they are much better than really are , many paste came into the light with a influence a colgate paste but all can not stand before it . and finally i conclude that most of product seems much better than really are .
