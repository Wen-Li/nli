the given statement proclaims that advertisement make product look better that they really are . i agree with the above statement , that advertisement in fact project the product in an unrealistic manner . advertisements are the most important way of marketing . every organization ha a seperate marketing department dedicated to selling the product whether tangible or intangible . products are portrayed in a very gradiose manner in lot of advertisement . let u take an example of a cola company selling their soft drink . the advertisement would have u believe that they are the end of all our problem . once we consume their product , we will be happy and live for age to come . whether that is actually possible can be is not subject to debate . in today 's competitive world , every body try to make themselves look good while degrading the someone else 's image . with so company producing similar product and commodity , it becomes very difficult for them to reach the top and beat their competitor . this lead an extrapolation of the reality , with each competiting advertisement putting it product a the best . things gradualy move away for reality . in a bid to outdo each other , company forget the real purpose of advertisement , which to give end-user a service or a product to make their life more convinient . marketing agency have started following the policy of ` a book is a good a it cover ' . their only purpose becomes selling the product in whichever way possible , by hook or crook . they dont mind lying about feature the product in order to make it look good . they are only concerned with how the product look in the advertisement , rather than the quality of the product itself . in the conclusion , i would like to re-affirm the above statement that advertisement make product seem much better that they actully are .
