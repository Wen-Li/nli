when henry ford made that beautiful invention known a the `` car '' , little did he realise the impact he would be creating on mankind and environment alike . when the machine , four wheel running with the aid of a fuel driven motor , wa first invented , many people were skeptic about it . expensive , ineffective , cumbersome , etc were few of the adjective used to describe the car . little did they know , that ford would be the one laughing all the way to the bank ! fast forward to the current scenario and ford 's laughter is well accounted for . cities , town and village are teeming with people who have are hooked on to the car like an addict is to drug . the car is no longer an expensive luxury or cumbersome or any of the adjective used by skeptic at the time of it invention . the car ha become a necessity . in today 's world it is almost impossible to imagine life without the familiar hum of car . they 're fast , sleek , beautiful machine that help u in reaching our destination with marked ease and comfort . with the increasing dependency on car , it seems highly unlikely that human will abandon this marvellous creation and go back to the `` walking day '' ! the dependency on car ha affected human physiology to such an extent , that it 's almost impossible to think about walking enormous distance on foot , which , ironically , wa the primary mode of travel long before the advent of car . `` in twenty year there will be fewer car in use than there are today '' says who ? statistics certainly do not support that claim . every year , the number of car per square mile is increasing at an alarming rate . with almost no change in the width of existing road , the inrease in number is quite evident on our already congested road . with mortality rate on a decline due to advance in medical science and increase in birth rate , it seems highly unlikely that the number of car bought will show a dip . more the people , more the want for a necessity ! its the simple supply versus demand theory here . not to mention the privileged few for whom buying more and more car is just a way of life ! science ha not yet evolved to an extent where alternative for car maybe produced and used . nor ha the understanding and conscience of u people , a responsible earthlings , advanced to that level where we start thinking about method like car-pooling to reduce the number of car on the street , thereby reducing congestion and doing the environment a big favour . thus , reduction in car in the next twenty year depends on how quick science progress and how soon we realise our responsibilites towards making this planet a cleaner place to live in . till that happens , all i see is the graph for number of cars versus time inching towards the roof - slowly but surely .
