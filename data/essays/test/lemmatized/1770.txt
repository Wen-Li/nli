i agree the statement that most advertizement make product seem much better than they really are . i think ad just need to introduce u how product are or how great product are . but , it is true , almost all of advertizement are not perfectly true . i think there are two reason for using overestimated ad . first , firm always use ad for selling more product . for example , if the product is not good one , they can not sell a number of the product with the ad which tell u just how the product is . but , if they use the ad which tell u the white lie for improving sale of the product , firm will get more money . second , all of u dont want to watch ad which describe how the product are . for instance , if we need to advertize new product , we must not choose the ad whish just explain how the product are but the ad which are overestimated . it is because such ad are often boring and old . the ad customer need are like beautiful or brandnew one we have never seen . in conclusion , i think there are two reason for using the ad with white lie . we choose such ad because we always consider ad a device for improving sale of new product .
