any company ha at least an objective to increase it product ' sale . for that , the company 's management should do several method to reach this goal . for example , the management is supposed to enhance the product ' quality , decrease their cost and let the customer recognize their feature and benefit . how can the company let the customer recognize the company ' product with thier benefit and feature ? the answer is clear that it should be done by having many advertisement using news paper , tvs and others to advertise the company 's product . however , i totally agree that most advertisement make product seem much better than they really are . the reason is , a i indicated in the first paragraph , to increase the product ' sale in order to increase the company revenue and profet a well . in my opinion , the customer who have the responsiblities to recognize good product from bad product by not believe all the company ' advertisement but check and verify this by themselves . for example , if there is an advertisement in the tv say when you have or buy a toyota car , you will get better maintenance service by repair your car within 24 hour only . in fact , this advertisement could be true for someone who live in ny but not in middle east . for that , the customer should check his/her local market and verify that this type of service are available in order to get a new car . in addtion , the customer may have this 24 houre maintenance service for mainting his/her car but the quality of the maintenance service will be low and not a it should be if he/she use to get in different car maintenance shop . in conclusion , any company should consider the advertisement method a one of the major objective to reach thier customer . as a result , mosts advertisement make product seem much better than they really are . for that , the customer should recognize and check the product not only by these advertisement but also by other way .
