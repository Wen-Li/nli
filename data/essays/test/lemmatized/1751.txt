i agree with the statement because i am a young person too and i know that i am not giving enough time to help my community . nowadays the young people is busy with their school work and entertainment . in the old time the people did n't have much thing to do so they can give time for helping community even though they do n't want to give . in old time , movie did n't exist . there were restaurant but it wa n't like today . there were not so many music group and concert or luxery hotel to go . there were no tv and computer . without these thing there is not much thing to the in a day . because of this emptyness people improve their relationship with other people and with their enviroment , because of that they want to help their community . in old day the neighboorhood were more important than it is today . nowadays people have no need to talk with the people who live in their community . we have got computer , television , mobile phone . we are always in touch with people we love . when we go outside there are lot of thing to the with our friend , because of that we are not interested in our community . for example our school ha a community service to help some undeveloped village . it would be very good to help those village but nobody wa intrested in helping the village because everyone had their own job to do with their friend or family . young people decides to their house rather than helping community because there are so many thing to do . to conclude , lot of thing changed in the world . the people doe n't need to be in touch with each other . they can spend their time by doing anything . these are the reason why i agree with the statement .
