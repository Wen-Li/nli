it is disputable whether it 's better to have a broad knowledge of many academic subject or whether to specialize in one specific subject . both side do have their advantage and disadvantage , however i think that specializing in one specific subject is better than accumulating broad knowledge . thus i disagree with the statement . having a broad knowledge mean that one ha a lot of information and education covering a variety of topic and that one is able to talk and work about these various subject . it allows to link various subject to each other and hence discover relation between subject or even discover solution within other subject that are impossible to find when one specializes just on one subject . for example aircraft engineer should have knowledge on how a bird fly and on how to convert this information into an actual airplane , so by not specializing on bird or just aircraft , engineer found out how the bird is actually able to fly and constructed plane that are able to do the same . however broad knowledge obviously mean that one never really get into the depth of a subject since there are just too many other subject that require attention . so one could say that a person actually ha a lot of knowledge but doe not know anything completely . i prefer specializing even though it ha one major disadvantage , one get lost in one 's own subject and might easily lose contact to other topic and subject that might be either interesting or important . nevertheless i 'd rather be an expert on one subject trying to really get into it and completely understand all side of it . i would be able to concentrate on that one subject and might even be able to discover new side to it that others did n't discover yet . in other word , specializing may allow for pioneer work , redefining a subject from it 's core . a good example for this major advantage of specializing is research work which can only work when people decide to specialize on subject and , once they 've discovered or developed something new , share what they 've discovered with those that work on other subject . as a conclusion , specializing on one subject and publishing information and knowledge mean greater knowledge for all rather than just an average knowledge for everybody .
