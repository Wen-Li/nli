there is a controversy wheher student agree that it is more significant for them to understand idea and concept that it is for them to learn fact . the majority of student agree the idea . they think that understanding idea and concept will make them understand better in the text . but opposit people think that learning fact is more important . and they claim that if they learning a lot of the fact can make them know a lot of detail in the text , also it can make them easier confer the idea when they know the fact . in my opinion , i agree the both two student ' idea . i think we can not separat the idea above . firsty , i think that if we only know the idea and the concept , we will be nervous and confusing in many question . for instance , we learn computer , the teacher will tell u that the keyboard is using to input the imformation to computer . just imagine , if we only know the idea above , can we use the computer quickly or effieciently ? the answer may be impossible . so the importance of the fact and detains can not be deniable . secondly , the importance of the concept is also exsitance in many field . many people will say that the detains and fact can confer the idea and concept . in many place , it may not work . so we must try our best to learn the concept . as the old saying `` concept is the soul of text ! '' we know that there are no people can live without the soul . from this , we can totally know that the idea and concept in the text are very very significant . finally , we can not deny that the combination of concept and fact can work efficiently and quickly to solve academic problem . consequently , i totaly hold the opinon that the combination of the two thing which is mentioned above .
