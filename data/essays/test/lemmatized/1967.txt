nowadays medium play a more and more important role in our daily life , a we are exposed to it almost all day long , whereever we go . the economy of course make use of this by trying to influence u with advertisement . this however raise the question , whether the product advertised are actually a good a they are promised to be . one might think that the quality of an advertisement reflects the quality of the product , because if the company ha much money to spend on the advertisement , their product sell well and thus need to be good . this however doe not necessarily need to be true , a one soon discovers a loophole in this theory : if a company for whatever reason ha a lot of money in the first place and can spend much of it on an advertisement , people might think that the product is good when it actually is not . and yet the company make profit and can now spend even more money for advertisement for bad product . the sole intention of an advertisement is to influence the consumer to believe that the product is good by praising it and hiding any fact which might hinder this effect . but i think it is very well known that ad tend to lie . computer animation and special effect can easily be used to make a car appear shiny , fast and powerful , driving in a beautilful landscape to create the illusion that this car is good . there are many way how advertisement can create desire in u or let u think that a product is good . for instance the usage of color when advertising medicine : one would rather buy medicine advertised with white and blue color , which make u think that it is clean and sterile , than one advertised with dark color such a brown , which one associate with dirt . this however doe not give any information about how well the medicine work and yet one prefers the first one just because of the better advertisement . so in conclusion , i believe that the statement that advertisement make product seem better than they really are is true because of the many way to incfuence the consumer without him noticing it .
