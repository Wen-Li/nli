nowadays , many people think the best way to travel is in a group by a tour guide because this way is very convinient . but in my opinion , i disagree with the idea . i prefer to travel by myself . the last year , i traveled to the yunnan province with the group by a tour guide . before the trip , i wa very excited because i would have a wonderful trip and visit so beautiful place . but i wa disappoint . the agent wa not responsable for the trip . in some place , i did n't have enough time to visit and to have some photoes because the guide bring me to some store and lost much time . so i think that if we have a considerable plan we are not necessary to travel with the group by a tour guide . firstly , this way to travel lost a lot of money . the guide may take you to some store . if you ca n't buy the good , the guide may not have a good attitude to you in the fellow trip because the guide lost the award from the store owner . moreover , if you enter the group , you must pay for the trip which maybe more expensive than the tip by individual . secondly , traveling with the group lost a lot of time . the reason is that there are a lot of people in the grop , not just only you , so you must wait for the other people when you go to the next place . also , the guide spend a lot of time in the shop so that you do n't have enough time to learn more knowlege of the next place . thirdly , you ca n't feel the freedom when you travel in a group by a guide . the traveling plan is unchanged in the process of the trip . when you konw a new interesting place and want to visit it in the trip , the guide must n't agree with you . in a word , the trip by individual is more free and cheaper than the travel in the group by a tour guide . so i suggest that if you want to travel , you can try to go with yourself . maybe you have a different and wonderful trip .
