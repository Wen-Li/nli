ever since grade school , teacher have taught u fact about many different subject , either important historical date we have to remember , basic mathematics that we will use for the rest of our life or important aspect of nature and the place we live in ; all fact that we have learned by heart and that will never change , we can always relay on them . however , what really influence and determines someone 's life , intelectually speaking , is if someone understands an idea or a concept . unlike fact , idea are not always the same , they may vary depending on the person 's undestanding , compared to someone else . the same idea can be interpreted in different way , depending on many aspect , like the person 's education , his background , etc . facts , like date , are not influenced by these factor , they remain always the same . concepts are also not fact . they way people aply different concept is never exactly the same , although similar , for example in art . the concept established about a certain art movement is already determined , nevertheless , not all art work belonging to the same movement are the same , they each reflect the way the author think , his feeling and his perception of the world . to really appreciate how much knowledge a student ha , one must focus on the way they understand and use idea and concept rather than by testing how much the can learn by heart . to learn a fact is merelly just to memorize and repeat something someone ha already taught u , something that ha been written . aplying an idea on the other hand is much more complicated than memorizing and repeating ; one must first understand the idea and then put it ` to practice ' , so to speak . this idea may already be written , but that doe not mean it is a fact . the way one aplies or explains an idea , not repeat , show if an idea wa understood or not , thus showing how capable a student really is .
