i agree with the given statement that most advertisement make product seem better than they are . most product which are selled on tv for example are called the best in the world . cars , for example . if you buy an mercedes you will be happy , but if you buy an golf you will be happier . that what they want to tell u . but they only want to make u think that these product are the best . it is a kind of manipulation of the consumer . but on the other hand it is understandable to claim that something is really special if you want to sell it . when the producer of a product tell u that his product , maybe chocolat , doe not taste very well , nobody would buy it . as a consumer you have to be able to look beneath the surface . you should not be blind while buying a product . being aware of the fact that advertisement make product seem better than they really are can help you to distinguish between a good and a bad product . especially our child have to lear it . the are very naive a far a manipulation is concerned . they see something colorfull with funny figure they want to get it immediately . without thinking about it they buy it , which behaviour is verz irrational it is an more instnctive behaviour
