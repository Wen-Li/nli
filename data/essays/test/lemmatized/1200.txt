i agree with the statement that ` successful people try new thing and take risk rather than only doing what they already know how to do well ' . success is often achieved with hardwork , persistance and by being dynamic . rather than doing thing which we already know , it good to experiment once in a while depending on the economic , polotical and social condition that might affect the business/career etc . taking an example of a chain of icecream store in a particular state . they could just record the average temperature at different part of the state every year and further decide upon opening a few temporary store at different part of the city depending on the environmental condition . this would increase the mobility of the business and at the same time could prove to be more profitable than the strategy that they were previously employing on . so it okay to try new thing a long a the decision made are sensible enough . the person should'nt be too fickle-minded to trying new thing abruptly without any base . the change should be done by taking both the positive and negative aspect into consideration , that these change might bring into the business/career , he should look in and out of various option and then take the right decision about making change or no and if yes what kind of change . being rigid and getting stick to only one kind of strategy might not help in achieving success . taking an example of a milk product in the market , in order to compete against the different other product in market it should be able to make suitable change so the product stay very much in the market yielding better profit than yester year . so , i would conclude by saying that it better to try new thing in business/career a long a the change made are sensible .
