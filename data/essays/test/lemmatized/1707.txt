throughout their schooltime , student have to gain a huge amount of new knowledge . there are two different type of dealing with new material . one is focused on understanding idea and concept and the other one is just learning fact . however , what is the more important method ? to begin with , it is very important that student are able to understand what they have to study . therefore , they need to understand certain idea and concept . for instance , if they know about the background of some theme and can remember them for a long time , instead of forgetting them right after an exam . this is more often the case when learning about idea and concept . on the other hand , learning about fact is not avoidable . in some subject , student have to learn about many fact and it is difficult to always introduce concept . one subject where there are many fact to learn is history . as that time ha already passed by it is often impossible to , for example , know the exact reason why some invents happened and the idea and concept that were taken into consideration . in conclusion , student have to use both method in order to learn about new topic . the more important one , in my opinion , is understanding idea and concept a to learn fact is just learning by heart and often doe not stay very long in student mind .
