time is the most valuable resource that people have in present world and young people do not stand different . to some extent i agree that young people nowadays are not able to devote time to their community . one of the most important reason is that they are overburdened with the ever increasing quantity of educational material in their college . they are always loaded with the course work , assignment , test , etc and therfeore they do not find enough time to be devoted to their community . during my college day it used to be difficult for me to attend community function because studying used to take a lot of time and i wa seldom left with the time to devote to such function . however on the other hand , i would like to add that studying never discourages young people from participating in community work . infact education make them more aware of what sort of community event are required to be conduted ? young people have more enthusiasm and so they tend to participate community work with more zest . any community work becomes a success only when young volunteer particpate in it . young people organize event for the benefit of whole community . plenty of blood donation camp becomes a success because of young people themselves donating blood in huge number . some social organization are run only with the involvement and support from young people . evening educational class for old age people are generally organized with the help of young people in their community . young people go on touring in their community and encourage old age people to come in greater number to such class . similar class are organized for people who want to learn a particular instrument or are interested in any other art form . young people organize community event where they can educate their community of the latest happening aroundhtier locality . young people during their school often tend to join scouts and guides . scouts and guides is a well known oragnization for the young people and they are invovled in hosting a range of community event , conference and camp round the world . participants in this group organize anti-malria campaign , aids awareness program , etc . so in my view it will be wrong to comment that young people do not give enough time to their community . i support the statement that young people tend to be more inclined towards community work . however the nature of involvement ha shifted from only local to global . nowadays young people are better aware of matter of global interest and therefore tend to work for issue of larger concern rather than the local one . but hey a
