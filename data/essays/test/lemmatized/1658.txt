in twenty year from now there would definately be fewer number of car used . by fewer number i mean that they would only be present on earth , being mose specific they would be lying in junk yard . we human are growing at a rapid phase , we are exploring right from a nail to space . because of this development we will not only explore space but also will start living there . the car will start getting modified will all the gadget invented by u and in few year , inorder to break light barrier , they would have speed beyond that . at that speed car will not be on ground but it would be flying . and i hardly think there would be any need for car to travel in space . at that time we will be having a more sophiscated car like thing ; you can call it space shuttle , super car or something beyond our imagination . people will start living in space , different planet , star and they may also start living in different galaxy , who know . now inorder to travel from one planet or star we would hardly need a car . car will be made used by people who are either poor or middle class , a they do not have much finance to get a house up there . this car are used by them because it only twenty year from now but not forty year . then according to the new definition of car , we will start guiding others by saying `` this galaxy is just another half a light year away . '' invention of new car ; would hardly have any pollution and no health problem , because solar car would have already been invented and put in junk yard . or we may invent some type of fuel for the car which will have no pollution and health problem . so twenty year from now we will be having a very large number of car in use than there are today , but the car will be called a super car or shuttle .
