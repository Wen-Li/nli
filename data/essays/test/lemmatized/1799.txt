i am agree with the statement a follow : in twenty year there will be fewer car in use than there are today . nowadays , there are more and more car than before . there are two reason that i think support this situation . one is because of the prise of car are decreasing , many people can afford a car . the car are becoming a most common transportation every where . the other is that oil and gas are cheaper and cheaper than ever before . that make the car market more poverish . when henry ford made the car came into vogue in the early 20 century . people no longer take the car a a dream that can never be reached . however , a the population of car increase day by day . people have also awared of the bad side that the car bring along with . the most serious problem is air pollution . air pollution cause lot of disease on human , which is endanger to health . take myself for example , when i wa young , i lived in a small country where there are fewer car than in a big city . afterwards , i move to a big city and found my lung wa not a healthy a when i lived in a small country . in spite of air pollution , the use of natural resource are limited . if we do not cherish them , they will be run out in near future . seening these two serious problem , scientist have done research on develop other kind of transportation . for instance , mass rapid transportion system in most of the big city around the world . this transportation include two kind of type , one is subway , the other is skytrain . also the high speed railroad is also underconstruction . we can expect it in the near future . evaluationg to the con of the car and the development in mass transportation system , i thus inclined to say that in twenty even fifteen year there must will be fewer car in use than there are today . after all , all human being are hoping a better life in the future .
