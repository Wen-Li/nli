it 's very hard to say which is more important understanding idea and concpets or learning fact but i agree that student should understand idea and concept for two reason . first , student could have desire to study by realizing idea and concept . second , it lead the student make great invention without knowing themselves . first of all , understanding idea and concept is basis of learning someting . of course , they could study more without them but it offer good chance to the student to study more . the great inventor or scietists knew the baisic idea of they inventon . edison invented light , bell made telephone . they did n't do that by accident . they studied and stuided on the base of the light or comumicatin using wire . second , it 's really difficult to understand idea or concept however , once the student realize what they learn exactly , they could study much easier and enjoy their learing . when i wa in high school , i really hated in chemistry class because i did n't understand lot of name of atomic or principle and i never studied it for the time being and my grade of chemistry wa terrible . there wa no teacher who cheered me up or help but i had to study it to get good score . and i just mermorized them everyday for almost one month . then miracle happened to me . a little by little , i got to realized what i memorized . to be more suprisingly , i have experienced that again during in my university . i wa major in socioloy and sometimes the term were unfamiliar with me and many time , i gave up reading socioloy book . and i made a decision again to read them more carefully and slowly . i realized again what the term meant . it might be my personal opinion but i am sure there are many people with the same expereince . i think all of those were thans to that i focused on baic concept so i still agree it 's more important to understand idea and concept .
