advertisements are widespred and they play a mayor role in today society , since they significantly influence the behaviour of the mass . while it is generally believed that advertisement always make product seem much better than they really are , in my opinion this is not exactelly true , since a distinction ha to be made on the type of product and on the type of customer . the main objective for all kind of advertisment is to emphasize all the positive aspect of a product , and this often translates into totally neglecting the negative one . this is only possible for non technical product , or product which are not conceived for professional . in this case a lie or a non working feature would lead to the opposite effect . in the case of non tecnical product which are to be used by mass , advertisments usually aim at stimulating the more subconscious and subjective idea of the consumer . the value of the object is therefore not the value of the bare object itself , but the value that society give to it . a very popular example is the ipod by apple , which ha become a status symbol . it is very difficult to evaluate the value of an object by looking at it advertisments . i pesonally think that in general advertisments are quite objective and it is people that give object they see in the ad more value , due to the appeal that the advertisement is able to give .
