first of all i would like to point out the fact that there are already a lot of car today . a far a i am concerned i think that there are too many and i hope that there won t be more car in twenty year . on the one hand i think that there will be fewer car . in fact , because of the increase of technology , i am sure that other sort of transport will be developed . i am thinking about train , plane , tramway , boat . car are very convenient but it is more and more expensive to have a car . in fact we can point out the higher cost of fuel and petrol . in addition to that , nowadays it becomes difficult to obtain the driving licence and there are more and more restrictive law about car driving . consequently i think that people will find and use other transport which will be more convenient , easier and le expensive . and we can underline that the developement of technology will help them and will give them the opportunity to do that . on the other hand i am not so sure that there will be much fewer car . in fact car is very useful . nowadays you can go where you want with a car . you can be totally independant . it is a wonderful invention . thanks to a car you can travel when you want , a far a you want . in addition to that fewer car accident can be noticed . consequently that make people more confident and so there is an increase of the car using . government put a lot of money in highway , car structure , road . that give the envious to people to buy and use their car . moreover , the technology enables car to be more and more comfortable . sometimes you can find all what you want in your car . tv , cold drink , food , very comfortable seat . people can feel a if they were in their own house . thus this develops the car market . for all these reason i am not sure that in twenty year there will be fewer car in use than there are today . to conclude i hope that there will be fewer car in use in twenty year thanks to the developement of other tranports . but i am not sure that will happen because they are very useful and comfortable and the car market is still developing . but we must bear in mind that if there will be fewer car , perhaps the other transport which will remplace them will be more polluting , dangerous . so perhaps it is better that there will not be fewer car .
