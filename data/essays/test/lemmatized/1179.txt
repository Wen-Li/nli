i support the idea that succesful people try new thing and take risk , becuase that the first step of success . the first thing you need to do in order to begin something new it 's take the risk that come with it . the fear that the unknown brings it 's what hold u back in life . if you 're not willing to take any risk in life you 're always going to be sure that nothing bad it 's going to happend , but neither something good and unexpected . and you 're going to loose a lot of opportunity that involves taking risk , even simple thing like going on a trip , or buying something new and rare . this fear can become a problem in our life , and i experienced them , a i think a lot of people do . you become afraid of what may happen if you do something new . and that becomes like a habit and you just stop trying because you feel confortable in the world you live in , and any opportunity of changing you livestyle or anything in your life brings a risk , a big risk for you . the reality , i think , it 's that what happen or if you get what you expected it 's not that important , what 's important is that you doing what you feel it 's right and can make you happy , and it may bring you a lot of new and good thing into your life . that 's why the people that take risk and try new thing are more likely to experience a lot of different situation and learned from them and get a lot of succes , becuase they take the risk and they do n't stop if something go wrong they just try something new !! . i admire this kind of people and i 'm working on becoming one of them . there 's nothing to really fear about new experience , they mean that you living and learning , and after the time ha past , all we have left it 's our happy moment and experience throughout our life .
