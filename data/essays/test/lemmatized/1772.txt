i agree that the best way to travel is in a group with a tour gide . i have some opinion to support my answer . firstly , it can decrease the waste of time for our sightseen . the place we visit a a travel would be strange and there are many thing we do not know about the place , for example , the direction , how to ride the local train or public car and so on . then we can depend on the tour guide what we should do or where we should visit . moreover in the case of travel abrod , we do not have to worry about the problem of language . tour gide must be good at the language spoken in the country . so we would not be panic because of the difficulty of the language . secoudly , it can be sure safe for tourist . as the above the paragaraph , we do not be familiar with the place so we can not know about the dengerous spot where we should not go . there are many case that we can not find such place in the guide book by ourselves . so listening the direntions from guide , we can protect our self from unexpected acctident . if , unfortunately , we meet such accident , for example , we lost our pasport or money by theaf , we can depend on a our guide what we should do to solve the problem . thirdly , we can get many knowledge from our guide . for instance , in kyoto in japan , there are so many temple or shrine . then we can learn from him/her about the history of them . it is too hard to do ourselves
