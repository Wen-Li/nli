although i think that people should not be influenced by advertisement , i admit that the marketing initiative of company influence our life , our mentality and our shopping pattern . there are several reason for this and my personal experience reinforces this idea . as i studied at the university during a marketing course , the purpose of advertisement is to catch the prospect ' and customer ' interest on the advertised product . in this way they are fostered to buy it . the lever which are used to achieve this target aim at highlighting the main characteristic of the product . moreover company do their best to make the product seem much better than it is . so i think that making the product seem better is a specific marketing strategy used by company to increase their turnover . there are several way used by advertisement to improve the characteristic of the product and to make it better e.g to make it more fashonable or more beautiful or to increase the smell of the product in the supermarket where it is sold . once i entered a big store and i wa nearly shocked by the advertisement done for one product that is bread . the advertisement wa done by mean of leaflet , commercial about this product were screened on big monitor , the smell of the product wa intentionally diffused in the whole supermarket that everyone bought the advertised bread . me too . to tell the truth it wa not particularly tasty but i wa nearly compelled to buy it . as an employee of an international company which make use of commercial a a key lever to increase the market share , i believe that this way of advertising is a good idea to make the business more profitable . on the contrary , a a private customer , i would like to point out that making the product seem better should be prohibited by the central government of my country since customer invest their money in a product which doe not have the advertised characteristic or feature . this can not be considered a good conduct !
