the above statement is completely true . advertisements do make most product seem better than they are ; but what else do you expect ? advertisements are made by company to promote their product and convince the consumer to purchase them . if this mean they have to bend the truth here and there , they do not hesitate to do so . a prime example of this is a commercial i recall from when i wa young . i wa watching tv one day when all of a sudden i saw the strongest man in the universe and my personal hero , superman ; flying thorugh the air in his signature red and blue attire saving the world . but what wa this ? .. superman wa actually being beaten by an evil monster ! .. he wa ont he verge of death when he remove this energy bar from his pocket and take a bite of it . instantly re-energized he beat the monster to a bloody pulp and save the world yet again from the claw of evil . on seing that 1 minute commercial , i went into a frenzy ; i had to get that energy bar immediately . it had saved the life of my life-long hero . i rushed out to the nearest grocery shop , only to find it filled with kid my age all there for that energy bar . when i finally got my hand on it , i found that it wa no different from every other candy bar i had eaten . i wa angry at the time about this incident but now that i look back at it , it wa not the company 's fault ; but my own for believing everything that came on tv . that is how advertisement work ; they make people buy the item ; that is what they are meant to do , and now that one think about it , that advertisement must have been one of the best ever made !
