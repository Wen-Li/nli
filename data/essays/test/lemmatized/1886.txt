if a person is travelling to a certain country around the world . the person can be led by a group of a tour guide . as this can be a benefital or unuseful way . the benefical veiw , is the opportunity to meet new people and exchanging knowledge and intrests . by having a tour guide to lead the way that he or she take you to the place that are worth to seek it can be a historical or modern area . the person would be handling the pressure of making difficult descions because it relys on one person which is the tour guide . he or she will be handling and planning the trip for the day . and the person main conern is enjoying their time in that country . the unuseful idea , which is not coopertating with the group or with the tour guide having argument and disagreement . the other fact , would be disliking the tour guide that the person feel that the tour guide is not planning the tour correctly . having a group which mean that the lost of time needed to make sure that each person is on the bus or that maybe meeting on a particular area , waiting for all the memeber in the group to be there on time . some people prefare travelling with the member of a family , friend or by themselves . it is because it enjoybe moment to be with somebody your know and relate to . travelling without a group and a tour guide which mean nobody is planning the day and by just planning thier day a they move along . i usually travell by a memebr of a family because i feel much comfortuble . some people who feel that travelling with a group and a tour guide it can be sutable also . from my point of view , travelling either way it is up to the person to decide .
