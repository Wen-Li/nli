affirming that young peolple do n't dedicate much time to their community may be a generalization , because you will always find some youngers that are really involved in their communitiy life , but i quite agree on this statement . indeed , i think that young people are sensitized too late in life to the issue that touch their community . in most case , they are only concerned by their hobby , their friend and family during the first part oh their life . studies and enjoyment are often the only thing that matter to them during their daily life . people begin to realise that their commuties encounter issue and and are motivated to try to help them only when they are older and often when they are touched by some of these problem . in fact , this problem is maybe related to our educational system . even if chidren and then student are told that it 's really important to take part in the social life of their community and to adopt a civilian behaviour , these are just recommandations . children are rarely obliged to set up a project that could contribute to helping their community . young people are rarely encouraged to involves themselves in charity . to illustrate this idea , i will give a personnal example . i have been attending a business school for one year and during the past year we had to plan a tea ; project and to achieve it . we were free to choose the project which attracted u . many project which were launched failed and among those which have been realized , many were not interesting . i think that the school should oblige student to chose project wich are related to their community are to a charity in order to create a work that could be useful to everyone . it 's sure that so ;; e young people decide to involve one self to project useful to their co ;; unity . they are too few . and educationsyste
