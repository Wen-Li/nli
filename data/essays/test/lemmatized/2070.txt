the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide . there are plenty of guided tour and travel around the world . in most place , tourist look for a nice and relaxing journey . although normally hiring a guide represents an additional cost , guided travel contributes a significant cultural enrichment to the experience . as a traveller , one doe not take too much time into planning the site-seeing and other tour . taking the time to buy the city guide and information brochure on museum doe not accomplishes the goal . some of the amazing thing of travelling often rely in the detail . for example , a walk through the courtyard of a castle in england will definitely not be a amusing if noone tell you the detail about who actually lived there . people may even dare to imagine the tenacious fight that once occurred in the castle wall long ago . the old folk story about tourist site revive the experience . the time and place to visit will not always be balanced . there are such place a paris which one can not know for completely after one week of daily walk and museum visit . only those who live there will grow aware of the tour worthy of a pair of worned shoe and body ache . a guide will propose the most amusing site , the world-famous place and those local rare thrilling experience . i would rather pay some more money in a guide than spending plenty of time trying to completely know the louvre museum . anyone who take part of such bold attempt will miss a great deal of paris if he only had a week . definitely , a guide can provide the tour which best fit you interest . in that way , one will go back home and feel relieved because he really knew paris . the best time invested during a travel is the one spent in a guided tour . in conclusion , travelling is a matter of cultural enrichment . to the eye of a traveller , the site will not evoke such experience like a guide would do . the folk story and well invested time give u a sense of satisfaction . there are such beauty in travelling that maybe one can not see by himself . sometimes one would like to share them and not be able . travelling in group led by a tour guide is an alternative that will prove every penny worth it .
