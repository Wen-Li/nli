many teacher generally teach their student by only remember the fact in the content book because of it ease . however , i think that it is more important for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact . there are several reason why i think so . first of all , fundamentally , understanding idea and concept improves human brain 's nature ability . as people understand idea and concept , they can do many application of their thinking and develop these idea . in chosun dynasty , intelligent scholar did n't think idea or concept , and they just learn about the fact of book repeatedly . so the society could not developed , therefore the dynasty wa destroyed by mighty of japan . second , people who try to understand idea and concept have more ability of solving certain problem rather than one who learn fact . people who just learning fact can not view entire story or meaning of their problem , because simple fact make people so simple . they can not solve any complicated problem or work . for example , when korean people are elementary school student , they learn about the method of multiplication , nine-nine rule . many student learn and just remember this rule , not expand more application or it origin that it is derived from many set of addition the number . when they become the high school student or university student , if they meet some complex mathematical problem or other profound problem , it is sure that they can not overcome the difficult stage . to sum up , understanding fundamental idea or concept make the people more intelligent . through people try to understand profound meaning , they can solve more complicated problem in their life . consquently , i firmly believe that it is more significant for young student to understand and consider main idea and original concept than it is for them to learn and remember just fact .
