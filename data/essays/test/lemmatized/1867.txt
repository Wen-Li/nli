i agree with the statement that in twenty year time there will be relatively fewer car a compared to today . the reason for my agreement to this statement are discussed below . first and most important reason is the diwndling petroleum resource . humans are already usurping up all the available natural resource at alarming pace and it pretty much possible that within twenty year we will exhaust most , if not all , of the available petroleum reserve . the increasing cost of petroleum product reinforce it . this will lead to a situation where we will not be having fuel to run the car . this automatically will result in fewer car . second reason for fewer car in future is that in future there will be development of many medium sized city instead of growth of already disproportionately big metropolitian city . for example city like new york , london and tokyo are already so huge that it take too much time to reach city center from suburb . since medium sized city will be relatively smaller in size , time to commute within it will also be small . thus people would prefer to use public mode of transport to commute then driving car because of lower cost and lesser time required to commute . third reason is related to ecological and environemtal issue . as we know car are major source of pollution , government and other law enforcing agency would find it prudent to limit the number of car in a city to avoid further detoriation to our already wretched environment . last reason for possible fewer car in future is due to increasing population we might have to resort to pedestrian way to commute because for such large population car for all people cant be accomodated even when fuel is available . for example , already such a model is in place in few european city like amestradam . the available space for any new construction including parking is decreasing all the time . thus government agency might choose to enforce legislation limiting the number of car in a city to free up more space for housing . thus i think there are number of reason to believe that number of car is going to decrease in time to come .
