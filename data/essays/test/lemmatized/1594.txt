students study in school just want to learn more and new knowledge and experience . some people think it is important to understand idea and concept while studying , however , some people do not agree with it , they think it is more importan to learn fact . in my opinion , i prefer the first idea than last one . firstly , student understand idea and concept can imoprove their intelligence . they can know the knowledge clearly . people who study only want to learn the fact , mybe , they do not know the profound of the concept that will preseven the student ' development . secondly , student understand idea and concept will make they go on to futher education more easy than some one who do not . because they can know the knowledge clearly and develop the it in a high lever . futhermore , they will advance the some aspect in the word after they gratuated from the shool , such a industrial , medical care system , secience research and so on . lastly , student who understand idea and concept mean they know the essential of the knowledge . thus , they can passed their knowledge and experience generation to generation . therefor , our culture will be consevation . all in all , student to understand idea and concept is more important than to learn fact . not only in the people 's intelligence but also in the future of hunman 's development . so , a my respect , it is impotant to student to understand the idea and concept while studying the knowledge .
