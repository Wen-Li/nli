the contention of this discussion is whether it is more important for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact . i agree with the statement that it 's more important for student to understnad idea and concept becase of the following logical reason . i believe only learning fact doe n't do anything in the real world . let 's say about the environmental problem . lots of disaster ha been happening in the world including flood and haricanes . we all know it 's not safe to live on the earth anymore . of course people want to live in the safer world but we did n't know why it 's happening . ten or more year ago we were getting to know temperature of the world is rising up . we found there were some certain relation between them but we did n't know the foudamental thing . i mean we didnt't know why it ha been happening . we did n't know the foundamental reaon , so we could n't do anything about it . this example show it doe n't change anything you only know the fact . now when you understand the basic what can you change ? returing to the global warming , you can get to know the basic idea and concept of the global warming from news or paper . now we know it cause lot of disaster to human . we also got to know since industrial revolusion the amount of co2 ha been increasing beause of our life . you can get to know how to stop the global warming from knowing what 's being the cause of it and now we can stop it if we try . it lead one conculution . without main or basic idea or concept you ca n't understnad the fact or detail of the fact . therefore it 's far more relevant for the sutdents to understand the basic than it is for them to know the fact . only knowing the fact does't do anything and solve the problem . you can understnad the real fact deeplly only when you get to know the foundamental idea .
