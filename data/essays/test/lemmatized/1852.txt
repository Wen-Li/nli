the world we live in is constantly changing , and everyone in it is changing at the same time . the prducts that we are offered have to totally satisfy our need and want . this along with globalization ha created a lot of competition in most of the market . therefore company have to relay on advertisement in order to acquire more customer . a lot of time they put more effort on advertisment campaign than on the real product ; therefore , this creates that the product we consume is not what we expected . most of the comsumers expect a lot from certain product because of the way they advertise it , and at the moment they received the product they will be very dissapointed . big company such a mcdonalds do this . they focuse more on the image of being a happy place for all the child , and having hambuergers that hey appear to be really tasty , but they actually sell food that is unhealthy and doe not taste good . a good example of this will be the bigmac , this hamburger is very advertised a being huge and tasty , but when you buy it , you will see that is not that big and it doe not taste that good . other company such a nike , where they advertise their shoe a the best running shoe on the market , and there are actually other brand that produce more lasting shoe than they do . the problem when company focuse more on advertising their product than actually offer a high quality product , is that when their customer consume their product and realize that it is no good , they will not consume it again . therefore ; this lack of offering a good product will cause them the loss of their client . in a near future they will be forced to run out of business because they will not have anyone to sell their product to . adverstisement can be a great tool in order to acquire a lot of customer , but the person using it should be carefull when doing so . the key is not to sell a lot , but to sell constantly . when adverstising a product they should offer exactly what they are advertising , becasue if they do not do that , their customer will be highly dissapointed and they will lose them in a short period of time .
