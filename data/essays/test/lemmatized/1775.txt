i agree with the statement . i believe advertisement fundamentally present the feature of a product in an attractive and easily understood manner . the highly scientific manner in which this is done lead to the consumer perceiving the product to be better than it actually is . most marketing agency tap certain key trait of human behaviour in their design and development of marketing scheme . some of them are greed , envy and philanthropy . the advertisement would be conceived keeping any one or all of these trait in mind inorder to communicate to the consumer about how the product is the best thing to happen for his or her life . take envy a an example , most product firm use this prevalent human behaviour quite effectively in their advertisement . lets try and remember any advertisement for deodrants or toothpaste . i would like to ask the reader of this essay two question . do you ever remember being mobbed by member of the opposite sex , because of the deodrant that you have applied ? do your teeth becomes a white a those of the person using an identical toothpaste in the television advertisement for the same ? i am sure most of the reader of this essay like me , would reply negatively with a mournful look . let u take greed a the second example , a common practise followed by most product company during public festival is to have massive advertisement in the newspaper stating a discount in the price of their product . a potential consumer who might not need that product at that time , still go ahead and buy it because he or she belief that he or she will not get the product for such a ` good ' price in the future . thus using the festival and greed a a platform , the company creates the message that it product is the best thing for the consumer to own . thus i have stated in this essay , why i think advertisement make product seem much better than they really are .
