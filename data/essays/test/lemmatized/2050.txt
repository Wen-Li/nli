i tend to agree to the statement although i have doubt . of course , when you think of great inventor or explorer , they tried something new and took their risk . but when you think again , what had gutenberg to loose when he invented the book print ? he wa successful without taking a huge risk . on the other side , christoph columbus took a great risk by landing on a new world - without knowing that it is new . how would a map of today 's world look like if columbus and his fellow explorer did n't take the risk of get to know the unknown ? what contradicts the statement are successful people and company that do n't take risk - and being successful just because of that . mcdonalds , for example , make the same burger every day since about fourty year . this company doe n't experiment with the taste of their product and so people know what they 'll taste when they buy a burger . that 's what make mcdonalds successful . people rather walk on path they already know . sometimes people are just not ready to adopt and so a great achievement can fail . for example the computer keyboard , a we know them , are not very efficient . there are way to sort the letter which would let people type faster . but no one would take the risk to change that , because his or her new keyboard would n't have a chance , although it may be better than the one we know . what i want to say is that the reality is more difficult than the statement pretend to be . not every taken risk lead to success and sometimes doing it the common or known way ha more success than taking a risk . in the end , i believe the most successful people are those , who take risk , but know how much of a risk they can handle and know how much of a change people can deal with .
