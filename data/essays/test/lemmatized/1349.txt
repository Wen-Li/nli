advertisements are a thing which i am very skeptic about . i think that advertisement are more focused on making money , on selling the product , than on actually showing the public what the product really is , or what it really doe . rather than just presenting the product a what it actually is , and letting it sell itself because of it true characteristic , advertisement enhance certain thing in order to make the product seem more desirable or irresistable . examples of this can be seen in our daily life in thing we might not even notice . one example of how advertisement make product seem much better than what they are is the presentation of food in the advertisement of fast food chain or restaurant . when we see a mcdonald 's ad , for example , we see an enormous , juicy , perfect-looking hamburger . this make u want to go and buy one right away . later , when it is sitting on our plate , we realize that it is nothing like what we saw on the poster or banner . it is smaller than what we imagined , and not nearly a perfect a the one we saw previously . this tactic used by publicist make the product sell more , by giving the buyer the illusion of a much better thing . another example of this is the way celebrity are shown in magazine . when we see magazine cover we always see people with the purest skin , the most flawless makeup , and most perfect hair we 've ever seen before . this make the magazine more desirable to people passing by becasue the `` beautiful '' people on the cover stand out more , which sell the magazine . people are led to believe that these people are perfect , when in fact they are normal human being , just like the other six billion on earth . another example of a product made to seem better than what it is is the mona lisa . this painting by leonardo davinci is advertised , in a sense , by many history book and movie . it is portrayed by many a the most amazing work of art that ha ever been painted . i wa lucky enough to be able to visit this painting in person , and it wa n't all that i imagined it to be . when we see the mona lisa in book and movie it appears to be a large painting , when in fact it is quite small in relation to others . also , there is n't anything special about it , in my opinion . advertising can have a very influencing effect on people , which we can see throughout society every day . we can not believe everything that we see .
