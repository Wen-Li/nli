the idea and concept and fact are both important tool that will be used to in education . sometimes , these two teaching method are integreted in the class teaching , sometimes , the teacher will more emphasized one tool than another in some particular subject . which one is imporant is a controversial and complex issue , different teacher have different view from their respective angle . as is well know and often be advocated by many people , many people start to start from the concept . many others insist that fact and example are more effective in teaching . i believe that in some subject , fact will be much more effecitive to help the student to undertand what the teach want to expess . for example , when i study in business management in business school , the teacher tell u that constant innovation is the most important factor to maintain success for a company . to illustrate this point of view and ideal , he find a example of ibm . the teacher told u , although ibm invented pc in 1981 , which is the first invetion of personal computer in the world . however , because ibm do n't continue to put effort in innovation on design and technology for pc , ibm quicly loose the leading position in this market . as we all known , ibm had to sell this business in 2003 to lenovo . from this example , all the classmate is very easliy to understant that constant inovation is very important . because from the story and fact that ibm failed in pc business clearly show that even ibm is a huge and leading company in the world , but because they did not keep it up to constantly innovate , the big blue giant also will be deafeted . in this instance , we can see , fact are more interesting , clear , impressive when you want to express a very complext idea and concept , expecially the concept and idea in business management , human behavior , history and many subject that people learn knowledge from observation and experiment . but in some subject , which is more abstract and need to use a lot of concept , then use t be conluded . maybe , the first thing is to help the student to set up a deep and clear understanding about the concept and ideal . i remember , in the math class at college , at the beginning , we must understant , what is the real number , what is the absolutely value , what is decimal , and many other concept firstly . then we can use these concept to conlude some more complex conclusiont . in this kind of subject , all the concept are created by human being , it is we creat the theory of algebra , geograpy and logic . if we do n't understanf the basic concept , you can not understand the more deep conhesive theory in the future . all in all , n my point of view , i think this complex issue should be accessed under a case by case basis . which is the best way to decide which teaching method should be used is highly related what the content of teaching is .
