averstising is nowaday part of our reallity : jingle , leaflet , eye catching poster , ... all of them aim to make the consumer ( known a the target in the marketing vocabulary ) buy a product or a service , no matter they need it . it noticable that advertisment do not show u what we buy , but more , going further than the utility of the product advertised . classic economy teach that the offer ha to meet the demand but more and more , this offer generates it 's own demand , creating new need that cunsomers would not have had if they have not been brainwashed by all the advertisments they are subjected to . the best example is the talent advertiser have to create and lay off trend : produce have to be held by people to make them fashion , but are quickly throw away for others : advertisement try to give a kind of obsolesence : forget the old , buy the new ( this adjectiv is maybe the more noticable in advertisments ) . the second example is the way advertiser use to extand their product 's utility : what they sold is not a product , it is a way of life , a way to show who you are : belonging are to embody your personnality : you have got the last ipod ? you are obviously a cool and trendy person , looking for the best . a cell phone is not a simple way to phone according to advertisments : it is the way to spread yourself to the world with an unlimited ( and most of time expansive ) access to all the digital content you want : you are the new samsung holder ? not only : you are now belonging the world , doing what you want simply with your mobile phone ( so wonderful is n't it ? ) . third illustration of this phenomenon : advertiser use more and more celebrity to promot their produce : beyond the produce you have , you try to reach the person shown in the advertisment ( for example , in japan , camerons dias is the official face of docomo ntt , the first japanese mobile operator ) . advertisments le and le aim to show a product , they show consumer what they want to see .
