`` eat dr. andres slimming pill and loose 10 kgs of weight in a matter of 10 day '' . does that claim seem familiar ? . i am sure most of u are used to readin such trite advertisement in the daily , magazine , hoarding-almost everywhere . but how many of the claim made in these advertisement really true ? a miserably small percntage in my opinion . i firmly support the topic of this discussion . i feel , that to attract a vast customer base , compaies issue advertisement which not only dismiss the side effect or disadvantage of their product but also exagerate the advntages . due to the competitive nature of the market , most company tend to spend a lot on advertisement which glorify their product . for eg. slimming product or technique , a i mentioned before , are advertised almost everyehere , but nowhere will customer find out about their side-effects untill they themsleves encounter these ! a similar examle is of the never ending advertisement of the supposed `` fairness '' cream availible in the indian market . when such product are actually used by the cutomers , they dont genreally fullfill their claim and instead expose their disadvantage or side effect , ence causing a feeling of everincresing dissatisfaction amongs the customer . the customer feel cheated and exploited whereas the company salescontinuously increase due to more cutomers being fooled by the `` glorified advertisement '' . a feeling of prpetual distrust harm other genuine product and their advertisement too . i strongly feel that the government should do something about this issue . i feel that each product before entering the market should be tested by a government organization to ascertain it advantage and list it disadvantage and side effect . the company should be permitted to list only the confirmed advantage in it advertisemnts and also include the side effect it may cause . this way the customer will be able to bank on the advertisement of the product . this , i feel , is the only plausible solution to this problem .
