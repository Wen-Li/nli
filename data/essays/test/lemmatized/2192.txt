'' i completely agree with this statement . in the advertisement , most of our role model endorse the product with such an art and creativity such that they create an impact of really buying them . these day ad are animated beautifully to attract plethora of youngster . they also add special gift , quiz , etc to the bulk of sale . if we look into an example of a toothbrush , say oral-b , we can dig deep into the advertisement field . `` oral-b ha been acclaimed for it large dentist use all over the globe . '' this statement really impress the public . the ad also show the use of toothbrush for it effectiveness . defects like tooth decay , bad breath , gum bleeding are some common problem faced by the people , have been presented very gracefully in an animated shot . these day they show the data of sale of a particular brand of product in last few year in a statistical way . with view of change in the modern world , advertisement world ha developed and reached upto sky-touching height . the changing trend in the society , the upcoming of a new product , the plethora of us ha been depicted in the advertisement in a very good manner . thus , advertisement not only create public awareness but also do increase a sale of product to a substantial amount .
