i partially agree that most advertisement make product seem much better than they really are : this in my opinion occurs especially in sector in which the market are not so developed . in the case of not developed market , advertisement are biased to create a good image of the product : they do that because the main purpose of the advertisement is to make the people buy the new product . this is done showing the good part of the product they are marketing . one of the main reason why this is true is that in this kind of market the success of an advertising company is measured by the amount of purchase of the product advertised ; the people will be more inclined to purchase the good that is presented a being `` good '' and not a being a `` bad '' . this indeed mean that the advertising company is going to try to highlight the good part of a product and it will try instead to hide the worse part of the product . the customer are betrayed and treated a stupid . this mean moreover that the image of the product will be distorted by the advertiser , a the advertiser will be biased to show only the good part of it . the problem with this way of doing advertising might actually come when the market develops and new competitor enter the market . at the beginning they might just compete brutally , trying to highlight the best part of their respective product but when the customer realize that the quality advertised for the product are not true , they might stop buying this product and buy the competitor one . in this case , the advantage to the producer of exagerating in advertising the good quality of their product fall dramatically , while a more responsible statement of the good quality of the product could be the key to achieve more customer . in addition to this the company might be inclined to invest money in enhanancing the image of the company in general and making the customer believe that not only the product are enough good but also that the company is reliable and responsible . in conclusion i think that advertisement make product seem better than they are only in some case .
