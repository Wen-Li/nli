i agree this statement . becuse , i think to succes someting , you have to try new thing and take risk . for example , i think that tadataka ino is one of successful person . he made the first surveyed japanese map in edo period . he started leaning survey at the age of 50 . although this age wa quite old in this period , he tryed to start a new thing , serveyed all of japan on foot . finary , he made really exact map . something new usualy good for u . we can not find them unless trying . about tadataka ino , if he had not tryed to start leaning , japanease map would not have been made . i think successful people usualy like try new thing or can take risk , so that they can get good result rather than pople who only doing what they already know how to do well .
