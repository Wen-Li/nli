first of all , i agree with the statement given here that `` the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide '' . my first reason is , a we go to a new place , we may not be knowing how the place will be , how will be the behaviour of the people , what their culture is , what their custom are , what their tradition is etc . if we go to some latin american country , we may find some difficulty undeveloping their language and also we can not understand their accent even though they speak english . for example suppose you planned to go france . the language the people , speak there is french . you may not understand french , here you need a guide . my second reason is , if the place you planned to tour a historic place without a guide , you finally end up with the rocky structure you saw there . as each historic place ha a history behind in the main purpose is to know it history . as we are not familiar with the place and it history , a guide it is right person to explain it . fot example , take an instance of visiting mahabalipuram , a famous historic site in india , it 's all filled with temple made of rock , carving on stone etc . we need a guide to explain what those rocky structure are . lastly i deside to say from all the previous thing i discus `` the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide '' . from these you know every thing mean history and what are the resourses are thereand the greatness of that place . moreover you enjoy the company of the tour guide , traveling with company is good .
