from my point of view it is more importent to understand idears and concept , becouse what can we do , if we do not understand thing . first , understanding is very importent , because without understanding you can not put a fact in anouther problematic situation . like in the biologie , there you must lern the mendelschen rools . if you do not unterstand the rools you can not finde a answer of question in witch the teacher want to combine rool and situation . if you only learn the rools , you do not know how to cominations the situation . you only know that you need for example rool 4 , but why do you not know and that is not good . second , it is importend to combine situation . with the learning of fact you can not write and essay , because you must combine it . you must write a logical structure . so that the reader understand what you are want to say . fact after fact is not interesting to read . you must modorate the fact and if you do not unterstand it is very difficult to do that . you need a reason to write about . third , in your life you will have new situation and if you can understand what is to do , you will finde your way . people who only lerrn fact le the ability to handel situation . like the light who show that you can walk across the steet . you lern if it is green you can walk , but what is to do , if the light is defect and you can not see a light . that are a simple example , but it show what mean with new situation and the understanding what to do . so i agree with the statement that it is more importent for student to unterstand idears and concept that it is for them to learn fact .
