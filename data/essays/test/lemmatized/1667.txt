i completely agree with the statement that ` most advertisement make product seem much better than they really are ' . advertising ha now become a major field of study and there ha been a lot of research in this domain of marketing . the basic purpose of advertisement is to provide a leverage to a product so that the product sell and can compete with other product in it 's category . advertising give a product a platform to showcase itself in the best possible manner to the customer . the product shown in advertising are customized by the owner of the product himself or the team behind building it . the customization of product on screen add to the visual appeal of such product . lighting , color , size etc are generally varied by advertizer to increase the product 's visual appeal . this intices the target customer and he rush to buy the product only to find that their are many variation in the look and the quality of the product a compared to those shown in advertisement . for example , advertisement of titan watch show the product in life-size image . the watch are enlarged on screen , polished heavily and often are shown with beautiful packaging . when the customer buy such watch , first of all he might find the heavy polish missing . also , the packaging and the life size image which attracted him are not even thought of while buying the product . another tactic that advertising agency use is the inclusion of celebrity in advertisement . if a well known celebrity endorses a product and promotes it , the customer interprets a different image about the brand and the item being promoted . the qulaity factor of the product is related to the celebrity promoting it . for example , amitabh bachchan ha started promoting a hair oil from a firm which wa never heard of earlier in the market . the effect of mr bachchan endorsing such an oil ha automatically leveraged the image and reputation of the product , irrespective of it 's quality . gurus in the field of advertising do not deny the fact that almost on all occasion , the high quality advertisement are overdone and are not in accordance with the product 's quality . but with time the customer have become more aware of the tactic used by clever advertiser and with the increase in incidence of disaccordance of the product quality with it 's advertisement , the cutomer ha evolved and there is an urgent need for new methodology in the field of advertising that would enable the advertiser to send across the right message without using exaggeration .
