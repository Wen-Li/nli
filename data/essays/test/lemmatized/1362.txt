i agree with the statement that `` most advertisement make product seem much better than they really are '' because i really tasted it . not only advertisement , but also spot on tv make believe that . not all spot are true . they show the product a they want the product is seen by people . this is a terrible and huge mistake by the publicitarians because people go to the shop , buy th product and then client are not satisfied by the product itself . for example this mistake can be related to the bought of a pair of jean , like in my case . after i saw a paper publicity of a pair of jean , last week i went to rinascente in monza to buy that pair of jean . once i wa arrived , i went to the first floor looking for the jean and when i found them i wa really surpraised because they were not seem to be like the one 's on the paper advertisement . when i saw that , i did not buy the jean and i went to another shop in which i found a pair of pant that i really enjoyed . another example is what is non-mentioned in and an advertisement : pheraps the product can seem beautiful but it can be very and much expensive . it is all a question of language used for show product . there are different type of language and it is necessery find out the most appropriete to show a product . nobody say that is necessery follow fashion , rather than advertisement . it stay at each person judging if a spot is true or not . fortunately there are different way of thinking e so everyone can make his choise independently by others . everyone ha freedom of thinking and it is very , very important to make one 's choises .
