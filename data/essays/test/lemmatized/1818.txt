i agree with the importance of the understanding of all subject or topic . i believe that is more imoprtant for a student to understand something that just learn it . as an example , in a history class you will memorize , date , place , number of individual in a certain place , and that is right , but that is not the full concept of history , history is knowing how the thing happend ? , why they hapend ? , for what reazons ? , all that kind of doubt that you should be able to understand . another example will be mathematics , your teacher give you a formula for memorize and you will memorize it but if you dont know how to use it in a problem in a quiz you will be stock and you wont go any farther untill you understand it . people need to use their brain , more than just saving record , date and name . students need to start thinking , in that way they can develope better understanding towards any subject . one great thinker in the history of human kind , galileo galilei he learned how the gravity work by understanding it spending time watching thinking over and over again until he figure it out . a big part of our society relies in people that are able to understand thing , like geologist with the global warming , they need to understand why the world temperature is increasing drastically , detectives need to understand what happend in crime scene in a way to catch the author of the crime , scientifics need to understand why the thing happen in physic , chimestry , biology and all kind of branch that the science have . my conlusion on this subject , is that student need to understand everything that is arround them in a way to develop more the logic behind everything .
