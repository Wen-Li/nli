are cars slowly becoming extinct ? yes , i agree with this statement because of the following reason . in today day and age the people of all age and culture have become extremely health and environment concious . this is probably because in every newspaper and magizine a well a on the television you will always find an topic on the envionment appear , this ha spread awarness through out the world and ha got people thinking about the future of the earth . due to this many country , government and city have begun a concious effort to try and reduce the number of car on the road , in a final bid to try and conserve our environment which is already begun to discentigrate before our eye . like the glacier that have started to melt in anatarica and the many hole that have appeared in our ozone layer . therefore we see many change in the thought proccess of the future generation and of the current government . for example in japan we see rule being passed which make it illegal for one person to drive a car to work , there should be at least four people to a car , in turn this cut down the number of car on the road and help to reduce the damage to the environment . another country that is trying to cut down on the amount of car usuage is dubai , which ha already started construction on a metro rail system which run throughout the city and take commuter to and fro ; from work , school or shopping this along with the slowly increasing petrol cost will help encourage people to use the tram instead of their car . many other country have also passed rule on car usuage , like the u.s. and u.k. which have implemented heavy tax on petrol a well a on car manafacturers , hence raising the cost of purchasing a car . therefore due to all the positive publicity , public awareness and government envolvement we see people willingly using alternative method of traportation a well a slowly being forced by peer group and government rule to use alternative transportation method . thus i agree and strongly believe within the next twenty year we will see very few car in use or maybe even none at all .
