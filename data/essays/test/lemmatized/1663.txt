in twent year there will be fewer car in use than there are today . i do not think it is really possible and hence , i completely disagree with this statement . over the last decade the automobile engineering ha definitely made giant stride in term of advancement and to me it doe not seem to wither away so easily . a burning building can not be put off in one minute even by the fire brigade . in this case i have observed that car machinery and technology ha definitely become much better over the year owing to the burgeoning need of the customer . if i talk of my country , india , i have seen here many number of multinationals pop up during the last decade only and manufacture car for sale in the market . this definitely indicates that business tycoon are not restraining from investing million in this industry . the chief reason i feel that the number of car in use would not decline is we , the customer . it would be strange if i ask anyone that would he stop driving a car after twenty year ? he would give me a surprised look a the question sound absurd . people hope to buy new bigger better car in future a provided by their finance , they never think of giving away the old car and give up driving . thus it the customer that ha evoked the need of better car , faster car and more and more technologically advanced car . with time the economic status and level of the common man is also increasing and thus allowing him to harbour dream of buying a new car or a bigger and more novel car . another reason for me to support my opinion would be that if people wo n't travel by car then how will they travel . it is noticeable that train and aircraft do not reach each and every place and hence we have to resort to car in any case . its worth mentioning here that a recent survey conducted by the outlook magazine of india clearly illustrated the view of the people that they enjoy car-driving much more than any other mean of transport . even if i contemplate , i realize that there is nothing a thrilling and fun a going oyt in a car with my family or friend . if we look around ourselves we will dicover that there are university which are promoting bachelor 's degree in automobile engineering and score of student are undertaking these course . it doe not signify a decline in the upcoming year a these graduate are readily being employed in corporate house . in india , the number of car have increased approximately tenfold in the last decade and so in other country too more car are coming on the road . in the conclusion i would say that in present day circumstance i see no evidence to prompt me to support the view that there would be fewer car in the next twenty year .
