human being have never compromised with innovation , from the stone age to present modern life , the society ha worked for the betterment and development a a whole . one of the finest example could be a the steam engine , that drived many country for almost half century , the best use of steam engine wa for locomotive purpose , and one of the most seen locomotive is a car . car on the course of development ha reached to such a perfect stand that it ha become necessity for each individual . with the advance of the machine and other faccilities it ha become the most helpful invention for the mankind and since then there ha been a gradual increase in the number of car on the road . and i still belive that though there could be many reason why one can think of fewer number of car in the nxt twenty year i do not agree to the point . to begin with i shall try to give some reason why one can think that there would be fewer number of car on the road . car requires fuel , such a petrol or diesel or some other form of energy providing fossil . the number of car on the road depends a lot on the supply of fuel which definately will finish on our earth but then the reservoir have enough fuel to last for nest ten decade and the explorer are in search of new oil feilds , moreover we have also shifted from the basic fuel to alternate fuel such a the car driven by electric supply . hence , i dont think this could be one of the reason why there would be fewer car in use after twenty year then now . then other reason could be that people might opt for other mode such a personal plane which are far more efficient and save time , but they are not very economical and doe not fit to the pocket of many ! other resason could be that people might shift to public transport because the present number of car can be seen a the saturation in the big city like washington or newyork , but there are many other country where the saturation is still not reached , in fact the larger portion of the society in developing country wa not so sufficient to buy car a they are now and hence , the market expects a larger rowth may be in next twenty year these market would also saturate and to save time people might switch to public transport but then too the number of car would be much more then present . moreover public transport can always be opted at the cost of independence . in general one opts for another option if the present condition is not able to satisfy the need , or is heavy on pocket or some sort of hidden advantage , but i see no other option giving so many advantage a a normal car doe atleast when compared to the option we have . unless their is a better alternative that i can not see of in present future i can not agree to the point that there would be fewer number of car after twenty year .
