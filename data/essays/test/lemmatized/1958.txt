almost every one like travelling . someone prefer to travel alone because they feel more independent and free , while others prefer to travel in a group led by a tour guide . as for me , i think when people are going out for a trip , they should always be in a group and led by a tour guide . first , having a tour guide can save tourist time and money . every one ha experience that when one is in a totally new place where he ha never been before , he may feel confused and do not know what to do and where to go . it is the same for people who are on a trip without tour guide . though the place ha attractive view , such a old temple or beautiful beach , one may still can not find the right way to get there . for instance , i once went to cambridge in england and wanted to see trinity school , but i just get lost on the way . i spent 4 hour in asking people . taking bus , and finally reached there at 5 p.m . it is really exhuasting . one can imagine if there is tour guide beside me , the situation will definitely change . furthermore , staying in a group led by a tour guide will save one 's money . in some sight , the ticket are much cheaper for group visit . and staying with more people , most importantly with a tour guide , will make bargin easier . moreover , one can make friend when travelling in a group . sometimes , there are some interesting people in the group that one can talk to and make friend with . i remember on my last journey to beijing , there wa a really humorous guy in the group and told so many joke that made the trip relaxing and full of fun . and we all became good friend after this trip . besides , one can always find some people in the trip who share the same interest with him . during the trip , they could discus movie they like , sport game they enjoy . this kind of friendship will make trip never boring . by contrast , if one travel alone , or just by several close friend , he can never have such excitement . admittedly , there are some advantage for people travelling without a tour guide , such a freedom and independce they can get , and he may schedule his time more flexible , however , i still think travelling in a group and led by a tour guide is good choice . to sum up , travelling in a group led by a tour guide will save one 's money and time , and add the chance to meet new friend during the trip . therefore , if i am going out for a trip , i certainly go with a group of people and having a tour guide .
