due to the importantance of economic and the competence bought by various kind of product , the advertisment is playing a more and more essential role in our life . but to say advertisemnts are all taking benifits to u , however is not easy . the most noticable problem is whether the advertisement do give u a true view of the product . depending on my personal experience and view , advertisments , at least most of them are sending u a better product than they actually are . first of all the information from the advertisement may not be complete . every thing ha two side . the product a well , may have their disadvantage . however the company want to maxize their profit so that they always hide the dark side of the product from the customer . take the sport drink a an example . we can see from the advertisement that the sport drink can take u energy when after kind of sport . but we also need to know it will become poison if we drink too much , especially when we are not doing sport which is not presented from the advertisement . so always we can only see the advantage from the advertisement . another reason for my propensity is that due to the serious competence of the modern market , if one company presented an untrue advertisement without punishment , the other company may be affected by them . if they do not do the same thing , they may not working well or even can not survive . so this kind of untrue advertisement just spread out like virus . it is so common now that the company advertise their product untrue . taking in to all aspect above i agree with the statement that most advertisement make product seem much better than they really are . and it is expected that the govements can notice this problem and take a effeciency way out .
