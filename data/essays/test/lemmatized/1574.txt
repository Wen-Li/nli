nowadays we are exposed to advertisement during the whole day . we listen to them on the radio when we wake up , we read them in the newspaper , we watch them on television or while driving our car . advertisement campaings are an essential part of the marketing of every product and company invest a lot of money in them , sometimes much more of what they invest for the manufacturing of a product . in all modern country governaments and parliament had introduced specific rule in order to regulate advertisement and give a little proctection to consumer . of course , in advertisement all product seem nicer and more useful . it must be so , since the advertisement are made to sell the them and the success of an advertisement campaign depends on the sale result of these product . i usually do not give much attention to advertisement and i try to buy just what i need . however , i remember that i bought a pair of shoe just because i had been convinced by the advertisement . according to it , this particular shoe had a rubber sole with a special membrane , which allowed the sweat to go out through small hole in the sole while letting the water outside . it seemed a good idea to me , because it matched the advantage of a leather sole , which is naturally breathable but not water-proof , and the advantage of a rubber sole , which is water-proof but not breathable . unfortunately , reality wa very different from theory . the first time i used these shoe in the rain i came home with my foot soaked in water . since that day i listen to advertisments with more suspect and i always think that they are trying to cheat me somehow . of course it is not always so . many good product are advertised and may advertisement are correct and fair .
