the thesis given pose a question that whether most advertiser make product seem much better than they they really are . i agree fully with the assertion that the above statement is correct . development of human civilization ha given birth to commercialisation and industrialisation . advertisement is a major part of commercialism . to sell it product more than it 's competetor advertisement is used . companies driven in complete madness to earn more , have produced an era which ha produced the level of excellency in the field of advertisement that ha never been experienced before . now even the financially bankrupt company can not afford to exsit without having a separate adbvertisement and publicity deparrtment . this department is full of hilly skilled technician and artist which work together in such a way so a to display the valubility of the product more than what it 's worth . at this moment i would like to give the reader the example of manchester united . thy are one the the most known football club in the world . their player such a cristiano ronaldo wa signed a a brand ambassodor for the pepe jean . his stunnings look while wearing the jean during the advertisement inuces a sort of feeling in the watcher 's heart that he could be comparable to ronaldo in appearence if he wore the pepe jean . thus the brand value of the jean is increased and ronaldo through advertisement ha made the jean worthier than it 's inherent quality . hence company use many celebrity a brand ambassodors which seeing openly a the name itselfs state increase the value of the brand . telecom service giant vodafone for this reason endorsed manchester united . also that 's the reason why bradd pitt is endorse by rollex , a giant watch-maker . the advertisement war began in the 1970 's when the cola war began between pepsi and coke . each tried to outdo one another by hiring the best team of technician which could produce the best visual effect in television available at that time . but one must realise that the inherent value of the product will not change . in the end i wold like to convey that one must be aware of the true qua ; ities of the product in case of final buying and not become a trap - goat of the advertiser . one must be a vigilant and alert buyer . the mass should not be influenced by advertisement and spend in a wise way a every penny is worth the fun .
