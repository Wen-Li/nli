life is full with risk and we often face different kind of risk during our life time . i agree with the statement . i think successful people always take risk to do new thing . there are a lot of reason to be successful by taking risk . firstly , i think the person who is afraid of to change his life doe n't try to new thing . so , he can not meet to right opportunity to change his life . perhaps , he ha a perfect talent for music , but when he doe n't try , nobody can know this . as a result , he lost the oppotunity which can change his life . i always believe that if i had n't take risk , i could n't improve my mined . when i graduated high school , i wa a nurse and i had a good salary for a person who wa 17 year old . i did n't need to take risk to change my life , but i thought that i could be better . so i resigned from hospital , then i got into university . after i graduate to university , i took some exam in my country and past them . my goverment chose me a a student who would go to the usa for master degree . now i am here , 10 year later than the graduation from high school . sometimes taking risk cahanges our all life and make u successful . on the other hand , taking risk make u brave and we can make new decisous without being afraid . so it provides to think logicly , because when we are afrait to be fail , we can not think well . i think taking risk improve our ability for make good decisious . for example , the success people who tried tnew think usually become more successful in the future , because they can think clearly without be afraid . in summary , in my experiance , although there are some exception , taking some risk can make people success . because they play for big praze , if they win , their benefit are bigger than other people who choose to be same . in addition , if we do n't try , we can not know what is waiting for u on the unknown part of life .
