i totally agree whith the statement that most advertisement make product seem much better than they really are , for many reason . it is the goal of a good advertisement to do it , and they have lot of technique to manage it . the goal of people who make the advertisement is to sell the product . so they need to present it in a way a better a possible . for instance , for an advertisement for food on the television , they will broadcast the advertisement before dinner time , and it will be exposed the item in such a way that you will want to purchase eat immediatly . but then when you have your product , you are often desappointed , because it seemed to you that it tasted better on the screen . all people have seen advertisement for coffee . on the television , you have the impression that you will have a lot of cream in you coffee . but when you prepare it alone , the effect is never the same . futhermore , marketing manager know lot of technique to present well the produce . they will use some software a photoshop , which allowed to highlight the advantage of the item . the item is almost always replaced in a context . for example , for an advertisement for a soda we will see a woman who drink a soda on the beach . thus . the product seems always better on the adevertisement . moreover , for a paper advertisement , they will will place the item in the good place , in order that you focus at it directly , when you look at the picture . however , consumer are not so stupid . we take into account the fact that the reality can be different than the advertisenents , and we do not except for having exactly the same thing on our hand and on the tv .
