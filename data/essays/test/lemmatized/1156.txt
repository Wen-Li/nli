i most certainly feel that having broad knowledge of many academic subject is far more beneficial than to specialise in one specific subject . according to me gaining knowledge is an ongoing process . to restrict oneself to a particular sphere would encourage ignorance . for example , being a law student if i restrict myself to the study of criminal behaviour and it impact on society i would totally be ignoring the vast field of civil law which contribute greatly towards the well being of the society . let me elaborate further , while i wa in my first year of law , we had sociology a a compulsory subject . all of u failed to understand how sociology could be connected to law and we were anxious to get over with the course and move on to something more interesting . it wa in my second year of law that i realised the significance of what i had studied . sociology provided the basis and the reason for why the various law were initially framed . it explained how the need of the society gave rise to the collective will of the legislature to frame certain law . without understanding the basic sociological concept i would never have been able to understand the logic behind law . as a law student i have come to embrace research . i have time and again come across legal problem of varied nature . i have always built upon my basic knowledge of law and substantiated it with concentrated research over the area related to the particular problem . but without the basic of every subject it would definitely be impossible to give the client a complete and well informed advise . in this era of globalisation and knowledge sharing it would be highly disadvantageous to close door to any academic sphere . i feel that it is a must to have broad knowledge of many subject to be successful in any career .
