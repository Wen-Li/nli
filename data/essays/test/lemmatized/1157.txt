advertising is an art . how do you get people to buy a specific product rather than the other one next to it ? you only emphazise the best aspect of the item , and more importantly you `` claim '' . advertisers often mislead buyer on the real value of what they are selling to them . this is why i strongly believe that advertisement make product seem much better than they really are . and to support my opinion , i will use exemples based on my personnal experience and observation . i never forgot the day when in the u.s for a month i decided to call a television marketing channel to buy a set of kitchen knife . i wa probably only 8 or 9 year old but i wa mesmerized by what wa promised to me. `` it will cut right through the bone of your chicken like if it wa a tomato '' the sellsman claimed . after convincing my older brother to call and buy the knife , i wa more impatient than ever . but when they finally arrived , my deception wa huge . the knife did n't look at all like the steel one i 'd seen on tv , nor did they cut very well , even through soft and tender ingredient . in fact i had n't looked at the bottom of the tv screen , where a little star stated that the product aspect could differ , and it efficiency too . even last year in europe , a law wa passed to ban misleading advertising in the food industry , because consumer started to complain that they had bought morning cereal that were supposed to lower their level of stress , and that sadly , it did n't work the way they had expect it to . the truth wa there wa nothing , not even a single ingrdient that wa known to reduce stress level . while it may be true that you do have certain product that offer what they promise , the vast majority doe n't , and it is all because of one thing : profit . they have to sell a much a they can and find every way and mean to convince a consumer to consume . so do n't believe that advertisement stating you can loose 60 pound in 7 week , or the one claiming you can grow back new hair without surgery if you are bold , because they are simply irrealistic .
