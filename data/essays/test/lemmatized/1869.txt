nowadays we live in a globalization world . we produce a lot of thing . we live in a world where quality it 's not important , the most important thing is buying . the most we buy the most our economy grow up . in every moment of our life we see spot . when we are wathcing television we see a lot of spot of new mobile , new television , some new computer etc . we live in the consumism era . we always need the best moble , car or somethings like that . we need it because our society ( economy ) , want that we spend our money . we usually spend our money for something that are unusefull for our life . so if we want to buy a mobile , we have to choose between 100 of it . there are many productores of the main produtc . we have samsung , lg , nokia , motorola , and probably they are all the same . i agree with this statement because it ' real . when i buy somethings in it advertisement it seems the best one , but sometimes it break up in a few month . i think , also that in our society advertisement have to tell lie . there are a lot of competition between the same product , because we have a lot of these , and sometimes they are all the same . at the end i buy somethings not for it quality but for it aspect , and also for it spot . i can `` follow in love '' for a mobile , if it spot is incredibly strange or amazing . we live in a society based on aspecs and image . i think that we are attract of what it is new and beautiful . for this reason we buy something that in it advertisament seem the best one , but we know that is n't true .
