the youth of today is the future of tomorrow . keeping this saying in mind , i strongly contradict the opinion that `` young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their community . '' to support my claim , i would like to provide example of a charity school and an incident i witnessed on the road . i am aware of a charity school that is run entirely by people within the age of eighteen to twenty - five . these young men and woman come to school every evening for two hour to teach and instruct child who are not privileged enough to receive a formal education . they also instruct the child in extra curricular activites such a dance and music . in my opinion they are opening a number of door for these child by providing them with an education free of cost and are saving the child from a life of poverty . the education these child have accquired , however le it may be , will help them to secure a job which in turn would ensure them a livelihood . in this , one can not say that the youth of today is not helping society . i often walk on the street of the city in which i live . once i noticed an old man trying to cross the road . he wa rather hesitant and visibly scared but no one came to his aid . to my astonishment , i saw a young girl of not more than 16 year , come up to him and help him cross the road . these are two of the numerous incident which , made me think that our prejudice against the youth of today is not completely valid . there are still the young men and woman who devote time to their community hoping to help people and better their life .
