most advertisement make product seem much better than they really are . i agree with this statement 100 percent for many reason . ` if there is no advertisment there is no life to the people who work in centre and store , and also for many company and buissnessmen ' . why do i say this ? lets think about this example ; if a copmany produce new product , how it will let the people know this product supposing if there is no advertisments . it 's not important this product is useful or not , the fact is on how much money do the company lose if these product would n't bought . now , what is the onther advantage of the advertisments ? when all watch the advertisments on tv or on newspaper , we will hurry to market to buy this product . and by this way ... if the product which we bought is really useful to u , that 's mean we will buy it whenever we want and not search for onther one . from this the advertisment is n't just help the company to advertise their product but also it will make u more comfortable and wonderful . what is the way that can help company to advertise their product ? from my point of view advertise their product by make an agree with one of the favourite channel that many people watch it is the best way to do so . on the other hand not all advertisments we watch is tell u the truth about the product , but when we watch it on the tv , we will be eager to know and buy the product and then the company will be gained . finally if i were in buissnessmen position , i would make sure that all my product will advertise in many diffirent way . because this the only way will make me gain a lot of money .
