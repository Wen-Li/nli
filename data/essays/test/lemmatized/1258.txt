i completely agree with the statement shown bellow . it is quite true that most advertisement make product seem much better than they really are . i will continuously give my explanation and personal opinion of this agreement . usually , the place were you find the advertisement of these product are in the street shown on billboard , the television , magazine and news paper . each and every add ha the intention of giving the best impression to the society , or better known , the shopers , the consumer . in some case the advertiser exagerate the appearance of the product . it is obviously their way of selling and catching inmensely the buyer attention . it is true that it 's their way of selling , however it is n't the right one . after buying a product that seemd much better on the add than in the reality , the person aquires a different view towards it . for example , if you buy a shampoo in the supermarket , believing that it will supposely help to nourish your hair and to give more volume to it , and you do n't observe any difference or improvement , you will obviously stop buying it . lying with the function of the product may help the fact that people will buy it . however , it wont bring an economical progress for the company . this may provoque a problem with the consumer , because people nowadays are not sure if they buy the product or not . by nature the human being is unconfident and this may cause a problem with the consumation . people are no longer buying what they see on the television for example because ther are afraid that the product wont work a good a it look on the tv set . i personally believe , that the society ha to change , so that this vision or belief that people have , becomes different , that is to say in a more positive aspect . the function of the product should n't be a lie . it defenitely wo n't help the company . they should expose what is real to their project . if it is n't quite good enough , then they sould simply work harder to make it better .
