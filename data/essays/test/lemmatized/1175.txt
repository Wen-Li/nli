some people think that young people nowdays do not give enough time to helping their community , but other people think that young people give enough time to helping their community . i think that many young people do not give enouth time to help the others because they tell that they have n't many time to spend for the community . it is not true , because if a person want to do something for the society he can do it . the time is only an excuse . many young people prefer to use their free time playing or doing different activity that they like most . for example , in my school there are a lot of boy that , after the lesson , go to join theirselves . they do not give any time to helping their community . after the school , i take the train ; i go to milan all the day and i arrive at home very tired , but i do different activity to helping my community . i help the old men and woman ; i go to play with the child and i go with them to school to do the homework . the people do not pay me : i am a volunteer . i also teach catholic religion to child and i very happy to do something for my community . i agree with the statement : in my small town there are only few people that do give their time to helping the others . the time that the young people use for other is not enough and i think that we could do more for our community : in the future time , we will want that some people will do give time to helping u .
