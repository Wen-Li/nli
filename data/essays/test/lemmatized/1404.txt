some people think go to have a trip with a group and a tour guide is a good choice while others hold the opposite idea . as far a i am concerned , i believe it is a good choice to travel with a group with a tour guide . there are may be one or two disadvantage to having a trip with group and tour guide , however i think the advantage are far more . first of all , one of minor disadvantage to having a trip with a group is that you will lose your freedom partly . for example , you can not go wherever you want to during the trip such a you want to go to visit somewhere is not included in this trip schedule but you just begin to be interested in . another drawback is you can not arrange your time freely . for instance , you need be on time and make sure not be late for the arrangement during the trip . such a having breakfast in time , leaving time , gathering time . though there are one or two disadvantage to joining the travel group with a tour guide i do believe the advantage far outweigh them . by taking the group trip with a tour guide , you can enjoy your trip a much a possible and do not need always check your arrangement . for example , you do not need check the information about the trip arrangement such a hotel booking , reastaurant booking or bus arrangement . also by joining the group trip you do not need prepare a lot for the trip . for example it is not nessary for you to prepare the knowledge detail about city or country you will go such a history , culture , eating habit , climate infornation . all those you will be told by the tour guide before or during your trip and by taking group trip you can help or be helped during the trip . for example you lose you way during the trip . you will be helped by others to find you back to the group . another advantage to taking the group trip with a tour guide is that you can make friend and have a very wonderful atmosphere . for example you will feel more enjoyfui to travel with lot of people with the same interest a you . so you can share the memorable moment with them and each of you is able to have unfotgetable memory such a your good picture which were taken by others . you may become friend later through the trip . although i agree there are one or two disadvantage to taking a group trip with a tour guide i believe the advantage are more obvious . considerable though the benifits spending the trip time freely alone enjoys are , they can not compete with the advantage that taking your trip with others brings out when sharing the joyful moment and making friend are taken into account . so taking a group with a tour guide is nothing but a wise choice for me .
