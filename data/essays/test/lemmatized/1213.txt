it go without saying that different field need diferent way of learning . but generally speaking , it is fact and experince that can help u better understand the knowledge , though idears and concept are still important factor . it is said that concept and idears are the basic unit of thinking , one can hardly give a thought without clearly definition of a relative objective or substance . for example , when people deal with a math problem , he or she can never get a consequance ----- not to mention a corect answer without knowing what is `` add '' or what is number . of course this is a eregious example , but it can well demonstrate the problem . howere , the importance role of the concept and idears in sovling problem can not banlance the significant factor of a personal realisition of a certain fact . for one thing , the fact or a realistic experience can go to a long way toward a better undersanding and a well conmand of knowledge . for istance , only you look and touch a elephant by yourself can you get a sense of the huge and strong of it . in addition , there still some usefull skill that is impossible to conmand without the fact get from a certain experience . to suppert this one need look no further than the skill of swimming . though one can well remember the important term and key point of motion , we can suppose the scence the first time he or she plunge in to a swimming pool . in conclusion , fact is much more important than concept and idears .
