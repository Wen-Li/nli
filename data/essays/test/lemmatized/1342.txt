some people agree that most advertisement make product seem much better than their reality . however , i strongly disagree that product are advertaised with emphasis for the following reason . first , many company have to inform reality for customer . if they emphasize their product through advertisement , they should pernished by not only law but also society . for example , there are many incident about unfair company . to lie about many thing where their product made in , when their product made , what they use in their product , and so on . these behavior destroy their credit from customer and client . after incident , almost company could not recover their credit and drop out . in addition , many customer understand what product wiht high quality . advertisements give customer only first impression about product . it is important that customes buy product repeatly . for example , in my company , oil company in japan , we do not have many advertisement . we think that advertisement are not large influence for customer . we strongly believe that the quality of product and service are more important . many competiters use much cost for their product using famous person . in my opinion , they have to use their cost for developping their new product or quality of product . in conclusion , i definitely believe that most advertasements make product better than they really are .
