i disagree with the statement , a some of my most valuable and unforgettable travel experience are from travelling on my own or with friend independently . travelling in a group ha it advantage , yet i would say that doe not necessarily mean that it is the best way to travel . for example , there are also great advantage in travelling independently , such a you are free to wonder around on your own pace , stopping at certain place that interst you most and improvise the route a you go along . what i like about travelling is that you can see a whole different world , culture , life , language , food , custom and so on , that is completely different from what you are used to see or live in . and it is usually in those small street i went in wondering about when i meet the most interesting scene of local life , unfamiliar thing or exotic shop . also you tend to get to know more people easily when you are moving individually , which is another big purpose for me to travelling around . conversation with other traveller , local people , or even taxi driver , meeting and getting to know what all the other people are feeling and thinking in their daily life is something i find very intriguing , a they often have completely different way to see thing and open my eye . i see some benefit travelling in a group led by a tour guide , for instance to have someone to rely on when problem occur , or never to get lost or being in dengerous situation . the tour guide can provide interesting insight about the place they go too , yet i am still inclined to value more the experience you create on your own account , which make the trip and experience you live really yours . to conclude my opinion , therefore , travelling independently can be a great a travelling in a group . firstly because you are not restricted by the travel time table made by the tour agency and free to spend a much a time you want on place that really attracts you . secondly , because you get to meet people from different background and people who you would never met otherwise more easily then when you travel in the group . although the guided tour can provide various valuable benefit such a safety and information , i think you can suppliment element like information by joining a short tour in the particular spot , and you can always be careful and causious to not to encounter problem . for those reason , in my personal opinion travelling individually is more preferable than travelling in a group led by a tour guide .
