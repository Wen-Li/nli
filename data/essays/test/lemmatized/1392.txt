cars a all we know is one of the basic traspotation nowadays . in twenty year there will be fewer car in use than there are today . i disagree with the statement ther are many reason some of them i have discussed here . first of all , nowaday people are buying more number of car to their uasge because of their necesities for example let take my own family example , we own only one car ten year ago but now we own three car because of the necessity have increased . like this only , people are buying more and more number of car a the day go and necessity increase . so by the next twenty year their will be more number of car than today . secondly , nowadays car are getting chaeper in price and will get it in instalment also so more number of people can afford car now so by this the number of car running on the road have increased . . the car productivity have increased in number , the tecnology have have become more and more advanced buy this the performance of the car ha increased . so the people will buy more number of car a to their comfort . finally , the car have become the most easiest and comfortable way for transportation . so people are haeding towars buyin car aa i told in the above which is easier to afford by middle class family also . so . i conclude that , i disagree with statement due to this reason .
