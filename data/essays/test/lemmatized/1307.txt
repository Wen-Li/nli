advertisements by it self is a huge world there are too much advertisement and not all of them are honest there are many advertisement that people some time know that they are lieying in it but yet they go and buy the advertised thing they see on television something and when they buy them they find out that it doe not look like the one they so on television . always advertisement make product seem much better than tehy really are but there are some that are honest but they are so rare and u can hardley find them , not all thing put on advertisments is good . if they were good why are they advertising it unless , a company ha opened new and it want to make people know more about the produced thing of that company , so that people would buy more of them , or if a company had made , something new or developed something known before , then the company could put it on advertising , but there are many advertisement that lie on people in order to gain money , but they do not think that if this person baught from u this time , he will never buy from u again , goverments should be aware of all advertisement and they must put a cuantity of money of those who make fake advertisement by that way advertisement would make product look better than they really are , so when people know that the goverment is looking after these advertisement he would go and buy the advertised thing with his eye closed , but let u never forget that advertisement is an important thing for a company or a business group since all it produced thing are being shown to people on television and million of people watch television daily . at the end advertisement is a huge domain and the goverment should be aware of every advertisement before it is shown on television , in this way advertisement would make product seem much better than they really are .
