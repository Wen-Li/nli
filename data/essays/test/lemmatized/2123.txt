all advertisement no matter if they are tv add or magazine add have the same goal and that goal is to sell . in my opinion advertisement doe not make product seem better than what they really are , they just show the cualities of the product . a marketing campaign ha the objective of creating advertisement that will sell a product . therefore the product need to have an image , a set of cualities that set it appart from any other product in the market . this doe not mean that the advertisement is not telling the true or miss leading the consummer just because it focus more on it advantage than on it disadvantage . it is also important to keep in mind that an advertisement is a reproduction of the real thing . it creates an image of the product and it also allows the consummer to develop a relationship between the product and what he or she expects to abtain from it . a good advertisement will not create false expectation , it will show what the product is capable of doing , but never what it will not do . as i mentioned before a marketing campaign objective is to sell and the advertisement disigned for this porpuse are ment to create a need that did not exist before . as a resoult of this there might be consummers that might feel that their need are not being covered or that the product seem to be better than what it really is . this doe not mean at all that the product is bad or that it faild to do what it said it could . what this mean is that the consummer needed another kind of product to meet his or her need . i really do not think that all product look better on the advertisement than what they are . most of the product do what they sayed they could do in their advertisement , but in an open market like the one we have today it is impossible to control every advertisement and what it say . but we can not make a generalization because of a small sample from a huge universe .
