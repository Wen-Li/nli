today in the medium world everything is showing that is perfect . every product ha several good way and better option than the other product which are in the same market area . it seems me like a paradise . every product is incrediably good and better than the other that person i do not like . adverstisements are creating the world for the person that want to live in that . but real world is not a good a on advertisement . i do not believe that the advertisments are saying the true to u . firstly , in today 's world everyone ha a mobile phone ( cell phone ) . but the new model are coming everyday and buyer are on a compatition , to buy the newst ( because the best ) from the other people . new one can easilly be the bad one from that you have . for example a phone company trade a new product which name is `` shine '' . when i saw that product it wa like a mirror it is really shining . i went to the market to buy it but i could not expected to see an ugly product . it doe not have anything in it besides a out view of mirror not even a camera . the advertisement changed the truth and expected me to buy it , but adversitment can not actually gave me what i expected from the tv . second reason that i do not belive that advertiments are not showing the reality is the people on the tv advertiments or in the billboard are always the world top models . it doe not show the reality . for example a jean look great on a top model on billboards but when i tried on it , i can not really imagine which part of my leg and hump are invisible to seen like a top model 's . if they can be more relible people can buy it easily but in this way the given message for my opinion is ` if you do not have a body like this , do not even come to our boutique . finally , advertisments are not showing the reality . they want to be seen visibly good and trend but they are categorizing the people . people who wnant to buy the product because it look great and wear by top models and the people who wnat to buy the product because it is useful . advertisements should indicate more reality if they want to sell much more .
