with the increasing problem of pollution , public transport 's development , somebody think that in twenty year there will be fewer car in use , but with decreasing price of car like logan or the futur projet of car 's constructor to do cheapest car , is the affirmation possible . the fact of danger for the environment conduct u to think that people will more and more take care of ecology because pollution is destucting the environment . people will prefer public 's transport to car , because transport will be more develop and open to concurrence in france . the road will be divise to make more bus way and car which polluate will payed a important tax . we will be use car just to go outside the downtown . however there will be a alternative to petrol with `` bio-caburant '' . the road and hight way will be more develop and the circulation problem will be resolve . today , the two big problem of the car are pollution and road free to drive . if we resolve that problem , car will be the best friend of human . in fact , city are becoming more biggest and if you have n't got a mean of transport in a city where the public transport are too far , that is very penible . finally , this is very difficult to answer by yes or no but my opinion is that we will have more car , but a important technology associate to security , ecology , and the facility to drive .
