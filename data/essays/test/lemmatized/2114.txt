i disagree with the opinion that the best way to travel is in a proup led by a tour guide for the three reason . first , traveling in a group with the guide does'nt provide u much look . my family often travel during the vacation . we visited east europe last summer vacation , and we went in a group led by a tour guide . my parent and i wanted to see more thing than just going around well knowned place . we wanted to feel the culture of the other country . we wanted to do shopping in the market which wa located in the side of the road , and we also wanted to take a look of small shop and people ' life , but we had to move quickly to the next place where guide ask to u to go . it would be the better trip if we could walk around the alien country street , i think . second , you can not get enough time when you move in a group . looking all the thing that you want need planty of time . each person 's interest is different , and there is a situation that someone want to spend more time in particular place , but the other one doe n't . when you travel alone , you do n't have to worry with this kind of problem . you can take time enjoying the travel in the place where you want to be . finally , you ca n't feel the real life of the place by just looking the great sight of the important building of something . sometimes you can see more fantastic thing without the map . but with the tour guide ? you can just visit famous place and building or sight , not the life of the country or city or whatever . if you are scared to go trip alone , and that 's the reason why you went it in a group led by a tour guide , just bring it on . you surely can enjoy your trip feeling the alien culture with more time and look .
