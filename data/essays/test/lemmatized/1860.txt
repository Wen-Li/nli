i strongly desagree with the question saying that `` it is more important for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact '' . i trully think that to understand the concept and the idea is equally important with learning fact . students need to understand idea and concept pointed out by the teacher . the student also need to have proof and learn fact of what the teacher is saying . giving an example , if a student is following a chemestry lesson and the teacher make him understand the concept of an experiment but the student ha n't done the experiment , the student will understand it but he will be missing the practical part of it , and he would not posse the proof that what the teacher is saying is true . understanding idea and concept is a theorical part of the study , fact are the practical part of study . when in primary school we learn that an addition is the concept of adding number toghether but that the teacher doe not show it with an example , the childrend will get the concept of addition but will not know how to apply this new concept . therefore it is important that the teacher show to the student a fact and prof him that it work and connects with the concpets he ha learned . i.e : 1 + 1 = 2 , this is a fact and with this fact we can show that one candy plus another one equal to two candy , it is a proof for the concept of adding number together and the childrens will appreciate it . some fact can be seen or even touched that help a person appreciate the concept he ha learned . it also can make a person , personnal contentment grow to show fact on what he ha learned and showing that he know what he is talking about . sometimes we learn fact but we do n't fully understand the idea or concept that is hidden . this is why i am strongly convinced that understanding idea and concept is linked with learning fact and that it is important for a student to get both information . one without the other is not useful .
