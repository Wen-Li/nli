i completely agree in thinking that people opinion on a product can be better than effective aspect of product because of advertising , but i think this is part of the work that the industry do to sell much product and i do not criticize them for theese reason . a lot of product take a great advantage by using advertisement and , because of this , industry spend a great amount of money in advertising . sometimes this cost are higher than the cost spended in developing and taking material for product . if they decided to spend so much money is because they know they can earn more that what they spended . this is a correct way of working just if are not shofake caracteristic about the product . in italy , the country where i live , law doe not permit to advertise a product with not real caracteristic and an industry can have expensive fine if what they tell about a product in not real . some year ago wa not permitted also comparation between a product and another , but with new rule government introduced this aspect in advertising that increase his fame by an important comparation between pepsi cola and coca cola . there are another way used by industry to improove popularity in product . that is using amazing word of ingredient that can stupify the listener or the reader . in italy is easy to listen an advertising that talk about a shampoo or a product for washing dish linked with an important chemestry product such a pro-vitamins or other that maybe do not increase powerful of product but surely increase interest in who is listening . finally i think that , even usually you can buy a product that doe not respect your hoping , if the advertising respect rule and law , you must not protest or criticise it .
