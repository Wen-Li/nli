some people think that to understand idea is better than to learn fact for the student , however , i do n't agree with their 's opinion . ideas based on personal experience , it come from our brain rather than the reality . on the contrary , fact are what really happened , and it is more real than idea . therefore , it is always true that learn fact help people make futher development . as a human , we curious about why thing happenes and how it work . like the sun rise everyday and then disappears in the night , therefore , people make guess about what is happened . for example , the myth . ancient people in greece make up story about the nature phenomenon . the story are all about god and goddess who life in the heaven . they think that god and goddes build the world . actully , the fact is that it can only be explained by a scentific theoty . however , what the ancient prople think are idea . so , we can see that idea are not always right , just like the story or hypothesis . if student understand and believe what the story say , it may become a roadblock for their life . another reason why is not improtant for student to understand idea than it is for them to learn fact is that people are more likely to experience and to find the truth , facts are all truth that we can trust and use in many area . if we just simply learn the fact , it is not enough for our development . so , we have to use our knowledge to anaylsis thing , in short , understand it . if we only know what the fact is , how will we use it ? the fact is that , idea are different opinion . through both the view of others and the reality of an event , we can better understand the thing aroud u . all in all , learn thing not only by understand idea , but also by learn fact will certainly help student , not just student , develope their own skill and make a different in the whole world ,
