i totally agree with the statement that most advertisement make product seem much better than they really are . that is because advertisement ha a unique goal : to sell the product it is showing . in a very competitive world , with hundred of similar product it is not enough to say that your product is good . so , advertiser ha to show their product a indipensable . the strategy for doing this is to present product with a lot of thing and person that do not have a direct connection with them . for instance , in the case or beer : the beer is presented with beautiful woman drinking it , with peaceful beach , very amusing meeting , etc . when the truth is that beer ha a lot of calorie , that make you fat , and that you can perfectly drink a beer alone at home watching tv . another noticeable example are car . car 's advertisement show u non traffic highway , where you can use a modern engine and reach high level of speed . well , you can , sometimes , drive in a large highway , but most of the time you will be in the city , going out from work , finding a crowded way to home . even with the most excellent and expensive car you ca n't avoid this daily stress . maybe , the most logic proof that product are presented much better than they are is cigarrettes . in cigarrttes 's advertisement , you watch great natural landscape , such a a blue sea or vast mountain . also , you appreciatte healthy people talking around and laughing . nothing is far away from truth , tobacco produced breathing disease such a lung cancer , vocal chrords burning , etc . if advertisment woud show is the truth , we would be seeing yellow people confined to hospitald with all kind of instrument to help the breathing . in conclusion , in advertisement product look much better than they are because of competition beteween similar product . companies achieve this by connecting their product with very attractive people and situation .
