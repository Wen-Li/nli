to achieve a progress in any field , one should try new skill which can bring a considerable positive changement to it . doing the same thing in the same way all the time doe not give you the opportunity to improve yourself . this requires the curiosity , the willingness to learn and to develop new idea and also the courage to take risk . noone can say that edison wa not brave and curious enough to invent the bulb . if he wa satisfied just with the regular research he did at school , or with the simple work he did professionally , he would not have been capable to help the humanity by his invention . if a teacher is not willing to learn the new information on his or her field , he or she can never be helpful to the student . staying behind the development would not help people learn more and go one step forward . repeating yourself in a work or in a field not only limit your personal development , but also keep your mind close to any development in the life . this psychological effect is maybe the largest effect of being a person who constantly doe what he/she know to do well , without having a look around to see the possible amelioration that can be applied to that work ; a the adoption of this manner is a kind of addiction to the laziness . it ha always been the creative people who had opened the gate for the development especially in science and art . even if these gifted personality were not appreciated by people at those time , then they were well understood . this typical behavior towards renovation is also a point to agree with the statement which say succesfull people are the one who try new thing . as an example , turkish poet nazim hikmet could be taken . he tried a very strange form of poetry which wa not composed of the regular line , but of some irregular line containing the word that sound like the sound of the nature , like running horse for example . this new form wa able to give the reader the exact feeling thet the poet had while he wa writing it . and also it let you free to imagine visually . to conclude , the renovation and the development are brought to life by the craetive , curious abnd brave people rather than the one who repet themselves and who get stuck in a limited perspective in their life and in the work they have .
