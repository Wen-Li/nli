i agree with the statement that most advertisement make product seem much better than they really are . let me explain why this is so in the paragraph below with reason and then give couple of example that i have faced myself . advertisers typically use a very high quality of presentation skill in all aspect . be it a radio/tv advertisement or large sign board advertisement seen over the road , they try to capture the viewers/listeners attention very well . a lot of research is done prior to the making of the advertisement a to how should the attention of consumer segment that they target for be caught . it is now very well realized fact among advertiser that unless they have something novel presented , it may not be able possible to attract the attention of the consumer because of the over exposure of advertisement that a consumer is facing today . advertisers make use of the latest technology and audio-visual technique to display even extraneous action that take place in the advertisement . because an advertisement last for very short time , it is possible to enact the scene again and again till a very good presentation level is achieved . repeatedly showing the same advertisement also help in making the consumer make him listen to watch it is and typically he or she may be attracted to buy the product . i can now provide some example a to how an advertisement can make a product much better than what it really is . i have been seeing advertisement for energy drink called boost since my childhood . the brand ambassador is sachin tendulkar hit good shot and then say that boost is the secret of his energy . it is quite unrealistic to assume that i will become a energetic a sachin by drinking boost . recently , i have come across advertisement of axe deodarant . in it , lot of girl come from all over the place to the hero because they are attracted by the odor of the deodarant . it is extremely unrealistic that if i use the deodarant , so many girl ( or atleast one girl ) will run towards me . finally i atttest to the fact that most often than not , advertisement will make the product better than what they really are .
