( understanding ) understanding is a way to use the brain to think about something to reach to the fact . i gree with the statment that said `` it is more important for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact '' bacuse many reason . firstly , by understanding we can argue and speak about any thing with any body and give our opinion . because if a person understand , this mean that he will have alot of supporting idea which by it he can convience any body . secondly , by understanding we can correct any mistake that this idea or concept ha . for example , we heard alot about some theory which corrected and developed in the past like bohr theory . finally , understanding is a good way to active the brain and make it to work . because this thing increase the space of thinking and our knowledgment . in a conclusion , i advise any person to think and understand anything he listins or read because the understanding is the only way to learn fact .
