i really agree with this statement . nowadays young people are mostly tended to care about themselves . the development of the technology ha a critical role for that . teenagers are mostly spend time by playing video game and watching tv and they are isolated when they spend time on these thing . because of that they lose their social ability . therefor they do not have feeling like helping their community . they mostly live in their isolated world and think about their problem . another big reason for that is the competition atmosphere in all area . for example university acceptance exam in turkey : every student try to do better than other student . and meanwhile they do n't care about other people . another good example would be the job . everybody is trying to get in a higher position at work . young people are so ambitious that they can do everything to get a better position . they do n't wish anything good for others . of course there are always exception . there are some people , who are being happy and satisfied when they help their community . but i do not get to know people like that very often . another simple daily-life example can be seen in public transportation vehicle . it is an ethical rule that you should give your seat to an older man/woman if he/she can not find a seat to sit . but most of the young people pretend to being asleep when they see elderly people or they pretend a if they did n't see them . even once my friend pretended to be a foreigner when an old man asked , if he could sit on my friend 's seat . and my friend did a if he wa not understanding him . shame on him . . i hope we try to teach the new generation that they should help and respect their community . this is a big problem for the future . we live on the world together . we share the world . we should try to help each other . i think young people would see their mistake if they taste the satisfaction they get , when you help others .
