advertisement is an often discussed matter in a time that is highly dominated by all sort of medium . in a sense of medium a something that transport a meaning , advertisement also is one of them - and it is almost omnipresent . but it doe n't only have a social aspect , it is also a large factor in today 's business . some advertisement , like for example the one in the break of superbowl game , cost unbelievable amount of sum . this money surely ha to be generated somewhere else - product have to be sold . that most advertisement make them look better than they really are , just to reach this goal , is a very common opinion about this topic . i am a student of journalism and mass communication and therefore have heard several lecture about this specific phenomenon . i think that most advertiser make their product look better than they are , because - and this is simple - they have to . it is necessary to make people believe that they need to buy a certain thing and in order to fulfill sale expectation they must present it in a positive way . if only seeing it in a market or a store would be enough for a person to decide to buy it , the advertisement would not be necessary at all . research ha shown that this is not the case , so company try hard to stimulate people to buy their product . problems occur where it is tried to achieve this effect by lying about the feature of the product . the statement seems also true to me , because of my own everyday experience . not only tv station show a great amount af advert , it also becomes more and more present in the radio , one the street , in the cinema and various other public area . not only once have i tried one of the offered product - and been severely disappointed . an aspect of the topic that make it even more urgent to discus , is that nowadays , many advertisement seem to be highly aggressive . the `` stimulation '' to buy a product i have mentioned before , ha turned into manipulation and sometimes even into an order to do so . making a product look good and worth buying is tried so hard that , in many case , the mere opposite is happening : people feel repulsed by the aggression and are pushed towards a negative attitude towards the product . i think that this a dramatically dangerous development and even though i criticised the false positive presentation of product before , i would highly recommend some advertisors to return to this way of selling . even if i do not agree with this sort of advertisement , it would certainly be a first step of improvement for them .
