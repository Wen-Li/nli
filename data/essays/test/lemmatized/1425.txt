yes i am completely agree with the statement that effective way of representation or displaying produts would not only increses there demand in market but also make them better . afterall , many produts in the market are avaliable which might dont have featutes comply with the feature shown in there advertisments . user freindly grafics , computer , internet , television and news paper play an important role in advertising . by useing grafics , color and computer designing , advertisersnot only help u to understand produts more deaply but also attracts potential buyer . i want to qoute my personal experince . my best freind want to buy cell phone not only because he like it feature but also attracted by the way it wa represented in it advertisment . he later founded that the cell phone he had purshached not satisfies his need . some advertisments are meant to enhance the feature which are avaliable in produts in order to make it more attractive and better . today , load of money are being invested in advertising industry to make product more attractive . diffetent market policy and monetary method are being used to make advertisment more grandoise . some advertiser hire famous personality like film star , cricket star , musician and other sport star in order to endorse their product effectivily . some people might buy these produts only because they like or admire their favrouits brand ambbasedors . in india , some advertisments depicts our culture and tradition in order to convey effective publicity of their product . for example , hamara bajaj ( an automobile firm ) displjy true color of india and simoultaniosly enhances their production . thus i want to make an statement -- whenever someone is goinging to buy produts , check it feature firts not it advertisment . beacuse sometime advertisment may coumoflages reality .
