success is mostly based on money and fame and it can sometimes drive people to madness or just simply to curiosity . in this essay i will attend to explain why i agree with the following statement . firstly , a successful person is someone who ha reached a certain level in social life , it is often linked with wealth and fame . just because a person is famous doe n't necesseraly follow that he or she will attract attention in trying new thing ; however , some world-known artist among other thing tend to take risk to regain success . in this case i could write about britney spears a a perfect example seeing a she cut all her hair in order to become a headline in the newspaper again , a she one wa , before a sharp drop of her popularity . it is pivotal for some artist to make flabbergasting thing in order to refocus attention on them , and thus , make more money or just regain fame . secondly , i think that some successful people want to try new thing and therefore take risk because they simply want to change an aspect of their life and do something else for a change ; doing the same every day can besome borring and mundane after a certain time . on top of that , some risk are worth it . for example , if the rock group radiohead did n't change their style of music some year ago , they would n't be at the top of the ladder now . nobody knew them when they were playing folk music at the begining of their musical carrier , and nowadays they are world-famous . some people like artist or even politician need to change an major aspect of their carrier to have a better start . to conclude , in my view take risk in day-to-day life can mostly be positive and creative , and for successful people it is sometimes crucial for them and for their fame .
