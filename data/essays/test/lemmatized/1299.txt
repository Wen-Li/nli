i agree with the statement that say that succesful peolple try new thing and take risk than only doing what they already know to do well . when a person doe n't dare to try something new just because they are afraid to loose , they wo n't have the change to win an opportunity that can change his o her life . everybody ha to try to use his capacity and take the change to invest in a new area , a new bussines , a new experience , or a different carrier that can bring more satisfacction . i have my family like example . my father did not go to the university , he did not finish high school . he just had expererience like a taxi driver . one day he decided to buy another car and hire a new driver . he began to make and save some money , and later he had the economic capacity to buy more car and impove his own transporatation bussines . now his bussines is the most important an succesful company in my town . he hire almost half of the young poputation in the town and give oportunities to many familes to have a job an improve the quality of life . if you feel you have the change to start a new proyect , or the capacity to do something different and yo do not expect to continue the rest of your yea doing what you already know how to do well , just do no be afraid and invest all your time , experience and ability to take the risk and became a successful person . i know this is the example of many people that today is completly happy , just beacuse they took the risk to do it . do it ,
