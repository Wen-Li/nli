i do agree with the statement that most advertisement are exaggerating their product to be seen more better . in fact , there have been many case the consumer critisizing that the product they have purchased did not please them much but disappointed them . there are some reason why these product being advertised are in actual fact more degrading than described in the advertisement . plus , there are also factor which make u become attracted to the product . firstly , the company exaggerates the product on purpose to make a better profit . the company normally do not tell lie on the function but do tell lie on how effective it is . there were many case reported in news that the people who have actually came out in the advertisement to tell about the product efficiency did not try the actual product . some advertisement do show the interview of consumer . however , this act is not reliable since they may not be the real consumer . secondly , the advertisement may not exaggerate but may hide the disadvantage of the product . for example , we can see a television advertisement . the advertisement will emphasize on the positive view of the television for sure , that it is wide or that it is clear . however , the television may not have a good function in channeling or may have a bad design . all consumer will choose this television when the advertisement highlight the clearness and the size , but not it design or function . and soon , the consumer will critisize the advertising company . thirdly , the word use in the advertisement are too attractive . these situation are often seen on poster on building . i have seen many diet class poster . these poster will surely attract many obese people , who desire a better body line . however , the scientist state that a balanced diet and regular excercise are a better way to make a perfect body line . and plus , many people did not succeed in their diet by attending these diet class . the unreliable interview of consumer , the limited advertisement and the exaggerated word use are all factor which attract the consumer . however , if we , the consumer , calm ourselves down , we will be able to see that the product may or are made to be seen better than actual by those advertisement skill . we have to be careful when choosing a product , whether the advertisement is exaggerating or hiding something .
