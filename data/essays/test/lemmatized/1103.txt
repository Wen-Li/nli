in modern society , student are required to understand concept and learn fact a well when they study . the two method are both essential in mastering knowledge ; however , in my opinion , the former is more important than the later one . the first reason to support my view is that conceiving the concept is always the first step and the base to learn any type of subject . without the correct understanding of the idea of what the subject is describing , the further action towards analysis of the fact will be meaningless . take the study of advanced math for example . if a student new to this knowledge of advanced math , he/she will be totally lost if he/she is instructed to learn the facts-the stactics and data at the beginning . the usual procedure is that the teacher explains the model of this class , teach student how to use this model and then asks the student to study the fact . second , student are more subject to put bias on fact if they do n't understand idea and concept , which will distort the fact reversely , especially when the student are not experienced with the knowledge . for example , one of my classmate misunderstood the meaning of human resource modern the professor taught u in a hr strategy class . he missed the first class about the methodology and only caught the one when we began to analyze the case . the result wa obvious-he misinterpreted the strategy adopted in a certain manufacturing company in the case based on the `` fact '' he assumed . while the other student saw the fact that this company failed to executive it organization behavior and culture after we studied carefully according the idea and concept the professor delivered ( and it wa proved a mistake after the development of company ) , he thought the company ran very well because he only focused on the fact itself . to sum up , student should pay greater attention to understand idea and concept to find more in-depth message revealed in the fact .
