many people might say that advertisments are lie , well i see it diferently . i think advertising something is selling it to you in a gold tray . it make people say that advertiser are selling something that doe n't exist , but is not true . people might think that this are a bunch of lie because making something prettier when it not and just doing it because you want to sell it mean that the person that did the job lied , but almost every time , advertising company do thing that they believe . advertisements might some of the time make thing look better , but they just give you a different , prettier , better idea and taste from the one you already had . advertisments usually represent what the person that did it wa feeling or wanted to have . in my opinion , advertisement are always to help you choose something over something else that might be better , or just the same . but i always think . the prettier the better . and if company put so much effort on doing it well , it ha to be good ! .
