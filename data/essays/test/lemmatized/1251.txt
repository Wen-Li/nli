i really agree with this statement and believe that most advertisement make product seem much better than they really are . the main reason of this are the people 's inclination to creating image in their mind and the essential part of television and computer in our life . in today 's life , people like image more than reality . they like to create some positive stereotype about product and they like to make people be jealous of them since they own that product . this is easily visible in my city . nowadays , everybody ha a black bmw . everybody worship to this car and they are making a show with their car . they have an image that this car is sportive and it point to wealth . however , the reality is not like that . bmw is a too expensive car which is not value of it price . it also us a lot of petrol and creates lot of problem . this is the consequence of a challenge in our mind . another reason is the essential part of television and computer in our life . we spend so much time in front of them that our mind fall into a trap by believing whatever we see . we , being unaware of it , start to perceive tvs and computer a undoubtly thrustworthy resource . in conclusion , advertisement can make most of the product seem much better due to the essential part of television and computer in our life and due to our inclination to creating image in our mind .
