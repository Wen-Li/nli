from my point of view a a consumer , i totally agree with the statement that most advertisement make product seem much better than they really are . there are several example to support it . to begin with , there are full of toothpaste in out market . some of them are made to attract people who want their tooth become more bright . the seller made the advertisement which described a man whise tooth wa dark three week ago , but after he used the amazing toothpaste , his tooth now is brighter ! i think many prople will be haunted by it . i wa one of them . i went to the supermarket and bought one to dry , but a you know , it wa in vain . moreover , the woman in asia dedicated themselves to make their skin become more white . hundred of product were designed to serve this appeal . as i can remember , one year ago , i bought a so call fantasy lotion which would not only whiter your skin and also protect you from the sun light . however , after my roommate and i used it for two month , none of u became whiter ! last but not least , young lady are always concern their body shape and weight . there are countless medicine and loss weight oil in the market . i never believe that we can lose weight only by taking pill , so i never buy them . but one of my friend wa crazy about it . she bought a lot of product that have lose weight function . but she always complain to me that `` the medicine wa a lie . '' sometimes the advertisement describes their product with exaggeration . we must have to know it . in conclusion , i wa the victim of advertisement . i spend a lot of money to buy them but the result are really limited . i think all of u should be aware that some of the advertisement are not a good and effecive a they presented .
