i disagree with the following statement and do firmly believe that the trend of increasing number of car , which ha been in place for more than three decade now , would be reversed in a short duration of twenty year . the growth in number of car in the developed nation of the world and in the past decade , in the developing nation of the world like china and india ha been meteoric . car manufacturer like hyundai and honda are among the biggest corporation in the world now . the primary reason for this is the rapid increase in population in the city . as more and more people will continue to move away form the rural area , the public transportation system in the city will not be able to cater to the need of all and people will resort to car a their preferred mode of travel . alternative mode and mean of travelling have been slow in development and do not offer an economic solution a provided by car . we still depend on fossil fuel for energy and the development of new energy technique like fuel cell are also directed towards application in car only . the advance in public transport system like railway ha not been able to keep pace with the increasing demand . cars are also aggresively advertised a status symbol in a society which is increasingly getting materialistic . as the purchasing power of people increase and the price of car decrease by new technological advance in their manufacture , it will become accessible to more people and hence ever increasing sale figure are insured . cars are still among the top of desirability chart among the common populace . they are no longer just transport system but offer popularity and increased social standing to the owner . the argument that the number of car will come to a saturation point is not vaild a efficient mean of disposal of car and recycling of their part is being brought about car manufacturer . these policy would ensure that the need of a new car would not be offset by the problem of disposal of an old car by an owner . banks and other economic institution are also readily providing loan for purchase of car and low interest rate and easy pay-back option . new market are being created and captured by car company . we are informed daily of newer deal and strategy by these conglomerate for market capture in localised socities , primary among which are asian and african nation . cars are being made according to local need and desire which enhance their attraction even more . these argument can not be repulsed in a duration of twenty year alone . it would require a more sustained and rigorous effort than the measure which are being currently underway to check the number of car on our street .
