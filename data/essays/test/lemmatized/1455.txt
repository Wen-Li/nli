understanding or learning facts when comming in to general openion both may have their value a the same . but , i agree only with the word understanding idea and concept is better rather than learning fact . this is because understanding idea and concept is a practical one and a group operative one and fact reading is a theoritical thing which can be read . and we all well know practice make man perfect . so understanding is more easier and accurate one to follow when we go for an example to give strength to my point i say that if a student or a child is thought to read that fire is hot he might not consider it to most extent and he might forget that . but , when he ha an insidence with fire he will well know and understand that fire is hot and he will not forget that in his life time because of what he had faced and in another case if u try to teach driving to a person in a closed class room he will only know what is gear and what is stearing and breakes and so called axelator . but when comming to reality he only can learn driving perfectly throuth through understanding through practice . with out that he cant go for a ride directly from a class i with my view and example , i conclude that understanding is the best thing rather than learning fact . facts are true but they come in to resemblence only by understanding . so , only understanding help a man to remember that for a long time rather than knowing fact . understanding is of most greatness than a normal reading or fact study . this is because of the greater friendly ness of understanding with human brain rather than just studying the fact . final but not the least one is , `` fact are the thing which are faced and understood many time by our ancestor to guide u '' . so i strongly disagree this state ment and support my idea with the above example and my idea
