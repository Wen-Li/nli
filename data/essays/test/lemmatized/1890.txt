according to me , in twenty year from this date , there will probably be fewer car than there are today . there are many reason to why i agree with te statement . the most important reason being , increase in fuel price . currently , most car run on gasoline , which is a petroleum based product . fuel price have been increasing continuosly from the past few year and it might get so costly one day , that using a car could become very burdensome on a common man 's pocket . in my country , the price of petrol ha doubled over the past 7 year . going by this rate , petrol will soon be an unaffordable commodity . another problem with petroleum product is that , they are in limited supply in this world . oil is considered to be a non-renewable source of energy . it can not be replaced naturally in the short term . oil producing country may reduce their production in order to sustain their economy over longer period of time . thus , the price will rise higher . the process is irreversible and the price will continue increasing . apart from this , people will be more educated and concious about the environment around them . that 's why they will avoid car a they are a major source of pollution . they will also be more health conscious , and may take a walk or a bicycle ride to nearer place and burn some calorie instead of moving around in the comfort of their vehicle . because of the above reason , people will be more inclined to use public transport system , a they are more efficient fuel-wise . buses and train will be more common and there will be fewer car . unless an alternate fuel is made to run car efficiently and cost effectively , the the number of car on road are bound to decrease . it 's the job of engineer and technologist to find new and cheap source of energy . some car have already been designed which run on electricity . but this is n't becoming popular because of it 's slow speed and accelaration . research is already underway to produce car working on solar energy , water , biomass and anything which can act a a substitute to petroleum but their success is doubted in the near future . so unless an altenative fuel is made . the number of car is set to dwindle in the year to come .
