i agree that it is always better to have a broad knowledge rather than to become perfect only in one subject . it is true that it is difficullt to learn all the subject at once . but , if we think that we are wasting our time in reading all book , learning all the subject then that would be not appropriate . learning all subject and becoming perfect in all subject it would help u in future . in my veiw , learn all subject , a far a we can . in life academic knowledge is very much important to go ahead and take not only one subject but also take part in all most all subject how much we can cover . later , in future if we get an oppurtunity in a particular feild where we are not perfect we have to lose that oppurtunity . becoming perfect only in one subject , we will probably face some difficulty in finding a job or to set up a business . for example , if we study all subject like account , business management , statistic , etc. , would all mainly help u in all feilds if we are searching for a job . mainly in any company where we attend an interview they would rather ask u any question related to any subject at that time we might face a problem . at that time we will be blank and thinking whats the answer is ? but , if we are perfect in all then no one can stop u to answer the question . we would be appreciated for that and get a recognition on the day one itself . as the trend are changing the thinking power of a human is also changing . he want to gain more and more information a he can . he want to be the top one in the world . he can be a perfect men or woman in the world . gaining all the academic knowledge and applying it in the personal life or at work place it change our career . so that if some one point out that he is weak in this then it a negetive remark . finally , it always better to be the best among all .
