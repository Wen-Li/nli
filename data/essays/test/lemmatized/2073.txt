i agree with the statement that successful people try new thing rather than doing what they already know how to do . the first reason to agree the idea is to stay in the same rotine , situation and way doe not create somethings new . it it ture when we do something new , we have to take risk of failur , usually we will be failing first . and form the failour we learn and make thing better . it ha been said that we can not success without knowing fail . in a nut shell success is based on the fail and risk . we can find good example of this from transpotaion . if people had been satisfied with the speed of the bycicle , we would not have seen the motorbike , train . car or even ariplaine . indeed , in the course of creating ariplaine , lot of people took the risk of death . but we tend to think taht porson who made the airplain is successful . the second reason is that doing what they already know satisfying with the situation , doe not make u the creative . to become successful people , creativity is the essential element . we can say that the situation that someone is satisfying with now ha been created by someone . we tend to pay the money to the thing , we think , which is more effiecent or vaulable than the others . example you have car a. you found car b. car a is faster than car b. car b is also cheaper . we will be buying car b. people who is satisfied with car a can not create car b because of the satisfaction .
