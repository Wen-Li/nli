the best way to travel in group is not led by a tour with a guide for whille it can be convenient , one can not enjoy at the maximum extent the marvel of the visited place . many individulas choose to trave lwith a guide . most of the time , not having the time to devise an organized plan of place the individual want to visit , he resort to a pre-made `` field trip '' in which for sure all the most important and relevant attraction of a place would be visited . it sound good so far right ? but it is not . traveling with a guide is romantisized by the ignorant and yet hated by the knowledgeable . those tour are way too stricted to actually feel the sweet feeling of being in a beautiful place because everything is in a rush . 6:00 am one have to be ready to take the breakfast in half an hour . then half an hour to get to point a and then another half to reach point b . .. just too stressing for one to enjoy . at this pace , the tour seems like a photo album : one is just looking at it from a far away place and despite the fact that you are looking at it , after all , you just look at it and are not able to reach it . another problem with this is the expenditure . everytime one go to a restaurant , that restaurant charge too much capital for food that the resident of those area obtain it for low price . i would be bold enough to say that the guide take adavtage of the tourist to go to eat to expensive restaurant where whether the wealthy , ignorants or unstoppable spender go . finally , the apathy of some guide is just admirable and unconceiveable . they have so many people to attend that in notime they are overwhelmed by stress , tiredness , and boredom . they do not do the job that they are suppose to . they just try to go by day after day , making the traveling experience one of low quality and monotonous . traveling with guide in a tour is not the best way to travel . if one want a full great experience one ha to plan carefully one 's own trip . it is not worth to put trust , money , and time in a mediocre company to offer an , in most case , one-time-only experience . thus , traveling with guide is not only hte worst way , but also the one that traveler would regret the most .
