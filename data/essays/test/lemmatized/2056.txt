`` i am successful '' . how often do you heared this pharse from someone ? . i would say very rare because they are not so many successful people out there . the word successe could differ in meaning from someone to else , however ; we all aggreed that to be a successful peroson should not try different thing in life even the perosn well knowleged to the other subject . one reason for not trying out other thing is because the successful person should be concentrated on only one target . having a multiple tragets will confuses the successful person on his main traget . for example , the person who invent fedex in a normal perosn who work in not well developed job . he thought about the idea behind delivering package around the world very fast and introduced it to his manager which eventually disagreed with him because the place they wrok in different of what his idea present . therefore , he resigned from his job so he would be concetrated on his traget . second reason that state the idea behind the not searching of many new thing is becuase searching for other target until the person find one time comsuming . if anyone wanted to be a successful person , time is very important factor . when time pass , le opprtunities occurs becuase by the time people will come up with new idea which might effect on your traget .
