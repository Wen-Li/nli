although today education system pay a lot of attention in the learning of fact , it is also important for student to understand abstract idea and concept , and not only to memorize data . it must be addressed , that both activity are needed in the formation of knowledge and the development of education . education is mainly based on the practice of the studied theory . humans learn a they practice , one will not make knowdledge it 's own if concept have not been practiced . not even the most capable student can learn how to play a musical instrument only by seen it on a presentation , the music student must also spend long hour practicing how to play the accurate tune and note . in the same way , all math student have to do home work to gain practice an understand the concept of calculus , if they just learn by heart the fact around math they will not be able to solve a single exercise on a test . memory play an important role in the development of a student education but in the long run memorized fact will end up been forgotten . on the other , when a student understands a concept , he or she would not forget it right away and perhaps would hold it for the rest of his life . on the other hand , learning fact is essencial to understand abstract concept , and the understanding of concept is a well required for the developing of knowledge . it would be impossible to understand abstract concept , if there are no basic fact to lay the basis of knowledge . as a matter of fact , to learn any phiscal phenomenon student must have basic formula a a given . newton 's law are needed to learn about body in motion , and these law are basically memorized . both activites complement each other and should not be separated or in the rush of disputing importance in education , both should ride together in the path of knowlegde
