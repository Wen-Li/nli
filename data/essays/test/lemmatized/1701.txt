personally i believe that it is essential to understand concept and undermine them with experience and hard fact . but how can we train our student , who have not the working experience to be creative enough and still compare with evidence ? at my mba course we do combine the two of them and that is what i would think of an ideal education . some student are more theoretically oriented than others . therefore it is easier for them to sit down and study theory . others are more practically oriented and learn while exchanging concept and idea with others . a sound education focus on both : theory and practice . all of u student work on management level of company and have not so much time to study hard on concept . however , we get our book ahead of the respective block ( 2-3 month ) to study and complete a pretest which we have to hand in to the professor who teach the course . if we have prepared well , we will pas the pretest and will be able to participate at the respective block . our block last two week . during this time we repeat and improve what we have learnt before in our class . on top of that programme we do work in the evening on so called living cases . this mean that a company come in and present u their question or problem which we - splitted in group of 7 to 8 people - try to solve in the so called living case . having understood the theory , we try to adapt it in practice and learn , that there are much more factor which need to be taken into consideration than only the theoretical concept itself . ideas are not always enough to rate , analyse and understand . it doe in fact need hard fact to compare previous experience to understand or reject our idea . summarising the education explained above i would really draw the line that i personally profit more from the practical experience . but i could not benefit if i had not learnt theory before . only the combination of the two is for me successful .
