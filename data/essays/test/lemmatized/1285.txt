some might agree to the statement that in 20 year time there would be le car than are today . they may say that the technological advance could have far reaching effect such a development of more sophisticated mean of travel , thus car would reduce in number . others might argue saying that car infact will become an essential comodity . the owning of a car would be a necessity rather than a just a mean to travel . hence the number of car instead of reducing would probably multiply . however in my view point i believe that the number of car in the comung year might just reduce . there are various reason for my belief . firstly 20 year down the line probably the technology would have advanced such a great deal . this advancement in technology could cause scientist and engineer to come up with another mean of travel , not necessary the road alone . probably we could have small jet flying around in air making use of the lower layer of earth atmosphere thereby reducing the number of car . people could simply sit in the small private jet and fly to their destination . all this might seem to be out of the box , but the rate at which technology is advancing there might just be a distinct possibility that this might become true . also the already tremendous increase in number of car ha saturated the mean of travel by road . the amount of time taken , furtherd by traffic jam have already made people to move out and look for other mean of travel . furthered by the time constraint already alternate solutons such a use of speed boat and hover-crafts have come into effect causing people to make use of these rather than travel by road . this reluctance to travel by road will also disuade the people further from investing money in buying a car thus reducing the number of car present . apart from this the space constraint 20 year down the line would discourage people from using car a there would be le or no parking place left . people of today are utilizing all possible land and 20 yers hence the scene could be just worse . this would reduce the number of car user automatically causing fewer car to be in use . thus in my view the number of car are bound to reduce in the near future . owing to advance in technology and time factor , people will explore other mean of traveling , other than by car , which may lead to the car become obsolete .
