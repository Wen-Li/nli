i agree that is more important for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact . if a teacher give you idea and concept and say to you to talk about the fact of this and if you do not know the fact what will you lern about that , mean that you did not understand the class or the homework that the teacher gave it to you . you will have trouble because living the life is one of the idea and concept and if you do not know this how will you do in school , at home , at church , when you travel , when you discus , when you do a speech , when you teach to people or student or anybody that need help and ask and everywhere you are . for example many people suicide because they do n't know the fact why they are living , they have idea and concept but they do n't know the fact so what will mean to them . in my case sometimes i understand idea and concept of life and i learn some fact of them but not all of them so for me i do n't have many problem of this at school when the teacher give me a homework or everywhere that i go , but sometimes i have difficulty about this . i think that small childrens that start school they have to learn clearly and well and to understand and have idea and concept to learn the fact about all the thing that they have or they learn so this thing will help to this student to study and to live the life of the world and to comunicate where ever they go . for this reason i agree that is more important for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn the fact .
