certainly there are some people that like trip with a tour guide . but i do not agree with that opinion . i think trip without a tour guide is better than trip with . my primary reason is that with a tour guide , there is a little frre time . for example suddenly when you want to eat something , if you do not have a tour guide , you can eat . but if you have a tour guide , you can not . the same is true of using a toillet . second if you do not have a tour guide , you may experience many thing . for instance in trip for foreign country , you may not use your country laungage . you may have to speak in english , spanish , or chinese . it is difficult to talk with foreigner . but it is big chance . in the environment you are gived chance that progress your ability . without a tour guide , you may have hard work . but the hard work is very important thing . travel should not be composed with enjoy thing . you need hard thing . therefore i disagree with travel with a tour guide .
