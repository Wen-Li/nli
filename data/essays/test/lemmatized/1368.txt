though it is appealing that the increasing amount of car will strengthen the burden of both the society and the environment , in my opinion , it is quite impossible to have fewer car in the twenty year . my reason will be mentioned a following . the pursuing of a safer life stimulates the growth of the car . the horrible situation of that prevalent disease are deeply impressed by the whole country . at that time , the most effective way to pas the disease is passing by public . the public transportation form a underway , taxi , bus are frightening people by the potential disease they posse . as a result , the hot trend to buy car start from that period . it is because that majority believe that they can stay in a much safer condition in their own car , at least having le opportunity to contact the public . since future is unpredictable , how the enthasium to buy car for sake of safety will decrease ? besides , the better condition of living contributes a lot to the phenomenon . people are generally getting rich , hence it is reasonable for them to enjoy a better life . why not buy a car on the condition that people can afford them ? to those who have career , being squeezed in the bus during the rush-our can be a nightmare . if possible , wo n't it be a good choice for them to have their own car if affordable , both being effective and comfortable ? futhermore , the productive ability ha an incredible influence on the huge amount of car . since the policy released by the government that automobile industry is listed a the most powful one in our country , a soaring increasement of car company began to invest in our country . according to the latest statistic , china will exceed germany to be the third largest car producing country in the world . at that time , so many inventory will surely be a headache to those company . to promote the sale , they will use a lot of measure to attract consumer . who wo n't take action under that condions a car are cheaper and cheaper . in brief , the situation is not so positive now . cars are expected to be fewer but the fact contradicts it . hence , to keep a better condition of living , the decreasement of the car is the trend in the future . to achieve that , it need the action from both the government and individual .
