it ha been said that most advertisement make producs seem much better than they really are . i agree with this statement for the following reason . first , the product company want to get more profit from their product . the product company need sufficient profit from their product to compensate thier cost to produce it . it is necessary for the product company to promote selling the new product . therefore , the product company have the advertising company to make an attractive advertisement , even if it contains the misleading statement . i have worked for a japanese advertising company for about 6 year . one of our client is a pharmasutical company . they produce not only the medicine but also the supplement . the supplement is the top selling product that bring a lot of profit to the company . the client always care about the sale of supplement and always say `` make good advertisement '' . this `` good '' mean that they want u to create good looking advertisement to earn more profit . therefore , we sometimes create the advertisement that seems much better than the product really are . second , the situation that most advertisement make product seem much better than they really are is caused by the nature of advertisement . the advertisement ha it own purpose to make the product more attractive . therefore , i think it even natural the content of advertisement is better than that of real product . when it come to the reason why the advertisement need , there is no doubt that the product company and advertisement company want to sell the product more and more . it is not the consumer who asked the advertising company to create the advertisement . if the advertisement say that there is a lot of but point of this product , that is no longer advertisement . in conclusion , the company pursue thier profit from the product and the purpose of advertisement is to make the apperance of the product good . i definitelly agree with the statement .
