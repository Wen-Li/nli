it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subject than to specialize in one specific subject . this help you to know more about life and give you more idea and make you think and explain thing in much more and better way . i agree to have many acadmic subject this will help me to think and to look at thing in much better way . if specialize in one specifix subject u will just be good at one and you wont have any general idea about other academix subject , that mean you dont have good idea about thing . as far a you got many knowledge this help u dealing with everything . you help your self to give good thought about your future and how to think about it . like if ur not good in busniess knowledge and you didnt go for many academic subject you will have only one subject that you can use in your life . but if you went for many academic subject help your self creating idea about what you doing you can chage from busniess to something else other than sticking to busniess you give your self a oportiuntiy to face problem like this so i prefer that people should go for many academic subject other than sticking to one subject because this may be trouble some for you . people should know that going for many academic subject is useful that would help that with their life alot if they faced anything with the subject that they are specific at help you dodge problem that you may face in future . thats why i say to everyone to broad knowledge of many academic subject than to specialize in one specific subject .
