of course , alone traveling ha lot of adventage that if i want to stay in this place , i can stay for a long time , and i can feel freedome but if i have opportunity to travel . i prefer to travel is in a group led by a tour gide first of all . when i arrive strangth place , i feel dangerous there . because i do n't know every thing , even their languege . so when i trevel whith grop . i will feel sefety and if i have dangerous situation , i recieve halp from other people i ca n't feeling lonely aslo when i travel abroad alone , i got stolen my bag . at that time . i wa embaressing so i did n't think anything . i felt loney if i travel with other people then the same situation happen again i can solve this problem easily and i do n't feel isolate in addition guide knowes this place very well . so i can save my time and energe even money . i can understand everything - culture , history-easily when i went to japan for trip alone . i did n't know every thing for instance , i do n't know that how rided the bus , and metro where i wa stay domitory . where wa the best place to see so i must be spend lot of time on the rout , i wa cheated form shop 's owner . a a result . i lost my memey and chance of viewing other place then , when i showed some structure , i did n't understanding because the board ha japan 's strupture although japanesse were very kind . i remained regret in this reason , i would rather to travel is in a grop led bu a tour guide than to travel alone although i give up feeling of freedom . it is better economical than waste
