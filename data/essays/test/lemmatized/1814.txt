a successfull person is a man ( for example ) that can solve a very diffucult problem easily . for solve asily a difficult problem you must use your knowledgment . i think that there are many way to enlarge the knoledgment of a people . to solve a problem you must do some step for expand your knowlidgment . the first is : research about the problem to solve and study the best of possible the argument . the second is : talk with others people about your problem and listen the solution that they propose . the final step is : try the solution . this step is more important to learn . from your result obtein trying a solution you can know many thing about the contest of your problem . if a man doe n't make any experiment he can ' t create a new invention , he can ' t find new solution , he can ' t have a complete visual of the contest , in other word , he doe n't expand his knowligment . a successful person must try new thing that he doe n't know . in this way you can have an advantege with the other . with trying the thing we can find solution about a problem or experiment a new farmacol that permit to save many life . so i agree with the statement that say that successful people must try new thing and in this way take the risk . if you don ' t try you can ' t find a solution and you can ` t make a successful person .
