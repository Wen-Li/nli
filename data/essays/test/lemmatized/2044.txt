risk taking and creativity are considered among the most pivotal quality that make a manager or an enterpreneur succesful . i completely agree with the statement that succesful people should try to do new thing and take risk rather than doing something already well known for two main reason . first of all the world is changing , people change taste rapidly and fashon is always developing . for this reason one should emphasise on doing new thing rather than the same thing to achieve success . this assumes that one should take some risk . the biggest example that come to my mind is steve jobs , the ceo of apple who took the risk of investing a large ammount of money on the i pod project , that later turned to be a great business . if he had continued simply to do computer he would have not invented this new successful product . secondly , the success is something difficult to control . one need also a large part of luck to reach the success . but if one do not expose himself to new project or new idea , he or she will hardly catch the moment that might change his or her life . for example in china , after mao period a lot of people found themselves without a job , so they had to try to do something for surviving . those same people that tryed to do something new , thinking about the need of a country that is developing so quickly are the same that now have the greates business of the country . one need determination , luck and a sort of talent to achieve success , but the most important thing is to be brave enough to take some risk and try to introduce something new . in conclusion i think that since the environment that surround all of u is always changing and doing always the same thing taking risk and introducing new idea to the world are the most important element that need to become a successful person .
