it is almost impossible to disagree that the advertisement make their product seem much better than they really are . there may be a lot of reason listed to agree this statement , but the fact that they grant impossible thing happening is more than enough to prove the point . furthermore , the importance company put on and the percent of budget they spare for the advertisement department also show that they might not manage to come up with a very good product , but they can still compete within the market by effectively advertising . the temptation of the shiny product on most people is yet another thing to strengthen the statement . first , there is the issue of impossibility of some of the advertisement . one advertisement of nike air stated that it make you jump higher and stay in the air longer than it competitor , using michael jordan slam dunking from outside of the three-point area . the physical explanation to the ` staying longer in the air ' can not be explained by the power of the shoe , but it can be explained by the muscle power that is trained through year by the athlete . despite this fact , the existence of michael jordan in the advertisement made most people think that they can do the same in his shoe . moreover , another advertisement of a car manufacturer showed people that are not in possession of that brand were ashamed of their car once the car of that brand wa in the street , and tieing balloon to their car to make them go away because of their shame . this situation is impossible from many different angle , two of them being ( a ) people would not give away ten thousand of dollar just because their shame for their car , ( b ) it is not possible to fly a car with a few balloon . however , especially the car of brand being too shiny and glamorous and other car dirty and overused , the car seemed a lot better than the others . the car wa not the best in horse power , safety regulation , look or comfort , but the advertisement made it sell the most within the market . second , the budget spared for the advertisement in most of the company strenghten the statement . one study showed that statistically more than one third of the budget of the company in the top 100 list showing the most profit wa spared for the advertisement department . this collaboratively agrees to the idea that when these company are unable to compete with the quality of the product of their rival , they try to sell it with effective advertising . last , but certainly not the least , people buy some product just because they are attracted by the advertisement - even when they do not need the product . the first item that come to mind is the technologic product . when something is new or in sale , there is more emphasis put on it advertisement . when one think of the ipods or iphones , the situation is clearer . in my country of residence , it is shown by a reliable study that more than half of the ipods sold were to people that either barely appreciated listening to music , or the one that are too busy to spare time to use to ipod . however , they bought the item , inasmuch they saw it on tv or newspaper , probably either too shiny , or in sale . as a conclusion , considering the budget spared for the advertisement department , impossibility of some of the advertisement and the easiness of people to be tempted to buy product they might not need or use at all , i concur and claim that most product are overrated by their advertisement .
