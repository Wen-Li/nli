i absouletly agree with this statement , a it discussed over and over , but fortinally no body listen to . most or all the advertiser seems better or much better than they really are , for example , for food they make the sandiwish bigger or look taster . for toy , they make they make the toy a it is the best toy ever and it 'll make your child happy for the rest of his life . and for furnture , they will draw an image and make you believe that if you did not buy this furnutre your home will be very sad and can not be lived in . adivertisments main aim is profit , which mean money , they do all of these advertisment on the televsion , radio , newspaper , magazins , bus stop and even on the street , taxi 's car roof and on the bus just to let you buy there product . they let you like the product a you live happy with it , a they brian wash you , alought may i add the way they attract child , with toy and child food for example biscuts , chipts exl . many of you looked throught the newspaper and saw a tasty sandwish and decided you going to buy it . and many of you seprized buy it size or it look . ! i ask the government to stop that brian washing or atleast control it by making or giving the real picture or the real image of the product cause at it seems that not body like to be lied to or acually no body like to be roubbed . may i add that lieing in the advertisment is forbedden in every reliogin and it not a good thing to do to atract customer or clints . in the end i would like to ask the advertiser one question , is every product you put advertise is on your home , or your firge ,, why not ?
