in modern life , when you turn on your tv , you will hear mcdonalds ' `` i 'm loving it '' ; when you go to the street , you will see nike 's `` just do it '' ; ... it is an era of advertisement . you would see them everywhere , in the bus station , in the highway road , in the plane , etc . however , do these advertisement exactly reflect the real product ? as far a i am concerned , my answer is `` no '' . for one thing , the advertisement always magnify , or even `` create '' the merit of the product . it is quite common in the product of make-up . the director of the advertisement always hire some famous model or movie star , and claim that the beauty of these person should be contributed to the special product . they concern nothing about the truth , but the business effect of the advertisement . for another , the advertisement would generally trivilize , or even neglect the disadvantage of the product . some product may even have side effect , to which most advertisement would pay no attention . a case in point is an equipment for eyesight therapy several year ago . in the advertisement , many child who had used this equipment were interviewed `` randomly '' , and claimed that the therapical result wa quite satisfying . however , when this product wa put into real use , it caused many child to lose their eyesight permanently . as a result , the manufacturer and the advertisement producer were sentenced after that . in addition , some advertisement may not even mention the effect of the product , but only to link the product with the consumer ' special emotion . for example , a home-made food simbolizes it a `` the taste of mother '' . you would never know how this food exactly taste through the advertisement . neither would you know what effect this food will do to your body . to conclude , to be a wise consumer , i think we should pay little attention to what is said in advertisement . the reason manufacturer pay to make advertisement is to gain profit , not to tell the consumer the true story .
