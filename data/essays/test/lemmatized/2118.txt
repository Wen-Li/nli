i do not agree with this statement . eventhough today most of people know about the disadvantage of car , i think there a several reason why there wo n't be le car in twenty year than there are today first of all , people do n't like to change their habit , they are lazy and always trying to maximize comfort . they are just so used to their car . therefore it would need a big changement in the consciousness of the individual and this can not be attained easily . eventhough nowadays there are organization that try to make people aware of environmental problem an so , however , most of people do n't consider their own compartment a part of the solution . second , more and more people live in suburb , especially young family . these people still mostly work in the big city and travel there by car daily . i really believe that this development of the social structure doe n't help to get the car away from the street . people basically need their car to make a living . last but not least , the lobby of the carindustry play a big role . as long a there are car , there will also be people making a lot of money with it . and those people , who are most of the time very powerful , are ready to make a big effort to prevent the public opinion to shift towards the unneccesity of car . they will always try to provide other solution to problem like pollution . for example they could try to argue that today car have catalyzators or do n't need a lot of gas anymore . in conclusion i tried to show with three example , which are in my opinion the main one , why i do not believe that there will be fewer car in the future that there are nowadays . the three reason are : people 's habit , social structure and the lobby of the carindustry .
