most of the prodcuts we can see on advertisement seem better than what they really are . everywhere we are flooded with advertisement , but why a company should pic product in a different way they are ? advertisements are the medium used by company to purpose their product and mainly to increase their profit and , all around the world , company follow money . if a company can increase the number of customer also the money they will get will be increased . for example when i wa working in a computer shop i could see how my bos wa describing , in a leaflet , a new kind of computer he wa selling in a way it wa not . that computer did not have the power that wa written in the advertisement but people wa accracted by the nice picture of the computer , by the capturing style of the font and my bos could increase his profit . and a we are speaking about a market , with all it rule , it is obvious that an advertisement must capture the attention of the customer in order to be better than another company . for example when i go to eat an hamburger the sandwich i usually get is not that big and colourful i see in the advertisement but obviously it ha to be like that so that people will eat at that place instead of going to another one . but sometimes the advertisement is studied so that we create the idea that the product is very good . for example imagine a cleaning liquid for the bathroom , in the advertisement they can only show it a it is but what if they put a picture of a shining bathroom in the background ? people will like the idea of the shining bathroom and will think the product is very good also if it will probably not be like that . in conclusion i think that advertisement always make seem product better because in the moment we wanna purpose something , and get money for that , we always have to do it in the best way , sometimes even cheating .
