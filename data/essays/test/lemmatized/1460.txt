the given statement implies success would be rather based on creativity and audacity instead of conservativity and stagnation . this is a tempting statement , since it appeal to the deep human longing for exploration of the new and unknown and implicitly link success to any adventurous idea . leaving old path is indeed not only highly thrilling but also necessary in order to evolve a a single human and a society . stagnation would mean , formulated in a very extreme way , that people would still live in simple shed instead of well constructed building and would be deprived of luxurious good such a warm water , heating , any mean of fast transport and so on . the impact of invention in general on daily life go beyond the visible , none of the now well established idea , good and invention would have been possible without creativity of the mind . but not everything new and good wa successful right away , how many story of people who invented and imagined good that we became used to and consider normal and necessary but who died poor and never saw the payoff of their work and contribution to all our life exist out there ? artists are a common example , another may be scientist such a galilei who even got burned for his brilliant way of thinking . would he have sticked to common and accepted way and idea , nothing would have happend , both to him and scientific progress , because once an idea is out there and it is supported by something such a data or simply a vision shared by more people it will be explored until it reached a dead end or success . therefore , success may not neccessarily be linked to risk , because most people like to stick to one way and change need some time , even more in proportion to the radicality of an idea . this lead to the conclusion , that small new idea which to not affect and cut into people 's daily life strongly , may indeed be very successful after some time whereas others may need more than a lifetime to sink in and blossom .
