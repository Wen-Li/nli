tour guide provide a good organization and information to the person ( or group ) that is traveling , but it also ha it disadvantage . one is that a tour guide limit the option of place to visit to those that he/she think are more important for the tourist to visit . it also limit the ammount of time that the individual ( or group ) can spend on a certain activity or place . i believe that if the group planned the travel it will be better . in term of the organization , i think that the group have more flexibility for various reason . first of all , the schedule will suit the group desire in term of which place to visit and how much time to spend in each activity ( or place ) . for example , if a group is visiting puerto rico , the group can decide wheather spend more time in the national rainforest el yunque or in the historic fort el morro . or the group can also decide not to go to any of those place and spent the whole trip period in the beach . secondly , if the group plan it own trip , it can be le expensive . the group will not have to pay to the tour guide . also , it will be able to decide which place and which day of the week is le expensive or economically favorable to the whole group . relatively simple thing , such a where to eat or which ground transportation to use , are factor that affect the total cost of the trip . if the group plan ahead of time , they also can adquire the informational resource of the tour guide . in the present , there are many book for traveler . these book provide map and historical fact of the place , providing the traveler ( in this case , a group ) a good deal of cultural , demographical , and historical information . so , in the present there is no need of having a tour guide if the group plan effectively . and most importantly , i think it will be more fun .
