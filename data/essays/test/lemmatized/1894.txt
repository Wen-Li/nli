i agree that most advertisement make product seem much better than they really are the reason for having that opinion are advertisement are intended to introduce a newproduct which not aware for the consumer . advertisement will give the description about the product . advertisement give an analysis of the efficiency of the product by comparing with other product which are using presently by the consumer . they will convince u to buy that product if person is satisfied with product he feel it is an necessary to watch advertisement . consumer are now a day attracted to the advertisement . they dont know the quality of product until unless they will use it . but in oldendays .a person in avilage us one product introduced in the market . if the person satisfied with that product the person will recommend that product to other person . this process go on and end with all person in that vilage owns that product . the generation before are very careful about money advertisement is a very commercial and costly process . it involves spending a large amount of money by the company . because most of the advertisement will cast by celebrity who demand crore of rupee for single advertisement . the company will left enough money which will affect on the quality of the product . so they are comprimising on the quality of the product advertisement are telecasted mainly to influence child . most of child are attracted due to the animation used in the advertisement . they are forcing their parent to buy that product because they like the ad very much . with out caring much about the product the parent are willing to buy that product
