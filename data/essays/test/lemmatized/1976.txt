i do believe that a successful person tends to try new thing and take risk rather than stick to what he/she is already knowledgable about . a successful person always seek to try new thing , reach to new place and look for new opportunity . he/she ha the courage and self-confidence to venture into unkown territory . this person indulges in new experience , which ultimately enriches his/her self and make that person gain more insight and exposure to the world around him/her . advantages of a successfuly person 's approach can be clearly depicted from the business world . a businessman who is doing well in providing a certain product to his customer may settle for that and wo n't care to expand his business . this person may operate profitably to some extent . however for him to be - and more importantly remain - successful , he must broaden his vision and constantly look for new way to improve his offering and increase his customer base . for instance , he must try to come up with new version or update of his product or look for new component that 'll lead to higher quality . he must be open for new trend , say in promotion and advertisement . moverover , he must be continuously seeking new market and segment to which he can introduce his product . some may consider such pratice to be risky and would rather remain on the safe side , doing what they 've always done . but the fact is , we 're living in an increasingly competitve environment , where excellence , innovation , professionalism and exposure are but a few of the competency that everone is struggling to achieve in order to be successful .
