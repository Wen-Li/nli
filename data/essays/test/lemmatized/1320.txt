i disagree with the opinion . i think the best way to trvel is in a group with no tour guide . if one travel with a tour guide , one cannnot experience the true living the people there do . i think the people who live there know the best point there . nowadays , people watch travel program on tv , so , travel a the same way that people do in a tv program is not give people new experience and new sight , new curutural topic and new movement . people usually travel in great expenditure , so , i want to experience other thing people usually can not do in japan . for example , eat food which do not exsist in japan , and speak people who live there and want to know what people there think everyday . once i had gone to borneo to dive and to see animal . we made friend with a man who live there , and he explainded to u where wa a dangerous place to go , and where wa a delicious market and so on . our family enjoyed our trip , and we could make a new friend in borneo . trip with a tour guide is good for a man who only want to see fasmous place , i think . but by such trip , people can not see the real figure what the country is . to enjoy the country fully , i think it is the best way to travel without any tour guide .
