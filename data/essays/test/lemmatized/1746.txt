when you see succesfull people you can ask yourself what they are going to do with their succes . there are many example in historical person and contemporary personality that show that succefull people try new thing and take risk rather than only doing what they already know how to do well . indeed i can take the example of alexander the great in anciant greek history . he is considered a one of the biggest conquestors in human history . initialy he come from a wealthy athenian family he is the athenian king 's son . when he is 18 he becomes king of greece and he want to expanse his kingdom . first he fight the ottomans : he win the war , then he wish to become king of the most important territory ever . so he continues his conquest he encreeses his empire up to india ( he ha been the first occidental to have discovered india . he ha been defeetes in a province of india and he had to go back to babylon which ha become the capital of his huge empire . when he died his empire imploded because there wa no one with such a carism like him to garantee the stability of the huge empire . an other example would be napoleon who ha been defeeted by the british army 1803 . he wanted to reign all over europe , he won against the biggest army ( austria , prussians ) but he made a critical tactical error when he wanted to invade russia . he went to russia at the beginning of autumn and in winter he arrived in moscow which had been burnt by the local inhabitant so the big napoleonian army could not find any rest and had to go back to france . it wa very cold ang the huge army of more than one houdred fivety thousend men at the beginning of the russian campaign wa only five thousend at the end which mean a verry big humiliation and it the beginning of the end because one year later he get definately defeeted in wateloo . i have tried to show that person who suceed in something always want more and that leeds to catastrophies . it ha always been like that . only a few wise person who suceeded try to take mesured risk and not inconsiderated one . i presume those people exist but i do n't have any exaple to mention .
