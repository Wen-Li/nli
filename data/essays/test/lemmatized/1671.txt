in the modern business world , many large company , especially in the consumer good industry , are marketing driven . marketers try to convince consumer that the product of their company is superior to all it competing product . our society is responding very well to promotion and advertisement and the marketing message behind it . trends are often developed by promise of a company in it product . i agree with the statement that most ad make the product better than they really are . many advertisement show celebrity , sport professional or other famous people using a product . companies want consumer to believe that using their product will make them equaly beautiful or successful like the star in tv . a good example are the nike commercial with tiger woods . he is playing around with golf ball and then hitting some shot . at the end consumer should believe that buying a nike golf club will improve the score at the golf course . unfortunately , it 's not that easy . the cosmetic industry for woman is another classic example , how advertisement can mislead end consumer . you see a famous and beautiful person using a certain cream and then the lady in front of the television at home think that if she buy this cream , she will look like julia roberts . a more simple example are advertisement for food in the daily newspaper . supermarkets always show u the best and most beautiful picture of vegetable and meat . if you finally go their , the product will look a little different [ at least in some country ] . sometimes advertisement even get a cult status and phrase are taken over in daily communication . this proof for a marketing agency that they were really successful and that they have reached their customer . i often heard a person on the street saying - just do it - this wa maybe one of the best slogan ever and for sure give more attention to a sport shoe , then it deserves !
