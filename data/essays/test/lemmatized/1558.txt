we know that advertisement ha been created for a psichological purpose : to convince consumer to buy something . since the consumer 's society ha spreaded , advertisement are the bast way to have some product known and sold . groups of people , producer , expert are engaged for preparing advertisemens a well : one colour is prefered to another , a target of people is studied in order to know habit , desire ecc . so the consumer , in the end , should feel a just a if the product he 's buying , belongs , in some way , to himself . but we also know , in the same time , that this kind of operation is not always satisfying for the kind of product that it 's going to be sold . let 's think about food , for example . if a meat producer give me the idea that a kind of beef is better than another produced not in the same way , not in the same time , not with the same animal but le sponsorized than this one , it 's probable that i will feel in myself that , that product it 's better , even if it 's not . sometimes the countrary happens , maybe for some environmental condition some people preferes not to buy the product that ha much advertisement , but especially in the past , in the year in which there wa the economic growth , advertisement played a great role . people wa fascinated by those colour on the street , on the tv show , and never thought twice about buying a thing . now , with new norm which regulates the market we have different situation . tv , internet , phones have changed the way of creating advertisement . we have nearly quintuplicated the number of them , but in the same time i think that much more information and consciousness ha also given u a different way to approach the buying of a product . young people , both man and woman think before they buy . there 's no more just an economic affair : people should be sure of what is buying and most of all want to be sure not to be buying a disposable good .
