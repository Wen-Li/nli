i can say that i am the person who traveled many time . since 1999 , i visited the italy , england , egypt , austrailia , and thailand , etc to broaden my perspective . i think that the most important thing that i learned from these trip is that being with the group and a tour guide is the best way to travel . the reason are a following . first of all , we can enjoy the systematically planned trip . in my case , i went on england without any group member nor tour guide . i remember that it wa the most terrible trip that i have ever experienced . at that time , i could not ask for help to anyone , a i wa not good at english . so , i just stayed all seven day at the hotel . what i could do at that time wa just looking englishmen who looked much happier than me over the hotel window . on the other hand , when i went the austrailia with many group member and a tour guide , i could enjoy a happy trip . the tour guide assigned the time for trip effectively , so i could visit a lot of tourist attraction , which might be unnoticed if i went alone . i felt that the tour guide is a indispensible element for the great trip . furthermore , i can definitely say that we do not need to feel loneliness if we go on a travel with other people . as i implied above , i wa very lonely when i went to england alone . there wa nobody i could communicate with . however , i could enjoy the trip better with a lot of people when i went to egypt . in addition , the group member who accompanied with me were all korean , like me . we were very happy to meet people who were able to communicate with . i think that it wa also very exciting experience to listen other people 's story during communication with others , not only to look around famous place of foreign country . in conclusion , i am convinced that it is better to be with group member and a tour guide when we go on a travel . they enable u to enjoy well-planned tour altogether .
