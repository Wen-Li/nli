i do agree . i do agree indeed . advertisements very often are not real . wherever is the advert show , internet , television , magazine or news paper you alwayst must keep alert . make and example , you see a car 's advert on a magazine , first of all it is the most powerfull with the le consumption on the market , second , it 's the most atractive one and third if you buy it today you 'll start to pay it with very cheep and confortable fee from next jenuary . than , what you decide to do is to go and see it . take you wife , kid and the dog and run to the closer garage . ones you get there first thing you notice the test car is not exactly the one wa shown on the magazine but you are so desperate to test it that you do not care so much about the litte difference . there you go , you are going to drive your next car , little nervous but do not worry , it will come with 3 year warrany !!! so , after your test drive and the ice cream for your four kid you are finally sit behind the desk of the most funny sale man in town . what is the problem ? the problem is the following , the actual base price of your new dream car is not the one you saw on the magazie , the cheep and confortable mothly fee are not so confortable but actually are very similar to your house loan and not last but least off course you will have 3 year warranty , yes off course you will have it if you do 3 service a year for 400 euro each . there you are , pale and worry . you are really upset , you dream is turning into a nightmare . allright it doe not metter , you think just go home get a beer and let wait for another offer , who care ! i 'm sorry man , you thought that wa it , where are your 4 beautifull kid with their cherry icecream you just bought ? eating it on the back seat of your new beautifull cheap and powerfull car !! let me say , everytime we see a advertisement you shuold really pay attention to every single word of it . specially the really really really small one which are always at the end .
