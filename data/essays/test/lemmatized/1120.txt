taking risk is the very instinctive human behaviour that defines u a human . we take risk to prosper and find new opportunity by facing new challenge . to succeed in today life , one ha to have a wide scope of imagination and innovation . we can not just rely on what we already know how to do well , we need to try new thing in order to advance and create change . we a human do not like to abide by routine our entire life and so we look for change . yes we have to have the expertise to succeed in whatever we 're doing , but we a human never stop to learn and it is through learning that we can take the risk and try new thing . for example , if i created a new product that i want to sell and i want to make my own business the first thing i would need to do is learn how to operate a business . in that sense , one can not proceed into new thing without knowledge . before we endulge in risk such a a new business we have to carefully ass all the aspect that this new innovation might bring along . on the other hand , if i 'm not brave enough to take the risk , i wont be able to advance and i will be stuck with the same old job for my entire life . taking a risk can be looked at a a trial and error experiment because even if you do n't succeed you learn form your mistake and try again . trying new thing and taking risk can lead to success but it can have negative consequence if irrational decision are taken . it is true that knowledge is power because ultimately a risk is called a risk because we can not possibly know or predict exactly what will happen but we can at least come close to it .
