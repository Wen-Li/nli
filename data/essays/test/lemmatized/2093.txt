human life ha differnt stage . student life is one of the stage in the human life . we can know about more thing in this stage . we can experience major incident at this stage only . the student life include study , understanding the fact and understanding the idea and concept . i strongly disagree with the statement that state `` it is more importent for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact '' . a fact is true statement . students should learn about fact . i learned about so many fact . firstly i learned about earth rotation around the sun , this is a fact . by learning about this fact i got some doubt in mind that how much time it will take to complete full rotation ? and also i learned many thing by this fact , for example how day and night are coming ? and lot more . secondly i learned about a fact that `` energy is neither destroyed nor created . energy can converted into different form '' . by knowing this fact i came to knew that how thermal energy is converted into electrical energy and how mechanical energy can converted into kinetic energy . i learned these pionts by observing electricity and various machine those are underwork . this is the fact that thought me how to learn . thirdly i know the fact `` light is one form of energy that can exibit several property '' . by knowing this fact i thought in such a way that what are the property of light and what happens if light is projected on some reflective object . i can get the property of the reflective material by studying about fact on light . i can know about opeque nature of light too . in conclusion although student must understand idea and concept , the student must have learn the fact because fact teach u how the fact is effect real world , weather in positive way or in negative way . i strongly believe that student should learn about fact .
