students should always concentrate on learning and understanding new idea and concept rather than learning fact , because this will help them in generating new idea and help them to expand their ability in writting , reading and listening to lecture , learning new idea and concept is the main key to be successful in the future a the job that the student will attend in the future will be based on the idea and concept rather than on fact , because student will learn the fact with the time and the experiance in life a the fact will be learned from historical book and also from political event . also the student will be in a powerfull position when understanding new idea and concept and that is in school , college and even in participation in lecture a the student will have an excellent background , for example , if a student is selected to represent the class in a general discusion about a certain play for a famous author , the student will be able to participitate effectivly in the discusion if his information is based on new idea and concept rather than fact because the fact will only be needed in speical lecture not in dramatical one . learning fact will onle be needed when a student is going to study history or other major which involves the use and the need of the fact . but i believe that learning new idea and concept will result in creativity a the student will be able to generate new idea and thought based on what he had learned because the idea and concept will help in creation new thought and will help in developing new skill . but if a student concentrate more on fact , the student will not be successfull a the one who concentrate more on new idea and concept because the fact will only help in for example historical reasearches . finally , i believe that learning new idea and concept are more usefull for a student in many field such a the college , school and job in the future rather than learning fact a it will only be helpfull in certain field like political science ,
