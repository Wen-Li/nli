what is advertising ? a simple way of selling one 's product wa what it used to be . today , the advertising world ha become a competetive jungle ; one that , i feel , ha lost sight of it original purpose , and ha been reduced to a money-spinning frenzy that attempt to make product seem larger than life . i , thus , strongly agree with the given statement . i come from mumbai , india 's commercial capital ; where every road is a blaze of flashing neon-lit advertisement ; where familiar face of celebrity , endorsing the most frivolous product , jump out at you from every hoarding ; where brightly colored advertisement are plastered on every spare inch of space in the city ( bus , bus stop , wall , signpost , post box : you name it ! ) and where one third of the time you spend watching your favorite television show is spent watching advertisments . in the light of the above situation , i do not think i can be blamed for having such a strong viewpoint ! since when ha a toothpaste been so effective , that the poor old teeth that are subject to other toothpaste crumble in comparison ? since when ha an energy drink been so vitalizing , that it ha bestowed upon it drinker the sudden magical abilty to win every race that he perform so poorly in before ? since when ha a shampoo been so nourishing , that the light reflected from the hair of the lucky damsel who us it , ha been enough to blind a crowd ? since when ha a cologne been so alluring , that a man who used it had a lady swoon into his arm on the very same day ? these are all real example of the blatant exaggeration that the advertising industry make use of today in order to sell . it illustrates the shocking extent to which producer will go to make money , and is a depiction of their mercenery approach to life . i do not mean to preach ; i merely feel that employing such ridiculous hyperbole , just to make a buck , is absolutely unnecessary . to say that advertisments make product seem much better than they actually are would , in fact , be an understatement ; for they endow these product with quality that , at time , defy the realm of reality !
