some people say that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide . they insist that with the help of tour guide trip would be way safer and more fun . however , i am not favor of the idea that travel with a lot of people and tour guide for two reason . first , i am able to change my plan whatever i want during the trip . second , a lot of people could distract my plan . i will expalin in detail . more than anything else , my plan could be flexible while i am traveling . of course , tour guide could show u a lot of historical place with certain plan . but what if i would spend there than i would have expected ? it is true that traveling alone is a lot more flexible and exciting becuase nobody care my plan . let me take my experience for example . when i wa first year of college , i went to japan for the first time by myself . truely , it wa a little nervous and scared becasue i could not speak any japanese and i had no cousin there . however , i had wanted to go abroad without anyone 's help . on the second day of my first trip in japan , i went to art museum where had displayed prestigious japanese art . while i wa watching a number of art , i listened some student 's complaining . they were talking about plan that they had assined . to be specific , they argued with one tour guide . some student wa really wanted to stay at museum , but the guide just kept saying that plan wa already designed . at the moment , i wa really relieved that i would not have to argue with a guide who had strict plan . moreover , a number of people might be able to distract my trip . obviously , some people could make a trip unhappy becuase of their lazyness or reckless behavior . it wa recently reported from my university school news paper that a large number of student want to go travel by themseleves . they were interviewd that they had a bad memory due to annoying people in group . obvi
