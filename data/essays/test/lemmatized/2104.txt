i would tend to agree with the statement above mentionned . i have three reason to take this position , and shall discus each one of them successively . in the first place i think that reducing car doe not mean cutting the number or the flow of transportation mean available . cars have been a major tool of the 20th century , and ha been promoted by giant industry . however it is challenged by virtually any more convenient or le expensive personal transportation mean . i believe that within a twenty year period , a brand new sort of vehicle which would not fit within the definition of a car is likely to arise a too serious a challenger . as a result the number of car produced and sold could drop dramatically . i still give some sympathy to the argument that technology could be used to improve car instead of shifting to anothetr object . and all effort at making it more environnement friendly , faster , etc do have an impact . the question is to determine how long lasting they will be , how much additional year crumbling auto company such a gm or ford will be able to hold and foster useful investment before going bankrupt . moreover , this evolution seems all the more possible a car no longer enjoy the sexy and attractive image they used to benefit from . a quick thought at the status car enjoyed thirty year ago is enough to build a pessimistic picture of the future of car . they are doomed to be replaced since people do not dream about car anymore , they find it expensive , express growing concern a to it environmental impact , have already found alternative way to travel . and government are already taking serious measure to this end . the governor of california ha recently considered a tax on all car holder a if owning a car could be seen a a crime . in europe attempt at drawing innovative urban space all praise the same elimination of car within city . not to mention london s tax on inner city driver ; car are pinned a one amongst serious public ennemies . they are living their waning year and recent initiative pave the way for further measure towards their reduction .
