i agree on the statement `` most advertisement make product seem much better than they really are '' . i believe that if the product is really good , it doe not need any advertisement . advertisments is only way that company see if their product is not working well enough in market . advertisement is only the mean of attracting more and more people . moreover , the fundamental rule of marketing is if the product doe not find coustmers let coustmer find product by advertising it . there are many reason by which it can be agreed upon the statement that advertisments make product much better than they reallr are . firstly , the advertisemnt agensies trap the coustmer by giving various offer with their product . they just show their product a the number one product in the category of that product . like for example , this diwali the tata motor advertised their diseal car stateing that it give better milage than any other car and their are also providing heavy dicounts on festival season with some gift . so , the customer will forget to compare the car with other diseal car in greed of gift and heavy discount . this show how the advertisments attract people or we can say fool them . additionally , the advetisement agency sometimes sell the prroducts which are not worth and they may also be harmfull for the health . like some expired eatable product that are now considered a harmfull for use . the company have no profit in these product . so , they do what ? they advertise these product that they are available on heavy discount or they are 50 % off on their marked price . the some customer doe not take care of expiration date and buy the product . this may harm them . so , adversitment sell the product which is not worth selling . moreover , the advertisement have greater hand in succesfull of toxic softdrinks . the softdrinks available in market are very toxic and harmfull for younger or even for whole generation . but they are in incresingly demand by the presentation of advertisment . the product show some well know people to endrose it and this hepls these product to get the attraction by which they are succesfully selled . finally , i believe that advertisment are the main source by which the product seems better than they really are . and this practice should be stopped by health govenment by allowing only those product to advertise which are really good . and first the product should be tested ang gi \ ven the permission to advertise .
