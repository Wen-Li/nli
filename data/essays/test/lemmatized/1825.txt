the issue whether it is more important for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact , is controversial . on the one hand , idea and concept are built upon fact , therefore it is important to learn fact not only for the sake of learning fact , but also for having the ability to better understand idea and concept . on the other hand , that is idea and concept that matter . therefore , i agree with the statement ; it is more important for the student to understand idea and concept for the following reason . first , if a student just learns raw fact without understanding what lie beneath or without constructing any idea on the fact to discus or even better understand the fact , it doe not mean anything but number or word . for example , if a student just know that there occurred an economic crisis in europe after the second world war without understanding the economic , social and political reason behind the crisis , she will lack important understanding about how and why economic crisis occur . second , student should not just tought of fact but also be equipped with the pertinent methodology to acquire fact when it is needed . if the student are just tought some fact without understanding how to interpret those fact , they could just answer the simple question on the fact and it is all , education will be inadequate and student will lack way to survive on their foot . third , the technology is improving so fast that the major fact of today may be obsolete tomorrow . so even if a student know all of the fact of today , he might end up knowing nothing but obsolete data if he doe not understand the idea that is built upon the fact . but if the student understands the idea and concept , he is well aware of the overall picture and he know how to interpret the fact even if the fact change . in a nutshell , i believe to understand idea and concept is more important than to learn fact .
