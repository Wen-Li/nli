knowledge is an enlightment on a dark path . it is good to have knowledge of varied field . but , today , it not an era of ` jack of all trade and master of none ' . one is identified with his profession . it depends on the stage at which one is , whether he should have a broader knowledge of many academic subject or specialize in one . if in a school , definetly , one should have a broad knowledge to many academic subject . it wil help the student to decide , what subject he is actually interested in . he can identify his apptitude and choose a field of study accordingly . this will help him folllow the path which lead to his carrer . but , if we stress on people in college , i believe it is better to specialize in one subject than to have knowledge of many subject . once a student reach in college and is out of his teen , he know what he expects from his life . his goal are set . he take every step carefully and make sures that these step lead him to the door of success . if he try to study different subject all together , he might not be able to master in any . he will be confused with varaity of subject in his hand . and what if he is not interested in many of those ? if one is an engineering student he can not handle subject like account or political science . a friend i know wa practising medicine , it got difficult for him to attend even his music class , which also taught the history of music . how could he study medicine and something else which need him to know it history ? he finally gave up music . thus , if one try to hold many thing in his hand at one time , he might land in a situation where he will have nothing in his hand . students in school can handle different subject but at college level , it not an easy task . knowledge is something that is justified , true or believed . it would be not feasible for them to look for answer to all those justification .
