i do agree with this statement . a general trend seen amongst people is that they tend to do what they only know how to do well . to be lauded for this is a good thing but due to this people often get into a comfort zone . this comfort zone is a state of mental satisfaction where people feel they have achieved it all and see no reason to improve . it 's generally only a person who see a reason to improve that try something new . cliched a it might sound , ` need is the mother of invention ' . it 's common to see a great sportsman loose his magic touch soon after he is signed for endorsement . he feel proud of his achievement and hence loos the fire inside to improve . at the same time , it is not neccessary to try something new for the sake of doing so . it is important to continue doing what one doe well for sustainence . at the same time it is required not to get too comfortable with the situation and see how the bar can be raised . it is a fine line dividing a rational base and an adventurous will to explore . a person who will stay ahead of the competition is one who will be able to reinvent him or herself . it 's imperative to realise that time change and so should we . if we get left behind , then one 's action would be of no considerable consequence anymore . this is getting pretty standard in business practice across the world today . a company that will innovate and offer the customer the newest and best product they can have will be the one that stay ahead . similarly a person might start something new today , but it might become jaded tomorrow so he will have to reinvent himself . hence , i do agree with the statement but i believe it is those people with a mature mindset and a fervour for adventure who will be able to set and match ambitious target . because trying new thing doe not make a person successful . if so then any unsuccessful person can gain success with simply a change in profession . but conversely it is chasing success that will make people try new thing . stay out of your comfort zone , dream big , aim high and go for the kill . that 's the formula to success .
