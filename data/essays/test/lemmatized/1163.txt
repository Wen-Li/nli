im not agree i think that for student both idea , to understand the idea and concept and to learn fact are important . first is important to understand idea and concept to know all about something , if one are interesting , of course . for example , when we are in the class and the professor are talking about some issue we must to take atention of his word and then we can have an idea about the issue . despite of there are some issue that are not very easy to learn it , but we can ask to the professor and try to understand . sometimes we have a different idea of something , of course , is not necesary that all people have the same idea , but there are some topic that all know if it true or false ( well , is difficult to speak about what is true or false in the life , i think that all is relative , i m really not sure about this question , is difficult to respond ) and here is when the second part come , when we have the experience . for example , drug . there are many young people who thing that the drug is not bad for ower health and life , and although their parent had tolk with them about the problem of drug but they didnt paid atention and they consumed . after the experiencies or later they can see the drug problem . there are some people that they dont need to learn the fact , they only understand idea and no more is necessary . so both are important for student . another example , usually , when i m studyng chinese language and learning about the structure , i trying to right some sentence in my copybook , but only when i go to the house of some chinese friend i can understand idea or conceps of chinese structure , because is better for me to learn fact than understand idea and concept in chinese language , but this is a problem in my country because hardly i can speak in chinese with some chilean people , only a few people can speak chinese , and the another problem is that the chinese people who life here in chile the most of them speak dialect or canton languague . .
