i agree because one firm product something such a radio car and so on . and these are making advertisement . then most people is buying this production . and then other firm are seeing it . they want to earn money much more . so they have to make more quality that they earn money much better . but first of all there will start problem . each production can not show on television . if people buy it which production , it make advertiment . it is normal i think .
