people have got different quality from each other . some of them try new thing and take risk , some of them waste their time only doing what they already know to do well . in my opinon , people who try new thing and take risk rathet than only doing what they already know how to do well are successfull . succesful people do not afraid of the encountering new thing . they believe that if they can achieve these difficulty they feel themselves the happiest person in the world . they think the result of this accoplishment . they do not escape the risk . they try to figure out the problem and try to find the best solution for this event . achieving the new thing which have not seen before and taking a risk for it belong to succesful people . the people who occupy with thing which already how to do well is not spend their time very much on this situation . they believe that they can success it very easily . they do not encounter with difficulty and they do not try to defeat this difficulty . because of this they do not understand the worth of the success . they asume that become a winner is very easy and they feel themselves very calm . to sum up , achievement which is won easy way doe not accept a an success . the people who do not afraid the encounter ing new thigs and risk achieve the eveything . everybody in the world admires them . because everbody can do everthing if they know enough data about this condition . but achieving the new thing which are not known is vey crucial for people and they know the value of this . people support the succesful people , too .
