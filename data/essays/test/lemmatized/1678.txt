yes i do agree that most advertisement make product that seem much better than what they actually are . there can be many reason for doing so , however doing this can be at time a disadvantage too from a company 's point of view they have to sell their product and the only way they can reach every door and every home is through marketing their product . nowadays it ha become a fashion to spend more money in marketing something that isnt much worth to do . people also like such advetisements where the product is marketed in a grand manner . people get drawn to something that is more eye-catching than something that is really useful . everyone is more in to look and color of the product rather than it usefulness . i personally feel that marketing the product that are not really worth , is incorrect . this simply can mislead the common public who have no idea of what the product is all about and what it can do . its side effect can really be death threatening at time . many product are made using harmful chemical . such product that can take a toll on someone life should be advertised in a proper way stating it outcome in case of misuse etc and not just keep on projecting the good side to the product . this is more common incase of cosmetic product . products must be advertised on basis of what it really is and what it can do . it is completely incorrect to advertise product in a wrong way .. this can hamper the company reputation but most of all this would prove costly to someone life which is more precious than anything else . i believe that it is not proper justice to people out there who have no clue of what the product can and what it can not . it is only through proper advertising can anyone get exposed to the capability and limitation of a product . since advertisement are the only medium that make these product reach every door step .
