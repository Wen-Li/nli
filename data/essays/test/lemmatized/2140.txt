i do believe that is far more important for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact . i study psychology and in this field it is crucial to pursue undersatanding about the concept and idea . if you do learn the fact but then outside of the calssroom you are unable to apply the concept and idea to the reality you face , your capability for acting and modifying a problem or difficult siatuation will be really limited . if all a student had to do wa learn fact , then no important change or new discovery will be possible because he will be caring about the very basic only . i know person that have piled up through their life , all sort of fact , they know every single of them over a specific topic . still , when you give them a scenario that wa not included in the fact they learned , the might be unable to conduct themselves on it . this wil be rather opposite for a person that dominates the concept and main idea , she would not have a much trouble because all she will need is to learn some of the fact and then she will be able to make her own conclusion and real understanding would be achieved . many people at field sucha a medicine or science , believe that leraning the fact will allow them to succeed on what they are doing . sadly for them this is all wrong . for example , if a patient is dying and the medicine student learned about how essential it is to mantain the vitals at certain level , but he doe not understood how this fact should be integrated along with the concept and main idea about this topic , simply he will have quite a hard time a he will know the patient will die and he can not stop it . our world and our thoghts are made up of idea and concept , those are the basic component which lately guide u to fact . i belive that is essential to gain a domain over both learning the fact and understanding the idea and concept . for contructing valuable knowledge you will need to master both . the fact are important a well and you have to know them , still it is true that the fact by themselves will not lead to a deep and profund comprehension . in our psychology department there is an important statement ; `` psychology not to interpret , but to transform '' . understanding the concept and idea will enable you to do so at any given situation .
