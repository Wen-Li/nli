in a quite optimistic manner , i would personnally tend to consider that people are about to take into account the harmful and far-reaching consequence global warming ha and is still triggering . an awakening seems to be unavoidable now , a whatever we do , we will not be able to make for the reversal of the order of thing we have created . the quicker our reaction will take some concrete aspect , the more useful and efficient it may be . to achieve these hard-working aim , car are one of the most effective symbol of our desperate need to accept some crucial and meaningful sacrifice , to say the least . needless to say , firstly that they are part of our daily life , which make the decrease of their great number le likely . yet there is no doubt that given the emergency , politician will have to own up to their liability and talk people into reducing their gas consumption in order not to let the threat of the greenhouse effect worsen . if people do not act reasonably enough , i thing that it is up to governor to stand a example and to encourage people to pro-environnement behaviour ( a the inciting financial support offered to people who priviledge solar energy at home ) similarly , responsible citizen who refrain them from overusing their vehicle should be rewarded , whatever the form it could take . furthermore , in addition to these reason , mainly based on a sense of community and the wilfulness of people , other parameter may interfere in the evolution of the typical profile of car buyer : actually , is n't the increasingly high price of gas the most succesful mean of deterring people from driving ? the seemingly promising introduction of green fuel , despite it environmental benefit will not solve this problem . to crown it all , car industrials are highly suspicious and reluctant at the prospect of making the access to car working with electricity or renewable resource easier . therefore , although the consumer may be well-intended by restricting his own consumption or making it safer , nothing would be efficient if constructor do not bother to hinder the inevitable decline of car selling . drawing the thread together , we can summarize reminding that some factor are radically refraining people to buy and use car , either environmental one or some others more matter-of-fact like price .
