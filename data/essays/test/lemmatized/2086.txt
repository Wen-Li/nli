i agree with the previous statement since during my high school year i have noticed that it is extremely important to understand certain idea and concept , but mostly understanding how to apply them to our life . once you understand a concept , it is easier to get an entire picture of what you are being taught and it is also faster and easier to understand any following explanation on these same concept . when it come to an exam , it is easier to discus an idea and agree or disagree with it by using a reasonable argument . on the other hand , it is also important for student to learn some fact because some academic aspect of subject such a history and science can only be absorbed with our memory , and this is done by just remembering date , name or number . there is no understanding involved in this process , which mean that to a certain extent i also disagree with this statement . some area such a economics require that student really get to understand some theory and idea , an example of this could be the understanding of the keynesian or monetarist theory , but at the same time it is important that in this same subject some fact learning is also implemented ; an example of this could be the learning of economic definition such a `` ceteris paribus '' or `` mutatis mutandis '' . i decided to bring up this scenario due to the complexity of some area within a student 's study , but most importantly to the fact that sometimes it is important to combine both reason and memory in our daily learning task . i actually believe that the most important of these two concept being brought up in the passage is to understand idea and concept . some of the most capable and inteligent being in the world have reached their social , economical and it can be also argued that spiritual position by understanding life and it 's process , but also by learning to listen to others and understand the human behaviour . based on these thought , i would argue that understanding idea and concept is most important than learning fact .
