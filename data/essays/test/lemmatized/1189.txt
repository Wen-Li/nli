the world that we live in today is full of advertisement . for a young man like me it is sometime difficult to deal with all these image and message that are trying to tell me `` buy this , buy that ! '' . but we are now so used of seeing them that we are sceptical about all these ad . thats why i think that product seem much better than they really are . first , the fact that advertisement put the product in a scpecific situation will make the product more attractive . for example , when you see a television advertisement that show someone eating an icecream on a beatiful beach with clear water , nice sand and blue sky . the viewer will associate the ice cream with the dream of being on a tropical island on the beach and relaxing . in this sense i consider that placing an ice/cream in a specific context make the product more attractive . another way to make product look more atractive than they really are is to improve the way a product look like on a television ad . for example , when you see a television advertisment for a fruit yoghurt you always see the fresh fruit going into the yoghurt and they are always staying nice and firm . but when you open a fruit yoghurt in real life , the fruit chunk are always a bit spungy and ugly . we also can see this phenomenon in fast-food restaurant , when you order a hamburger you always see on the picture that it look delicious . in fact , the hamburger look a lot le attractive in reality . i think it is normal that advertisments always make product seem much better than they really are . the goal of advertisment is to sell bigger amount of a product so they have to show the best aspect of there product without lying about it . it is the job of lot of people to make a product more attractive . to illustrate the way advertisment work , i recommend a french book wich is translated in english called `` 99 franc '' written by frederique beigbeder .
