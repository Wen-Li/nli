advertisements are all about increasing the popularity of a product whch may or may not achieve the result a claimed by the company . in most case by employing the celebrity to advertise the product the company are actually taking the advantage of the respect people hold for such celebrity . they are also hitting on the psyche of the consumer by actually tempting him to use the product after seeing his idol use the same project . history is full of such example where the adverstised product ha not yielded the desired result . the advertisement which advertise buying medicine to decrease obesity or retain hair growth , slipper to increse height are all there to make a fool out of the consumer . the mutual fund and investment company which employed stratergies of using a celebrity to increase their popularity have many a time left the common man bankrupt . although in this age of globalisation it is not wrong to advertise a product to fight off the competition but then again the govenments should look into this before someone is really hurt badly . like man kind , advertisement and marketing of a product have also evolved . a recent form of advertising a product ha been vehemently opposed by many a government . it is employed by pharmaceutical company all over the world to advertise their project . by giving expense gift to doctor , paying for their vacation and sometimes funding their post graduation study have lead them to fool the customer by sometimes handling them a bad and expensive medicine . another form of advertisement in this regard is by paying the politician for their election campaign and then getting the benefit after the party come to power like that done by blackwater firm of us currently working a a task force in iraq . another type of evolved advertisement is by actually propogating fear in the mind of the people and then implementing the personal agenda like waging a war or curb the right of the people a done by the country waging the so called war on terror . to some people many of my example seem out of context but if looked closely these are the advertisement stratergies which should be scared of a the affect the life of many people .
