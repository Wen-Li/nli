i disagree with the statement that it is more important for student to understatnd idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact for the following reason . for the first , it is necessary for the student to learn the fact to feel wonder and interestrd in the subject . when i wa a juninor high school student , i had many experiment in the chemical class . at first , i wa just surprised to find the each chemical reaction , like chnagin the color or making fiber from the liquid , becasue they were hardly seen in the daily life . after i had experiment , i wa very interested in the reason and learned them in the text book a what kind of the concept were . also , in the mathematics class , my teacher taught u many fact and suggested the idea to lead the mathematical rule . instead of just teaching the idea ot concept , i wa very interested in the subject throught the fact in the experiment , i could enjoy studing at the class and read the related article by myself . secondly , it is importnat for the student to think about why and looking for the answer by themselves . threfore , learning the fact will enable student to feel wonder and interested in the subject . also , it enabels the student to think themselves . therefore , for the reason mentioned above , i certainly disagree with the statement that it is more important for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact .
