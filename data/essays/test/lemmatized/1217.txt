i am disagree with the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide . i do not think the statement by two point . that is travel in a group and led by a tour guide . frist , i do not like to travel with a tour guide . i think one of the exciting thing on travel is planning , but led by a tour guide mean almost all of the travel plan is made by a tour guide . flight is decided , hotel is decided , schedule is decided , rest time is decided , sometimes suvenier shop is decided ! the only thing we choice is where we go . it is never joyful because everything is restricted . although travel in a group is not so bad , led by a tour guide is so bad . i feel i am robbed my pleasure . next , i do not think travel in a group is the best way . the reason is i want to do everything freely in the foreign country . i enjoy what can i do in the foreign country , so i do not want to use mother tongue during the travel . furthermore , the most exciting thing for me is `` no plan '' . i am a backpaker . so , when i am tired i sleep all the day , when i want to move i go next country or back to home . i go somewhere i want to go , i stay somewhere i want to stay , sometimes i stay sobody 's home . these thing can be made by traveling alone . because of the two point , i do not think the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide . the best way to travel is `` alone '' .
