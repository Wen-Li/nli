knowledge ha been man 's most reliable tool for success and development since time immemorial . knowledge and the capacity to utilize this knowledge into something useful is the reason for the human race 's growth . had there been no knowledge , we would still have been living in the neanderthel age . ` knowledge is the tool for success ' . it ha brought u away from a state of bliss into reality . broad knowledge of a subject brings about the scope for a broader perspective a ideas and invention are not limited to their specific branch . for eg the growth in technology ha been utilized in area of medical research , communication , banking and the industrial sector . again an eg is the ambitious cloning project taken by medical researcher , are also expanding to stem cell research which in future might be used to cure cancer . thus the expansion of knowledge from one field to another present a broader perspective and higher possibility . on the other hand specific knowledge of a subject is important to develop skill and expertise in a particular field . if there is no expertise and the knowledge remains stagnant or influenced by other factor , it would kill quality and the possibility of improving upon the subject to take it to the next level . to take an eg had there been no research on the ` intranet ' developed by the american army for it own use in the 1970 's , the world would never have seen the rise and expansion of the ` internet ' or a widely called ` the world wide web ' . the internet is a phenomenon that ha revolutionised the concept of communication across the world . any piece of information can be obtained at the click of a mouse . this is all a result of specialisation and research in a particular field . quality can only be achieved through specialisation . in sum , i would say that no quality work can ever be achieved without specialisation . skill is the key to success and can not be compensated . the specific knowledge can then be used in collaboratin with other field to reach to higher level of expertise and growth that would benefit the society a a whole .
