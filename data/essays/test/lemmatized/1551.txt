the statement , that young people do not give enough time to helping their community , is a wide spread statement . i think you should have a look at the timetable of a young people nowadays . he ha to go to school or university , ha homework or other work which cost a lot of time . i think young people have the right to meet friend and spend their freetime how they want . some people prefer watching tv , other make sport and other help their community . i think you have to make a difference , where the young people grow up . for my part , i have grown up in a small village . i have to work at home and i am in many sportclubs . everyone know everyone and we have an open ear for the others . if you need help , you will get help . but young people in a big city , they often do not know their neighbour . it is also difficult for them to integrate in sportclubs and other club . they have another social environment . often you hear this statement from older people . they had another youth and have other experience . perhaps they spent more time for other people , but i think you can not say the young people nowadays don not give enough time to help their community . the time change end every generation ha their own possibility . i think you can not generalize this statement . of course , there are young people who don not spend enough time to help , but one such case ha more impression than 100 other case , in which people take the time for their community . many people see only the bad thing .
