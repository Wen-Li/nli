we should think people a two type . one of them is like water , another group is like a wood . for the people who is like water can be look like every sitution trying new thing and not to be afraid of taking risk , it is impossible to see or understand which situtation , action or behaviour is right or wrong . because they believed that succesful hide behind of creativity and in order to be creativity , we have to try new thing in our life . of course , these people know they having some risk making them poor , even die . but after they try what they want , they have no disturbtion or anything else on their mind . while these people speaking relating to new thing , never feel any hesitation . moreover they always trust themselves , because of seeing the whatever talking about . on the other hand , it is possible for these people trying new thing or doing taking risk to be ill relating to heart or sugar because of adrenalin . for example , albert e for the another group of people , who is like wood , it can be said for them that they are strong , never fall against the life , mostly they will not have a big problem on their life because of not to take risk . beside this , during their life , they have done the same thinghs or thing the another people had already tried . they have never been creativity and succesful . for example finally , i agree to people who like risk and adrenalinand i believe that creativity hide behind of risk and new thing and people can be succesful if they make creativity thing in their life , so do them .
