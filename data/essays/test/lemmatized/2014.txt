a growing up the economical condition and development of transportation such a car , plain , ship , people used to travel where they do not have any experience . and one of the most important thing planning the trip is making their schedule . however , it is really difficult for common person to schedule their sightseeing . so many people who have plan to trave try to get a travel agency for grouping and leading by tour guide . but i disagree with the statement that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide because it is possible that if someine choose group travel , they might miss what they want to do or where they would like to go . admittedly , leading by travel guide is one of the best way to trip a unfamiliar place because travel guide used to have acquaintance with the cite where the traveler want to go to . and the group traveling used to give the traveler some economic usfulness because of low price . however , it is possible that the traveler incount some problem caused by group traveling such a schedule of visiting place , entertainment at the cite and so on . for example , when i went greece and turkey , i led by tour guide with my colleage and my familly . at then , i really want to fo to gafadokia where are composed by several hundred of artificial cave because there is one of the seventh myteric remains in the world . but i could not go there because even though i ask my travel agency and travel guide , they refused my request a a reason why other people did not have any curiosity about the place . in addition , if someone go to travel alone , he or she might meet unexpected delight such a new friend , strange experience which others can not have . i went to guam island a honeymoon . when we arrived in hotel , it wa 4:00 am. a it worse , the next morning schedule would be started at 8:00 am. we never could not participate the trip even waken up . so we are isolated from my travel guide and group . and we went the downtown of gaum island by cab . we got a wonderful time which others are never have . and the experience is one of the most expected occurences my life . in conclusion , traveling in a group led by a tour guide is just one of good way .
