the question called is dealing with the fact to specialize or not in academic subject . this issue is raised by a lot of student when they have to choose their orientation . on one hand , i think that it is important not to specialize too early in your life for different reason . the main reason are that , first , it is really a good thing for your own knowledge . you will be able then to be interested in many subject and conversation . so it is a way to be somebody open-minded and interesting . then , i believe that only few young people know what they really want to do in their life . you can not be totally sure when you are eighteen . indeed , i think that to choose many academic subject will help you to discover what you are really want to do for the rest of your life ( even if now , it is easier to change your carrier ) . for instance , i have chosen for this academic year business subject which are useful for all type of job in business , because i am not determined . it allows me to have a global vue of how function company . it is a way to keep more opportunity for my carrier . but on the other hand , you can not stay generalist all your life . one day or another , you will have to specify in order to be more performing and more interesting for recruiter . most of the job requires specificity . this specialization can occur when you are more mature , and more experimented in life . it permit to avoid from mistake in your orientation , problem which are generally difficult to solve when you are fourty for instance . as a conclusion , i think that both are necessary in the construction of your future . you need time to open your mind , in order to help you to specify in a better way , and to feel better in your life .
