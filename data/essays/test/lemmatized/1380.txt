advertisements are the crucial way of an industry to earn profit by attracting the coustmers . i agree with the statement that most advertisement make product look better than they really are because the industry want to atrract many coustmers by the add and improve the product sale . so obviuosly the product should be shown better . advertisements make the product look better by many mean like covering with nice design so that the coustmer feel to buy it . also , add do n't tell the bad effect of the product so people are lightened with only the positive effect . as the advrtisements are the only mean by which coustmers get to know about the product product must be better shown than they really are . every individual accepts the product if it is good so if the add show them in real they may be dissatisfied with product and they refuse to buy . although the process may decive the people but i think it is a business trick to gain profit , afterall the object of any business firm is to gain profit . some advertisement show the real picture of the product but may fail , like one of my friend car wa put for a resale . he actually showed the real condition of the car with crack on the body and dim colour , no one dared to buy it for the cost he expected . then he realised the situation and improvised the texture of car in the add and then many coustmers flooded inn . finally he sold the car for the cost he expected . thus , most of the advertisement show the product better then it is . after advertising when coustmer coms for the buying of product the actual product must be showen and we have to tell him the bad effect of the product . and we have to convince him by decreasing the amount to that stated in the add . so , i agree to the policy that advertisement show the product better than they really are for the reason i stated above like it is a business trick to attract the coustemers and thus the product sale would go up .
