is it more important to understand idea or concept or learn by fact ? . more people often do both , but how can we know what is more important . i definetely agree that student get more understanding by real fact . as a matter of fact , we have been realized that the experince come from real fact that have been happen to u . student are getting knowledge based on their experience and assigments that proffesor assign them in order to get the knowledge they can get from their brain and then succed . students get more by learning with real fact . another reason , is that theory about life nowadays do not get that importance in teenager , because time consequently ha been changed and go over and over again in order to change method a a form of study . as technology go , the student want to get the convenient way to to get their chore easy . in addittion , student that most of them are teenager that are in the middle of adulthood and childhood , get more confusing and they want to learn real fact for themselves . only few of them want to follow that rule of ancient method that are idea and concept . nobody want to follow an idea or concept that ha been implied by other person , at the end the student is who really learn that those fact are experieces they have been trought and have lead to some personal problem that in future can help them to grow a a person or whatever would be that specific goal . thus , i think that understanding by learning fact is more interensting and fun for student to learn rather than idea and concept .
