taking risk , and new innovative thinking is mandatory for success . the person who ca n't take risk ca n't grow well , and get sucess . our history have plenty of example that every sucessfull person have taken risk and thinked diffrently . our resercher , scientist who have taken risk in experiment of failure or win , and many of then are sucessfull . thomus edison , if he had n't taken risk and had n't try new thing then it would be difficult that bulb had been discovered . newton if he had not think about why n't apple fly up and came down then newtons low of motion had n't discoverd . like sciencetist , the businessman who have taken risk and thinked diffrently are sucessfull . there are many businessman in the world but only who are sucessfull hav tahen risk and thinken problem in extraordinary manner . bussinessman like bill gates taken risk , and his company microsoft ha become world class company , this is due to his innovation , thinking diffrently , even though he belong to middle class family . like bill gates , indian businessman dhirubahi ambani also think diffrently then comman people and his comapny reliace beacome most reputed comapny of india , and his son became most rich person in the world few time ago . on the other hand comman people do n't take risk so they are not much sucessfull . from this i doe n't mean that every people who will think differntly and will take risk will be sucessfull , on certain sage it depend upon one 's fate a well . but it is ceratin that who will not take risk and will not try to think differnt will not be sucessfull . so , youngester like u must have to think diffrently in innovative manner to each problem , and should take risk to become sucessfull . history doe n't have place of comman ordinary people .
