although many country have to be comfronted with the problem caused by car , we , human being , completely depends on this kind of machine . most of u , especially those in developed world , is unable to survive without car . i believe that in twenty year there will be more and more car in use than there are today . people are feeling the power of modern technology everywhere , but technology are not strong enough to find an ideal alternative of car used recently . trains are too big and ponderous ; hydrogen-driven car are too expensive and unstable ; plane have been proven not sutible to short-distance transportation . so we still live under the shadow of car . moreover , there is no evidence that the replacement for car can happen in recent year . therefore , the amount of car used in future will increase or at least wo n't be le than today 's level . many developing world are requesting more and more car . china is a very good example . if you are lucky to visit beijing , the capital of china , recenctly , you will find the traffic jam are rife from day to night . the huge capital can not contain 3 million car , which are still increasing at the rate about 200,000 car per month . the similar landscape is reoccuring in bankok of thailand . moreover , statistical data reveal the increasing trend of car in these hot region . therefore , it is able to be concluded that car used in twenty year will be more than today doe . now , it would be wiser if we should concentrate u on the negative problem caused by ever-increasing car . scientists and government should be unitied to fight against the issue such a fossil fuel polutions , development and extension of city , and shortage of suitable energy .
