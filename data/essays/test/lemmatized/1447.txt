i believe the statement `` successful people try new thing and take risk rather than only doing what they already know how to do well '' to be true for the following reason . first of all , attempt to do new thing can expand one 's perception of thing , and bring new idea to perform better at it task . for example , diesel engine powered train overtake the coal powered train for it better efficiency . many stayed skeptical about the diesel a new energy carrier because it wa new and human mind tend to stick to one they are familiar with . some company suffered after domination of diesel take place , whereas one that read the trend and took risk of going out of business suceeded and survived . second of all , rate of the technology improvement and replacing the one that becomes obsolete is not linear , but exponential . it mean the world is continuously changing . in this fast changing world , to be able to be competetive , one ha to step ahead of everyone else which requires taking one step further than what is already out , that can be risky yet beneficial . third of all , i , a a person who enjoys many form of art , evaluate creativity highly a the primary goal of art . human mind make u feel comfortable to one we are familiar with , but often boresome . however , different and new material excites human brain which manipulates sense of happiness . trying new , foreign material is though often risky in art world . critics might see it a too different and not be satisfied . without attempting something different , art would have not suceeded to spread , it might have died out a people seek for excitement . to be successful , there are certain sacrifice that have to be made . trying new thing sometimes seems insane , and too risky . but a the history prof , it is better to take risk .
