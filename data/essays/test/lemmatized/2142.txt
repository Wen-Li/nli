what is more important for studens ? do you think that student prefer understand idea and concept than learn fact ? i think it is more important to understand idea and concept for several reason . one , a student ha to learn concept and learn important thing like criterias , reason about the topic is studying . second they will need to discover different example or situation about a concept or matter because not all the example are the same . third , a student ha to have a good capacity to explain , why he think in that way , for example if he understant an idea about why in united states are very common the tornado ? he most have to explain in detail why he is right and why this happen scientifically . on the other hand , if a student just learn fact and not understand idea and concept the most important thing , it is not the same because every situation it is different , and there are exception in everything . for everything you must understand why it is , because at the end you can join the concept with your knowled and then it would be more easy to express your idea about whatever topic . summaring all this in life there are many type of people who think different , and most of them apply the best for theirselves , but if a student prefer learn more stadistics and example , expiriences , than just fact , he should be a very good professional , no matter the area he is interested .
