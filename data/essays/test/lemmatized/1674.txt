how to travel is controversial and complex issue . different people have different opinion about how to travel due their respective angle and expriences . in one hand , many people enjoy traveling by themselves . on the other hand , many people ibelieve to travel in a group led by a tour guid is best way . these two way both have their advantage . however , a a old man , i prefer to travel in a group and think it is best way for old people . we should judge it on a case by case base . in the following stament , i will provide my reasoning and evidence to support the statement that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guid . in the first place , travel in a group is more conviniet . we all know before we travel , we have to prepare a lot . we will search the related information from internet and book to know which are historical site and landmark of the city we will visit ; we need book plane ticket , hotel . sometimes , tourist also need to reserve the ticket of some very hot view site . if you go aboard , you still need to deal with many issue about visa . it require a lot time and effort . i travelled to maldives in my honey moon last year . i spend almost a half month to find which island is best and arrange hotel , visa and transportation . in the end , i only spend seven day in maldives while i spend much more time to prepare . it is a very good case that demostrate travel in a group led by a tour guide will help you to save a lot of effort . in the second place , travel in a group is also cheaper . because the huge demand from the travel agency , the travel agency always have a good discount with many hotel an airplane companise . the huge discount can gurantee them to be profit even they offer you the more cheaper price on transporation and accomodation . to travel in a group can really help you save a lot money . last thing , i really think travel in a group led by a tour guide is expecially beneficial to the old people . for example , my parent are 60 year old . everytime , when they travel alone , i will be very concerned about their health . however , if they travel in a group accompanied with guide , i will feel much better because my parent can be taken care by the guide of the travel agent . there is no denying , sometimes to travel along is also very attractive . but nowdays , because there are more option and high quality travel service , a far a i see , i will prefer to travel in a group .
