in this period of rapid social and technological change leading to increasing the life complexity , the use of the car is increasing a lot . many are advantage that these method of transportation brought in this era , even if a lot of these turned out to be disadvantage . in other word i think that the extreme growth in the use of car influencing by new technology had many positive aspect . for istance , now in order to reach the work place we can take le time that we used to be in the past , because of speed of car . we have a lot of comfort like to not wait at the bus stop a lot of time , to take huge distance in few minute . consequently because of some of these reason other method of tranpsort are replaced by car . although there are many very effective aspect that can help the human life , nowadays the use of car caused dangerous disadvantage , such a more and more quick speed that cause a lot of death , emission of vehicle that produce very negative enviromental impact . i believe that car in use will rise in twenty year because nowadays we adapt ourself in this style of life and there are way to riduce this use . the negative effect , a mentioned above , don-t stop u even though surely they have to convince u to limite the use of car . in addition many politician established a lot of threshold standard for emission of vehicle to protect the human health and law in order to reduce the traffic and to not encurage to take car , but there wasn t very satisfactory result . it is necessary to require regulation and programms in order to support a sustainable management of trasportation . in conclusion i believe that the reason for which we must to reduce the use of car there are and they are very important for human life and living standard
