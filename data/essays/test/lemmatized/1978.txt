i agree that successful people try new thing and take risk rather than only doing what they already know how to do well . in my country have good proverb for this statement . that is `` people without challenge can not be success their life . '' i think this is good proverb for explaning my opinion . challenge always come with some risk . after challenge , however , person who do this can get success . very famous guy who is owner of apple campany is good example for this statement . i think he ha enough money for spending his whole life and he is already in high position in the society and in the company , but he everytime try to make new thing and develop new sofeware . i think he doe not need to make a risk by himself , he dose not need to challenge for some new thing . without making new product and new software , he can spend money a he usually use and live well a before . but he is challenging . he is making new product and sofrware . this is the key why he ha so much money and ha world best seller product which is i pod . the success key in his life is challenge , even the challenge ha risk . we can find one same thing from the successful people . that is their challenge story . they are doing or did somethings in their life , although their are some risk . it mean without risk people can not success in their life .
