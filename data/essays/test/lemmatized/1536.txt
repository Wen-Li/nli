advertisements try to attract people so that they want to buy the product , because in their aspect they want to sell the product . that 's why they try to make the product look tempting through advertisement . i agree that most advertisement make product seem better than they are in reality . the product that are shown in advertisement look awesome and cool , but they really are n't always what they seem . i have had several experience that relate to this thought . internet shopping can be an example . the product that appear on the screen are usually just the image . through the advertisement , the vision of the product seems flawless . it look so colorful and attracting . when i actually buy it and receive it through package mail , the color is sometimes different from what i had seen through the image , which is dissatisfacting . also in hidden place there are scratch and place that are n't complete . therefore , advertisement simply try to make the product seem tempting through the buyer 's eye when they are actually not that perfect . also , another example can be a food commercial . the seller on television make exclamation about the product , of how delicious it taste , and it make me feel like calling the company . they emphasize only on the point that make the product seem perfect . when i receive the product that i had bought through home-shopping , sometimes the product is n't at all like it wa on the television commercial . in conclusion , not all product are a good a they are advertisement . advertisements only show the customer the good side and the advantage of the product but not the downside . looking at product at a criticizing point of view can be a good way of smart shopping . it 's always important to think carefully before being convinced by an advertisement . that 's why i try to seek the disadvantage of the product and the part that i might be being fooled by the seller .
