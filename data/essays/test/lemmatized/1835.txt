i strongly disagree with the motion that , the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide . i personally would like to travel alone without any tour guide for the following reason . reduction of element of surprise : when we travel with a tour guide , most of the thing are expected and hence it doe n't put up any surprise , and a some wise man said ` surprises make you happy . ' so i can comfortablly presume that a travel guide reduces the happiness of the whole trip . and significantly reduce the much cherished experience that a trip is bound to throw on the traveller . limited access to local : as mentioned above this point ratifies the notion further . if i travel with a tour guide he 's bound to show the monument and other interest of tourist , but what about the experience of mingling with the localites ? it 's simply ruled out and just no scope pertains of it . the most important part of a tour is itinary . on travelling on expected line it extremely difficult to get the nuance of the local culture and tradition . for a avid traveller like me it would be a detereioration of experience . understanding of cuture : for a travel there are many question to be answered . like the motif of the travel . unless the motif is fulfilled the travel is incomplete in all sense . understanding and imparting the local culture is of high importance to the traveller . to be spefic traveller of high caliber . he would surely understand the importance of culture and necissity to confluence with it . this ratifies the above mentioned point by all mean . `` the best experience is the experience of travel '' started some wise man . and indeed it is . i would like to take the opportunity to exhibit my pragmatic side of my persona . i have been irrationally harsh to tour guide , but the fact reamins that most of the traveller opt fot them . in some way tour group led by a tour guide is indeed a good idea , especially when we are in a group an stuck in a problem these group and guide come in handy to the situation . it all depends on perception and interest of the traveller .
