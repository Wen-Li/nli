recently , there are many tour company . each tour guid is very good and the quality become very high . if we have good choises , we can enjoy enogh . however , i disagree with the statement that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guids . the reason why i desagree are it cost too much , it is not real enjoyment for me , and there is no free . first of all , a tour guid cost very expensive . basicaly , if we use the tour company , we have to pay more for the company . however , i do not like that . if we have money to pay the company , we can use the money the other thing . for example , we can eat more delicous food or we can buy more suivenires . i do not want to use money for empty thing like company or tour or servise . it is not good way to use money . second , it is not exciting because the trip already decides a plan where will we go and what will we do . it is a little boring for me . if we plan by ourselves , we can enjoy to decide where will we go , what will we do , and which hotel will we stay . i think it is really exciting to plan about that . if we use the guid , we do not have to do anything by ourselves , but it is just lazy . i want to organize by myself . finally , the most important reason is free . if we ask guide , we can not move freely . if we go there and see various thing , shop , or building , we may want to change our plan to go the place . nobody know the timing when our mind will change and i want to change my plan at that time . therefore , i want freedom during the trip . in conclusion , i do not think that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide because i have three reason . for me , if i want to enjoy my travel really , i want to use the money by smart way , i want to make the trip by myself , and i want to have freedom during my trip . it is the best way to enjoy traveling for me .
