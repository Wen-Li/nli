i agree completely with the statement that most advertisement provide misleading information on the product which relate to . in addressing this matter , we should consider the fact that the advertising is playing a crucial and substantial role in the current and modern trade of good . take the case of two similar product , one of which massively advertised , while the other one lightly promoted . you can be sure that even if the latter ha better feature or is for instance more heathly , it will face a number of sale lower than that the more advertised product will receive . since the company are aware of how advertising the product influence the decision of customer in choosing an item instead of another one , they are stimulated to present their product by showing off the positive aspect of the product and by hiding the negative one . in most case , in presenting the product company attribute to them quality that they do not even have only for the purpose to increase the relevant sale . how many time have you heard about people that want to return the product they bought or they complain about the relevant feature expected in the product ? i am sure that nearly all of u have experienced this situation . due to the high competition on the market , company do not really care to be completely fair in presentig their product , they are only driven by the aim to reached the highest sale . however , i believe that if in certain case a misleading advertising do not bring any damage to the customer , on the other hand certain advertsements that submit untrue information about the quality of a product may adversely affect a customer . for instance , you can face this problem with food procuts . some people are pushed to haevily use a product beacuse of it supposed ingridients and quality , but if the product doe not contain the presented quality it may really hurt such people . one friend of mine wa used to eat a special food in order to lose weight . unfortunately , this food did not produced the effect advertised , but on the other hand my friend by an hude use of this food ha suffered other kind of damage .
