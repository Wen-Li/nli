somp people may not think most advertisement make product seem much better than they really are . but i do n't agree with them . i think it wa really most advertisement make product seem much better than they really are . firstly , i think most advertisement make product seem much better than they really are . because now the tecnology is much better than before . some company want to get more money from the product , even if the product do not have these fuction , they will use some advertisement to make product better . so that could make customors believe that product is really good for them . but after they use the product later , they will found out the truth . and also maybe the product give them some pain after use the product . secondly , i think most advertisement make product seem much better than they really are . because on the tv , there is a lot of commercial , and the company want more people to believe the product is good . they always find super star to give presentation by using the product . ask them to tell people how good is the product and how useful are they . and through the commercial more and more people will receive this message and know more about the product . but among lot of commercial , only a few commercial tell the true fuction of the product . finally , a i said before , i agree with this statment . i really think most advertisement make product seem much better that they really are . the only way we could know if the product are really like the advertisement make is try it by ourselves . we could n't believe the commercial and the advertisement . they always lie to u to make the product seem much better than they really are . so we could just believe our eye instead of believing the advertisement .
