i think that this statement is only partially true . if we look at survey and poll about this topic may be we should agree with it but i know a lot of people who try to help the community a often a they can . actually survey analyze wider sample of people and for this reason it might be more accurate than my `` survey '' but i prefer to believe that the person interviewed were the wrong one ! i believe that young people today are very sensitive toward the problem of their community especially because the mass medium broadcast a lot of information about it . to me young people are not the `` bad person '' they are deemed to be by adult but , at least in small town , the majority of them dedicate a lot of their free time to the community . in my town , for example , on sunday , instead of going out , my friend and i organize event for poor kid , a for example karaoke or drama . from time to time we go to clean park around the town and we dedicate to old people who are alone and need someone who go to take medicine or food for them . i know a lot of boy and girl who do it , in other town too . this is not an attempt to elogiate myself and my friend but i want to demonstrate that young people take care of the community and care about the way it work cooperating to improving it . another way in wich young people spend their time in helping their community is working a volunteer for the local health assistance . i have to admit that it take a lot of time and i ca n't join it but there are a lot of young people who go there on saturday night instead of going to club with friend , only to help the community . in conclusion , in spite of the fact that survey show that nowadays young people are careless toward the community my experience tell me something different . this is the reason why i can disagree with it without admitting that survey can be right .
