the main issue of advertisement , in my opinion , is two-fold . on one side there are the economic interest of the company which is selling a specific product , on the other there are the interest of the consumer which are to be granted . it result clear that a company , in order to survive within the market , ha to sell the grater possible amount of it product . many are the instrument that can be referred to , although the major one , and the more strictly linked to the topic of this essay , appears to be marketing . this economic tool ha it main focus on how to improve sale by taking into account consumer preference , the impact of the image of the product , the pricing and so on . all of these factor must be considered and contribute to the creation of an advertisment . it can be easily inferred that an advertisement will concentrate more on the benefit that the product confers to the buyer , without drawing too much attention to it drawback . that is why , to me , advertisement make product much more appealing than they really are . there are some limit though . during the past , the field of advertisement wa a kind of a free zone , with no rule that regulated it market . in modern day , instead , a growing awareness of the risk of a misleading advertisement ha triggered a counter-reaction which the naissance of authority that defend customer ' right is the result of . the behaviour of a company is now strictly observed by such authority which have , also , the right to impose precise standard requirement for an advertiesment . all the detail of the product must be easily comprehended by the buyer . for example , following a resolution by the european union , a product which doe not contain cocoa butter , can still be defined a chocolate . the producer is to specify , though , the ingredient enabling , in such way , the consumer to evaluate properly which kind of product he/she is about to buy .
