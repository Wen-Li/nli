i do not agree completely with this statement . in my experience a a student and a professional business woman , i have continuously encountered situation where understanding concept , idea and fact is equally important . the importance of each element can sometimes increase or change depending mostly on the pragmatic perspective or end of these situation . as a student , sometimes it wa difficult to discern between the importance and precise difference between each of these element . then again , throughout my educational experience their difference and importance became clearer . i strongly believe that the importance of each of these element lie within their application throughout each student 's educational programme . for instance , it is more important for student who major in exact and/or natural science such a chemistry and mathematics to prioritize fact over concept or idea . on the other hand , for student who major in philosophy or psychology , understanding idea or concept is significantly relevant to their study and the implementation of these in their work . however this comparison is not 100 % accurate or true . what might be important to some student might not be important to other student , independet of their major , their interest and their academic ability . overall i think the importance of these element depends mostly on each student and their academic and personal objective . nevertheless it is crucial to evaluate whether the prioritization of concept , idea or fact is indeed an issue . in my opinion it is more important for student to achieve good grade and obtain a diploma to continue with their career . while some student might be in university to learn others are investing their money and their time in preparing themselves to become leader , lawyer , doctor , teacher or whatever they want to become . what is most important is to become eduacted .
