i think that it is better to always try to take risk , risk make people succsesful because , for example when you risk something and you loose the next time you do it you will know how to do it and you will do it good , like they say in my country `` the people that doe n't risk doe n't win '' that is because even failing make you more experienced in what you did . the people that doe n't risk anything have boring life because their life are always the same , they live in a circle because they do the same thing every day . in my opinion life should be fun , and where is the fun in doing always the same thing . all the big idea and business are made by taking risk . but taking risk doe n't just applies to business , it applies to everything and every day . for example i want to go to study to a college in the us , but i could just stayed in my country and study a carrer there . so i am taking the risk to see if i can have a better life . the people that doe n't take risk in most of the case are people with problem because they think that their life could be worse and they could get to a bigger failure , but if instead they take the risk and they succeed they would feel better and they can be better people . i think that one of the best thing about taking a risk is the feeling that you tried to change something for the best even if you fail , taking risk make your life more intense and interesting , and that is a healthy way of living because you are making an effort to change your life and not to keep it that way and just see the oportunities passing by , and thaths why i think that taking a risk is better and why i always try to take risk .
