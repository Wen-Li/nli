nowadays , there are a lot of type of education . some school teach and give their student so general education without deeping the subject . some other school give so specific education to their student . i believe that student can be more successful with specific education . because of this , i disagree with that it is more important for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact with two reason . my first reason is that if student learn fact in their school they can learn easier because the fact provide real thing and the their class may be more logical and the most important thing in this point , if student learnd fact they do not need to memorize anything . for example , if we explain everything to student , he or she will not have a question mark in his or her mind . moreover , he or she never forget this idea . thus , learning fact are more important . my second reason is that if we teach student just idea and concept , these thing may shape his or her life style . he or she may start thinking everything so general . it can effect his or her life . for instance , if a student learns just general thing he may start looking at people like that without thinking deep about them . it is not good because people have emmotions . to sum up , student can understand idea and concept easly but for them the most important thing is that understand idea correctly with all of point . without that , student can not think deeply and they can not critic their world . understanding idea and concept are easy way for student . they can not improve their self in their future , if we teach them with these way .
