no one can deny the fact that in this present context that every person know that travel playe an important role in our life , i think that the statement `` the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide , sound very true . the extent to which wecan enjoy in travelling in a group can not be otherwise . the role of a tour guide is also very important when travelling in a group , a tour guide will be having all knowledge about the various tourist site . we can miss out some important place to visit without a tourist guide . a tour guide also recommend u to not visit some prohibited site or site which are not so good and by doing so a tour guide save our time and energy . moreover tour guide will take u to site by a shortest waywhich may be unknown to u before . travelling in a group is an adventure in itself . one can never get bored in a group . activity like playing game in a group and singing etc. add a lot to fun and frolic ehile visiting some sites. a person can never enjoy a much if he is alone. a guide take u to site where we can enjoy more and more spend time . more over we can miss some important and interesting site . although some people like travelling plone , on the other hand according to me travelling in a group is more beneficial for the people . it is said that great thinking attracts good result medicure thinking attracts bad result . ultimately i would you like to say that my view are rather diferrent from other people . i have contemplated the matter a far a the topic is concerned .
