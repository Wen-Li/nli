i agree with the statement that most of the advertisement represents the perticular product a the better one among all others . as advertisement main motto is just to aware people about the new product and to advertise the best pat of it and lastly how it can help anyone . but now due to very high competetion in the market advertisement are doing different job . my preferrence is better a now a day advertisement show many thing with their product . which many time look like evevn unimaginable . for example i have seen an advertisement for a deodrant . in which when one man spray that spray on his body hundred of girl just started running towards him . in this way it misguided many youngesters perticularly . as that advertisement is targeting youngesters . in the same way for the beauty cream . in the advertisement they shown that just use this cream for seven day and you will become beautiful . but according to expereinces of people it only work 20-30 % also depends on circumstance . it also make advertisement unreliable . secondly , many time for advertisement company using big star . perticularly those who have great fan following . in that way also misinterpretation occurs by the fan of those star . like in an advertisement arnold is doing his jim from a perticular product . so after seeing that advertisement many people interpret that by using that machine only they can build muscle like arnold . in the last many time people influenced with the advertisement of perticular product buy that . but after using that product for some time , came to know that it is not fulfilling the need or because of bad material used in it , product damage . like you buy a motorbike of perticular copany without doing proper research for it but just because of it rough tough advertisement . after some time you came to know that it part are not working properly , it average is also low . because in the advertisement they shown the average with small sign for ` condition apply ' . so in this way i can say that my preference is the better one a compaired to the other a due to very high competition in market , the advertisement are made just to give maximum profit to the company not to people thats why they represent product much better from what it is .
