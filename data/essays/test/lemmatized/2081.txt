it is questioned that student understand idea and concept is more importatn than for leaning fact . i believe that understand the idea and concept is better for student . in this essay , i will discus why i support student should understand idea and concept when they are learning . whenever we learn anything , we must fist learn the concept and the idea of that thing . that is the basic thing we have to know , to understand how it work and come . for example , if we learn mathematics , we have to first understand the basic concept of a formula . after we understand it , we exert it and learn more formula which is related to it . but if a student doe not fully understand the concept of the formula . he will not be able to use it well and ha difficulty in learning other formula which require the understanding of the previous formula . so it is improtant for the student to understand the concept first . besides exerting , learning a concept can provoke people to think so that they may create a new concept . for example , when a matheticican want to creat a new forumla by using the preivious formula . they will have to first comprehend thoroughly the concept of the previous formula . then , think about how they can amend the formula to a better one or even create a new one for different usage . that is why people improve a lot from the past . becaus they understand and then they think and though creating something new which will benefict others . if a student doe not think , he will lose his creativity . i think it is really more important for student to understand iders and concept of everthing since there is a relationship between understanding and thinking .
