is it more important for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact ? i personally believe that the answer to this question is , yes . i agree that understanding idea and concept in class is important and more helpful than remembering fact . as a young student a myself , i have experienced both method and found that understanding the idea and concept more effective in the long run . during a lesson , for example a geography lesson , i would be more interested in the concept of glacier formation and with interest i would be keen to understand the process rather than the fact . understanding idea ha given me a better view in a wide range of subject and helped me remember the process , for example the glacier formation , easily . learning fact can be very boring and quickly forgotten . i believe that being a good teacher , is to be able to explain and intorduce new idea well . good explaination and understanding not only help the student achieve better result in class but also help the student in the future . everything that you understand from the teacher or fellow classmate , will eventually connect with topic that will be taught later on in class or at university . if a student just remembers the fact early on , it will not help the student with the next topic that requires understanding from the previous topic . for example in chemistry , i would n't be able to understand acid-base equilibrium today if i did n't understand the concept behind equilibrium which wa taught last year . in addiction , student who just remember fact in any subject will have difficulty to imply them in everyday life and conversation held between other student and professor . it is a shame to see how many people do struggle with this . i know many people who would just remember fact and be stuck in an awkward situation with other student a they did n't quite know exactly what they were talking about and could n't show his or her interest . finally , i conclued that understanding idea and concept are more important for not only exam but in the long run , a it give an advantage in future study and is kept in the memorie for a longer period of time .
