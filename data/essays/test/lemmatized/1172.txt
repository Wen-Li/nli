travel is a quite wonderful way to relax for people live in morden sociaty with a lot of press . however , if one would travel , he or she must decide where and how to travel . for this situation , many travelling company have the programme that enable people be a group and let a tour guide lead . then , traveler can just have fun without the worry about where to live , what to eat or how to get . however , i disagree with the statement of travelling in a group led by a tour guide is the best way . firstly , travelling is quite a personal thing . travelling by ourselves , we can go anywhere we want to . but many tour guide have their owned route , and they always take traveller to those place which have been famous or crowded . it is hard to have enough time to breath the fresh air out of city . secondly , with a tour guide , if you don not like the taste he or she ordered for you , you have no other choice , or you have to pay more to get some food agree with your stumacl . meanwhile , travelling by yourselves , you can have more local taste and much cheaper than the meal ordered by the guide . what 's more , travelling in a group led by a tour guide , the time table always have been settled and you have to follow it exactlly . if one traveller want to take some more picture at the place he love and take a little longer time , the other traveller who doe not like the place may be unpleasured . so it is quite a big problem that make everyone in the group have one opinion . travelling by oneself have no worry about these problem . wherever you like , stay here for several day to enjoy and take a many photograph a you like . all in all , i don not consider travelling in a group led by a tour guide is a good way . i love the way that travel much freely and cheaper .
