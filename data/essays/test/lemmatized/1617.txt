in general , i agree with this assertion that advertisement make product better . however , in some case , it harm the reputation of the product a well . my point of view about this issue based on the analysis below . of course , in order to sale more product , most company are using advertisement to stress the advantage of their product , it always work in a positive way . it not only let the customer know more about it but also fire their desire . for example , sk2 , which is a famous brand japanese makeup , let zhang zhiyi to make it advertisement . as we all know , zhang , a beautiful woman , offer a chance to this company to make a great profit in china . by this advertisement , people will think this makeup will allow them have similar skin a zhang doe , since zhang said in the advertisement she used it everyday . as a result , the income of the company in china is amazing . hence , advertisement can always give a perfect image to the people watching it . however , some advertisement actually act in a opposite way . once a company , a traditional chinese food maker , used a advertisment which claiming it production ha wonderful effect in improving the child 's brain . and also , it contains certain substance which celebrated in china . nevertheless , the second day newspaper point out the substance mentioned in the advertisment ha not been verified yet . it could be harmful . so most japanese stop from using it . after several monthes this product disappeard in japanese super market . this illustrates the point that the advertisment which is not well organized or the quality of product are uncertain , the effect is negative . in a word , not all of the advertisments can lead surprising result to the producer . to sum up , althugh sometimes the advertisement can make the product much better than they really are , it can also make undesirable to the maker based on the quality of both the advertisement and the product .
