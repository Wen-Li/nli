advertisement ha taken an important role in modern society . nowadays you are confronted with advertisement in all kind of medium : you hear it on the radio and you see in the newspaper , magazine , on tv , the internet or just if you are walking around in the street . there is advertisment everywhere and for example some tv-companies are financing themselves only by advertisement . but are those colorful shining product which we see on tv also the one we get for our money ? or make advertisments product seem better than they really are ? in my opinion , in most case , the actually do . first of all the modern mean of technology give the creator of advertisement huge possibility . for example all advertisment picture in magazine or newspaper are corrected by computer program and it is the same with advertisement film shown on tv . sometimes even advertisments for food are completely produced with the computer . a second reason why i am thinking that prdoucts in advertisments are shown better than they are in real life , is that you need to overemphasize when you want to draw people 's attention to something . for example if you want to sell your newest car model you will not say : `` this car is cheap , but you do not get the standard comfort . '' you will always try to make your product look a great a possible . so in the given example you would therefore say : `` besides all the comfort you expect an automobile to have , you save the most of your money if you choose this one ! '' so you can see that every sellsman will always try to point out what make his particular product so special and why you would have to buy it . moreover i think that a lot of people even like it the way it go . because people do not want to see just the realistic life sometimes ; they want to see a little bit of a more glamorous and better world .
