i strongly agree with the statement that advertisments are making product much better than they are really . in the sense that , advertisement are over hyping there product though they are not really that effective . i will support my opninion based on the following reason and example . firstly , cosmetic advertisments like soap , shampoo advertises there product much more better than really they are . for example , during advertisments of soap , movie show a very dark woman at the begining and will transform the woman suddenly in fair and beautifully my misleading audience that there so called product had converted a dark and unfair woman into fir one . the reason why is disagree with the advertisment is due many reason . firstly , color od an individual is innate ; it is aquired by gene but not by using soap and stuff like that . secondly , color of an individual is based on the region of earth where people live . so , i strongly agree with statement that advertisments are making product much valuble than they are . secondly , recent one of our neighbour purchased a mobile phone after watching the advertisment whicg show that the usage of the so called mobile phone make human kind prosperous anf richer . but , in reality , purchasing mobile will make a man rich see to be absurd and illogical . in fact a man can be rich only by his effots and hard work but not by purchasing mobile phone . thirdly , adverstiments in the field of motar vehicle like car and bus . in this kind of adverisments , to make their business popular and prosperous , motar company use film and sport star who are well known icon in the society . in addition to this , some advertisments show a sport star ride the car very fast which in reality is impossible . but , people get attracted towards the ridiculous advertisments and will purchase motar car from the well famed companied , although they are not that much effective in usage . in some advertisments like the one which trade hair shampoo show in generally a dramtic recover of hair and baldness after using their so called product , shampoo . in fact , color of hair , growth of hair , baldness are gentically and therefore , can not be regrow again and again . to sum up the above statement , most avertisments like cosmetic , electronic , motar vehicle are making their money by just hyping there avdertiments which in really life a impossible and absurd . so , puplic should aware of all this kind of misleading stuff . finally , based on the above reason , i strongly agrees the statement `` most advertisments make product seem much better than they really are '' .
