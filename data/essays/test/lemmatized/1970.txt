the developpement of car is a reality and nobody can forgett it . cars have became an essential thing for a lot of people . but we have to notice that these developpment ha consequence on the environment . in my essay i 'm going to speak about the present situation and then i will describe how car have to evoluate to keep their place in our society . nowadays car become a problem because of a lot of reason . they need some oil to function but the reserve disappear because of the high consumption . then this consumption create pollution that is very dangerous for people and for the environment . ecological destruction are caused by the car . we make deforestation in order to create some road to permit people to travel by car . in addition some people reject their responsabilities and try to keep their personnal confort . indeed they do n't use common transport a bus but prefer to go to work by car even if there are some big traffic jam . futur for the car developpement is an evolution to do car that could respect more the environment . it exists some project to use car which power would be hydrogene , water or natural gas . in reality we can also take some bus which are using a melting of gas and oil . it exist yet some car which could make great distance using electricity or gpl ( natural gas ) . while we have to be vigilant about this sort of evolution because the developpment of country a india or china could have been dramatic consequence if each person ha a car . the earth wo n't allow this type of situation and it will be the begining of a very important revolution . to conclude we know that our way of life could n't follow the same evolution . our consumption society could not be activated for everyone on the earth . cars are a good example of this situation . if we wish that everybody could have one we have to change their source of power .
