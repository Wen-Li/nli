`` the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide '' yes i agree with the fallowing statement people like travel in many way according to their taste some travel individually while others like to travel with other people this may be with knpwn once or unknown . takeing a tour in a group led by a tour guide give u many wonderful experience we have a chance of meeting many new people and we have the chance to know the place better if we go with a tour guide because guide is a person who ha knowledge of the place where we travel full of his knowledge if we travel in group which consists of different people of different location all togather is a wonderful experince if we tarvel alone or in apair if you are well informed about the place you can travel alone but many dont know and if we travel in group we have security and that too if today there are many travel agency are available for u they are comming with different pakages which are effortable if we travell in group the expence will be reduced comparing to travelling alone i will an example of my world tour in last december i have joined the tour with the pakage offered by the country vacation in delhi the overall cost wa just 70000 in indian rupee the pakage includes the tour to eight country the group consists of 30 people from different region it wa wonderful moment for me to travell world with the people even i dont know thay were so friendly and the tour guide ha shown u many place including many historic place like leaning tower of pisa in italy , statue of liberty and empire state building in united state if i travell alone i could have missed all the fun an faced a lot of trouble . i would like suggest people like this way which mekes u to meet new people and see different location with an effortable price and with social security and i am sure it will be a unforgetable moment of every one .
