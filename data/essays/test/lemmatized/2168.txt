from my point of view this statement is absolutely true . there are three major argument that support my opinion . first of all i would like to invite you on a trip through our recent history . it wa about 1000 a.d. when erik the red set sail to greenland with about 25 ship . more than half of them sunk in the rough sea passage between iceland and the colony they were heading for . they set sail even though they knew about the difficulty which they might have to face . all of them could have continued their career a beeing a craftsman of a farmer . but they did not because of their inner desire to discover something new , to extend the border of the known world . erik 's son leifur ( national hero of iceland ) wa the first to set a foot on the new world ( northern america ) . with this example it can be seen that progress only occurs when men or woman take risk . this is of course only one of thousand of example throughout history . what about the discovery of x-rays by the german physicist roentgen or the apollo-11 mission to the moon ? all these achivements ( many of them increased our life standard enormously ) would not have been possible without taking risk . therfor we should be thankful for all the brave people who put their idea and dream above their own life . in contrast to that i would also like to point out that it is hard to define a successful life . is somebody le successful just because he stay at home with his wife and care for his kid ? as you can see a conflict arises about a clear definition of success . nevertheless i would like to leave it like that and draw my conclusion . throughout history progress wa only possible because of brave men and woman .
