i agree with the the saying that successful people try new thing rather than doing what they already know . becoue in my opinion doing usual thing is quit boring and no fun on that , also by doing the same thing again and again i cant learn so many thing in my life also i cant get alot of experiances in ather thing . first of all let talk about getting bored from thing that we used to do it without trying to take risk and try new thing . when i do the same thing so many time i get bored from it , its true that i get the experiance from that but when you get bored from s , me thing you try to get runed from it . why dont i try to take risk and try doing some thing new , like adding some fun in the same thing that i used to do it , or try ti do it in a different way , or also i can try doing it with my friend or my family . seconed , haveing experiances in so many thing in life . how could i get the good and the resenable amuont of experiances if i didnt try alot of thinga in my life ?? . i should take risk and gat ready for the change in my life and try to collect a much a experiances that i could in my hole life . '' the more thing you do the more experiances you get '' , this what my teacher used to tell u about the life style . finally , in my opinion i should try tafing risk in life and never stop practising in the thing that i used to do but in a new and model way , becuose if i used to do it in the sane way i might get bored from that and never do it again , so it better to thing in differant way from not doing it at all .
