i disagree with the statement that traveling in a group led by a tour guide is the best way . i think that the best way to travel is to create own plan and travel without a tour guide . the reason are a follows . first , if i go to travel , i would like to decide the time schedule and place to visit by myself . in the tour , time schedule and the place to visit is usually almost fixed . i wonder if these thing are sitable for me. 3 year ago , i joined a tour in thai land because that wa first time to got to the country and i thought there were not so many people who could speak english . in the tour , tour guide wa good but time schedule wa tight . also , the place i wanted to go wa not included in the visiting place in the tour . at the time , i thought i sholud arrange my travel by myself if i have already had the place where i wanted to go or the activity i wanted to do in the travel . second , i wanted to save my money for traveling . and i want to investigate my money to studying english instead of a tour . if we join a tour , we need to pay for the tour guide . so , that mean that it will be more expensive than without a tour guide . in my last travel with a tour guide , it costed twice a much a without a tour guide . it wa so expensive , but i could not satisfied . to prevent this situation , it is better to create own plan and to trave by ourselve . third , to ceate travel plan is so fun and interested for me . it will make my travel so memorable . in conclution , i prefer to travel by myself not with a tour guide . i hope many people tried to create their own plan .
