to tell my opinion , i agree . when you see a commercial in the television , you will be able to feel that some advertisement require a function that the product do n't have . for example , when i wa young , i watched many advertisement about doll since i 'm a girl . one of the advertisement which wa very impressive for me , wa an advertisement about mimi ( the doll 's name ) . the advertisement wa saying that mimi 's house is departed into seven room . one of the room wa a bathroom and they said mimi can take shower or a bath in the bathroom . and they showed u an image describing the water falling out from the sink . i wa so young at that age i believed all of the word they 're saying and told my mum to buy it for me . it wa very expensive dollhouse . but i wa very happy until i noticed that the sink wa not a real sink . i mean , the water do n't fall out of the sink ! the advertisement wa a stinking lie ! i think most advertisement requires some kind of a lie to make their product look better . i ca n't blame them for making such an advertisement . they just want to sell their product a many a possible . and that mean that some of the fault are ours . most of u like to use much better , high qualitied product rather than cheap product if we can afford the prize . we do n't realize some cheap product are a good a the expensive one . kind of like this : if we tell the people , `` i saw a very beautiful blue house. '' they don ' t understand about the house . but if we say , `` i saw a million dollar house. '' most of the people understands it . the point of what i 'm saying is that , most advertisement make product seem much better than they are because we want expensive , high quallitied product if we 're not very poor . so , the maker must make the product look fantastic and high quallitied by putting some lie in the advertisement . we should know that the prize is not it . we should judge the product by our clever brain and eye . forget about the prize . just think if you can afford the prize , and buy the most high quallified product you can buy with your wage . that way , it 'll make the maker to provide high quallified , average prize in the market .
