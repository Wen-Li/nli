i think today young people are seperated into two group . one group 's member only think of themselves . helping to their community is not a serious responsibility for them . they only aim to live their life in the best way they can . the second group 's member are trying to change something in the world . they want to be helpful and prevent the factor that may create negative effect . nowadays , i think the number of the second group 's member are increasing . young people are now more sensetive about community . the are trying to be a part of something . and community are the best place for them to reach their aimes . i think there shuold be more encourage to guide these young people to community . as i mentioned above , the number of these people increase but the not with the same ratio of their nation population . so in my opinion the number of people who help the community are not enogh today . when we walk on the street we can see a lot of young people walking around , spendig their time with unnecessary thing . if the government can guide these people , it is sure that their community will develop them self faster . and this will be for the benefit of all member . i think education system of school can guide these people succesfully .
