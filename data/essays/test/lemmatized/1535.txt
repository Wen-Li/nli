it is more important for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact . i agree with the opinion stated above for two reason : first . if you understand very well the idea and the concept then you will learn fact . if they are talking about behavior and why we behave this way , first , they have to understand the concept and the idea of what is behavior and know the process to make a response and evaluate the behavior . then they will have example and will know how we react in society , in school , in house , at a fight , and why we have this behavior , what is behind of ours act and where it is come from . second . more concept and more idea will take you to research more about the topic that you are on and then have a full list of concept and research about same thing and have a bigger criterion at the time of learn and interprete fact . it is like the free opinion of the people about a car ; people know what is a car , what doe the car do , and what a car ha to have to be a car . then they investigate about more thing like the motor , the type of wheel , if the car ha feature like air conditioner , electric window . etc . when you know all this and you have your answer which you think it is correct or unique , and you start to ask more people their opinion and what they know or what they want for the car , you can see that there a lot of different opinion about what is a car or how doe a car function , or what they want to have the car . you understood the idea and the concept , you wanted to know more and then you learned fact . it is hard to explain and put example but one can only learn by living and listening what is happening around u . its the base for a good criterion .
