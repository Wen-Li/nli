travelling is a vital part of our life . travelling to new place teach u a lot of new thing . we gain knowledge and experience about new place and various thing related to them . for example , when we visit a new city , we learn about the lifestyle of the people living there , their cusines , culture , etc . some people like to travel alone and some like to travel in group led by tour guide . i disagree with the above given statement and i think the best way to travel is to travel alone . there are various reason to support the same . firstly , when a person travel alone he perceives all his surroundings in his own way whereas if he/she is travelling with a tour guide he get to know the thing from only one viewpoint i.e. guide 's viewpoint . for example , once i went to see taj mahal . its a landmark in indian historical architecture . i think i saw and learnt a lot of thing about the place which would have been impssible if i wa accompanied by a guide . secondly , while travelling alone person is independant . he can do whatever he like . he doe not need to seek permission from the tour guide if he want to stray out of the group . whereas with the guide , you are bounded to the group . you observe only what your guide show you . guides can be helpful sometimes when it come to historical building because they are often familiar with the history of those building . thirdly , when a person is alone he ha oppurtunities to explore various place in the new environment like differents restaurant , hotel , etc , he is never in a hurry . if a person like a particular place he can even stay there without any kind of compulsion . as an example , in our country guide are not professional . it mean most of the guide are not educated enough . they are not the best person for the job of guide . morever some people find it dificult to stay with a group at all time . everyone need privacy . its often dificult to adjust with a group of unfamiliar people . also , if a person catch some kind of disease or ha a health problem during the travelling , he can take a break . so these were the main point which convey that travelling alone is more beneficial and interesting too . to conclude , we can say that travelling with guide ha some advantage but on the whole it not good . so travelling alone should be preferred always .
