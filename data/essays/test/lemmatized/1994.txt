in today medium the consumer is exposed to a lot of advertisement , of different kind , like in television or newpapers . usually advertisement is a way to communicate some kind of aspect of the product to a consumer . so the company intension is clearly to sell something . this should be kept in mind mind when discussion the question . in my opinion , a lot of company are trying to make their product to look a good a possible , but they are not making this seem better that it actually is . lets take an car advertisement for an example : on television a company show their car driving through a beautiful landscape with a happy familty . of course this make the car look good and adresses some feeling the consumer associate with these landscape . but it is not adding any feature to the product it self , nor doe it make the product seem better . it is presented in a nice way , and nothing more . since by law , company are not allowed to promise more than their product can hold , they will have a hard time making the product look good . like stated in the previous paragraph , the only legal way of doing so is , to make people associate some form of positiv emotion to it . another point about making product seem better that they are , is economically motivated . if a company make customer buying a product which ha le function than they promised . they are very likely to loose this customer for ever . es specially if you are having a specific brandt , it is important to give customer what they expect . let say a car company like audi trick a customer into buying a car , by proposing feature it doe n't have . on the next car , the customer buy , he 'll for sure not buy a car of the same brandt again . due to the high competition in this industry this is a very problematic issue , and thinking longterm , very foolish . because , like recent study have shown , such tricked customer , are communication their issue three time more than satisfied customer . as shown , in the previous paragraph , advertisement are not making product seem better than they actually are . it is rather a nice form of presenting fact of the product .
