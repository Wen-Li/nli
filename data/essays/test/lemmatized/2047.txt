today it can not be ignored that , advertisement are everywhere , on every wall , every tv show break and every t-shirts of your favourite basketball team . the opinion are divided about this question : are the advertisement realistic ? according to me , they make product seem better than they really are . first of all , the advertisement only highlight the good side of the product . even the picture are taken under such light or such angle that it hide all the default . i have a strikking example for that . i have ordered a computer screen on internet last month . so i never had really seen it , but just on two picture of it . when i have opened the box , i wa very surprised : it wa smaller and le beautifull than on the picture ! i send it back to the seller . but worth of all , there are the advertising who are not telling the truth . some of them simply lie about the product , that is a shame . but however paradoxical it may seem , rarely the advertiser are punished . for instance , in france , only a few association of consumors are fighting against these abuse . briefly , it is our responsbility to focus on the product before buying it and to fight against liers . but it is also to the politician to rule more precisly and make the law tobe respected by all .
