in the present world competations have increased , many development had taken place it is hard to do any thing because the people are aware of every thing . there are many number of advertising agency today , to compete with today world there should be change in many thing . some company show there product look much better then the actual product look , it beeing a form of atracting the people . advertisements are shown in that wayfor many reason one being the competation among another company , second beeing increasing the sale , third beeing increasing the profit . when the product are shown much bigger than they apper , they atract the people to purchase the product but when they purchase the product they will become very sad . showing the product larger or better than it appears is a very bad thing , company or the agency who are showing advertisement should be punished very severly . advertisement which show false thing make the public fool . but due to the development the idea of people also have been changed now-a-days people dont believe the false advertisement which are shown in the television . according to my opinion the advertising company which show false thing should be banned for ever for doing advertisiments . the advertising agency dont have any right to make joke and fool the people . according to me a commity shold be made so that every advertisment should pas the test which the commity conduct i.e. , the advertisement should be real ( not fictious ) i totaly agree with the statement most advertisments make product look much better than they really are .
