i agree that people who are successful take risk and try new thing . it is not a coincidence that it exist the saying `` who doe not risk , doe not win '' . the world is always changing and there is always the need of something new and different and if we only do what we know well it can come a moment when what we know is not enougth and we need to learn something new in order to stay in . successful company are those who take risk . let take the photo industry a an example . when the digital camera came out , not all company new well how to do this kind of technology but they took a chance and tried it , if they had not done that , they would still be selling regular camera and would already be out of the market . because the need have changed . the same situation happens with people . it is true that we are usually afraid to try new thing and get out of the routine , it is maybe because we feel more secure and confortable with the idea that we know exactly what we are doing and that we are doing it rigth , but we migth come to a point where we need to change , to evolve , to look for new horizon . i say this because if we take and example of a person who work in a company , he knwos well what he doe , but he doe not have the posibility to grow in the company anymore , he ha two option : stay there because he already know what he ha to do , he already know the people and the system and he doe not have to change anything . or , look for other option , it can be risky , different , new , maybe he is not going to know exactly the job and will have to learn new thing , but maybe he can have a better chance of success . take risk and try new thing open new door for the present and the future .
