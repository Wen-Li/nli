we would all agree that advertisement play an important role in our daily life since they seem to be omnipresent on tvs , newspaper and magazine . however , when it come to the question that whether most advertisement make product seem better that they really are , people 's answer vary depending on dissimilar background , various experience and different emotional concern . this question , nevertheless is not easy to answer . although quite a few people think that product are that same a what on the advertisement , i am , and probably will always be one of those who argue that ad make the product seem much better that they really are . in this essay , my reason for my answer are introduced a follows . to begin with , the most persuasive point is that the purpose of ad is to make the product sell better . so in order to achieve this goal , the company usually choose make the product seem better . for example , satorial company usually invite charming film star to wear their clothes . and will the clothes seem much beautiful on the actor and the actress ? obviously , the answer is yes . and people may tend to consider the it will be pretty in that clothe and decide to buy it . however , actually , will the clothes seem that better just a it is weared by the star ? the answer is no . this is just one of the small trick that the company use to make the product look better . furthermore , it is an undeniable fact that that the company often try to highlight the merit of the product . the ad will often show the teeth are whiter than white to illustrate the function of certain kind of toothpaste that make the teeth to get white . however , the white appear on the ad is speacially made and actually , normal people will never achieve that white by only using that kind of toothpaste . last but not the least , there is another reason that deserves some word here . ads often do not mention the demerit of the product . we rarely hear a drug ad say the side effect of that drug . however , people stand on a different standpoint may argue that there are regulation to ensure that the product is the same a they appear on ad . while i agree that regulation do have some effect to some extent , they can not totally prevent the difference between the real product and it on ad . taking all the factor into account , we can see that the company make that product appear better on ad by using them in different people , underscoring their merit and not mentioning their demerit . consequentely , i agree with the statement that most ad make product seem much better than they really are .
