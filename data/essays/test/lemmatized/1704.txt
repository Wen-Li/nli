there are two kind of study before highschool . you can go to the university or to specific higher institution . these two solution offer different way of studying . indeed at university you studie more specific academic subject than in highschool but you still have many subject . on the contrary in specific institution you learn more about very specific subject . in my mind university can appear to be better and i am going to explain why by explain the advantage and disadvantage to be specified or not . first , i think that to have a broad knowledge of many academic subject can help you more than study a specific subject . if you only study science you are not conscious of what happenig in the economic world and it can be useful to raise money . besides when you are aware about a lot of subject you are more open-minded in my opinion . indeed you learn different culture in history , different language , differents theory in mathematics . .. then when you are specialized on one specific subject you can be more precise about this . student are university know a lot of thing about different academic subject but they can not describe with a lot of detail one point of one subject . for example an economic student study mathematic but he doe not know some mathematic point particularly because he also have to stuy history , law . .. in addition with the great change in science or technology subject the working world seems to looking for more student who have studied specific subject than student who have studied a lot of subject . to sum up i realize that both kind of higher study have different advantage and disadvantage . to study a specific subjet appear to be more useful if you zant to a work in a very precise kind of job such a researcher in science or chemistry . in the other part having a knowledge concerning a llot og subject seems to be good if you want to have a job where you are going to use a lot knowledge such a marketing job or teacher in primary school .
