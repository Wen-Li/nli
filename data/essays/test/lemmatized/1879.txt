in my prespective , i agree that broad knolwedge of many academic subject is better than specialiazing in one specfic subject but to a certain extent . and i quote here `` knowledge is power '' , so wider knowledge of many academic subject give more insight to a general theme and allows to explore and relate a different aspect of one issue . for example studing econmics a a major subject alone will not be rewarding in comparison to studing it with other related academic subject such a politics and human science . we know that these other subject do have an influence on economics . so it is more of having a hollistic knowledge rather than seeing one face of a coin . knowing different academic subject also give the opprtunity to explore personal preference on studing a certain topic and help making choice . so on the other hand , specializing after a certain extent is needed to increase effeciency and quality of knolwedge or work .
