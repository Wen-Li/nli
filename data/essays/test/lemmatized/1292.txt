a person like me who ha immigrated to the foreign contry after living his or her most of life posse their characteristic based on their culture . it is the matter of nurture that form invidivual 's cognitive thinking and understanding . as we grow to live in the society , our knowledge and thinking are very crucial for lifetime . through the experience i had in school , i have learned the importance of understanding the concept and idea in order to be successful . one of the big difference i have came to realize between united states and korea is the education system . like in math class , for example , u.s education system make the student think logically not to memorize formula like kkorea . in preparation for the exam , i have memorized the note that the teacher ha lectured on to receive a good grade . the memorization of material seemed to work for me and i continued on just memorizing . even memorizing the english word i just learned seem to work for the several month of living in the u.s . i would write the word and definition repeatly for numerous time like many others do . the problem came when i entered the high school . as i try to take more rigorous class , there were just too many important fact to memorize . i have spent most of my time reading and trying to memorize when i got home . unfortunately , my grade on the test and quiz were dropping and continued failure in class made me want to quit and drop out of ap class . however , with continued courage from my parent and peer i have overcame my hardship , tried to bring out my full potential . i have started observing other classmate ' studying habit because it seemed to me that they do not study much a i do but still get a better grade than me . it wa frustrating but after observing and asking peer what they do to prepare for the test , i have learned a lifetime lesson . the understanding idea and concept have enourmous impact in acquiring knowledge .
