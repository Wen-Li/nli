`` imagination is more important than knowledge , '' said einstein . he wa probably referring to the domain of science , where every trailblazing discovery seemed to be the brainchild of a creative and hardworking genius . there 's no denying the fact that imagination is more or le useless in the absence of knowledge , because people need a basis , a ` pedestal ' on which they will produce their idea and test their assumption . when saying that he wa able to see this far because he wa `` standing on the shoulder of giant , '' newton probably illustrated this fact . however , what make newton the evergreen genius he is , is that he dared to challenge the conventional way of thinking and he changed the scientific paradigm forever . to achieve this , he studied and thoroughly analyzed the conventional approach in physic and mechanic , yet he also understood when the old conception need to be undone . let 's hold for a moment the opinion that knowledge is the factor underlying development and success . in this case , it would be normal to expect that the most successful person of each generation and each field would be the one who ha the widest knowledge . yet , the story of science and art challenge this opinion . for example , the first radiotelescope and cosmic radio wave were discovered by a nineteen year old boy , while playing with a radio in the garden . the greatest work of art are not always produced by tutor or professor of art and not every art student make a good artist . in turkey , for example , the majority of the acclaimed writer are not formally trained in literature . creative thinking and risk taking set the people apart , because conventional visdom is easy to earn and apply . this result in large mass of people , stuck with what they know and completely unanimous . think of it in term of business , would a businessman have any success without having an experience of entrepreneurship left behind ? all these evidence lead me to think that innovation and risk taking are the key skill to success . otherwise no one would bother doing anything new and we would be stuck with what we have . as a saying go , `` do not be led to think that a group of creative and risk taking people will not change the world . in fact , that 's the only thing that ever ha .
