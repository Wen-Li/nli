we confront with countless advertisement in our daily life . the modern advertisement cover the every aspect of our society , such a eating , wearing and playing . however , just a little portion of these advertisement are true . this situation can be justified by three obvious reason . in the first place , the food advertisement attract the child from the common food which offer the most nutrion they need . the dramatical competition ha inspired some company to take focus on the unfair adertisement about food , especially the snack . for example , the advertisement could describe their produciton a the very nutrial one to console the parent to buy for their child . but aferwards , many of them were be tested to contributed to some heathy problem . in the second place , we offen be encouraged to try some new clothes or launched losing weight prodution by some famous people , who just work for the high pay from come company . for example , some girl will swayed by the good looking woman on the tv to spend much money to buy some kind of equipment used for losing weight . but , actully the slim body of the star just maintained by other simple way , and the costed production are helpfulless . in the third place , some advertisement also use the new technology to persvade people to buy their producion . for example , they would refer to some new word or invention to interest the costumer . many advertisement will quote that the producing process is caculated by computer or some technology we never heard . because we are not familar with these staff , the advertisement producer will exagrate the effect of the prodction . the example emerge every day . in the summary , we should take awareness to these fault advertisement , and reduce them a much a we can .
