i agree that the best way to travel to somewhere in the world is travelling with a tour guide . there are many advantage travelling with a tour guide . a tour guide can summarize better the history , the culture and custom of a city or people . while travelling over one city they could also save you a lot of time and money . first , a diference from a book , you could get a better explanation of the history of a city from a tour guide . the guide book are in general short and with a brief description of a city , but a guide can explain you better the history , even you can ask him or her something that is not clear of a particular issue . second a guide know better the city custom . in general a guide is someone local or someone who is living there for a long time , so he or she know very well the place . guides also tell you myth and tale of the city dificult to get from book . third guide are fun , interesting , and people who speak a lot . they know many people and they can share their experience . finally guide can advice you about many important topcis such a safety , place to eat , to stay , ect . sometimes they can teach you how to save money . i remember my trip to cape town , south africa . i couls sepak african , a language in this country , but a guide teach me some word useful to survive also , she gave me a lot of advice and wher to go and wher to buy and sleep . she also explain very weel about the apart dait , a social discriminitation , explain many thisn ababot nelson madela . the more funny and interesting trip that i ever had were allways with a tour guide so i definitelly could advice anyone who travel to new place to take tour leading by a guide .
