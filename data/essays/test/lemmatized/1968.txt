people are different from each ather in trying new thing . however , there is a good number of people never try something alls if they know how to do that well in their own way . i am a gree with this statement `` successful people try new thing and take risk rather than only doing that already know how to do well . '' trying new different thing and take risk are successful for me for severl reason . first reason , is will help me to develp my imgnation . not all the time when i do something new i will fell in it . second reason , doing somethings new and take risk for me is kind of exploer myself more . for example , doing something new need sometime to skill . by doing these gave a chance to know what skill i have , i did n't know about it . third reason , a new experins . i do n't like to make my life a a cape pase . i mean by that i do n't like to do the same develop my imgnation is really good to make thing i do more different . expoler myself make me trest myself more and more . having many expernes are going to let me know life more . even so all these , i never forgat be careful with what i am doing or what i will do .
