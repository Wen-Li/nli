i agree with the statement that travelling in a group and should be led by an experienced tour guide . then that tour would be full of fruitful and sweet moment to cherish and recall . i would like to state the reason gradually why it requires a tour guide for the new place which we are visiting . first and foremost , an experienced guide might have a plan outlining the place , order of visit , time needed to spend and taking care of lodging ( if required ) . at this point , i would recall my personal experience with my family member in the tour with a guide . we visited all the spiritual and tourist place in northern part of our country ( india ) . the guide wa perfect in planning the logistics and place of visit . the guide ha planned our itinerary touring 25 place , lodging and food . most of all he covered all the place in stipulated amount of time . the guide had fixed specific amount of time for each place of visit . so that , we dont spend more amount of time in one place and spend le in other . he had taken care of food and lodging requirement in each place of visit . some historic and spiritual place require a person who is well versed with the origin of the place and any specific mythical story related to the place . this kind of information could be available from the guide . the guide would make everyone at ease by revealing the invaluable information to u . on the other hand , this information could be available from the book at the site , but this would require a reading through the book and understand . the information from the book might be supplemented to the information which guide ha given u . since it is the group of people visiting place , it allows to develop the sense of fraternity among everyone in the trip . a sense of belongingness and meeting differnet personality take u to different horizon of thinking . it would be lot of fun going a a group and enjoying it .
