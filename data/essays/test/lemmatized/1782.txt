peolpe in this world are devided into two type , the first type is people who take risk , and the other type is the people who only do what the know how to do well , so what do you like to be the first type or the other one ? some time to take a risk in a thing is good in a way , and bad in onother way , from risk you can take experince and you will get to know thing well , but some time it is a dangerous thing to risk , like if you tried to fix you car your own self and you dont know any thing about car , you may kill your self by touching a high voltage wire , or you may damage the engine , and that will cost you a lot af money . so if you want to risk you can risk but you have to think in the thing that are going to happen , and that your the one who is resposable for all of this . being expert in a something is a good thing , because you can teach other people how to be good in this thing , like the teacher he is an expert in his major thats why he teach student to make them learn about the major . so if the person i really nowing what hi is doing no body can say that he is not successful , if he is not successful who is going to be . in conclusion , i agree and disagree at the same time because it a good thing to have new experince by risking , in the other hand it a bad idea to risk in dangerous thing . also learning some thing and being an expert in it thats a thing will make proud of my self .
