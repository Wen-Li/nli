the question is to decide if successful people are the one who try new thing and take risk , rather than only doing what they already know . i definitely agree with the statement and i will explain why hereafter . firstly , we have to define who is a successful person . to this philosophical and broad question , i could only give my own answer . a successful person is an happy person . indeed , it would be very limited to define a successful person a a person who succeeds all he or she undertakes . also , it wo n't answer to the question asked because everybody can be this type of person , choosing only doing project he or she already know how to well . . with a such definition , i believe that a successful person is necessarily a person who try thing , because this person is curious : she want to discover the world , and experience new sensation . a successful person would like to make lot of travel to discover news country and tradition and to learn about that . a successful person think also that it is important to be aware of the place where we live and and about ourselves the best way to reach this objective is to take risk . in such situation , people can be really improved and learn about their main characteristic . for example , a such person would like to improve his physical skill , practising hiking or alpinism . she would develop his knowledge in these field , and could develop by this way his relationship for this type of person , the most important is not to posse a knowledge , but to be able to posse it . the way to obtain it is more important than the result .
