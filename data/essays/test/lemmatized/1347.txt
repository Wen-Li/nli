i do not agree that most advertisement make product seem much better than they really are . to hold the contrary opinion is tantamount to affirm that most advertisement cheat customer , which i think it is not true . however , in order to defend my position i have to face one straightforward objection : if your statement is true , why do customer sometimes expected more from the product they bought than what they actually received ? i will carry out my argument in two step . first i will give the two reason that support my claim , and secondly i will address the objection i have presented . the main point to bear in mind is the distinction between what a thing is and how doe a thing appears or is presented to others . for while what one thing is is just `` one thing , '' the way it may appear or be presented varies a lot . and advertiser know this and play with it . i see no problem when they take advantage of this difference , provided they do not alter what the product really is ( in this case they will be cheating ) . moreover , i think there is no `` sheer objectivity '' in presenting something , and we always have to choose the aspect we want to focus on or that should be stressed . this happens , for instance , when we are trying to convince others . another point is that a product interacts ( in the sphere of the seeming ) with many other factor , such a environment , company , an so forth . for example , when we see an advertisement of a 4wd suv the car is not presented in a garage , but in the best condition : in the mountain , with a wonderful overview , a nice day , good company and so forth . it is the same car we may be driving a rainy day in the midst of a traffic jam after having a flat tyre . .. now i want to meet the objection . i agree that in fact this sometimes happens . you have bought such amazing car you saw in tv , you have spent all your saving there and the first day you want to use it is a rainy day , and you are hitted by another car . .. you have not been cheated . rather , the condition do not help to enjoy such a product at it best . so this come from a failure on the side of the customer , who did not understand the difference between being and seeming . it is the duty of an advertiser to tell you the good reason for bying a product , but it corresponds to the customer to think about the reason for not buying it . the correct synthesis of both side yield always the best choice .
