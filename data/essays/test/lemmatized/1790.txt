i am convinced that advertisement make product seem much better because their objetive is to sell those product , in order to do that they have to maximize their quality and minimize their flaw . . psychological issue . marketing issue . job related experience as the daughter of a world renowned psychiatrist i undestood at an early age the importance of psychology in every aspect of our life . as a veterinarian , i tend to see thing from a scientifical perspective exclusively leaving the emotional issue aside . to work on this i have attended several workshop given by mental health specialist to discus different topic from several view point . during the last workshop the topic of if advertising wa realistic or did it tend to make product seem better than they really are came up and dr. peterson the best psychologist in the country told u that people tend to look for miracle product or exilirs in order to relieve themselves of the responsability to use the product correctly , for example we tend to choose diet product that tell u we may eat everything we want and by using the product we will still lose weight eventhough that is a paradox . as we all know advertising is one of the 4 basic point of the marketing mix . advertising is used to convince u that the product is the best , that we really need it and that although there are other brand , this one is the best and the cheapest . they have gotten so good at it that they now tell u what to wear , where to buy it , what to eat , to name a few . as i work for a international veterinary laboratory that sell different type of additive , biologicals and antibiotic , i have learned that advertising is essential to everything , mine can be that best product there is , but if i do not maximize it strenghts it will not sell . with all the above i conclude that one of the main finality of advertisement is to make product seem much better than they really are .
