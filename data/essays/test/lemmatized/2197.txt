i agree that most advertisement make product seem much better than they really are . advertisement 's object is to make it product good for saling purpose . to emphasize it , product is shown a perfect . there is a set-up what make costumer think that the product is better than actual it is . the set-up is made for a specific application . the customer may think that it also work well other situation like in advertisement . the actual case may not be so . for example , a machine for apple cutting may be good for that type of apple shown and it may cut only apple . when the machine is used for another type of apple or another fruit like orange , it may not work a well a in the advertisement . another thing make product seem better in advertisement is the place where it happens or the person who us the product . to illustrate that , a banana advertisement happens in hawii . the weather is good , beach is beautiful , there are beautiful girl . a man is seen a he is eating a banana deliciously . since there are many other perfect image in the advertisement , the banana will be like these , perfect . in addition if a famous and attractive person us the product for example a parfume , the parfume will be usullay sold at a bigger quantitiy . buyer of the product will probably estimate that the product will make him/her smell good and attracitve . since the player is famous , player will be dependable . as a conclusion , the image used in advertisement affect the view of costumer about the product . the product is not considered alone . when it is used in real life , it doe not work a good a it is on tv , newspaper , etc . it is natural since there are no other imagesor other affect , there is only the product .
