it 's true that the youth nowadays is le sensitive to the problem of the society than 30/40 year ago . you can see that in the disinterest that young generation have for politics , many young do n't know anything about politics and what is happening aroud them . while during the ` 60 / ` 70 many young were involved in politics , they took part to demostrations , they bought political newspaper and they often discussed about the problem of the society to try to understand and possibly change them . in those year there were n't so many distraction for young , there were n't video-games , dvd , internet and so on ... that nowadays fill entirely the day of young . nowadays young people do n't spend much time with other boy and girl , they prefare to stay closed in home to play with their video-games , explore internet and other thing of this genre that obviously do n't give any help and improvement in their often empty life . it 's time that the young understand that and begin to switch off their tv , console and monitor , and go out to talk with people , like their grandparent , figure too often forgotten in our society . people that have too much to teach u and that we do n't listen enough . it 's time for the young to meet people , who ha n't been so lucky like u , people who live in the road , who have n't enough to eat , who are cold . .. it 's time for young to understand that the world go beyond the last ps2 game or bruce willis 's movie . it 's time for young to understand that an one moment they 'll be called to rule the world after their parent , and certainly video-games wo n't be useful at this moment .
