in my opinion it is true that nowadays young people do n't give enouh time to helping their community . i think that now young people are busier than some year ago . they also don ' t have enough time to do their own activity ! for exemple i am a student and a go to university : it took me all of the time that i have : i go to university every day and when a do n't go to university i have to study so much that it is not possible for me to give my time to my community . i would like to do this , but i ca n't . however , this - do n't have time to do anything - is not the only reason . nowadays young people are interested in other thing and many time they prefer doing these than helping their community . so i agree with this statement : a a young girl that i am i have to admit the existence of that negative behavior . i do n't like this , i think that is wrong but , at the moment , i ca n't do anything to change it . however i really hope that when i finish the university i will have more time to help my community .
