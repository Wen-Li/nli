for the development of our country 's economy , many people are richer than before , so travel is good way of consuming . and it can take a lot of benefit , for example , it can release the pressure , and for child , it can give a lot of knowledge . but i donot think follow a guide in a trip is good way in travelling . there are some reason for this . i think , for me , travelling is not only the mathod of consuming , but also a communition with friend , when we start of work , there is limited time for me to meet friend , so in holiday , taking a travel with close friend is a very important way of keep in touch with them , i did not want someone else play with u . so i did not need travel in a group . secondly , traveling in a group with a guide leaded may be a good way for some child and old man , because they need to take care . but i think it is not nessessary for u , because we are not adolesence any more , we can take care with ourselves . and follow a guide , she or he can is talk about the place where the person visited . but we can go to the internet to download some information about the farmous place . last and most important , follow a guide in the trip , had disadvantage for me , our plan is limited by the guide . she or he do a lot of thing for u , for instance book he hotel , decide which place to play in , by plane or by train . these thing i want to do it on my own opinion . and a lot of famrous place like the summer palace in beijing , the great wall , where we want to spend more time in , the time of the guide give is to limited for u . if we wanted some place else to look around , this is not allowable because that could bring some other people waiting for u . for all of these three point , travelling by our own is a suitable method , we can travel in the hignway in our own car , meet the people in my own ,
