given the choice between the statement , i agree that most advertisement make product seem much better than they really are . first , the advertisement are good at creat the situation for consumer . for example , i want to eat ice cream when the weather is very hot . at that moment , i see the advertisement about the ice cream . it will let me want to get one right away . second , the advertisement are good at use the idol to attract people to buy thier product . for example , it is very attractment to me when i saw the super star who appealed . after she used the product that made her face more young and beautiful . it will let me want to buy one . third , the advertisement are always let consumer have a lot of illustration and dream . they teach people that the product what they owned are the best in the world . to sum up , these are the reason why i agree that most advertisement make product seem much better than they really are .
