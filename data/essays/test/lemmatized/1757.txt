whenever a customer visit a shopping mall he seems always confused about which product to buy or which new product to experiment with . the first thing that would come in his mind is a specific advertisement of a product . he just might buy the product whose advertisement he thought wa most appealing at that point of time . this give a best example of the power of advertising . in this world of cut throat competition every manufacurer want to potray his product a superior and will go to any extreme to make create a positive appeal in the mind of the consumer . today 's market ha new version of the same product coming up almost everyday and if a manufacturer ha to promote his product and make his brand a household name he ha to retort to large scale advertising . advertising can be in several form such a television , radio , newspaper , signboard , large hoarding and many more . a product ha to be vigourously advertised to create an impression in the mind of the customer . due to this a customer is left wondering whether the product is really worth all the talk . several time advertising can be extremely misleading . a customer may get fooled by the magical appeal of a product 's advertisement and may go ahead and buy it only to realize it wa not worth the money . sadly , the public belief in such form of display and life under the impression that the most advertised product is the best one . one must realise that if a manufacturer is spending so much on adertisements he is surely compromising on the quality and if not then the price of the product are increased to make up for the advertising expenditure . the customer becomes a big loser in this case a he is paying more only for a product that is highly advertised and not really a product with high quality . an advertisement of a product generally emphasis on the strong point of the product and would always prove his superiority over other product in the same category . the advertisement may attract a particular category of customer and almost convince them of the product 's effective presence . also the advertisement play on a customer 's mind , for example the product is displayed so many number of time that repetition enhances retention and even the worst product are remembered by the customer . advertisements allure consumer in all possible way possible , for example i remember my baby sister convincing me into buying her a candy bar she had seen on television . surprisingly the product wa not the usual one she wa always fond of . the advertisement had created an appeal and changed her choice . also product that are re introduced or improvised or claim to be better have a wider appeal a people want to experience the change . this may be a tactic used by the manufacturer to drive the customer to buy the product . products are also advertised with exciting offer or add on new product which propell customer to make the purchase . in such case the offer may be more enticing than the product itself a a customer always look to save a penny or two on his expense . thus it is for the customer to choose decisively and buy product that are truely worth their name and quality and not get attracted to temporary saving offer or false display of product .
