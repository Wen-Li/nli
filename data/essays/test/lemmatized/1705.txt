in this modern world where business is given much importance , new and improvised item are been produced to cater the need of the mankind . and this is the advantage taken by most of the firm to draw attention of most of the customer to buy product and make their sale growing . the advertisments in marketing especially to improve the purchase , would definetely opt for choosing some clever idea of highlighting their product more when compared to the other sale . for instance , the soap makin company try to spend more money on the advertisement to show the composition of the soap saying that it been made of essential oil which are medicative and improve the skin beauty . i srictly oppose to such kind of advertisement saying that watever it shown definetely wud n't be their outcome or result when used . the major goal of any marketing company is to get more profit and this would be possible only by advertising their produts to a larger extent with lot of attraction to the customer . their major idea is to make the customer somehow get interested in their product . similarly the discount offer are put up with lot of reduced cost which are the part of the commercial business . as various company in a sountry would go for producing the same kid of product , advertisement ha been the preference to many to gain the interest of many customer at a time . similarly the usage of various shampoo . one company advertises saying that it product would be more usefull for the people with dandruff . whereas the other state that it product is worth using because of the various natural herb used in it . truly speaking none of the company might have used such valuable item to prepare their product because the key ingredient used might be much costlier than the actualt shampoo . so they try to high light their product to be the best . however , their idea is to get enough profit by gaining attention but not to really work for what they have publically put up regarding their product . hence it worth saying that the ' advertisement make product seem much better than what they really are ' .
