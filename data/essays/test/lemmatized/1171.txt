i agree with this statement that the poeple try new thing and risk rather that doing thing they know because if the person made his goal to the end , he or she will always try to find a new goal to achieve . is the world wa made just for a person to have one goal in his or her life there would be no interest in living afret achieving it . the person have always try to find his / her limitation . people find something new in their life , try fighting their destiny and take risk through their entire life . is the people do the thing their anly know about their life will be boring and meaningless . the world will be not a interesting a it is and there may be no progress in the future . from the begining of your life when you are born you beging taking risk of exploring the world and learning how to survive . you learn how to walk even knowing that it going to be painfull in the begining from falling but you still continuie to walk . you find people and become friend even knowing that they may betraied you and bring mental pain . there have been always a lot of thing and risk the people pas through and still we keep on doing till the end , till they achieved what they wanted . being successful or not doe n't realy matter . people always where trying to find their limitation and finding their own way of doing thing . the exploration of the world is an important mean of why we still take risk and do thing that we do not know well . the seeking for knowledge is what keep u interested in everything and learning new thing we wish to know or think it will be usefull . the successful people may go very far on try new thing and by taking new risk to find what their want and seek for . the willing to try this is deep inside people . people will rather find new thing than do the same thing over and over , make their life boring and uninteresting . the taking of the risk is only one of the condition the people take to try new thing .
