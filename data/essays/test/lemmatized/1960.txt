i strongly oppose the idea that '' successful people try new thins and take risk rather than only doing what they already know how to do well . '' because , in my opinion , if a person want to be succesful , he ha to concentrate on just one subject and ha to learn all the aspect . i am willing to discus it by proposing two main reason ; one of the primary reason is that people suppose to do the same thing to get proficiency . for example , suppose a person who ha been playing drum for ten year , even if he try new thing and take risk , he could forget what he know in drum and probably could not be the one in his new field . i am a determined person and i always want to be perfect in what i am doing . therefore , being interested in one thing and focusing all the small detail , make an individual complete and more succcesful . the second reason is that , when you are doing what you already know , you feel yourself more comfortable and relaxed because you will be more self confident . thus when you believe in yourself there will be nothing for you that you can not handle it . for instance , my brother is a professional chess player and if he take risk and try to do other sport , i know that he can not be successful even it make him unsuccessful person . because he know how to play chess and he know that chess is the most convenient way to express his feeling . to sum up , i think people have to discover what they are capable of , and have to find out the way of being much better rather than trying new thing . because only by this way an indiviual can achieve his goal and can lead a successful life .
