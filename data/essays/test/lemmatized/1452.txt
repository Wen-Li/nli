i do n't think that student should learn more about the idea and the concept than the fact . for example , little childrens that are studying the importance of a healthy way of living including eating habit and exercising should know the fact that eating too much sugar and lack of exercice increase the risk of obesity . the fact will support the idea and the concept and will gave them a complete view of the problem or the situation . secondly , they are many idea about the way we suppose to eat , but if they are study who state that eating le salt can help to control or lower the blood pressure people will be in favor to follow this rule . facts help people to understand and to rely on something , for example if they do n't exercise they know the fact that they can increase there chance of having health problem a well a others problem like gain weight , lack of energy or cholesterol problem . i think that if student know the fact of good nutritional habit they are le likely to make mistake and they will eat more right and make more exercice . however , even if student understand the fact that doe n't mean that they will be more responsible about their food comsuption or their exercice habit , so that why i believed that student should learn everything in general that include fact , idea and concept but not one more that they others . the importance of this is for the student to have a global understanding of a problem or a history event .
