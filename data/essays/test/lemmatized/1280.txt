it is often argued that which is more important for student to understand idea and concept or to learn fact . i basically agree with the idea that it is more improtant for student to understand idea and concept becasue i believe that the concept and understanding can give a student opportunity to learn responsibilty and big picture of the whole process of what they doing , the opportunity is a direction that teach student by expericencing them to learn a creativity . in a business manner , the fact are always very important more than it real work sometimes . for example , microsoft wa ventured by few young people who were student by the time they started the business . the two co-founders especially , the bill gate ha a whole understand and concept for personal computer , even though he can consider a very skilled computer engineer , he actually created ms based on his belief and creating mind that both come from idea and concept of future personal computer time comming . there were probably so many other people who know computer and have more skill on technology than that of bill gate ha . but the real creative and the real revolution can be achieved by understanding idea and concept . examples to answer of the question given do not need to be compare big reputation company . we can easily find a example of better understand idea and concept would useful than just learning fact . i have 4years old boy , jun - my sister child , and 5years boy , sean - my friend 's child , the two childrens are have very different behavior in general . jun doe n't read and speaking properly yet while sean could read and learn many thing since he wa 3years . but when they using a computer specially internet to search what they wanted to watch such a child program , jun alwasy find his way to find what they want from internet because i believe that he know what is the internet about even though he ca n't read .
