there are many way to travel . one of these way is called `` group tour '' . i aleady knew this is one of the best way to travel . i really love to travel in a group led by a tour guide . there are three reason in doing so . the most important thing is that grouping tour allows me to save time . for example , last year i went to europe with my 13 co-worker . of course , our group ha g guide . we have a very tight schedule , and we are all stranger there . if we have a guide , we do n't choose what to see . secondly , if we have a travel in a group , we would meet many people who have different experience . we have chance to having a friend . that the really important point to every person in the world i think . we always share my thinking and opnion with my friend . having many friend will make me happy . finally , traveling in a group allows me to save the money . this is the obious thing in economics . according to the economic book , when we buy something a a group , we alway have a bargaining power . for instance , if i buy a airline ticket for traveling , i would buy much expensive than buying airline ticket by a group ( at least more than 10 person ) . to summarize , i like traveling in a group led by a tour guide . because , it is saving time and money and allowing u to meet many people .
