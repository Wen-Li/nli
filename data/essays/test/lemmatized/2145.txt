it happens to me a lot of time to taste food or to try a product that reveal to be not a good a shown in the advertisement . the mass medias can do miracle in showing item to be put on the market in a different way . they use the image , which can modify a lot the real consistency of the item to be advertised . for instance , what you look through the television or on a poster on the street is slightly different from the reality because of the use of colour and light when photografing the product . the advertiser use marketing strategy , abouve all in showing you the product with the perfect background : right word and slogan . they use the tool of communication to attract you . in addition they try to make a good use of time ( usually they have really short time ) and image , a good combination of both of them make an advert very successful . they also know to whom address their porpouses , usually they use target group , in which child and elederly are most common . as far a food is concerned , i think that advertisement can be a sourse of attraction for the buyer because they only see the product without tasting it . but i think that you can do a wrong choice the first time then you know that for the following time you will be not buying the same product even if it is good advertised . i prefer to watch a product with my eye than let me convice by the advert , even if sometimes they are really well done and a kind of art .
