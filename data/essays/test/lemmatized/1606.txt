generally think that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping thier community . probably , it is true . because they have to do their homework , assignment and so on , and also they want to have a fun with their friend . i definitely say that most of people like staying with thei friend better than helping their community . because we can meet our neiborhoods anytime . i think that this reason connects to this issue that recently , young people do not give enough time to helping thei community . however , i disagree with this statement that young people do not participate in community . first , they surely have their time . during the time they sre frre , and also they can do anythig what they want to do . thus , i think that people should not regulate their time , and they do not have any rigts to force to do something . and it is one of selfith of adult in the community . by the way , in the summer , my community ha many summer festival with neiborhoods . to achieve the festival we need many stuff , and also they want outgoing person . each year , the people who arrange the festival always annoy about lack of stuff , however many youngstars in my community participate in the festival , and also they enjoy it really much . they can know how to communicate with oter people due to participation of a community activity . i think it is the most important to live in a daily life s a human . i know that there is deffetrent tendency of the number of stuff each year . but i am one of a person who includes young people , i do not want someone to say such like a statement . in assition , i think that many youngstyars know how importance of communication with oter people like i mentioned above . therefore i definitely disagree that youngstars do not participate in their community .
