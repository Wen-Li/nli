most of u have probably seen the kid asking their mom for a candy or chocolate of which they 've seen the commercial on tv . how about adult being cheated by the advertisement either on tv or somewhere else ? in fact , most of the advertisement we see might not be reflecting the truth but trying to hook consumer in order to sell more . the truth is ; advertisement do not reflect the truth because they are not controlled by the government , they only show the benefit of a product and they are producer biased communication method to reach vast amount of people . first of all , the government doe not controll the commercial using appropriate method . in fact it can not do that . in a small country of a couple of million , there are more than thousand of company most of which are active and chose to use commercial to reach their consumer . on tv , newspaper , big board , flyer and using many other way that can only depend on the creativity of the advertiser , they reach million of people everyday . just the tv , for example , ha more than a hundred different channel all of which earn their money of commercial . therefore it is impossible to check all method of advertising whether they are accurate or not . secondly , any commercial would only reflect the product advantage but not the disadvantage . even if you are advertising a very expensive product , you would say `` it 's cheaper now ! '' . you would n't probably say `` coca-cola is unhealthy and result addiction to itself ! '' but instead you would say `` it 's delicious , it 's cool '' . the purpose of a commercial is not to indicate how useless a product is but to indicate how usefull it is . therefore , in mentality , if something is that harmfull , the advertiser just ignore the harm and emphasize why people should buy that product , like the example of cigarette . no commercial ever indicates that harmfull effect of cigarette but they show cool people smoking to show their product cool . finally , in fact a commercial is a biased method of communication . every commercial , either on tv or on newspaper is being produced or applies by some producer or manager . since the purpose of the advertisement is to convince the people to buy the product , they would reflect their bias at the commercial . however , even if they were trying to be completely honest , every person ha his opinion and people would reflect their opinion even if they do n't want to like a piece of art they are working on . in summary , advertisement make product seem much better than they really are . they can not reflect the truth . they are not controlled by the government whether they are reflecting the truth because it is impossible to check all advertisement . besides an advertisement only reflects the adventages of the product being advertised because of the purpose of the advertisement is to convince people to buy . finally even if advertiser wanted to be honest , it would not be possible because an advertisement would only reflect the opinion of the producer of it .
