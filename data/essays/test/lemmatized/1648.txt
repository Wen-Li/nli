i am not agree at all with the statement ! only a person who had never visited big city such a milan or rome - staying simply in italy for the example - could say these thing ! in twenty year there will be fewer car in use than there are today ? ! is crazy . . and what solution will be suggested ? what radical change will take place ? maybe to travel in the space or at least in the sky . . i do n't think so at all i 'm afraid . for absurd , the only way to do n't see a growth in the number of car of our city is to impose extremely hard tax for the owner of vehicle , but i really hope that the governement wo n't take this decision in the future ! i am a positive person and i think that we are in a period of wellness in almost every field of life ! every year , more and more people will be able to buy a car if they have n't before or to change their own buying a new one . moreover , many other strategical market will be avaiable and the number of place where sell car will be increase not decrease ! the example of cina i 'm sure that is a clear one ; the most popolous state in the world is forgetting bycicles in order to travel by car and to get the change of a new and powerful economic boom .
