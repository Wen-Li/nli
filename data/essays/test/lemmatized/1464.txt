i compleatly agree this sentence . maybe there are many reason why young people do not give enough time to helping their community . one reason because young people do n't spend much time to helping their community could be that they have to do so many thing in their own life , so they have n't too much time to help someone else . young people have a lot of thing to do in their life . first of all they have n't so much time to spend out of the school . they have to do homework , and than they often make some activity out of the school like playing some sport or they take lesson about singing or acting or somethingelse . secondly i think that when you are young you do n't think people need your help . when you are young you do n't want eny help , because you think you do n't need it . this could be a reason young people do n't help their community . finally it 's correct to say that there are also many young person who help thier community . but maybe they are le than who do n't do it .
