the issue at hand is whether understanding idea and concept is more important than learning fact . it is a very complicated issue since most of the educator claim that via learning fact student can get the idea and concept related to topic . i agree with the statement , since i believe that the main point of education should be understanding idea and concept in order to create new idea rather than only learning the fact and not to make student bored concerning education when they are constrained to learn lot of different fact . firstly , i believe that idea are more important since when student learn the idea and concept initially this will increase his inspiration about that subject . lots of scientist started their work only by considering the idea not the fact found before . and this made them to be open to create new idea . this is because when a person know that quite number of people had worked hard and could do nothing he would be afraid of dealing with that subject . for example , ramanujan who wa a very famous mathematician started his work about mathematics with a little knowledge , but since he liked the subject he worked harder and harder and found lot of many thing , and finally reached to an astonishing position in mathematics history . so by learning idea only student can work efficently . secondly , if the student do not have an interest in a particular area he do not want to learn fact about that subject and get bored and became unsuccesful . as a result of this he may lose his interest in all other area . then he may stop working to anything . this situation is inevitable since somebody like one area while others like another . for instance , einstein might have lost his interest concerning science when he became unsuccesful in primary school because of some irrelevant course . to sum up , we can say that student should be made aware of firstly idea and concept then fact . since by teaching fact firstly concerning lot of different area they can be made bored and can lose their interest .
