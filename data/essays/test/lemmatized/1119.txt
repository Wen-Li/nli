can you imagine an old lady standing in front of an really expensive mashine which had just destroyed her oldest book , telling you that it wa said in the advertisement that this mashine could clean everything without harming it ? this situation happens more often than you might think . often you can not relay on what is said in the advertisement . i have seen a good example for lying in advertisment in china . there wa an advertisment for loosing weight . the principle wa to wear special sock that force your body to give away the fat , in the television one wa able to see white sock before they were worn by a person , the same sock , after the person walked with them for a while , were completly dirty and dark . the advertisment said that this is the fat , the person ha lost . no educated person can belive such supid thing , because we learned in biology that this is impossible . this is an extreme example , but there are plenty of daily life example . a good example is washing powder , there are thousand which promise you to help you to get the dirt out of your clothing and to protect them from getting dirty again . and although you tried them all , none of them persuades you entirely . another fact is the outward aspect of good shown in the advertisments . there are a lot of trick , the producer us to put the product in the right light . for example a holiday resort which is , according to the advertisment directly allocated at a white beach , is in reality at least 500 meter away from the beach . the fotograph only make you thing that is much more closer . to summ it up , one can say that everyone should always be really carefull concerning what one see in advertisments , because there are plenty of possibility producer can use to make the viewer think what he want him to think about a product . and this will always be better than the product in fact is .
