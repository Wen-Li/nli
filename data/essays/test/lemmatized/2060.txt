in the 20 th centuary . advertisement drive the consumer selection . all the international company believe that good advertisement mean good sale . so they try to prepare efficient and exiting advertisement for the consumer . most of the company use the effect and also famous person for excellent advertisement . briefly they use all the way to show product much better than they really are . before 10 year the customer select the product after the advertisement and most of them dont change their first product . so thats why the advertisement were most important way for the company . but today all of the world know the advertisement lie . the customer dont select the product according to the advertisement . so in this point company advertise not only product but also company and plant of the firm . because today most of the consumer select the product according to the company name . today all of u know the danone , phlip morris , kraft , coca cola . .. etc . so this technique is also wrong for the selection to buy something . for example , i dont want to wacth any advertisement but sometimes i am waiting the advertisement . because company use the ferrari in the advertisement . and when i buy gas i am going to the shell because i think that ferrari never use bad oil so this mean that shell oil is the best , it is more appropriate my car . actually shell ' oil is not good than bp and also oil is more expensive in the shell but they use the ferrari in the advertisement . but last month i used the bps oil that incraese my car performance and i reduced the my monthly oil cost . so i agree that mot adevertisements make product seem much better than they really are .
