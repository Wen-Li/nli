i am totaly a greed , the history is full of the example which telling u that . we could think about the flying , using new medicens , etc . but i think these charachteristics exsisting not with every one , just some people who ha such nature . to try a new thing . it , s to entry in a uknown world which could be a harmful and fatefull . the entry to a new world need to have a courage , not only the corusity . we can think about the man who is the first one tried to fly ! he dreamed to fly , but that wa not enough to dream . he decided to do , because a they say ( to dare is to do ) what made him a great man , the secerifice that he did to reach his dream . or that happened so often in the busniss field also , those people who , s taking risk in some position , they can going very much longer than those who , s driving the traditonal or the well known dealing to them . as the stock market now , it debending pretty much on the risk in term of selling and buying . but we have to know also the risk and new thing not always coming a a luck strike , if i am a risker thats mean i know pretty well that a i could win so i could lose . the healthy society , it is that cocieties which ha a people of the adventure and risk , cause such act bringing alot of new experience and aknolidges to the whole society .
