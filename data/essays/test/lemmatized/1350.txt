i agree with the following statement that itis more important for student to understand idea and concept than itis for them to learn fact . the reason i thought that , this is more easier than it is for them to leatn fact , and also that can be using time wisely . first , it is more easier than it is for them to learn fact , because if i understood what teacher saying , and after the school i come to my house , and studyed myself easily , when i wa kid i do not understand what teacher saying and this is hard to get what is teacher saying . so i have to ask my parent and my fiend . if i got it before this , it wa easier than asking my parent and my friend . secondly , i can use time more wisely . because we can get more time to study for the other subject and also we have more free time than that . for exampl one of my friend , he wa always getting hundred and good at p.e. and i thought if i something like him , i could get better grade . but he do everything the other student doe he played and also studyed . and i got he were understood teacher saying and he just need little time to memorizing them . in conclusion , it is more important for studends to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact . because it is more easier than that and also we could spend the time more wisely .
