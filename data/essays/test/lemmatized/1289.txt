in the `` james bond '' series , the hero james bond appears to the viewer to be flawless . he inspires the viewer to follow his lead and mesmerizes them . well , these day , the various product have become the james bond of commercial . no , they dont quite chase the villain , or save nation , but yeah they can do a wide range of thing . like making your teeth appear really white , attract a thousand girl around you , or even take a test for you . well atleast they pretend to be able to do so . evidently , i am in favour of the statement . the reason for these kind of advertisement are varied . many advertisement corporation feel that the only way of designing a solid campaign , is to brag and exagerrate , which can be well remembered for a long time . it is the only way to attract custmers . the advertiser promote certain influential thing in the ad , when choosing between the brand . since the only link between the promoter of the brand and it customer are these ad , the promoter project the product a being on a higher level . i would like to discus some example . recently the perfume brand axe , ha published an ad in which it show that any man who wear the cologne , get instant attraction from the opposite sex . not only is this impossible , but also a bit dreamy . it is directed to the men 's desire . there is also a toothpaste ad , which claim that it can whiten the yellowest of teeth within a mere 14 day . a bold claim , but is it upto the mark ? nope . recent study show that it can only maintain the colour of the teeth , not whiten it . then , there are the cola commercial which are everyone 's favourite . they deal with a wide variety of thing . they can lift your spirit , make you pas an exam and what not ! studies estimate that a much a 30 % of the cola revenue go in it promotion . one must understand that the product a it is projected in the ad isnt a true representaion and must not be blindly followed . and also a little bit of exagerration on the part of the promoter doesnt hurt anyone , and infact add to the fun . so i think one must be a careful consumer and pick our brand and product wisely .
