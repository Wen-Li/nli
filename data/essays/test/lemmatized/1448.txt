although people can have different opinion , i certainly agree with the idea that it is more important to understand idea and concept rather than learning fact . i have following three reason . first of all , today , fact can be easily found in book or using internet even if you forget them . therefore it must be waste of time and energy to learn and remember the fact . i know that many information especially on the internet website are sometimes wrong . however if you know the idea and concept under the fact , i think you can judge if what they say in the source are ture or not . secondly from my experience , fact without idea and concept behind them can be easily forgotten and what is more , i could not be interested in the subject only with the fact . i took world history class in my high school . i really learned a lot of historical fact including which year the american continent wa found . yes , brief fact can help you like it wa found at the very end of 15th century , but i do not think it doe matter that if it wa 1492 or 1495 . after the final exam wa finished , i wa totally happy to forget all the detail fact . i sometimes regret that if i learned why they tried to find the new continet , i maybe studied more about the world history . at last , i would like to mention about japanese education . it might be widely known , that japanese education is focused so much on remembering fact . so what happed now ? many kid can not think by themselves . they can not build their perspective . anyone can not have their own perspective just with fact . we need idea and concept behind the fact for building perspective . japanese government became upset about it , and they try to change the education . i recommend the most important first step is starting to teach idea and concept to kid in the formal eduation . with the three reason above , i stronly agree with the idea that it is more important to learn idea and concept than fact .
