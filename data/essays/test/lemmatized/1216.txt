i agree with this statement that successful people take risk and try new thing rather than only doing what they already know how to do well . then why only successful people ? i think this is the point i want to discus on a a main reason . what make people possible to try new thing and take risk ? my answer is the capability . for example , if you are a poor casher at a grossery store and have limited money for living expense even though you keep working hour and hour everyday , you would have no time to even think about doing something new or creative because of the everyday 's routine and also financially you would not be allow to take any risk because it is not affordable for you . therefore , to make people try new thing and take risk requires the person 's affordable financial situation , the person 's flexibility to be creative to try new thing and the person 's successful background to be brave enough to do something his/her do n't know . the successful background here mean by the area of cultual and academic education because otherwise you would not be able to imagine that something worth to take risk will exsist in our unknown world . considering these reason , i will agree with this statement .
