the issue stated that will their be fewer car in coming twenty year from now . i disagree with the staement . i believe their will be an increase in the car density on the road twenty year from now . the first reason why do i believe in this is that increase in the employment oppurunities in the country . as the country is progressing or developing there are lot mulitnational company coming into the feild which give lot employment , making person sound financially , a a consequence people can easily afford car which will further increase the car popullation on the raods in near future . secondlly i think competition between the bank , which provide loan for the car on easy installment that will also encourage the people to buy more car . thridly i think the people density is increasing in the metreopolitan city therefore people donnot get job in the vicinity of their home and the job that are available are far from the home , therefore they require their own private vehicle like car to reach on time and cover up distance from the home to the work place . final reason for my belief for increase in the car density in coming twenty year is the competition between car manufacturer . to promote the sale of their company car , they are currently coming with slash down rate . this tempts people to buy more car . as i look back over the decade the car density ha increased ten time and according to the news report these company are coming with new straegies to promate their sale in coming few decade . i conclude my opinion on the above statement by stating that the car density will rise because of easy loan facility , for convience of people and coming uf strong copetitions in car maufacture market .
