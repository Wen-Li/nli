`` successful people do what other people do not want to do '' this is my favorite saying and i like to say it out loud everyday in order to encourage myself to break the limit of my confort-zone and to be a better person every single day . often i feel lazy or uncapable to do certain thing in life and certainly the belief that `` sucessful people try new thing and take risk rather that only doing what they already know how to do well '' , ha pushed me to my edge . i want to be succesful therefore , i will do whatever it take to get what i want . that is the reason why i am here today , on a cold sunday morning , taking the toefl . i could have decided to be at home having a warm breakfast with my husband in bed , but i decided to proof and improve myself . i left him , sleeping this morning , warm and lovely before i came to take this test . that is also the reason why i study hard everynight after a heavy class day . i always like to try my hardest and even when thing do not result the way i want them to result , i gain many positive thing out of trying . trying make me stronger and give me the chance to live fully and deeply . i think that life get formed out experience . so a many experience that i can have , the better i am , the better i will be ready for the future . it is always easier to quite or to be indiferent to the movement of life . but i always consider to be a good idea to keep on moving forward , even when you are not sure of where it is that you are going . work hard , do different thing , try different way , find your passion ! grow with life following your own flow . every little effort that you make today , will mark the difference between you and the person right next to you tomorrow , who might had decided to not to do what it took to get what he wanted .
