the issue at hand is wheather or not advertisement make product seem better than they really are . this issue is important because advertisments have great influence on the consumer . i agree with the statement because i think that advertisement make promisses that the product ca n't fullfill . the first reason why i think my choice is right is that especially young people do n't realize how they are influenced . for example a ten year old boy or girl are not able to recognize that the product in the commercial seem much better than they really are . they see only really fantastic and cute thing and want to bay this stuff right know . but when they have for example the toy they saw in the commercial child are often unhappy because the toy is smaller or broke up really fast . so i think kid need parent who understand what advertisement do to product . another reason why i believe that advertisement make product better than they are is that food seemt often better in the advertisement or commercial than they are . i tried a lot of food which looked delicious but when i bay it or taste it it wa n't really good . for this reason i think that people need a lot of competence to be not influenced by advertisement . the last reason why i think that advertisement make product look better than they are is my use of cosmetic in the past , influenced by advertisement . a lot of cosmetic , especially make up seemed much better than they really are . so for example woman in the commercial looking absolutely fantastic , have great eye , lip and skin . but the product do n't fullfill what people expect when they bay this stuff . in conclusion , this are the reason why i think that the statement above is truth .
