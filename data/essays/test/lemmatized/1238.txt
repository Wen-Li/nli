nowadays , knowledge is often the basis of every succes . there are many type of knowledge and each of them have it 's efficiency in the day to day life . in my opinion , all the knowledge are importants because each of them will one day in our life help you to figure out the solution for a problem or will help you responding to someome , or just having a discussion with someone . the aim of school is to teach all the basic subject such a math , history , biology . .. and then after when you grow up you start specializing in one subject , and you will use this knowledge in your future work . in order to manipulate a specific subject , you wil need a minimum knkowledge of many other subject , because all the subject are part of other subject . making the choice of having broad knowledge of many academic subject or specializing in one specific subject is a choice of life . i think we should have knowledge of everything , but it 's not possible . having knowledge of everything would make u independant and more efficient in life because we would be able to fix everything by ourselves . thus , we can highlight the fact that people whose success is the best are people who do some specific school like `` polytechnique '' . these kind of school are teaching to people to adapt themselves to any situaion by giving them the basis of everything , and then they specialize in a specific subject . this kind of formation give them an asset because they will be specialized in a subject and they wil be also able to do some other task and to manage people who do no have the same speciality . furthermore , having broad knowledge of many academic subject will allow to someone to speak with eveybody and to be interesting in every situation , and like i said before , he will have the capacity to adapt himself to any environement . but it is necessary to be specialized in a subject because you will have a main asset and people will recognize yo for this , you will use it in your work and this is the thing that is going to make you different from the other people . as a conclusion , i can not say which choice of life is he best because i realy think we need both of these choice . that 's what i am trying to do on my life . i am specializing in finance bu i also have many knowledge in computing and music and sport and . .. well i just try to open my mind and improve my knowledge on al the subject that i can have because it give me an asset , a specific thing that not all the people have . these kind of thing make the difference between two people who are just specialized in a specific subject and the one who have the same skill , bu also have many other skill . usually people will choose the second one for a job
