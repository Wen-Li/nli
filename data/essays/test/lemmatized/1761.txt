why should people stop using their car ? people are now used to using their care all the time . they use it to go to their work , go shopping , spend a day in the countryside and so on . the car is now an habit in our technological society . but what about the problem that car can induce ? according to me the use of car is more likely to increase than to be reduced . nevertheless i would like to underline some problem that car brings out . it is unlikely to see the number of car be reduced in the next twenty year . first , western people have the habit to use it and it is also a very convenient way of transportation . you are alone in your car . you dont have to wait for the train or the bus . you are asbolutely independent . for example , i often go and visit my husband 's family in italy . if we want to stop to visit a city during the journey , we can do it while it is impossible when going by train , for example . second , according to me the number of car will increase because car will be also available in the developing country . it is a huge market to break into for the car industry . there are many people in the world that would like to benefit from such a technology . however , there are plenty of problem with car and the maim problem is connected with the environment . vehicles are not environmemt-friendly . first the green house effect is increasing , created an important climate change all around the world . the climate on planet earth is becoming hotter and hotter . cars also bring pollution and noise pollution a well . even more concerning is the time people waste in traffic jam in the city . it ha been proved that it cause more stress for people . both government and individual may change the present situation . more law are necessary to control pollution . besides , people should be more sensible when using their car . in twenty year there will not be fewer car in use than there are now . on the contrary the number of carrs will increase a well a the problem to solve .
