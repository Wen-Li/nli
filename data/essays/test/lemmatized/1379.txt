i think that both understanding idea or concept and learning fact is important for student , but i think that learning fact is a better way to understand everything . in fact if you understand properly a fact , you wo n't forget it ! on the contrary if you learn a concept it is possible to forget it because concept and idea are too astract . when student have to learn something they usually read some conceps into some book , but they do n't understant properly what they have read until the professor doe n't explaine them referring to some fact . the more professor refer to a fact , the more student learn quikcly ! and professor are usually aware of it and so they explaine the lesson referring to a practical fact and not only reading to the text . for example if a professor explains how to use a particular program of computer reading the explanation on the text , the student do n't understand how to use it ; but if he support his explanation with a computer and he show to the student the program , they probably understand it better . but there are a lot of professor that prefer read the text without any explanation and so student do n't understand properly the lesson . starting from the fact to the concept is the best way i know to understand something . i am really sure about my position and i wonder how student can think the contrary ; i think the statement is not correct ! probably student prefer starting from the concept because they can use their brain and they can improve their conceptual skill .
