according my personnal experience and personality , i think that it is a happy time for me to travel in a group , such a sharing the happiness with your friend , helping each other and experiencing different culture , custom and delicious food and so forth . moreover , there are numerous benefit for that , i , just , put several good reason a follow . one the greating thing about travelling in a group is sharing the happiness along the trip . outside the home , we commonly enjoy the picturesques scene , hold the fresh air of nature . we are happy , each one in a group ha different experience about the wonderful trip . that is more , sharing the happiness is a major task companied the trip . another point worth mentioning about it is that it is necessary to help each other in the trip whil we may be in some occasion accident or trouble . travelling is not always a good trip . maybe one of my group be careless to hurt his/her ankle because of the wet road , doing a favor with each other is conspicuously important . at the same time , you do not feel anxiety and nervouse in a group . it is safe for you to travel in them . in addition , experiencing the extoic fansty and differnt culture , custom is an excellent enjoy . meanwhile , during the process of the trip , we also make friend with several people of different conturies who have the same love , travelling around the world . acrossing the aboundaries of the space and get-togetherring in the same place , we are talking , laughing and enjoying the leisure time . each of the trip in a group , more or le , i can learn from the more knowledge , experience and lesson of life . our group is like a huge family which give warm and kind for each in them . i would like to travel all over the world not to be lone , but in a group .
