personally , i think i am a successful person because i am rich , i have a fantastic family , i have a lot of friend and a beautiful girlfriend . in my view , i managed to have all these thing because i am a person who love risk . therefore , i agree with the statement . in fact , if you want to be a successful person you have to take some risk and you have to challenge your destiny , ability and luck . there are many reason why trying new thing and being able to take risk is important . first , if there is a risk in something you do there is surely a bigger reward . secondly , to risk mean to have fun beacuse you never know what could happen . for example , i like to play poker , since i wa only a child i have played this wonderful game and when i wa only 16 year old i have won 1 billion dollar by risking with two ace in my hand . for all these reason , i consinder myself an adventurous and successful person and i agree with the statement : try new thing , such a new game or new job , and take risk is fundamental in our life . trying new thing is always a very exciting activity that make people very very happy of their life , while , in my opinion , doing thing they already know how to do well make people very very sad . nevertheless , the use of your own ` know-how ' in routine activity may present some advantage ( e.g. a good perfomance or a save of time ) . but all these advantage are nothing if compared to that of trying new thing . thus , i think all the successful people in the world is the people who like to risk and try new activity and new way of getting thing done . in conclusion , in my humble opinion , trying new thing and take risk are the key to be successful . risk mean nothing than success .
