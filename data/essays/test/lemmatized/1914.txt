in th early day a particular product quality wa determined by the popularity it gained among people who used it and then had provided proof for other people who were willing to use the product . nowadays there is a trend to camoflouge the customer by making more advertisement and alluring him to buy the product , untill he find the reality after he us the product . to a great extend i agree with the statement that `` most advertisement make product seem much better than they really are '' .i say this because most advertisement are intented to sale of product rather than for the satisfaction of the customer . for example a builder provides an advertisement of a new project with natural habitat , easy transportation facility , playground to play , school nearby etc , but the actuall case is that the final product the customer get after completeness ofthe project is totally different . the advertisement wa more appealing than theactuall product . the motive behind this is to gain maximum profit from the sale . better advertisement also help to get a upperhand over their counterpart . to some extend i disagree with the statement `` most advertisement make product seem much better than they really are '' because , in this world of competition advertisement can not provide all the fact about the product and stand for the need of the people . also the brand the product ha acquired assures that exagiration wa not to get the sale but actual product is also providing the same effect in order to get the best profit and capture market product are advertised in a much better fashion than they really are . although the product of inferior quality may be sold because of this but the prime moto is to sell for the best money .
