i agree with the statement . there are lot of advertisement which mainly purpose of creating an illusion on the eye . most of the advertisement aim to create a world of alice for everyone . i think there are three reason of that problem . first , the company want to get all the effort spent on the item in kind of bulk of revenue immediately , in any way possible on professional life . this is somehow about ethic . however and unfortunately , firm operate in a basic manner : ` to get the maximum profit` . after all the effort have been spent on a product before coming to shelf of store , the firm are at a no-way point . they start to think that they should make their product appear in a more shiny way . this is only reachable when you show some extra thing on your product , which may be totally useless or though which may doe not exist . second , advertisement professional are paid for that . they should say some fantastic thing to crate an illusion on the eye of customer in order to attract them . if they only refer to normal specification of the item , they will not attract the customer , basicly . so the mad-mens , how the advertiesement professional called in late of 50 's in usa , should find some extra thing other than normal people can see or can utilize . this ha been a ethical problem since the industrialized day started . third , people tends to buy product which is totally different , fantastic and speculative . this is the trend growing among all of the society . therefore , the counter trend growing in advertisement industry is not quite surprising . i think the solution lie on the quality of the education . people must understand that they have to get what they paid for . this will be only be possible if enough awareness injected in the brain of young generation .
