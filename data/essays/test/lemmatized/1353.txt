`` will we still be using car in twenty year from now ? '' . even with the rate of devolpment in the field of sicnses it hard to belive that there will not be any car in fifty year from this day . maybe we can say that there will be fewer car in used at that time but to say that it will not exicst is only a blind hope . there might be a deffrint kind of way of transporting maybe like flying-vehicles or flying bycecles or somthing we can not even imagen . what i belive is that the mind of human reach another level of thinking every dozen of year because it found out a lot of thing that wa not avilable at the past so it begin to create a new way of thinking and sorting thing that wa inspaired from those invention . so if nowadays we have car we will surely will have le car by twenenty year from now or even ten year from now . these day we have a lot of way to cut down the number of traffic and car by bulding railway for traveling great distance , for the people who can not affored to buy a plan tiecket which will cut down the traffic in the highway and to decrease the rate of the daily accsidents in them . the perfect solution for the city traffic would be to bulid a network of subway around the city to provide it 's seriveces to the whole puplic which in a lot of way more helping then having a car , because i will not be burdened by the cost of maintenance or by the parking spot that i got to park it in. most people doe not hav eany need in having a car but for the lake of another way of transportaion they find themselves forsed to buy one . all that is only the half of what there is to say but in my opinoin i surrunder to the voice in my head that is telling me that there will be le car twenty year fronm now .
