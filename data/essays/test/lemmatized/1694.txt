when i think about my own experience considering car , i can tell that i already used fewer car within the last three year . three year ago i used to own a car and i wa living in a small town in a rural area and it wa necessary for me to own a car to go to school , to go to work and to meet friend . for three year i have been living in berlin and in the last three year i never felt that i would need a car in such a big city . reconsidering my own experience and argument that i will offer below , i would agree with the statement that in twenty year there will be fewer car in use than there are today . as a first argument i would like to mention that it is evident that the oil recources are going to it end within the next 30 to 40 year . since wether the oil nor the automobile industry show a real interest in changing their behaviour and their marketing plan , i assume that we will use all the oil until it gone and that in probably 30 to 40 year there might be finally a car that can be fueled with a new kind of `` gasoline '' . my second argument that speaks against more car is that i expect that within the next twenty year there will defenitely a next big scientifc development that will make car useless . i truly believe in science and the car seems to me a rather old and antique way of transportation and men will find better way for transportation than we have today . maybe nothing we can imagine right now but there will be something and it will not be a regular car . my last argument is the scientific proof that more and more people are moving into big city . recent statistic show that the rural population decline whereas the urban population is constantly growing . just like i did it , a lot of other people will move into the big city to study , to work and to live there . big city are attractive in many way and thanks to a sensible public transportation system one can easily live without a car in a big city . as a conclusion and to combine all my argument i would say that car are antique , the time are changing and humankind ha no need fo car who take a away space in growing city that get bigger and bigger . therefore i agree with the statement and would say that in twenty year there will be fewer car in use than there are today .
