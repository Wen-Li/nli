l'oreal , coca cola and nestle 's procucts are under the control powerful structure : advertisememts agency . those agency spend their time and money studying our taste and desire , what we need a opposed to what we want . do they usually success in their job ? do the advertisement make product seem better than they are ? at fir sight , i would answer that i trully believe that the statement is true , that those product are not a good ad they looked like on the press add or in the middle of the tv show . to illustrate my point i would argue that agency that create those advertisement actually know what we want and when we want it . they perfectly select their target before creating an advertisement and choosing the right time or place to show it . have you never have wanted this chocolate bar so much that you finally decided to go and buy it even at minight on a rainy december night ? but the question is ... were you deceived or desapointed by it ? the product could be le good than it seemed but wa it because of the advertisement ? as far a i am concerned i would answer that all is not of the advertisement 's fault . however , really good advertisement or misleading advertisement make the product seem much better than they really are . everything else is somehow due to the consumer 's mentality or desapointed desire . in the end i believe that the two really different type aforementionned of advertisement make product seem much better than they really are . for the first category , the really good advertisement , either funny or beautiful , there is quite nothing to do except maybe trying to change the consumer ' mentality , which mean the human mentality . for the second category , the misleading advertisement , rule are now setlled and country have to respect them on a national and a european level . as a consequence , advertisement will not be abe to lie but only to play with your desire , which can be controlled and limited by yourself . one should realize that advertisement are made for creating desire ,,,, and spending money
