i do not think that there will be fewer car in use than there are today , twenty year hence . the number of car in every country ha been steadily increasing since the time car came into use : this scenario is certainly unlikely to change . one might consider the current state of the environment , a a a major reason a to why car may become obsolete . the pollution caused by the emission of the exhaust fume from the petrol and diesel driven car is surely a major cause for concern . moreover , concerned ctizens may also say that the loud honking of the car horn increase noise pollution . however , in keeping with these consideration , car manufacturing company have started making car which run on electricity , solar energy or chemical energy ( battery operated car ) . these car , though still small in number , are gradually gaining popularity among the concerned citizen . the have been proved effective in reducing air pollution to a great extent . also , car with softer horn are being manufactured and law prohibiting blaring horn would definitely reduce noise pollution . though one may argue that with increasing developement , most city and town in many country are getting better connected by well-developed and technologically efficient transport system such a railway and airplane and this could be a reason leading to fewer car being used in the next twenty year , i fail to agree . in my opinion , these day , everyone want independence and space . everyone prefers to plan according to his or her own convenience . hence , the usage of car will not decline . if a person owns a car , he can live by his own timing . a car would provide flexibility in term of time . it definitely would provide more comfort and personal space . keeping these view in mind , i think that though the number of car may not decrease in the next twenty year , however , the type of car may change . the car produced then , would definitely be more environment friendly and technologically advanced and catering to the comfort of the individual .
