understanding idea and concept is crucial for student . however , this doe not imply that learning fact is le important for learner . facts are definition or statement that are real and undebatable . for example , we breathe in air to survive is a undeniable fact . ideas and concept can be defined a the explanation of the fact . for example , we breathe in air in order to supply oxygen to body cell for respiration is the concept behind the fact aforementioned . facts are important in the way that we have to learn about fact before understand idea and concept . for a primary school , if a teacher explains , even relatively brief , an idea to a student of how our brain control our movement , would you expect him to understand what the teacher is talking about ? would the kid understand those difficult wording such a nerve impulse and ion carrier ? i believe what the student will get is confusion . on the other hand , if the teacher start by teaching the fact that brain control all of our movement , i 'm quite sure that most student can get the teacher 's meaning . in a nutshell , fact are the fundamental knowledge that should be learned by student first . what follows behind fact are idea and concept which are also of paramount importance . once a student ha learnt enough about fact , the next task is to understand the idea and concept underneath the fact . these concept explain the principle behind the fact . students usually have some question when learning about fact , for instance , why doe our earth rotates around the sun ? at this point , when the student ha understand enough about the fact `` earth rotates around the sun. '' , it is time for him or her to learn about the concept behind the fact --- `` earth rotates around the sun due to gravitational force '' . ideas and concept let the student to have the whole image of the fact which is crucial for student who are studying . facts are important a they give a clear definition to student first a they are unable to understand the principle behind it . when the student ha developed enough to understand . ideas and concept are taught in order to give a comprehensive image to the student . therefore , idea an concept are essential equally .
