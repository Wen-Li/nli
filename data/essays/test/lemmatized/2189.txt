i love to traval , therefore , i positively agree that the best way to trvael is in a group led by a tour guide . because when travelingl in the foreign country , we might not familiar with the local cultural or custom and that might cause risk . furthermore , some place maybe too danger to visit , and by advised by the tour guide , it might decrease the dangerous . for these reason , i believed that join the travel group led by a tour guide is the best wat to have a wonderful travel memory . when i have the chance to visit foreign country , i always love to attend the travel group . the reason is not only it might cheaper than travel along , but aslo the travel agency can arrange the traffic and staying problem . besides , when i travel to a place in which i have not been before , the tour guide will introduce the culture and custom for the me . therefore i can save more time to do reasearch . take myself for example , i visited bali island by mysely last year . i spend a lot of time to do the reaserch . however when i arrived the island , and because i can not speak the local language , i do not even know how to rent a car , and it took a long time to arrived my hotel . in the second day of my travel , i went to visit a tempel , and i do not know that the temple is not allow to take pictrues inside . as a result , i have to hand out all of my film and i lose my good memory in the island . i think if i attend the travel group and there is a tour guide , then the tragidy would not happend . though people might think that arrange the travel schedul is more flexible and fun , however , my personal experience told me that trvael in a group with a tour guide is more effiency . not only we will not wast time and money on arrange the traffic stuff , but aslo we can obsorb the knowledge from the tour guide , and meet more friend in the group . to sum up , i do believed that the best way to travel is in a group led by the tour guide .
