in my opinion in twenty year there wo n't be fewer car in use , because of the society . with the phrase `` society '' i mean all of u , no matter in which country . i think we now get used to car for a long time and i think it would be very hard to give up such a important `` helper '' . many people ca n't image life without a car . a car make many thing in life much easier , or should i say more comfortable . you do n't have to care about bus or train and their sometimes chaotic schedule . the only thing you have to do is , sit in the car and drive where you want . many people may argue that driving will be to expensive in twenty year , because of the declining petrol resource on earth and the increasing petrol price . but i think the only solution for this problem could be car with other engine . i mean there are several new technique like gas or solar for example . many of these technique are already used . i think in twenty year we will have not fewer car a nowadays , i think there will be more . but the car will run from different fuel resource . many people in the `` western world '' already have car . in many family there are more than only one car , often two , three or maybe four . but in the eastern world , like china , not everyone or even every family have already a car . but they will have a car . the same will happen in many of the african country . every year the wealth increase there in a high rate . many people there will be able to buy a car in some year . i think this will be the reason for a increasing number of car , in the next year . i think nobody want to use the bus or something else instead of the own car , me too . ..
