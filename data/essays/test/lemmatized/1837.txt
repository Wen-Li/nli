as multimedia continues to increase , we can not neglect the great advertisement it ha provided for a wide veriety of product . nowadays there are commercial everywhere . products are now better advertised than ever before through tv , radio , newspapres , magazine and even on the street . however , the question arises here . are product `` that '' good ? advertisement ha ofcourse enabled manufacturer to display their product , whatever they were , in the best possible manner . lets consider pantene for instinct , a very significant hair product that everybody know . pantene ha displayed many tv commercial on how amazing it 's shampoo is . its commercial always display a young woman with the most exquisite hair anybody could ever encounter . her hair in every commercial is always long , strong , healthy and shiny . in a matter of fact , her hair is too perfect to be true ! i just often wonder if there is hair like that in our real world and in a matter of fact i doubt there is . that hair is most likely , a i can imagine , visualized hiar . it wa probably visualized thruogh a special computer program and then attached to the woman 's head in the commercial . why am i saying this ? it is because i have brought the product and several of my freinds have , yet non of u ha seen a massive change . ofcourse i do n't expect my hair to be just like the woman 's in the commercial , but i expect something from what they state in the commercial to happen , like having a healthier hair for example , or tleast seeing some kind of change to the better . as a result , i discover that the commercial of the shampoo ha really nothing to do with the actual product available to the consumer . here my argument begin . why are commercial so fake ? why are they too perfect ? has it come to the point that manufacturer are nowadays decieving people and lieing to them just to get a product sold and successful ? in a matter of fact , i do n't believe that commercial and advertisement are making pruduct successful , they only give them the attention requird a people become interested in discovering the product . once the consumer try the product and realizes it 's insignificant , the consumer will no longer think of buying it again . simply , advertisement have this power of making product seem much better than they really are but they certaintly do n't promise them success . it is a shame how far producer and maunfacturers have reached to lie to the public by making their product seem extravagant through advertisement . all they are getting in return is distrust form the public . people nowadays are becoming aware of the great hypocricy lying about behind each and every commercial . a simple massage to all company . be realistic , you might gain more success out of it !
