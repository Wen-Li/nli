people often say that understanding idea and concept is more important than learning fact . personally , i agree with the above statement for two reason . first of all , it reduce the time and the posibility of failure to learn how to do . in addition , it more last long to my memory than just learn fact . to begin with , understanding idea and concept is more important than learning fact . generally , the result of our act is seem to related with learning fact . however , there are more fundermental and basic proncipals in learning how to do . for example , when i learn ski , i did that without learning basic theory . so , i had hard time during learning how to ski . if i had a little basic skill or theory , i 'm sure that it wa more effective . therefore , we may conclude that understanding idea and concept is more important than learning fact . secondary , understanding idea and concept more last long than learning fact . we have witnessed many case that short-term memory is generally used to learn how to learn . if i learn how to play the piano , basic theory are very important . without this procession , even though we learn about conducting a melody , this skill doe not last long . in thas way understanding idea is more effective than just learn how to do . in conclusion , i strongly believe that comprehension of idea and concept in more important than learning fact .
