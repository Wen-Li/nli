i completely agree with this statement since many product never prove what they promise . everyone know how company advertise their product , you can hear them on the radio , see the in magazine , newspaper or simply open your eye when you are walking along the street . our daily life is full with advertisments - some are more noticeable for u , some are le . but they all share the same idea of their producer , - to get into our mind and remind u in case we need a product . since our ecomomy is so overloaded with company offering the same product , everyone is trying to sell at most . every company is investing more and more money in the production of a sucessfull advertisment rather than they invest in research or for the product itself . for a low value product , with no research expense they can fully invest in the advertisment , since this is the fact that make consumer buying the product . initially we dont care about the material used creating this product or how much time and effort wa invested in research . since childhood we are trained to listen to advertisments , therefore every company is trying their best to make their product on the advertisment a much appealing to u a possible , if we need this product or not , we still listen are see the advertisment . for sure advertisement are not always telling the truth or prove the test they have undergone to successfully lead in their range among all other product . this is the way company are competing among each other and everyone is adding more fact which are not true . thats why people know many product do n't prove what they promise in their advertisments . the simple reason why well known company are lying to u is in order to increase their sale to make the consumer buying this product expecting result they never can get . i see the situation is changing , company want to be seen a thrustworthy and therefore starting to invest more money in genuine research , test , to prove the expectation of a product .
