a group led by a tour guide is not my favorite way for traveling . i think this depends a lot on the kind of person who is traveling , because many people find them useful and practical . even though a guide ha a lot of knowledge , they are too strict on the itinerary and do n't let you focus on whatever interest you the most . i think this kind of travelling is more for people who worry a lot on timing and having thing strictly according to plan , but i am not that kind of person . i like to be free to do whatever i like , whatever interest me and come to my mind at that time . this is why i prefer lo lead my own tour , obviously with the help of map and information about all the new place i am visiting . another thing i do n't like about the group led by a tour guide is that you have to be all the time with the same group , and for me it can sometimes be annoying . i like to be spontaneous , and decide on the last minute looking at my option what i want to do . when i traveled to europe , with my mom , we had a train pas that wa valid for a month i think , so we could go anywhere we wanted and on the date we wished . we already had seen some place we wanted to go , so we booked a couple of hotel with the approximate date , just to have a safe place to stay . the plan changed a lot during the trip and we went place that were n't on our plan , amazing place we usually guided ourselves with the `` michelin '' guide that gave u the most important information . this wa the best trip ever , i got to visit many city and got to know many place on my own itinerary . i like traveling alone and based on my interest , i do n't like group or guide .
