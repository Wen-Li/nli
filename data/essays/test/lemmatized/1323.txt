i partly agree with this statement . i think that there are a lot of problem with fuel a the main source of energy for car nowadays . this will get much worse in the next couple of year . that 's why there have to be some solution to solve question of pollution and energy requirement . cars belong to our dayly routine like coffee and bread , so there ha to be something instead . i believe that there could be different source of energy for keeping car going , like the sun or even wind or electricity . if that happens , the prize for those new car would raise immidiatly to an incredible hight . so in such a time there could be much fewer car then nowadays , because most the people would n't be able to effort a new one like that . but i do n't think like this for a long term objective because technical development always become cheeper after a while . so after a few year our car , a we know them now would just be replaced by another type of them . another , i guess much better possiblity , would be to reform the public transport system worldwide . of course there would be a huge number of problem to face , but it would be much better for the enviroment and also for the living condition in `` melting pot '' like new york or even berlin . if there are electric subway and cable car available at each time of the day , a car would n't even be necessary anymore . at least in big city . also if it would be safer to go by bike through the street it could be possible to have fewer car in a few year . but i do n't really think people want that , because they are spoiled of indipendence with a car and do n't really face the problem with it . but i guess if the prize for a reformed public transport would be lowered and it could be a relyable alternative , then it would work to get the city free of car after a while . but that doe n't count for little village or hidden area somewhere far away from a town . because without a transportation possibility , people there would n't really have a chance to live on theyr own . so after all i think there wou n't be much fewer car then today . hopefully i am wrong and there will be at least different one , but i do n't believe in it for certain .
