i definitely agree that young people nowadays do not give enough time helping their community . in my opinion , young people totally forgot about their responsibility about their community . nowadays , young people trying to be rich a soon a possible . these are kind of television effect . their aim nowadays is get rich or die ! why i think television ha effect ? because young people watching watching much more tv and they are watching about celebrity life such a how they are having party , how big are their house , how are making holiday . .. this list may go so far . and who ever watch it impress about their life and want to be rich . so they forget their resposibility about their community . moreover we have one more problem ` loneliness` . young people growing up lonely and that cause big problem for community life . i think child should grow up with a social vision . this mean they should learn the importance of friendship , sharing something , caring about someone . in that way when child become young people they will know the importance of helping . and one more is about parent . their responsibility to show how te be a good , helpful and responsible person a child 's first teacher . if young people see a goodness from their parent for example if the parent visit some old people caring house , or work on charity job , young people will learn about their responsibility . on the other hand , there is one more way to be helpful for our community . young people must be a succesful student a knowing that they are our future . if they become succesful in their school , they will improve and change something in our country . and improvement and difference in our country will affect our community in good way . in conclusion , we all have responsibility for our community
