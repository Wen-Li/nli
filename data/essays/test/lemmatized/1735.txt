`` the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide '' . i strongly agree with the statement because there are several advantage for people to travel in a group led by a tour guide : a tour guide can guide the people in right way , how people see the entire city and how people communicates with others . firstly , a tour giuder can guide the people in the right way because he know the place well when compared to other people . for example , the famous place to visit , where to get proper food and boarding . so that the people doesnot miss the best place to visit . at the same time he take care of boarding and food . if people are alone in a place that which they doe n't know much it is always problem for them to get good food . secondly , this allows the people to see the entire city . for example , some people doe n't know the city and there is always a chance of missing important place . people spend a lot of money to travel and watch the important place and sometimes people even feel bad if they miss some important place . finally , it is difficult for people to communicate with others and understand their language . for example , if people travel to place that they doesn `` t know mean if a person is from andhra pradesh and if he want to visit a place say oothy ( a place in tamilnadu ) . they ca n't understand tamil so it is difficult to manage . this problem can be solved only if there is a tour guide . in summary , people can even travel place in a group with out a tour guide . but , i always prefer to have a tour guide while travelling in a group led by a tour guide because he is the responsible person for a successful tour .
