when it come to the advertisement , there is a controversy over the issue that how reliable they really are . inspite of showing the quality and feature of the product , the majority of the advertisement make the product seem better and not so reliable to customer . admittedly , advertisement play an important role of showing the product to customer . they introduce the new product to the people who are not familiar with the product . advertisements can show the shape , the color , the textile vividly to the people in front of the tv or computer , giving information and making a link between the product and the customer . however , what ha mentioned above is a one-sided statement . usually the information from advertisement is not so reliable . advertisements sometimes show the advantage that the product do not have . for instance , tea is good for human health , but some advertisement say their tea can also help people to lose weight , which will not affect the customer when they drink it . the advertisement always show too many advantage of their prodution to be reliable . furthermore , the advertisement often emphasize too much on one good aspect and do not say the bad aspect of the production . the prodution may have that advantage to other product , but it can not be suppreme , and it must ha some disadvantage . for example , when you by a car of toyota , it advertisement is always about the saving of gas , while the advertisement never say the speed disadvantage to other brand like ford . so the advertisement si le reliable because they only show the good aspect and emphasize too much on good aspect . to sum up , a far a i am concerned , the advertisement make the product too good to be consumed .
