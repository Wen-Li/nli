i disagree with the statement that in twenty year there will be fewer car on the street than today . although i disagree , i would like to briefly examine why such a statement could have been expressed . after that i would like to show why i disagree . first , a possible explanation for this statement could be that in twenty year there is a shortage of oil or the price are that high that barely anyone could afford the gas . another possibility is that the goverments make a law which set a limit on a certain amount of car in a country , due to environmental problem . the third thing i can think of is that the people themselves restrict their usage of car . but , a i mentioned above , i do n't think that will happen and therefore i can not agree on the statement . so this brings me to my argument that there will be more car in use in the future . i am expecting that the automobile manufacturer will invent new technology which are polluting the environment le than the car today . so there wo n't be any critic who state that using a car would destroy the world . another major factor is the increasing population . let 's assume that only every second or third citizen of china us a car on his own . this would lead to an enoumous increase in the demand for car . the third point i would like to mention is that more and more people own more than one car . i can tell from my experience that in my neigborhood there are a lot of family who have more than one car . even some single person have two car . one for the summer and one for the winter . i also have to admit that using a car is much more convenient than using the public transport system and a more and more people have two job they have to use a car to be mobile and to arrive at the company in time . all these argument make me think that the amount of car will rise in the next year .
