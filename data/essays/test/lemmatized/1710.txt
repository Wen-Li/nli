not only government but also all human being should give much effords to improve the their community . especially , young people because they have much more energy and oppurtinity than the others . i believe that the young people do not much time to helping their community . i would like to give some specific example to illustrate the why i agree this idea . i wanted to begin a program in my collage two year ago . there is no ricyle system in my community , therefore i set up a group with my friend . we prepared a progran that would apply . however , our number not enough to achive our goal . everywhere wa full of young people , in sport center , park , game field and internet cafe and so on , but we did not find assistant for our aim . another example that come in mind writh know is about social work . some food and clothes are sent from city to my country for poor people by government . i had to find people to distrubut them to the homeness peole but any of the yong people around me did not accept helping me . nowadays i hear some good news about young people who participate in social work . however , it is not enough to be able to change some advers occurancy . to sum up , nowadays , though they have too much time to interest in comminity problem , youth interest in entertaintment , watching sport competition and so on . i hope it will change a soon a possible .
