telling if people are more likely to be successful trying to do new thing or doing what they already know how to do well is an hard task . in fact , a lot of situation and circumstance should be taken into account , then i think that each person must try to find out it own way for the success . for some people , which can be called `` inventor '' , the success can be found only through the creation of something new , something that change the existing situation and the established way of doing something . these people are moved by a wonderful mind and are able to get a lifelong or even longer success , like edison and leonardo , and their invention sometimes are so great that are able to change entire aspect of the world . together with this kind of success , i think that there is another success that could be achieved also through the ability to be the best performer in doing something that already exist . in fact , the people that are able to achieve this success do not invent anything new , but just do it better than their competitor . on this topic a lot of example can be given for this kind of best performer , bust one among all the others can represent them : e. ford . in fact , ford achieved an incredible success thanks to it ability to project and produce a very cheap car that ha been sold all over the world , but he did n't invent anything new , just did it better . in accordance to what is written above , it can be inferred that , in my opinion , two kind of success exist and each person should understand which one of them is the easiest to be achieved in accordance with the personal behaviour . furthermore , i strongly believe that everyone can achieve some success in his life , but this imply he would be able to understand on which he should focus his effort , ability that is not so common .
