this is an argumentative standpoint whether most advertisement make product seem much better than they really are . depending on personal judgement , we may find that some people will agree that the advertisement make thing look like better , in contrast , some will not agree this point of view . the judgement , however , is hard to make . nevertheless , in my opinion , i think the the former statement is more reasonable . among countless factor which can influence the judgement , there are some conspicuous a follows . first of all , the main reason why i support the above statement is that advertisement make product more popular than the product which do not be showed on tv or newspaper . for example , dell is a one of the most famous brand of computer in the world . you could see dell 's advertisement everyday . and there is an unfamous brand in my country , which you even do not hear about it at all . now , you want to buy a computer , which brand will you choose ? it must be dell . but in fact , the quality of this unfamous brand computer is better than dell . so the advertisement make product seem much better . in addition , i agree with the statement also because the advertisement will exaggerate the function and quality of the product . for instance , a very famous cell phone company say that their new cell phone is very strong , you can use it a a tool when you are in emergency . however , nobody will use their phone a a tool . but people would buy this kind of cell phone just because of this function . in fact , the cell phone is sound a other cell phone . of course , sometimes advertisement are not useful . for example , a new brand claim that it is the best in all other same product . this will not persuade the customer at all . but i feel that the advertisement influence people deeply . considering and analysis all these fact , frankly speaking , most advertisement make product seem better .
