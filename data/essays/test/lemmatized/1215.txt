i completely agree with the statement . there are numerous example in history that show that successful people have taken risk to achieve their goal . one prominent example is the development of air travel . there had been numerous failed attempt by people at attempting to use object that enabled man to fly . but that did not deter the wright brother . inspite of the knowledge of the risk involved , they went ahead with their attempt . they were ultimately able to engineer the first successful flight recorded by mankind . that led to the development of the advanced system of air travel that we have today . had the wright brother not taken the risk there would never have been air travel . and mankind would still have relied on the old and relatively inefficent mode of travel . another example that i can cite closer to my family is the success that my uncle achieved in the real estate business . my uncle wa an engineer and had a paid job at an engineering firm . he wa a good engineer but it did not satisfy his urge to earn a lot of money and be successful . he started to invest some of his saving in the real esatate business . over a period of few year he wa able to get a good return on his investment . he figured that although he had benefited from the investment it would take a long time for him to earn significant amount of money by making such small investment . he decided to take a big risk . he decided to invest all his saving ( including selling some of his precious family belonging ) into real estate . many of his friend advised him against taking such a step . however , he decide to take the risk and went ahead to buy couple of good property . within a year he wa able to sell the two property from double it original cost . encouraged by his success he invested the entire money again in buy more property . in a span of 5 year he took major risk and made a fortune . after that he started taking very calculated risk , making sure that even if his investment were not successful , it would have little or no effect on his fortune . my uncle is now a very rich and successful man . he would not have reached his current status if he had not taken risk and had continued with low paying job of an engineer . the above example prove without the a doubt the truth in the statement .
