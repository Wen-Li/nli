successful people try new thing and take risk rather than only doing what they already know how to do well . true . taking risk is all life is about . the uncertainty of the moment and the hard work to progress are the key point of a successful person . if you stick to the old conventional way , there is rather a high chance of keeping rooted to the spot you are in and never move forth and progress . today , big business corporation and company prefer creative and innovative people in their rank over the only academically achieving . education is a must , but the brain or gut separate the worker from the achiever . the world 's most successful people today , were in the past normal people who just broke the runtines and liked to try new thing and innovation . highly risky individual are often criticized because of their outgoing manner and different way of being . keep in thought that even the greatests genius of our time were misunderstanded . for example , there is a funny quote on internet that say , `` only 8 people really did understand eintein . '' if the benjamin franklin had not flew his kite during a perilous thunderstorm with the imminent danger of being electrocuted , he would not have been able to discover electricity . actually , we would not be taking this toefl test on a computer ! most of the innovation we have in our home are work of the mastermind who ignored the odds . the airplane , the bicycle , the microwave , the television , even the light bulb over u are invention or discovery from risky individual . we live comfortable life just because others put their brain and creativity to work . and a a friend of mine say , `` the impossible is what still ha n't been tried . '' people who put it all in the line are comparatively more active in their social life and people enjoy their company . they are mostly joyful and happy all the time . most are successful one way or another , love , work , happiness , or enlightenment . who would want to be a conventional conformist ? being stuck on a mono routine is just plain boring .
