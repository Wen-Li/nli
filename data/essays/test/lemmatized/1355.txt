i agree with the fact that understand idea and concept is more important than learn fact . even if learning fact is something important , undersatnd them is really more important and actually very more useful . i explain , learning something is a processus that implies the activation of your memory , precisely , most of the time , your short-time memory . studies have shown that when you learn something `` by heart '' you will forget almost evrything after 2 week . except if you are very interested about the subject . in that case , it assumes that you have made the second step . .. : understand the idea and the concept . my opinion is that with the processus of understanding something , you will keep it in your memory longer and that is the most interesting thing . most of all it wa proven scientifically . for example , i remember when i wa at high school , i hated the physic class because the teacher wa n't very clear in his explanation , confusing , nobody could understand him , never . it result in an exam where people just learned the sheet , by heart . finally , now , i do n't remember at all what wa this class about . i thing it is a shame , because if i had understood the purpose , i will first remember , at least some part but also , i would enjoy it . because everybody hated this class and the teacher . conversely , i had a very hard and high level of ancient greek class , but with a nice and so great teacher . he explained so well . when i went out the class , i wa able to explain everything to my mother . for me , thing seem immediately easier and more pleasant to study . indeed , when you understand what you are learning , it is easier to study it after the class , and to remember . i really agree with the fact that understand the concept you are learning is very essential if you want to remember it . i sustain it strongly and think that teacher who know that are most of the time `` good teacher '' loved by everybody , even if the class is difficult . learners must also know that because if they only study `` by heart '' they will not go far and are more susceptible to get what we call `` the gap '' during the exam . . they will suddenly forget everything because of the stress . i can conclude that understand what you learn is the key to pas the exam and remember it . it is a shame to waste all these effort to just forget it after a few time !
