the idea stated can be very well concised to what is called a ` knowledge with width and knowledge with selective depth ' . this question is very much fresh and dealt very effectively in many part of society and academic . from my personal point of view , i strongly support the idea of having a specialised knowledge in a particular subject . that make me a supported of the famous saying , ` a rolling stone gather no moss ' . the specific knowledge a person gain make him stand apart from other individual . let u elaborate this with the help of an example . let u consider the ` nuclear progress ' made by the various country . it wa only possible because a person gained a knowledge in that very field of study which proved effective to contribute to the development of the most reliable and undoubted world destructors . a common world example would make the said idea even more substantial . when suffering from a minor fever or cold , a person can be satisfied by paying a visit to the town 's general physician , which definitely will not be the case when one suffers heart ailment and similar major complicancies . at such point of time it is only the expert in the respective field can help a person recover it . on the ither hand , the same principle is applied is also applied in the arena of academic . almost all the university all world over offer specialisation in various fileds . why do they do it if it is not required ? why do they do it if they can not justify it ? the answer lie in a ` no ' of the mentioned question . the various fileds of specialisation are required a well a justified . without specialization , the world will soon grow to become stagnant . the progress would stop and the people will have no better tomorrow than the yesterday they have lived by . no ailment will be cured and people will continue falling prey to disease that could have been cured if research and specialisation were given real worth . thanks to development in various area , that we can now look forward to the unexpected . even today , we are able to carry the entire computer system in a palm or believe that we will be cured of almost all the ailment we will ever suffer ! ask a question to oneself , without study advancing and you advancing with it , would n't you be still rubbing stone to light a fire ? believe me , you would be !
