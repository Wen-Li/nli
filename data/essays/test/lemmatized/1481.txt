i completely agree with this statement . this is because people today have a tendancy to onl ; y look at the bigger picture , not the minute detail which may be a , if not even more important . so , they easily get distracted by big brand , shinning logo , big promotion , promotional star and all the glamour and glitzy . this they do without understanding or wondering about the content , the real quality . so advertiser today take advantage of this fact to the fullest . they make loud advertisement , promotion of the event which not always highlight what the product is about but it surely ha a big star , big ad campaign promoting it . take for instance , the chip making giant intel . people today would go in for a computer only if it ha a ` intel ' logo on it . they do not actually understand what 's inside it or what it actually doe but it 's promotion is immaculate . people do n't even know there are better and cheaper substitute available in the market which will perform better but the unfortunately , since they have n't heard of the particular logo they would n't go in for one . another case in point is the world 's second richest man-bill gates . most of u do not know this for a fact that his ` microsoft ' empire spent almost 10 time a much on advertising their product rather on developing it . so , in what ha come to be expected in this world today , microsoft is supreme leader in it 's field again when better substitute such a apple , macintosh are available in the market but since these brand failed in promoting their product they are lagging behind even with a superior product . another example in another field would be the like of ` reebok ' , ` adidas ' or ` nike ' which though are selling almost identical product , but their market share vary . adidas with promotional name such a beckam , tendulkar , messi , maradona is the market leader followed by nike with toger woods , federer and so on . the only reason they trail adidas is not because their product is inferior but because they started their promotional and branding campaign a lot later . in conclusion , product which are sold the most in market today are not necessarily the one which offer the best quality or service but infact are the one which are promoted the most aggressively by advertisement , branding , celebrity . thus , an advertisement today is successful in convincing the general public about a product 's quality or ` greatness ' which doe not exist in reality and it also easily display the ignorance of today 's consumer .
