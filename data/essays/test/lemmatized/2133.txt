some people tend to emphsis the importance of learning idea and concept whereas the others like to appreciate fact better . in my opinion , i disagree with the statement that it is more important for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact . several reason can be seen vividly below . the most important propensity of my opinion is that any idea or concept all around the globe come from reality and fact in people 's daily life . only after fter a long and hard period of researching and discovering time could the human race gain the essential idea from what they are really exprinced . for instance , all of math fomulas people use today come from million of researcher ' constancially hardworking and continuously proving . without the close attention and appreciation of fact , may no one of u can learn the mystery of any apartement of science . so , fact are the main source of people 's idea and concept . in addition , we can say idea is a mirror before the real world . the meaning of what i say is that idea and concept accuratly reflect the appearance of the fact . if people also only addictate in learning idea and concept , they may lose the chace to appreciate the right way to make a sence on the natural reality . in other word , people may regard the right situation of the fact in a wrong way only affect by the negative of the limitation of made-ideas and concept . for example , a great modern chinese physic resaercher wang-chufei , which addictated in many idea of solving space gravity problem , state sevral wrong and rediculous solution to people 's viewpoint towards science . that wa a serious situation ! of course , a close appreciation about people 's idea and concept is usually helpful to our understanding towards living and learning , in my tend of propensity , it is more important and advantage to purchase a careful apprecistion about the fact . in conclusion , although both understanding idea and concept and to learn fact are the way to guide people 's living and learning , i tend to agree that to learn fact is more important and meaningful .
