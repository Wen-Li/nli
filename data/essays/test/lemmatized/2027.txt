i agree with the fact that most advertisement make product seem much better than they are in reality , and i am pretty sure of it because i am a graphic designer and a lot of time my work definitively consist in making something appear what it is not or what it should be to make people like it . appearance , in general , is very important in our society . most of all how people appear is fondamental . and obviously people appearance is based on what they want , what they buy , what they have . .. some of the product themselves are good . they are product of good quality , maybe handmade , valuable because of the material they are built of . but many other time they are not , and they are just presented like that . sometimes the food with the nicest pack is the one which taste a dog meal . .. but it is successfull because of it wonderful package . in fact the package too is a type of advertisement . the same thing can pas with a pair of shoe . maybe on tv it is presented a if it wa the most comfortable pair of shoe in the world , and everybody buy it . .. but after one week of use they break or they begin to be unconfortable . sometimes advertisemnts not only make thing seem better , but even different ( thanks to photoshop , for example ) ! it is strange even to notice that many time people already know that one product is not so good , but they want it anyway , and this because the most important thing is to be cool , cool , cool ! i think one of the most appropriate sentence to express this topic could be the title of a song : `` smoke get in your eye '' by `` platters '' . of course it wa referred to another kind of relation but the relation between consumer and the advertisement could often be expressed this way .
