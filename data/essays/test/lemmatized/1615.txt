everybody need a minimum of knowledge of many academic subject but a specialization is often required to work in a specific subject . the main problem is that it is difficult to learn many subject and to be specialized in a specifice subject because it require so much time and energy . in the first part , i will show why a specialization is useful and in the second part i will explain why a knowledge of many academic subject is important . first of all , company are looking for specialized worker because the labour is becoming more and more divided between employee and specialization are demanded . moreover , a knowledge of lot of subject will not be use in the work . remember that the objective of school is to prepare u to enter in the work world . for example , a student in international business will not need knowledge of biology ( unless he will do business in biology ! ) . in contrary to the importance of a specialization in a work , a knowledge of a minimum of any academic subject is important for the general culture of the individu . with that minimum , he would be able to exchange talk with differents person and be opened up to meet different and interesting person different from people at his job ! you could also get a twin skill diploma and that academic subject could create a sinergy and make you becoming researched by some company . to give an example , some building construction company are looking for people who are skilled in business and in building construction in order to sell their product . to conclude , we can say that we need both of them because a specialization is required for the work and a knowledge of different academic subject is important to be opened to other subject .
