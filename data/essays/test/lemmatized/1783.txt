nowadays , people are used to do a lot of activity when they are young . different country have different way of teaching and educating young people . we will thirst see that a broad knowledge of many academic subject is benefic , then we will talk about the problem implied by this method and finally , we will discus of the necessity of having a specilisation when you graduate . i think that child need to be taught everything . even if they are not expert on everything they know , it is necessary to have a minimum of general culture . this will help them considerably when they will be older . plus , in order to choose what they want to do , they have to know various topic , various world and civilsations and all the most they need to be open minded . however , some student lack motivation and interest in what they are being told . either there is too much subject for them to handle or they simply do n't want to learn . therefore it is wise to take these child to more specialized school so that they can fell le excluded and useless . it is often seen that parent , who want their child to be the best , push them to learn music , do some sport , to work hard on their homework . . this is too much to handle for most of the child and they can be disgusted by everything . that 's why we should try to reconcile pupil and student with some specific academic subject . besides , althought a broad knowledge is useful and advantageous , working people only use a very tiny part of what they know for their job . there is currently no use to know eveything because there are always other people who know how to do what you do n't . so why not be more specialized and have better worker on all subject . eventually , everybody could gather their work and contribute to the global evolution of the society . to conclude , i could say that it is better to specialize in one specific subject because otherwise it is difficult to find an interesting job and the more people specialize , the more job are created . that really help society to improve .
