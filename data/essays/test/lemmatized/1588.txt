i would realy love if it wa true . but unfortunatly , i do n't think that in twenty year of time people will actualy give up on their car and find a better way for travelling . it just ca n't happen , because of the way thing are now . and by experience , i believe that thing just do n't change that fast . except maybe if there wa a major invention for travelling . .. but i do n't see it coming . let me explain to you why i think the number of car wo n't decrease , but more likely , it will increase . cars have been invented in the arly xxth century . it 's been a major invention at that time . everybody wanted to travel without getting tired and just let this machine do the hard part . well , thing have n't changed at all . a car is fast , easy to drive , and it allows many travel that we could n't do without it . our society became addicted to the car , almost everybody must have one , for the social life life a much a for the working life , it is required . some people even have a few car now , one for going around , and one for their job ! i find it crazy , what 's the use of that ? what 's the point ? the number of car in the world ha n't stopped increasing over the last century , why should it change now ? the reason why car will still be there , poluting our atmosphere , making the wall go dark , and increasing the greenhouse effect in twenty year is just because people do n't care ! we are a very individualist society , everybody think for themself and do n't care about what 's happening around them . only their own happiness count , and they do n't think about the consequence of their act . our planet is burning underneath our foot , people see it , fell it , talk about it , but they do n't do anything to get thing to change . they always think that someone else will do it for them . .. but it is n't the case . so , that 's why , for all these reason , i think there will still be more car , a there are more people . as long a people find it usefull and in spite of the danger it represents for them and their community . people should start acting for the future , but i do n't see any change .
