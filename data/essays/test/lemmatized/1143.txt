yes , i do agree with the statement which say `` successful people try new thing and take risk rather than only doing what they already know how to do well . '' successful people by nature and riding on the back of his or her previous achievement is more likely and inclined to try out new concept and venture onto new and unfamiliar horizon . and it is more likely and logical that a successful person will try new thing than a person who ha previously tried and failed . for a person who ha failed earlier is usually hesitand and ha very low level of self confidence . he perhaps suffers from bitten then a twice shy syndrone . a sucessfull person will probably be one first one to try out new and risky thing . `` like everyone else spend some time and tinking about why some people are more succeful in life factor that are in success that are under more personal control then others '' sucessfu people might be integent . or have had socially wel connected up bringing . are e naturally energetic and open and positive . let u take an example of a game that some one is good at . lets u say that these individual ha masterd this game and can play it so wel . that his selmdom end up on that lossing side now let u imagine the amount of satisfaction it would bring to do this individual who ha `` played `` and won this `` game day '' in and day out . i would assume he might not be all that thirlled on winning it . since he ha already done it on `` numerous occassions '' he wuld not enjoy because now the gamehas chessed the boo any real challenge . he might and probably would end up taking some thing that appears more challenging to him some thing he can stick to . something he can succeed at .
