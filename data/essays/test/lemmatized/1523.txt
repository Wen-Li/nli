i disagree with the idea that traveling in a group led by a guide is best . i think traveling with tour guide doe n't make me grow and sometimes feel bored . first of all , in the case of traveling with tour guide , we do n't need to make a schedule or book the hotel . but these kind of effort make my ability of arrangement grow . for example , my job is examination to the bank , and i have to go to the province every each month . so i 'm required to arrange the shedule , like booking the ticket or hotel . at that time , i feel that my experience which i traveled in many province of japan for a month in my college 's day . at that time , i arrange the tour myself . secondly , traveling with tour guide do n't make me effort ot learn about the direction . in the case of traveling without guide , i have to learn about the direction to choose where i 'll go to see . the knowledge gotten through scheduling the tour sometimes help me . for example , when i analyse of certain bank 's business model , the knowlege about that bank 's business erea is required . i have helped by the knowledge which i got through the tour scheduling many time . thirdly , traveling with tour guide reduce the fun of the toravel because sometimes i can not go where i want to see . especially in my case , i 'm interested in the japanese castle and want to concentrate seeing the castle in my travel , but i have never found such specialized traveling tour . also there are many case the tour company affiliated with the suvenior shop and take the tourist to these shop in the tour . for example , i have ever joined in these kind of goup tour , and i wa required to spend half of the tour time in the meager shop . i felt bored and even affliciton . for these reason , i thought traveling without tour guide is best . it give me more knowledge , experience , and movement .
