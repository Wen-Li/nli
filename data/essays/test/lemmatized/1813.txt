i entirely agree with the idea that it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subject than to specialize in one specific subject for two main reason . in the first place i 'm conviced that it is really important to study many academic subject in very different field because it help student to be open-minded with is an important quality for the present and the future . moreover if we learn art , history , music , which are subject that are often outside our major field of study , we learn at the same part a huge part of our general culture . thus , if we know history or religious science , it can help u to know where we are from . by the way we can thus be more tolerant with people who have different culture and understand them better than before . philosophy is also a very important subject to learn even if it is not enough valorised in college . if you study philosophy you get used to listening to different point of view which is not easy when you believe that yours is the best . secondly i think that it 's important to study many subject because it can be useful later in our professional life . it is true that we need to be specialized to get a job a doctor or lawer or every thing else . however i would like to underline that today lot of people have to change of job in the middle of their life . it can happen lot of time in a society such a ours where the sucess is synonymus to adaptability . so even if you are a lawer you could have the opportunity to become a painting seller , for example , but this would be possible only if you have some basic knowledge about art . in conclusion , i would say that a broad knowledge is a big gift
