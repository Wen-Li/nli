i agree that it is more important for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact . many student learn a lot like math , literature , language , and so on . when they learn something , they need to understand how it make or can be like that . according to a book which i did not remember , a child who learn and understand idea and concept is more smart than others who do not . thus , student should understand those . there are two reason for the statement . to begin with , it may help student to make another new idea and concept . for instance , when student learn math how to calculate , it depends on how to do . some student learn fact for math . the student just memorize math form . however , the other student understand concept . the student understand how math form is and why it doe . they do effort to understand principle . it help a lot for student . additionally , their brain active more than other student . thus , they think very well so they make another way to solve math form . at first time , it is very difficult , but the way is easier than other way later . furthermore , student achive a lot of knowledge . when student understand idea and concept , they look for other fact and also understand about that . when i wa a middle school student , i just memorized fact
