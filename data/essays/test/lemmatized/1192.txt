i agree with the following statement . nowaday young people do n't give enough time to helping their comuties . i think it is so because young people such a me have a wrong model . when i see the television there are only a rich people that for helping their community spend much money . this is a good thing , but a normal person , that have n't much money what can he do ? i think that for a normal people is enoughgh a normal act . he can spend his time to helping their community to do a meal to the poor peoople , or simply to help a child to do a homework . every u can do a normal short act that it can change a day to the other . my granfahter told me that his friend wa unhappy because wa alway single , without a company . when i can i go to find them . and every one of they is happy to see me , a young people , that remember them . in my opinion every time that i do anything for a other people i 'm happy also for me . i think that if you help a person in the same time you help also yourself . it is same at the christmas , when you give a present usually you receive another one present . .. the helping is same !! in the last year i usually go to the hospital for meet the young people htat are le luck than me . i go in the hospital for 3 afternoon every week , i stay here for two or three hour and i talk with that who want . when i came back at home i think that i 'm very lucky . i have this think every time . helping my community help me to undertsan how much i ' happy ! that every my problem is nothing in confront to a problem that other person have . nowadays the young people do not give enough time to helping their community . .. but this isn ' for ever ! for every one will arrive the moment that undestand the important thing of the life ! in this moment the person will start to help the le lucky people ! i agree with the statement , but i think and i hope also that the thing can be change !
