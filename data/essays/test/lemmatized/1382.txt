sometimes young people nowadays do not give time to helping their community because ours society do not learn to the young people to stay with the other . many yeards ago the family wa very important in the young life of a boy , with all the norm and the responsability , but there wa always a family to teach the trou and false of the life . today in the big city a young need to bild up him personality faster , when he is only a child , because the city have not time for him problem . always there is not a meeting point , where the young can meet and do only the teenager . the young people need more attencion , because ours society is more busy for many problem but nothing think to ours young people . to contrast this phenomeno the young people take more distance from their community . for me is true that they have not time to take attencion to their community , because there are many responsabilities and nothing who ask treir problem . it is only a problem of organizzation , in my opinion , if a young people learn who can ask to the people , so he can take more time for them . in my opinion there are two point of wiew , the young people who need more attencion to the people because are the future , and the other the people who think than the young people never can take time for them . if the two point of wiew stay in their corner , they can never resolve the problem . they need to spik abaut the proplem and take some decision for the common future . some possible soluction are the use of school time for learn to the young people who can help the other , or create a space in the community building for the young people , for speak to their problem . in my opinion there is the soluction and only with the dialogue young and the other people can take a key to live together .
