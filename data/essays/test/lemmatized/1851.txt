i agree to the statement that successful people try to continue seeking the innovation . i have two reason to support my idea a follows . firstly , the phylosophy of market ha big reason for the successful people to try new thing . in case the one company successed the business by some business scheme or business method in one market . the other company will , without doubt , try to enter the market by mean of the similar business scheme or method , which requires slight cheaper cost than the one required by the original scheme or method . then the following company will increase the share in the market . the company successed firstly in that market will be obliged to change the method in order to survive in the market . in such situation , the company , which successed firstly in the market , ha two choice . which contains the change of the original method and move to the different market . the successful people try to change their style constantly , though it ha the different extent , since they understand the above phylosophy of market or economical system . secondly , characteristic of the successful people may have the effect . the target of the management of the company is eventually to expand the businss opportunity or business volume a much a possible . successfull people who manages the company ha the same target in their life . therefore , successful people drive the company to try new thing and take risk to develop the comapny .
