i agree with the statement and beleive that successful people try new thing . .. let u see how successful people are made . no one born a millionare . people have to work hard use their brain , realise their capacity before they venture out into anything , ofcourse there is also luck which play an important factor in everyones life . people might be all of the above but yet not a successful a them , the reason well simple plain luck . when somebody start out with a business , they have to understand and know what and how thing in their respective business is . they cant start off with load of business right from the word go . they have to be focused on a single thing in the start and then if they are successful , venture out into other area of expertise . one such person who come to my mind would be mr. vijay mallya , chairman of kingfisher brewries , kingfisher airline and a whole lot of other organisation . it wasnt a if he wa successful right from the start . he wa 28 year old when his father had passed away and he had to enter the family business without quite a bit of knowledge . his company wa in a loss when he took over and he made it worse a soon a he took over but he hung in there and made a profit after profit every quarter , he wa convinced , passionate and had a goal in his mind and it wa due to these factor including luck that he is where he is today . he learnt the hard way and became one of the richest men in the world . mallya initially started off with beer and water . he saw that since he wa earning so much why not expand like any other businessman and thats what he did , he acquired reputed alcohol company throughout the world . after this came spirit , his company is the world 's third largest spirit company in the world . being the successful person he wa he wanted to take a risk in the aviation industry . he started his journey in this industry with kingfisher airline which today is one of the largest airline of india after it bought share of air deccan , another player in dat industry . i woul like to end by sayung thta looking at him u know wy u shud take risls
