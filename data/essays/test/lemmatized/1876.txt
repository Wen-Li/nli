the best way to travel is to travel in pack led by a tour guide because one would enjoy more and understand the surroundings . one main reason for traveling in group is that one would have more fun cohesively that individually . if it is an individual trip , then who would he/she have to enjoy the scenery ? who would he/she have to share the thrill of the adventure of traveling . for example , when one go to skiing in canada , how would he/she enjoy the trip without people to go along and race with or just do it for fun . on the other hand , what if there wa a problem ? there would no one to help but teh group one is traveling with . another reason of having a tour guide is that it help to understand the scenery of the surroundings . what is the point of blankly staring at a sculpture if one doe n't know when it wa created , who created it , or what it mean ? for example , when i went to the sixth floor museum in dallas where it tell the history of president jf kennedy i did n't buy the tape recorder that explains the significance of all the picture or anything else that wa there . so i wa just walking around trying to read the subscript and going out of order . a tour guide help provide information about what they are looking at . the guide also help one not wander off or get lost . for example , when one is exploring a cave there are many passage to take not all of them are the right one . the guide take you through the right passage while you are admiring it beauty . all in all , going in a group with a tour guide help one not to get lost , understand the surroundings , and enjoy traveling .
