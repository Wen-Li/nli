i agree that most advertisments make product seem much better than they really are and this is very famous trick to attract customer to buy their product by making huge announsment in magazine , news paper , and tv show and giving free sample for customer . however , some product are not getting good advertisement but in reality these product are excellent . so advertisement are playing a big role in saling product . for example , i used to buy anti dandruff shampoo it wa good and suit my haire then i saw a big advertisement for another shampoo when i use it i was'nt good . in the other hand , some advertisement reflect a good image for the product and the others are not , so it is depend on the company and how much money they have to spend ot for this advertisement . in my opinion we should not look how much the advertisement are big but we should know the quality of the product . more than that , avertisements are very importante in producing the product and producing the quality of these product so it should not be exagurated or very simple but it should reflect how much the product are useful and good for customer .
