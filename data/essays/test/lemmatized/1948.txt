i agree with the statement that it is more important for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn the fact because of the following point . firstly , to understand idea and concept help the student to know what is going on during the study . one can do well and behave appropriately in the real life by using the knowledge he achieved before . for example , when a student is asked to protect the environment by doing little tiny thing such a throwing the dirties in the garbage box or picking the waste paper up when he is walking on the road , he should know why he need to do such thing instead of walking away . in this way , a student will agree and know how to do to protect the environment more effective than simply doing it . secondly , to understand idea and concept allows the student to discover themselves and to behave well . as a student in the primary school , he dose not know a lot about what is right and what is wrong . he need to model someone 's behavior who is around him . but what if the model around him dose not behave right either , such a fighting with others or doing the stealing stuff ? then the teacher ha to tell them that the one who is fighting or stealing is a bad student because he break the moral rule in society and the teacher will also tell them that if they do what the bad student doe they will be punished by society . from this situation , we can tell that the student will keep in their mind that fighting or stealing is not right thing to do for a good people . finally , to understand idea and concept provides more chance for student to serve in real life in the future . what doe it mean ? well , it mean that if a student want to become a psychologist in the future , she must learn the corresponding knowledge that connects to the psychology class . she will have to be trained a a professional psychologist during the study . for example , if the student ha to earn practice experience such a hypnosis and dream analysis , she can not do it herself by simply thinking . she ha to study how to do it , not only to see the fact that other people can do it . to give an conclusion , i consider that it is more important for student to understand idea and concept that it is for them to learn fact a my point of view because it let the student to know what is going on , allows student to dicover themslves and to behave well and provides more chance for student to serve in the future .
