they are two differents point of vue about the increas number of car in twenty year . first , on ecology vision , it will be fewer car in the futur . in fact car reject so much pollution than gouvernements and ecology association will try to find new solution or will create many tax in order to reduce polution . probably they will so develop common transport a bus , train or subway and taking plane will be probably cheaper in the futur . petrol 's price continue to increase because of it 's a rarelly ressource and it will be necessary to decrease number of car to limited the consommation and control natural ressource a gaz and petrol . but car manufacturer invest many money to develop new technology specialy to reduce gaz emission and develop new engine which use new energy a biology fioul or electricity . so people will change their mind and continue more and more to use personnal car . we can see in car manufacturer new car 's category . in fact , size of new this new category is smallest so need more car to drive people . the size of town and distance between both will be biger , and movement for professionnel and personnel environnemet will be more important . so it will be necessary to move more and more and to use many car than today .
