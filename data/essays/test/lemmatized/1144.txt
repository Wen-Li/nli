i do agree with the following statement : it is more important for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact . here are my reason . facts are a collection of past situation and/or activity without any dependency . facts could also be repeating event : e.g. a collection of date christmas day , christmas eve etc . on the other hand side are idea . they are time universal . ideas did exist in the past , in the present and also exist in the future . without any idea there would be no progress or development . our ancisters had the idea that the earth is round . columbus did prove it and explored a new continent . the horizon of the human beeings grow , some group lost their influence and power . concepts are a collection of fact and activity with a future orientation . concepts are can be possible answer for complex situatuations or can help solving problem . here an example : you want to remodel a living room , because the fireplace is broken and need to be repaired . a possible concept could be just do disable the fireplace and keep the remodelling cost low . another concept could be to replace the fireplace and spend more money . the student are the key to the future . the need to understand the fact , the situation the human race is in , no doubt . but much more it 's more important keeping idea / concept alive to go another step . the human race is challenged in the future with environmental change and resource issue . the climate is changing , oil is running out in the next 50 year . answers are needed to question like : alternative transportation , global warming , civilization . the only key to find the answer is to develop new alternative concept and creative idea rather learning the fact .
