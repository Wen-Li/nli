i do agree only partly with the statement that in twenty year there will be fewer car in use than there are today . firstly i think that of course through consistent technolgy development , new idea and way of transportation will arise . but i do not necessarily think that there will be therfore a significant decrease in car manufacture or car use in general . as new technology is always more expensive than old technology . therefore i rather think that there will be an increase in car , a more and more people will have the possibility to buy a car . because the price of car will decrease , when new better way of transportation come to the market . then by looking at the financial situation of many german household , we realize that an average german family posse one car , but would need more than one car . as when the father of the family is away with the car , the woman or mother need for example to bring their child to school or get to her workin place . but the mother could use other transport system to do that . she could use other transport system such a train , bus or bike . this would also have a good effect on the environment , a there will be le co2 concentration in the air . the pollution problem , caused mainly by the many individual car , could lead to a decrease in car in use . because the environment will be polluted more and more , the more people buy their own car , therefore could some people decide to switch to other transport system , which are more friendly to the environment . but not many people will think about such factor and prefer having their own car to be not dependent on time . however driving with car ha also it negative aspect . as trough the constant increase in the number of car , the traffic situation on motorway or in big city ha become a big problemin our daily life . therefore many prefer using the undergroung railway system in city and for longer distance will decide to use more often plane or train . as for example flying had been becoming cheaper in the last year and you save time and time mean money . therefore this could be a reason for a decrease in the use of car . but in general i think car will reain in our s
