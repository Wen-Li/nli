i agree that most advertisments make product appear much more better than they really are , i agree because every day we see alot of advertisement on t.v .s and read it in newspaper , it is actually apart of the marketing of the product and we always go and buy this product according to the adertisements , some time we find it avery good product but so time also we found it moderate or bad but still not so pretty a showen in t v.s or news paper . so advertisments is an essential part of marketing , we see in each company a big sector for advertisments and this sector chooses avery creative people who can invent a succesfult advertisments , we see also the company pay alot of money for aperson who give anew idea oe design a we see it is very impotant for company and their product . for example certain company produce cracker , usual cracker a all cracker in the market but it show in the package spiderman picture in his new movie and the cracker have spider man shape so alotof kid love spiderman , as aresult they love spiderman cracker even they do not like the taste of it sothis company buy very much spiderman cracker a aresult of intellegant idea or design . this for child but for adult it may be different , adult can compare between product and then decide which is good and which is bad , for example all deteregnt advertisments show avery resistant spot or stain before washing then but the deteregent and wash the clothes then become very clean and brigt , so only woman candecide which is real and which is fake . so it is amarketing problem but i thinkfor the advertisments to be succesful it must be near realityto convince the people and to be logic because we will by the product and decide if we will buy it again or no . ,
