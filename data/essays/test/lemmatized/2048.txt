nowadays , there are more and more people select travelling a their relax way , and the tourinism is greatly developed with a rapid speed . some people assert that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide . however , i think this statment is too hasty to be made . i think the best travelling method is various for different people . during the trip , some people want to go alone , while others perfer to travl in a group led by a tour guide . the choice is basned on their personality , experience and characrastices . as far a i am concerned , i prefer to plan the travelling by myself and go to travel using my own plan rather than to follow a tour guide . my selection will be greatly substantiated by the following reason . in the first place , an important reason for me to choose this statment is that i want to plan the travelling by myself . usually , before the trip , i will try to find some introduction about the destination from labrary , internet and friend . i will learn which park is most beautiful in that city , which street have shopping mall , and so on . i will even study the local weather , local culture and local special food . after such research work before the trip , i can draw a detailed plan based on my own perferance . in additional , matching the personal travel plan , how to strenghten the personal skill during the trip is also a significant factor considered be me . if i tavel with a group and am led by a tour guide , i will lost many opportunity to commnuiction with local people , because my activitiy scope are limited in the tour group . however , i think talking with local people is more interesting for me than visiting some famous building . i want to know the different life style of different location , and want to learn people 's think in diferent culture . i think the living memory is more important the the photo which are taken in several famous architecturs . admittedly , it should be no denied that travelling with a good tour guide is also a enjoyable thing for me . acutally , altough i did many perparation work before the trip , i would probrarily meet some unexpected accidence during the trip . if there is a tour guide with me , he or she can provide in-time help to me . on the other hand , a professional tour usually have rich experience in local , talking with the tour is also a interested thing during the trip . in conclusion , i do not agree the statment that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide . based on the discussion mentioned about , i think i can safely arraive my conclusion .
