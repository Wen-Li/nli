i agree that advertisement make product seem better than they are . usually the company use advertisement before they release the product into the market to introduce the product into the public and the public get attracted to the new product and feel that the new product could do better than older one . but in many of the case this estimation could be wrong . advertisement indicates 100 % result of the product . where a when they are really used probably the result could not be upto the expectation . and there are many example for this which includes fairness cream , slimming centre and many more . the advertisement of fairness cream is best example for my opinion . in these advertisement the product when used completely chance the complextion of the person who is using it andthis really doesnt happen . also the slimming capsule or centre do not show the drastic change when really used . their are many example for which advertisement make the product seem better than they appear . hence advertisement is one of the way for the company to increase the profit of the product . in some case advertisement cheat public by not showing the best result a shown in it . advertisement only make profit to the company but in no way to the public . according my opinion advertisement are no where good for the company to spend huge amount of money on them . so they are just an aditional expenditure for the company . if advertisement really make profit to the company it specifies that the public have cheated because no product give the result shown in the advertisement . the product usually doe contain the quality shown or displayed in the advertisement . adverisements just make the street and news paper colourful but nothelp in any other manner to increase the profit . so according to me company shouldnt waste thier money and time on advertisement .
