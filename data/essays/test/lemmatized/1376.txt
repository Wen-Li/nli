the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide . yes , i agree with it . just because if you traveling to some new place where you have never gone before , you dont even know where to go and you will be spending most of the time thinking where to go , find out the place where it is , and to organise those thing . when you have a tour guide he or she will take u to the place where all to go , because they always have organized shedule the thime will be saved and it can be used to go and watch some other place . yes , if at all unless people need privacy to go around with , it better opting to have a tour guide when you are travelling . because the tour guide will be knowing the history of those place where all you visit , so it not only visiting those place even you can know about the history . even when you go to some new place , you dont really know anyone over there , you wont feel that safe to go over all the place , so when there is someone to take you to all place you really dare to visit all of them . that too when you go with travel guide he will be having his own vehical and all of his own , so there wont be any sort of problem . the main thing is that you have many people in the group , most offten they wont be from the same place , so you come to know about many people and their culture . you will be having much more fun in a group than when you are seperate . unless or other wise you really want privacy to go around with , you can go all alone any of the day , it not really that u have go only with guide if you hire him . the other day you can again join them . so , i really think that the best way to travel is in gropup led by a tour guide .
