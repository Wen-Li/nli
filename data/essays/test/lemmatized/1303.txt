as we all know and see in our daily life , some people are somehow more successful than others in various thing . this fact ha many reason such a studying more , concentrating and focusing to the right point , searching freely and intensively and investigating with full energy and time . but should n't we also consider that they try new thing and take risk rather than only doing what they already know how to do well ? according to some point of view , successful people are the one , who achieve thing well , which are familiar to them . in that way , they could get professionalized and specialized in one subject and get more and more practical each time . as an example , we can consider a baker who bakes the same kind of bread every morning . it ca n't be denied that he could become better in it , in comparison to other baker , who bake different cooky or cake each day . although there are view that people should often try what they already know , in my opinion this wo n't contribute to real success . if people try new thing , face with different alternative problem and situation each time , this make him/her more experienced . sometimes there may be few difficulty in finding out new information or doing unfamiliar thing , but soon this can be got over . it is important to mention that people who take risk , adjust to the various alternative and situation more easily . so , this could help in urgent situation . let 's assume a firm that is in bankruptcy situation . it could n't go on with it current goal and strategy . so , it need to continue with new plan and orientation . for this , open minded and successful people are reqired and these people should be able to get risk and become used to find new way . what can be concluded from these fact is that successful people are the one , who are open to new alternative and tryings , because the real success , a they know , is to confront with changeable and unstable variation instead of sticking to one familiar point . in retrospection to what i said , i agree that successful people try new thing without frustration , even if some risky event may occur from time to time .
