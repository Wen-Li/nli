i agree with the statement . because if you worry about to follow the way everybody doe , there were not improvement of our life . the great inventor thomas edison always thought about new thing and expalimented his idea . he exparienced lot of failure . young edison burened out his father shed . his inside train labatory cut fire . most of people laughed at him a a idiot . but his motivation to charange new thing would not dry out . now we enjoy lot of gift from his invention . without stable electoricity , telephone system and more , our everyday life would be tougher . not only edison is the new starter , there are many business came out and make our life delightfull . for example , starbuck 's coffee is the good examlpe . i can not imagin if there are no coffee shop like starback 's . many people start the day with coffee . the cup of coffee often make people 's spirit up . when this business first started , maybe there were risk of failure rather than success . because of the new business , nobody know how well to do . but now , nobady doult it success . so i agree with charanging new thing and making new world .
