i am going to explain why i am agree whit this sentence . i think that the spreading out of the wealthness through the world , however through the rich part of the world , cause a decreasing of the attention of the young towards the necessity of the other people . they would have all in a little time and they are not able to make anothers effort in order to help the others . at the time being young take more and more time to whatch television set and therein they inspire their behaviour from tha characthers that they see at the program on tv . therefore they have bad sample . thus is conceivable that they do not mind for the other peolple that might have some necessity . the young peolple are stronger than the older , they are also both more excitated and more eager than the older and maybe for these reason thay do not know the requirement of the olders . the problem is that the young do not to know that helping the other people , especially that person that carry on some importants disease , it is not a difficult and heavy requesting a they believe . the dynamic of the people s life is changing too fast and so all the young use their feature to raise up their social degree rather than help other people . they prefer having a swim or do some sport or also meet some friend . younger want to increasing own skill and to achieve , for example like a univesity degree , what they aim and all these reason explain why young have not enough time to do community action .
