i disagree with the idea that it is more important for student to understabnd idea and consepts than it is for them to learn fact . there are three major reason for this . first , learning fact is the first step of study and idea or consepts are based on these fact . thus , if student did not learn fact well , they can not develop theoir thought . for example , we can not understand historical context without historical fact . after studying historical fact and memorizing them , student barely start to notice the significance of historical event . basically important concept are based on fact discovered by early scholar . after learning fact well , it make easier for student to understand idea and consepts . second , student are in the process of learning , so it is difficult for most of them to understand idea and concept . even if they can , they tend to go wrong direction . facts are easy to teach and learn for both teacher and student . as a matter of fact , teaching idea by low-level educator is a harm because student believe wrong thing . although understanding idea and consepts are significant , fact are more important in term of level of education . third , the present education system work well teachin fact for student in the first place . according to the psychological study conducted by the unesco , the most important thing for child to develop their ability to study fact by reaching the level of memorization . it is natural step to develop each student ability , so current educational system consider it important for them to teach fact . we do not change this system and jump onto abstract idea . to sum up , i consider learning fact to be more important than understanding idea . learning fact are beneficial for student to .
