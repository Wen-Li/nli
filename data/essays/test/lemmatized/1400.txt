althogh both learing by experience and studying pricipals of the subject are significant part of learn fact , i agree with that understanding idea is more important for academic situation . fistly , studying idea and concept are effecticve for learing , beacause it support to distinguish the fact . for examlpe , if i searched endangered alpine plant during hiking a mountain , i could not find which is the specific family of the plant . moreover , by previous investigation for the plant is anable to me where i should go . therefore , understanding the concept should be centered . secondly , comprefension of ida and concept are crucial for develop our knowlege . for instance , when i research endangerd alpine plant without seeking information of the fact which already discovered , i would waste of my time and fureser reaching to consider the cause of extinction . because the fact is so largthus , understanding idea is advantageous for learning , since this advanced study allows u not only recognize the fact but aslo make progress of learning fact . consequently , i definitely think that if it were not understanding fundermental of each area , the study would be insufficient .
