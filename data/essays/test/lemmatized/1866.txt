i will become a manager , i 've decided to work in many differents structurs , with different people , so i agree with this statement for a lot of reason . first i 'm young and i do n't know what i will like to do in twenty year for exemple . i do n't reckon we can kept the same passion during his all life . so i prefer being generaliste than a specialist , because i want to be able to change my job when i desire . having the choice of our futur is essential to my mind . moreover in my point of view the society is very complex now . before we could be a specialist and sudy a probem with only one academic subject . but now evry situation require different competence . when i learned sociology , we learned politic and psychology too . when a student today want to become a scientifics specialized in biology for exemple , in fact he must learn mathematic and other academy subject . the real question would be able to be : what is a specialist now ? are specialist exist really ? i think not . besides the work in team , that increasing now , demonstrate the fact that we ca n't be only a specialist . i would added that i reckon the specialization is an ennemy for the democracy . in my point of view it can decrease the link between every citizen . because everyone close himself in a specific subject and forget other citizen . furthermore i think that we can forget the value of the other science , so we would criticised the work of the others . in a world where the racism is so important , the link between each citizen is a very huge goal for our future .
