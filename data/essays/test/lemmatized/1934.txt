what are the future of a whole entire world ? fewer car or the totally lost of car ? we do n't think to a world without any car or with fewer car ! the car have changed the life of all in the world ! in past it have canged my life and i think that will change my life even in the future . and the only thought that in twenty year there will be fewer car in use than are today will be a good started to the development of another way to trasport . with the advantage of aeroplane and it diffusion toward the people in the world , the car wo n't be the first way to trasport for the people who can catch the aeroplane easily and can trasfer themself quickly to one place to another without any problem . if in twenty year there will be fewer car in use that today this will be a good traguard for the world in term of inquinacy . fewer car mean le smog in the city and in the country and this mean a major healthy for the people who live this world . even major healthy for the people , either major healthy for the nature . with le smog , we will can reduce the hole in the `` ozono `` and that will can influence the weater in the world . after the removal of this problem , it can , a a conseguence , remove any other problem like the increasing of a level of water in the ocean caused from the glacier . fewer car in use will be a good decision and a good development of a thecnology that can improve the quality of life even for the people who liv this world , either for the healthy of the world . it will be a good pas toward a major future . that 's the why i agree .
