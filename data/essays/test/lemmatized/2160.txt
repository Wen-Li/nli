nowadays , it is a set of shared belief to think about our planet a a place impossible to live and to breath . the main cause is , without a shadow of doubt , problem pollution that enviroment produce . cars seem to be in everyone 's immagination depicted a one of the prime cause . in my opinion i think that our society will not be able to reduce the number of car for so many reason that it would take much time to describe all of them . first of all , among all these reason there is a particular way to consider car themselves . i believe that car have convey special to people . nowadays , car are become more than the function they absolve . it is common of every one to think about a car a something that exeeds the function to be a mere way of transporting people . cars seem to resamble to an object which convey to other people something more . cars show to people who we are . an example of this is certanly represented by showing our economical possibility . thus , it would be difficult to depict the next future depriving people from this particular and pleasant object . from the stand point i am adopting i believe that the more will we will have to follow fad spreading throughout the world the more car will have being produced in order to belong to a specific current of thought or fad . on the other hand , i wish that those caratteristics that car are made of will be substitute with some others that will allow u to breath clean air avoiding health problem . i read an intresting article about new source for supplying the next `` petrol desmise '' . these researcher have dimonstrated that alternative clean source such a rewable hydrogen will be able to reconvert car production in a way sustainable for people 's health . the problem , fron this point of view , is not to be concerned about how many car our society will have in the next future . i believe that the real problem will deal with which material and which energy they will use .
