i agree with the statement that most advertisement make product seem much better that they really are . this is because many company want people to buy good more and more , so they emphasize their good 's aspect excessively and at the same time , they hide their disadvantage of good . these following three example are often be seen and decieve people precise judgement . the first example is about contact lens advertisement . the story is that the girl who were wearing glass were always disregarded by men but when she changed wearing from glass to contact lens , suddenly the girs became popular among men . of couse , all people do not become popular when they stop wearing glass and change to contact lens . this is kind of excessive advertisement . the second example , in some canndies or chocolate package , very fresh fruit are discripted but in the fact most of canddies or chocolate do not contain such real derisious fruit and instead , they contain psuedo-fruits taste . that also tell a lie for consumer . the thrid example is lottely cm that the man who wa poor tried to buy lottely and then he got the no.1 prize and he became richer . he now life in castle and hire helper and eats stake everynight claming `` i could become happier . '' to tell the true , it is almpst impossible to get no.1 prize , but the lottely company exprain a if we can get no.1 easily . in conclusion , i showed three paticuler example but each field of company exaggerates their commodity in order to try to pay attention u and to encourage our consumption .
