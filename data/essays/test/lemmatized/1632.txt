i disagree with the statement a the advertisments make the product seem much better than they really are . because their is number of reason to support my opinion these are the following . first the main aim of the advertisement ( advs ) to acknowledge the consumer regarding the particular product . as the sole aim to produce an item or the product is to earn the revenue from that , for this purpose the product should be sale and for this the consumer will be aware thus the advs will be done . second their is the norm or law or guidlines that should be followed when the process of manufacturing wa going on . so the quality will be depends upon the norm made by the regularity authority not by the particular manufacturer although their is the minimum limit to check the quality and hence all the product from the different manufacture should have that charcteristics a written in the norm . third the purpose of the advs is to accelerate the sale of the product and compete with the same product produce by the different manufacturer , for this reason the advs mainly done a to show how superior their product w.r.t. another . fourth the advs sometimes show the effect of the product after using the same to stimulate the consumer but all the consumer may not get the same effect , it does'nt mean that the product having the inferior quality . for example it may be possible that the product does'nt suit your skin in case of skin preparation while show a good effect on the others . in all i say that the advertisement is the mode of communication between the manufacturer and the consumer , it is neccessary for the company to sustain or compete with the market contender . so it is not meant for the make product seem much better than they realy are .
