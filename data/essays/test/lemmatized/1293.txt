`` life is a risk '' , a very common saying heard . successful people try the same thing but with a better and clear prospective . they continue to do what they know well but again they also take risk . . for example the l n mittal - arcelor take over risk loss tata group - nano relaince with reliance fresh which deal in selling vegetable at a lower price and better quality . although i strongly agree that successful people try new thing a well a take risk rather than doing what they already know how to do well . risk help you to expand business an help you gain a broader horizon that lead to new and better opportunity to grow and become sucessful but however the mark of risk always remains . for example richard brason ha been an extremely successful man taking risk both personally and professionally . he satrted with a music company then going on to join hand with virgin group , airlines and now moving forward to space . taking a risk of entering into avaition industry without any training or knowledge in the field created a unique place for him . he took high risk adventure like ballon flying without having any professional training in it . another example of successful people would be ratan tata who lived upto his promise of coming out with a person car a he had promised . it wa a great achievement though he wa in the same field . he successfuly completed the project of making nano for le than $ 250 . he made a four wheeler which accomodates 5 people a any other car would . it is gaining much appreciation a it is going to give tough competition to wheeler on the road . the example just dont end but with these there are many other successful leader who continue to do what they in thier own caliber but not stopping them from taking risk at any point of time .
