the speaker contend that a the time pass the number of car would decrease . i agree with this statement and their are many factor which contribute to this . for example shortage of petroleum , rising petroleum price , pollution , rise in the rate of car and material used to manufacture a car . the shortage of petroleum is the main factor in decreasing the number of car . as the economy of each country is increasing their is more demand of petroleum , and a there is only a limited amount of petroleum product in earth the day will come when all the petroleum reservs will become empty . this thing also result in the price rise of petrol which is due to demand and supply principal , which can be easily noticed in nymex where last month petroleum wa trading about 78 $ / barrel and three year before it wa trading about 54 $ / barrel . scientist are also looking for alternate option such a natural gas which will also finish one day and ethanol which is not practical uptil now . price rise will make the people to look for other option to do their journey for example cycle and electric train which eventualy will cause decrease in number of car . pollution is other main factor . pollution ha caused a major sense of worry to all the people of world for example global warming , poisnous gases and acid rain are very hazarduous and have a devasting effect of human being . all these thing have made human bit cautious and they are trying to discard different bad thing and car ( produce pollution ) is a part of that . due to different institution such a who , people now understand how the pollution will hamper them and their offspring . so , they will try to discard car or at least limit themselves in using them . they might use cycle to do their journey which is also useful to the body . rise in the price of car ha also limit the buying power of the people . as the natural resource are becoming short day by day , the value of those resource will increase day by day for example iron , aluminium etc , that will limit the buying capacity of the consumer . furthermore , a the arrival of new generation we might see super train , elecrical bus etc which are more conveneant and are cheap also . in conclusion , the shortage of petroleum , pollution , rise in price of car , and advent of new generation with super fast train , electrical bus ha impede the potential customer from buying the car and i suppose that after 20 year from now there will be no car .
