successful people always exist a a group of elite . common people worship them and regard these successful people a their role model to follow . however , why can these unique people suceed ? are they more likely to try new thing and take huge risk or they only focus on their own expertise ? people have been arguing this case for a long time , but they have not been able to reach a consensus . nowadays , a the pace of modernization becomes faster and people 's mind open wider , we can view this particular issue form diffrent angle . personally , i agree the idea that succesful people do what the others afraid or not awared to do . every feasible decision or statement is based on rational reason . the first and foremost , successful people can discover the opportunity better . in this competetive society , chanllanges come with opportunity . it is not exaggerated to say that you can find great opportunity in every domain . however , the problem is , people are not really sensitive to the appearence of chance . successful people are diffrent . they are diffrent only because they can catch the chance and make a good use of them . bill gates is a great example . he saw the great potential of computer industry and deligently worked with this . he sacrificed his academic career in order to focus on his buisness . as a consequence , he ha become successful . therefore , succesful people are the group of people who can find opportunity and bravely try to achive their goal . moreover , successful people are usually intelligent enough to see the great profit behind the risk . they usally have magnificent understanding in some specific region . hence , their knowledge provides them courage to take the risk . the example of napolean o convincible . he wa a genius in military region . it is not an overstatement to say that he is the greatest military leader of all time . because of his ability , he wa able to see the flaw of his enemy so that he could made audacious strategy , and sometimes , those were unprecendented , to attack his enemy . generallys peaking , it is their talent that make succcesful people become so creative and fearless . lastly , successful people usaully have better mental qulities to withstand their audacious decision . this mean that they are more mentally-durable than common people . statatistics show that the ceos of big company are more prone to be calm and sustainable . a direct consequence of that is they are more likely to try brand new thing and be brave . thus , can win the hidden profit after taking the risk . in conclustion , after thorough consideration , i belief that it is more sagacious to say that successful elite are more likely to try new experinces and make risky decision . this ha been substantiated by listing several reason , including their senstive awarness to opportunity , intelligence and mental toughness .
