advertisements , exsiting every where , flood into our modern life silently . thus people are annoyed by invading of diverse advertisments , moreover , advertisement , mostly , misleading people by widening the function of product . from a ordinary customer 's persective , most advertisement provde u many error information which do not correspond to their real situation . for example , in the area i live in , the shoping mall often make huge outdoor advertisment advocating that it would send lot of cash return for cutomers . many people go to the mall , and perchase different kind of good . finally , when they are expecting the return promised in the advertisement , the mall is always giving another explaination which is so flexible that people can not find a convicing way to refute . sometimes , advertisement are democrated by the producer elaborately , and cutomers are attracted by their persuading appearance . one month ago , i saw a telephone advertisement in the television . the multi-function of the cell phone caught my heart immediately . as the introducement of television , this cell phone ha the powerful function of camero and vidieo , and the most impressive is that the advertisement make a clear and complete exposition about the funtion in the television . consequently , i broght it and found that it is not like the said of the advertisement . in fact , we could not live without advertisement because we need the information they provide to pick u what we really want to buy , which save lot of time and energy . however , we find it hard to tell how about the product after interfereing by the advertisement because they usually widen the form or function of the product . my mum 's experience is one instance . last week , she planed to buy a sweater . she saw the advertisement of one brand woolen sweater and wa attracted by the low cost . after she brought it , she found that this sweater contains only 30 % woolen . i have to admit that advertisement play crucial role on our life . yet , they also have harmful effect on our life becuase of their false .
