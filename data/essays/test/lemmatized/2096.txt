the advertisement are playing a major role in today business . there are many company that attract the people with their advertisement . the people were getting very much attracted to the advertisement . some of them may be really good and most of them are not . i agree with the statement that `` most of the advertisement are making the product seem much better than they really are '' . there are many reason to support my idea . one of them is many people get impressed by seeing an advertisement of voltage stabilizer stating that it can withstand any voltage but after few day usage when high voltage are passed it fails to withstand resukting in a damage to a refrigrator or a television . secondly , i want to give an example that happened in the country of my domain . my friend named john buyed a bike by watching a television advertisement saying that the bike run hundred kilometer per litre petrol . after some day of ridig the bike he found it is just running sixty five kilometer per litre . thirdly , i my self bought a watch from the showroom and it is said that the watch is water resistant . soon after i purchased it when i am leaving to my hone it showered suddenly and found some water on the watch . after some hour it stopped working . lastly my uncle bought a bread packet and the owner said that it fresh and tasty and can last for a week . after a day or two when my uncle started eating that the upper most layer were good to eat and the layer from middle to the end were infected with fungus . as the medium that is television , radio , news papres are playing a major role in entertaining the people the advertisement are highly broadcasted by on or other mean . so the advertising company were making cash by not selling the true item that shown in the advertisement .
