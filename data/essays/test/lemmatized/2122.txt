this spring festival , i spent almost a week in sanya with my parent , and also a tour guide . fortunatlly , i had a good time there , since the tour guide arranged our scheldule and fixed everything . what i should do wa just to enjoy the trip ! consequently , i prefer to hire a tour guide during a group-traveling . when you visit somewhere you do not familiar with , if you hired a guide , he would provide you with car , tell you the history of the city , show you interest of place . firstly , when you travel outside , where is far from your hometown , commonly , you will not drive your own car . thus it is obvious that you will be much easier and cheaper if you hire a guide who can provide a car . for instance , this time we went to sanya , we called a guide to pick up u and took u to the place we wanted to visit . if we , three person to take a taxi , the cost will be doubled . moreover , the guide know the city better than you do . he not only know the history of the historial inherents , but also manage to tell you where is the most beautiful place in the area . such a what a guide did when iwas in xiamen last year , she showed u a place you will never find by your own ! there , the combination of the sun , the sea , the beach is fantastic ! finally , which i think it is important tome , the tour guide will take you to a much cheap hotel . as you know , the cost is rising thse day . when i am in sanya , the hotel charged u 6000 yuan per day . however , the guide showed up , he bargined for u . at last , we just spent 1700 yuan per day . to sum up , i will choose a guide to lead my travel , not only for the money stuff , but also for the convieneint .
