i absolutely agree to the statement because the need to make one 's product more attractive to increase sale had made advertiser to rely on new technique that make the product look better that it really is . this push ha came from a highly competitive world where it 's required that a company increase sale and efficiency to have a good performance on the stock market . some technique advertisement agency use to achieve their objective are , the use of motor oil to make food look tastier that it really is ; or show product on good looking model where any product look good or show just the best part of a specific location , for example a hotel , while hiding others when trying to sell a touristic package . some other technique are related to the kind of word used to describe a specific product or service , sometimes you can make a mental picture of what you are reading but you do not realize that the seller is intentionally omitting some information to make it product attractive . for example , when booking a hotel , you will see the picture from the nicest room and the best location on the hotel but they missed information about facility and surroundings most of the time . i have seen case where hotel have advertise thing like `` view of the pyramid '' and although it is barely true , they forget to mention that you are 1 hour away from this place ( by car ) and you are not able to see them every day . but to overcome this problem , modern communication tool like internet , web forum , blog and email play a very important role since they reach a large community where you can share your experience with a specific product or service . it 's very common today that online travel agency includes the option to write review about a specific hotel or airline ; but it ; s not limited to tourism industry because you can also find , from popular place like amazon . com , review about electronic and household product written by previous user . as a final statement , we must make use of the available tool we have in a global community to research on a specific product before making purchasing decision that could be greatly influenced by the kind of advertisement used .
