i agree with the statement `` successful people try new thing and take risk rather than only doing what they already know how to do well '' . i support my statement with several reason . for one it is an unspoken economic rule which state that `` you only enlarge your capital by investing '' . in other word this mean only if you are ready to take the risk and invest your own money you will be able to collect future gain . thus it is important that one overcomes personal drawback and ha the courage to take a risk , even at the prospect of looseing his investment . a second approach to support my thesis is on a psychological basis . doing what you are best at in a well known way without trying out different attempt consequently mean that one doe not collect any new experience at all . by trying out new approches one naturally make mistake , which though are a important part of the learning process . makeing mistake mean gathering new experience which lead to a perfection of the attempted task . one now can relate the certain mistake , from which one consequenltly `` learned '' the correct answer , to new problem which arise on different problem . psychologically speaking , one who doe not take the risk to try something new , ca n't learn through experience . one can still analyse different problem on the basis of book or other medium but is not able to identify oneself with the problem a a personal experience . moreover , i experienced the statement 's content myself . as a foreign exchange student i had to take a risk and leave my well known surroundings and go to a different country . although , at first the thought about leaving wa very unsettling , finally the experience which wa gained by this sa
