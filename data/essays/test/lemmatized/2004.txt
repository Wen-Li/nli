there is an argument concernign about whether product seem much better that they really are is made by most advertisement . although it is true that advertisement can help to people who buy some product , i believe that most advertisement is not always a advantegeous a our life . most of all , many people have damage because some advertisement are not true . some advertisement decieve their client inorder to sell more their product . for example , when i wa a freshman in university , i bought a mp3 player that is advertised many place . by the advertisement , the mp3 player should get 1000 music . however , i wa able to get 800 music , instead of 1000 music . so , i complained the mp3 player to the company . they said that the advertisement is not true . in this respect , most people can get damage from not true advertisement . moreover , most people spend more money because of advertisement . after most people see the advertisement , they feel the buying impetus . so , they sometimes regret their spending . for intance , my girl griend like shopping and her hobby is shopping . when she had a bad feeling , she saw some advertisement by television , so she went to the department store and spend all of her money buying the product that is advertised by tv . later a month , she regreted about her behavior . in this regard , some advertisement can give damage to people because of over spending . in summary , i disgree with that most advertisement make product seem much better that they really are . this is because most people can get damage from not true advertisement a well a over spending .
