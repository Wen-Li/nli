some people try new thing and take risk in every step of their life but others do what they knew . i agree that taking risk and try new thing is good instead of doing what the knew . in this assay i am going to give some reason why i feel this way . while trying new thing , we can lean about new thing and we can learn to utilise them in our day to day life . trying new thing is risky but without trying we can not move forward . we can not invent new thing . for example i learned computer seven year back and now also i am leanrning new software . by using computer i am using latest technology . i am searching internet to get information for my study and i am talking with my friend in the forien country with out cost of single pennie . without computer it is impossible . i learned typewriting 10 year back . if i stick with that with out try computer , it is impossible to do all those thing . learning new thing will help u to build our career . technology is improving day to day . so we have to be upto date our resume . without learning or trying we can not get job . if we want to become successful we have to try new thing . we get confidence if we try new thing . our personolity will develope . confidence is very important to become successful person . we will become success in any field if we have confidence . we do't know until and then we climb a mountain ; we can climb it or not . so trying new thing is good . so in my opinion , people shoud try new thing and take risk to become successful in life . by doing new thing we get confidense , in biulding our career and in learning newthings .
