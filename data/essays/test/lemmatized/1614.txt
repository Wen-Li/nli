i completely agree with the fact that successful people try new thing and take risk . .. once a person becomes succesful , a level of confidence develops in him . this self-confidence inspires him to go ahead and to try something innovative . the present success eliminates the fear of being failure in his innovation . i want to support my claim with one of the recent example happened in indian automobile industry . the name of tata ( a giant company in the field of automobile , service sector and metal industry in india ) is well known . the credit of success gows to the ceo of the co . mr. ratan tata . being a successful person in his field he thought to give a cheap but technically advance car to lower middle class people of india . he announced the price of car month back only $ 2500 . everybody in automobile industry amused him that it will not possible to launch a car in just $ 2500 . he took it a a challange and stated working on his innovative idea with his selected team member . after one year of complete dedication , vision and self-confidence he finally launched the car named nano . whole world surprised to see the tecnical expertency and the cost of such a car . this this quite new and innovative thing can be done by a successful person only . a commonman struggling for his first success can not think beyond his day to day doing well . always the new thing do not work . sometime there is risk involved in innovation . suppose the concept of the car , what tata had created would not came true , then also the tata company and mr. ratan tata continued to survive . only thing is that this risk can be taken by succesful person and they continue to take . world is full of innovative thing and material . how they evolved ? how they came into existance ? at some or other point of time some person had taken risk to innovate quite new thing and in my opinion they are successful person . if at some stage people will satisfy with his achievement and stopped trying new thing then invention and development will stop . example of `` thomas alwa edision '' is with u . one after other invention he made and did not stopped untill his body allowed him to work . if he had stopped after his first invention we would not getting the electric bulb or gramophone today . if after discovery of `` photo-electric effect '' albert einstein had stopped thinking on new idea , the world of physic would not be heard about the `` theory of relativity '' even till today . these are only some example from the lot all over wold , when a successful person tried new thing and he/she gave something new to this world .
