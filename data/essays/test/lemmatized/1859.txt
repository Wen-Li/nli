the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide . i agree with this . the reason for supporting this statement may be explained in the following manner . generally a tour is memorable journey to an unknown place along with family or friend . so , at this time of travel a guide should led the entire group of tour because we travel to the place which we have n't seen till date . at this time the guide id the only person who help to make the entire place known . basically a travel in group led by a guide can solve a number of problem . a guide help to make understand that language . he give the right information of the food available in that area . in this way a ot of issue can be resolved with guide . also the guide keep on posting the different information regarding the place which we travel and he make to watch the people in the group each and everything in the area visited without any failure . for example , i along with my friend had a small tour to goa . our group wa led by an efficient tour guide . and we had a good time by watching each and every place . the guide wa helpful in each and every aspect . there wa a continuous posting of the information regarding the place and we came to know a lot of that area . the guide wa also helpful in solving problem like food , health etc if any . in the whole way the tour guide led the path and made our tour succesful . so , a guide is the necessary person who duly take care of the entire group in the tour . thus the tour guide is the person who make the constraint satisfy without any issue and make the tour successful . if the group doe n't have a tour guide the consequence may be in danger . so , the group should be led by guide when we travel .
