advertisements are very important for customer to gain information about product or have a knowledge about a new product that ha just started to be sold in the market . but there is an important problem about advertisement whether the product seem how they are in real or not . i agree with the one who believe product seem much better in advertisement than they really are . first of all , in the market there are many producer for a specific type of product , and customer usually decide between the product according to his/her need , technical and design aspect , price and quality . the customer want to buy high quality product with a le price and the producer want to sell a lot of them to get the highest profit . since the producer know the demand of customer and what they are looking for , advertisement are prepared according to customer usually . for example , i decided to buy a mobile phone but not an expensive one two month ago . i searched over the internet and came across with an advertisement . in the advertisement they were claiming that , they sell the cheapest mobile phone . when i clicked the link , a picture of the phone and price of it came to the screen . there were also some technical detail written with a small font . on the screen of the phone in the picture , there is a coloured sailer picture and a blue sea . i thought that the phone ha a colored screen and immediately ordered one from the internet without reading the technical aspect because price wa very good and it wa a hot offer for that day . two week later my phone came and i realized that it doe n't have a colored screen and also larger than the size shown in the picture . i became shocked and immediately phoned customer relation . they told me that there is a small note which say that there are two model for this phone and they put the picture of improved modal under the web page . as you can understand this experience producer prepares advertisement according to customer and they do n't real reflect the real model
