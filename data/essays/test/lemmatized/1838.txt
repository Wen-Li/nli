in this essay i will tell you why business make thier product look better than it is in real , and the advantageous and disadvantageous for both buyer and seller . could advertizement be harmfull sometime ? i will answer my first question which is why business make thier product look good and perfect to people . these day people value the product by the way it look , so company is trying to attract people by making thier product look the best on the market , which could be good from the outside but fake from the inside , and i disagree with that , becasue the buyer is trusting the company and buying the product , so he should be given the right to have a neat product . the company will only car about thier profit which is ofcourse a smart tihng to do but they must also be aware of it product quality . for the seller , he will benefit from the money he will get from the customer , although , if it wa n't that effective , customer will never buy from it again and buz talking will spread out therefore the business will decline . i will always suggest that the business should not fake it product , they should be honest with people and be aware of the fact of cheating .
