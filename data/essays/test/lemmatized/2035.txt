the topic of the statement that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guilde can be approach from several different angel , it is really a complex one . some people would tend to agree with that it will well when there are a group led by a tour guilde , while other people did not agree with that issue . i have develop my point of view a well . as far a i am concerned , i agree for this statement for two important reason . at first reason , when we came to a new place i need some one to intorduce the new knowledge and culture foe me . additional erasons , it will let me more effiency to got deeply in my trip . first of all , i need the tour guilde to intorduce any kind of the culture which i never been before . for instance , when i wa a student in the senior high school , i join in trip to the china . although i am a chinese whom live in taiwan , i never visit to china . therefore i do not have any idea about there . however i met a good tour guilde there , she had a lot of experience on this job so she intorduced very detail about the social culthure and traditional crafics to u . in addition , there will let me more efficiency to had a lot fun in my trip . i think that it is vey convince in the daily assigments , because the tour guilde will take every thing in my trip . moreover , the guilde sometimes had to designed very interesting game in our traffic time . therefore , i am not only to worry about any little thing in my trip , but also i could had fun from it . in my conclusion , maybe there are some people do not think that statement doe not good for them . however , i think it is very wonderful for me .
