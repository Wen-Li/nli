nowadays , young people do n't spend much time for their community . some people would say it is not enough time , others would say you do n't need to spend much time . as the callenges of young people 's life ha changed , there is a reason for this change . we may not say that young people do a mistake , if they plan their time in a new way . the reason for not spending time to helping their community are many . one can be the lack of time , that arises from new challenge . young people are faced to more competiton in education and worklife , and this force them to cut off their spare time . if you do not have time , how should you help your community ? another fact is the bigger global movement of young people . they are not willing to spend much time for a local thing like a community . if they arrive somewhere , they know that they will probably move to another place in a couple of year . reasons can be their job , or an educational program abroad . this lead to a lack of motivation to spend a lot of time for your community , so you concentrate on study or work and keep in contact with old friend . keeping in contact can be e-mailing and travelling . how should you spend time in helping your community when you are not even physically available ? young poeple who spend much time to help their community might know , that they do not want to move to other place . they may also have le other activity in their spare time or are not doing so hard study or work . they may focus to the place where they live , and search for social contact there . i think that people , who do not spend a lot of time by helping their community are not doing anything wrong . but if you are available , it would be nice , if you help your community .
