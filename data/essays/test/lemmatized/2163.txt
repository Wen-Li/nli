in my personal opinion is more important for student to undertand idea and concept , than , only learn fact . learning about the idea and concept you would problably get in to the fact , knowing step by step how is the result . the develp of the fact would give you the meaning and the principal idea of it . why doe occur ? it is not only a matter of simple proccess . moreover some fact ha an extensive proccess that is difficult to learn , but , you would get incomplete information if you only learn the fact . i think , if you want to have a complete formation in any subject , the idea and the concept will teach you differents fact . for example , the idea that roman were the most important ancient poblation , it is a fact , but the concept is valid if you know that they develop a lot of construction tool , and a pretty well develop sociaty , during the conquest and empire . also the idea and he concept can give you the opportunity to create your own fact , studing the develp of some fact you will see new way of one simple result . in addition one fact could had more that one option to be solve , but if you do not undertand the main idea , you will probably get in the error that they already found . in conclusion , understanding idea and concept , would give you the enough tool to have different option that one fact can give .
