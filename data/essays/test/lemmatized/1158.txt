it is debatable whether traveling with a group led by a tour guide is the best way to travel . some people say that traveling alone is better because if someone travel alone , he or she can spend their time more freely while traveling . however , i agree with the idea that traveling in a group led by a tour guide is better for tourist for the following reason . first , i can learn about other culture more precisely by asking them to a tour guide . second , i can meet diverse people while traveling with group led by a tour guide . first , if i have a trip in a group led by a tour guide , there would be more chance to ask something related to the country 's culture where i visited to the tour guide . the tour guide can offer me accurate information there . for example , when i visited new york city alone in 2005 , i just enjoyed hanging around the city . however , later i visited new york city with a guide one more time in 2007 , i realized that there were too many thing i missed . i could not know the history of rockfeller center well and did not go to the wall street becuase i did not have enough information about where it located when i first traveled to new york . moreover , traveling in a gourp led by a tour guide offer me opportunity to meet other people from different culture through the tour guide . for example , when i visited egypt during the last winter vacation , i got to know a lot of people there . especially the tour guide , al , teached me how to interact with other people from different country and helped me whenever i wa in trouble . we have preious memory and we are keeping touch with each other now .
