i do agree with the given statement . i think a main fact is that having success rather push one forward than staying on the same level or taking step backwards . for example a gymnast who just successfully tried a new more difficult jump at the vault is willing to go further and try another new difficult jump in the future compared to a gymnast who ha not much success in learning new jump or move . this last person is rather discouraged by the former experience than the successful person . success generally encourages people in trying new thing and taking risk . i do agree with the fact that it also depends on the individual a far a character and habit but there are people who might start taking riskes , who have never done so before a a result of positive experience in the past which encouraged them to act more risky than before . therefore i think the individual character affect that habit only to a certain degree . human being also tend to rather want to go forward and experience new terretories than staying where they are . that desire is even greater when one is successful because it make one feel good . eventually one want more of that feeling and therefore try to find way of getting to that point again . of course it can result in surrender and discourage but even then one would try again to get to that level of success . another example could be a player in a casino . at the beginnig this person ha not won anything yet but once he or she start winning it will be hard to stop because there could be more to win and it give a certain pleasure . a fact why many people ca n't stop playing is the feeling they get by winning , which is enormous at gambling . the feeling of success is one mayor cause of people taking even more risk .
