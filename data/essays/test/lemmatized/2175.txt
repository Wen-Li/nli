successful people are generally differs from the other group of the public because they take more risk and they do n't just repeat the same thing again and again . they always try harder for creating new thing because to be succesful you need to be unique in what you do . successful people always try to reach to the impossible . their idea are way more differen than others . for example the creator of `` google '' make an unique internet site which no one ever think . the creator are just 30 year old but their mind are much older . their thought could be seen a crazy for average people hence they have kept on thinking . successful people also try to renovate their vision . they do n't stick with the same thing , they make comparison of idea for the best solution . let 's say a known chef of a famous restaurant , he/she can not repeat serving same food , he/she should think of new style and cuisine for the customer . if he repeat himself/herself he/she is not regarded a an unique chef . he/she have to come up with new idea all the time to be successful . another issue is they should know the future aspect for people . they have to think of innovation about everything . not only they should proof they can do better but also they should show that they can improve their vision continuously . the people who are doing only what they can do best and never change their style are not seen a successful because they do n't use their capacity effectively . they should take more risk to improve and change the original thougths . only by this way they can stand out in the public , a a result their idea become famous and approved . to sum it all up , successful people are the one who always try to do the best and change the vision of the others . they do n't just do what they already know , they improve it with new idea .
