i definitely agree with the statement according to wich in twenty year there will be fewer car in use than there are today for several reason . first of all , recent statistic have shown that the sale of car have decreased these last year because the market is overwhelmed of concurrents and that the new car become more and more reliable and can be used longer . secondly , there are a lot of effort which are going to be made concerning public transportation almost in the great city because it ha become impossible to drive during the rushing hour ( e.g think about certain big city like new-york , london , paris , ... ) . for instance , in london , a tax ha already been settled for entering with a car in the centrum . i 'm sure that that kind of solution wll be soon adopted by other city . there are also many effort which are projected in order to connect the city located at the borrough to the centrum . for example , in belgium , they are going to build a rer like in france to connect waterloo , lasne , ... ( small city which are about twenty kilometer from brussels ) to the capital . this will undoubtedly lead to a decrease of the numbersof car because for the moment people are getting more and more bored with traffic jam and are waiting with happiness this rer . finally , another reason is that the price of petrolum ha hihghly increased these last year . when we know that the stock are limited , we ca n't reasonnably imagine that the price will go down in the future . it ha already become a luxe to drive or having more than one car per household and i am convinced that in twenty year , thing wo n't change . .. due to all these element ( which for sure are not exhaustive ) , i am sure that the numer of car in tenty year will be le important than today .
