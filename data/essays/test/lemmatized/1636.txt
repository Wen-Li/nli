when you go to the university , you choose a way . sometimes more specific than another . some peole will say you it 's to specific , others not enought . but which one is the good ? is it better to choose a specific subject ? or is it good to have many academic subject with le knowledge ? it depends of what you want to do after . if you specialize you in one specific subject , you can become an expert in this domain , and made research , which is very interesting i think . you are at the point of the technology and you help your planet to progress . i think it 's very well to know everythings on one subject . but for this , you need to do some long study . the problem of being specialize in one subject is you have some difficulty to explain what you want to do easily . companies need people with very specific knowledge to develop the software , tool . .. of u futur . furthermore , they need also people without specific knowledge , but with many differents academic subjet to manage people , give advice about the way to follow to create something . in general , this people could n't realize themself the application . they give instruction and manage that everythings is good during the project . they made the link between the customer and the engineer . they can explain easily , without technical word , to the customer what they do , give him some advice . then , they explain to their team what the customer want , how to do it . people with many academic subject and specialize people are both important . we need them . if we had n't the first one , customer and expert could never understand each other . and if we had n't expert , project could n't be realize . or they need more time , and time are money for customer , so it 's impossible .
