i agree with the statement that `` most advertisement make product product seem much better that they really are '' . apart from making the product look attractive and good there is no point in a advertisement . the purpose of advertisement is to promote and market the product . in this process many advertisement require that they dramatacize the property of the product to catch the attention of the viewer effectively . this dramatacizing almost always make the product look better than they actually are . for example consider the case of junk food advertisement . though they are not a useful and benificial a their advertisement make them look but they are portrayed that way to attract the attention of the viewer . if these advertisement were to project the true nature of the product no person with a sane mind would go for it . also consider the case of a fuel company which advertises that with that particular brand of fuel , a low a a couple of litre in the automobile is sufficient energy for it to run hundred of kilometer . although everybody know that this cant be true it help the advertiser deliver a point and help them market their product . it is a well established pshycological priniciple that the common and uninteresting event attract le attention when compared to the uncommon and exciting event . to take advantage of this priniciple the advertisizers tend to create the advertisement a uncommon and interesting a possible . in this process they end up showcasing their product a much better than it actually is though it might not be their primary intention . if this is not done there is the risk of the advertisement not serving it purpose and there would be no point in making it .
