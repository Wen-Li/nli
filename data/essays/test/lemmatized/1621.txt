success can be defined a the completion of a goal a person had set himself . in my opinion , it is in the nature of humankind to always want more , to never be satisfied with what we already have . it seems therefore logical that successful people would still want to try new thing and take risk . first of all , the want for more that lead to try new thing is sometimes driven by greed . a casino player who ha won the jackpot will undoubtedly want to try his luck one more time . he therefore take an important risk . moreover , a successful person who want to try new thing show his creativity and his will to advance in life . a simple example is the one of the 2006 nobel prize winner , muhammad yunus . mr yunus , before creating the grameen bank wa a successful college professor . however , he decided to stop teaching and dedicate his life and knowledge to helping the poor . he took an important risk when he created his bank : being an economics teacher , he did not know much about banking . successful people , for reason that can be both negative and positive , are generally willing to try new thing and take risk . on the other hand , some people work their entire life before they are successful . once they have achieved their goal , it is understandable that they would not want to jeopardize their situation by taking new risk . they therefore try to consolidate it . a man who ha work for year trying to make his business successfull , once he ha achieved his goal , will not want to try new thing by starting up a new business in a completely different field . he will only try to expand the one he already ha since he ha learned to manage it well . in conclusion , successful people can decide to either take new risk or rather keep doing what they know how to do . in my opinion , it completely depends of the type of person : someone who is creative , motivated , or even thirsty for wealth and power , will try new thing . moreover , even in the case of a man who only try to consolidate his business and not starting another one , he is still taking risk by expending . i therefore agree with the statement . rare are the people who are willing to let their life stagnate .
