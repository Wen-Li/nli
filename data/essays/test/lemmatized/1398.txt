i disagree that in twenty year there will be fewer car in use than there are today . as if we see the figure of the past about the yearly consumption of car , we can say that the figure is increasing continuously . as the population of the world is increasing day by day , so there would be more need of car in coming year in order to satisfy the transportation need of people . also government of country is building new road which are comfortable for driving car and other motor vehicle . better road increase the efficiency of the car . so transportation by car would not be costly for people in coming year . they would prefer travelling by car rather then taking the bus or hired motor vechiles . the economy of the world is growing so a a affect , the wealth of individuial person is going high . so , in coming year more people would be rich a compare to present . so they will be more interested to buy car a the car are also mean of show off in the society . by having the car , person try to impress others in the context of thing which are meant for comfort . as person will be more economically stable , he will prefer to buy thing of comfort which include car a well . as the technology of making car is improving day by day . so in coming year , because of technology advancement the cheaper way of producing might come in picture and that will surely decrease the cost of car . as a result , in the future car will in the buying range of more people a they can not buy car now due to lack of budget . also because of technology advcancement , new model of car will come in market . those model will be more comfortable and would be more beautiful in look . so new model might attract the more people a they will think that this model will solve the problem of transportation . as the life style of people is becoming very fast with time . now a day , person want to do more and more work in short period of time . so he need to reach at different place in order to for example attend important business meeting or presentation . by taking the public transport , he can reach at his distination but that will take more time and problem is that he is not having time . so he would surely prefer to have his own car . so there will be more car in use than there are today . also because of more consumption of the car , the car industry would be booming , that will result in economic growth of the country . so the government will also enhance the sale of car by allowing company to set up new manufacturing unit in the country and also by giving them some tax benefit . finally , i would stat that in twenty year there will be more car in use than there are today . this statement is very much supported by fact which have been discussed above . all in coming year there would be more car on the road .
