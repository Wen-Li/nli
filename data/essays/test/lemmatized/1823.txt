` prosperity is a great teacher , adversity greater . ' the above qoute clearly express the point of view of successful people . also i personally agree with the statement of the question . successful people are more prone to take risk and try to learn new thing every time . success is measured not by the return one ha achieved by his effort but trying to do the same thing every time he ha failed . perseverance is a very common trait shown by successful people and they also have a ` never say die ' attitude which work for them every time they are in a difficult situation . stating an example of a famous person from india would make my point more clear . dhirubahi ambani is a term synonymous with almost every person in my country . he wa a professor 's student who went abroad for his study and got employed latter with a big banner company . during his tenure of employment , he learned every business strategy and decided to start his own business a an entrepreneur inspite of the company offering him a very high post in there office abroad . he came back to india with his knowlegde wealth and started his working towards his goal with zeal . at first he met with many obstacle which started straight from his father but he did not give up . he faced many financial problem but did not let down from his goal of starting his own business . when his financial problem were solved he faced problem challenging the established set pattern of business in his region but still his attitude of perseverance got him through . he tried something new with risking his whole personal life and eventually he met with success from all quarter . today reliance industry ha achieved global level and it is due to his long lasting effort . from above example , i have shown how successful people try new thing while taking risk and still achieve success . it is not in falling every time but trying to get up after every fall is important .
