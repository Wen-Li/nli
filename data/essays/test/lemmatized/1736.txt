it is a complex issue whether advertisments make product seem better than they really are . i should say effect of advertisement of product varies from product to product . it basically depends on what the company want to convey to the consumer about certain product like quality , reliability , price , after sale service etc . but i agree with the statement that most advertisement make seem much better than they really are . herebelow i would like to provide some example in the support . firstly , take the example of japanese car `` toyota . '' the toyota car company in it advertisement for this car state that over a million of customer are using this car worldwide including united states . company while advertising know that this advertisement is working pretty good for incresement in sale of it car but the fact is that there are other car available in the market of the same segment and with equaly good feature and price range . but their sale are not a much a toyota car . that mean advertisement of toyota is having an edge over the other car in regard to it volume of sale . secondly , if one take an example of any food product . for example mac donald 's burger . though every body is aware that it is a junk food which ha lot of calorific value and it effect on health but number of outlet opening out in different part of the world . macdonald 's famous advertisement , `` i am loving it '' for it product is working like a magic which is helping to increase the volume of sale and increasing number of outlet opening . this sale increase is taking place besides the fact that the product are having bad efect on health . this is possible because of it kind of advertisement . in conclusion , citing the aforesaid example one can definately say that most advertisement make product seem much better than they really are .
