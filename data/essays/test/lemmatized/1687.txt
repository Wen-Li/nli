adverisements of product in today 's life play a crucial role in product sale which lead to a higher profit margin of a company . since our world today relies basically on money , advertisement business is also affected by the situation . most advertisiments are made to show a product better than it actually is . this approach can be seen in brand advertisement and advertisement of movie . most of the advertisement are trying to affect and influence people with their motto . advertisors try to show product a a lifestyle and more than what it is . for example , sprite - a leading brand in drink - claim that your thirst will destroy after you drink it . they try to claim that sprite can take place of water . but scientifically , it is impossible . the amount of sugar in it will increase the desire or demand of water after the sprite drinking experience . this situation is the main result of showing product much better than they realy are . the film industry is making fragment of the movie and advertise it in order to reach to a large number of audience . to accomplish that goal , they get the best part of the movie and edit it and with this process they try to make the movie bigger than or more than it is . everybody ha that kind of an experience in his or her life . they go to a movie with great expectation but when they see what it really is , they blame themselves about how they gave money to it . most of the advirtesements in the present time are product of emperialism . they are all made to increase the amount of money which lead to an increase in firm ' income . advertisors also put into position to do that if they can not affect product 's sale , they will be a part of unemployment group . so when we look at the big picture of advertising sector , most advertisement make product seem much better than they really are .
