in this modern society , people are given the chance to choose in what way they are going to study concerning the best type that fit for individual . some people believe that having broad knowledge of many academic subject is better while others think it is better for them to specialize in one specific subject . i agree with the latter opinion because student do not have to waste time to study other subject that are irrevent for their major and because our society ha been requiring people to be specialized in their field . first of all , specialising in one specific subjet save people from wasting time to spend doing unneccessary subject so that they can study more on thier major subject . one of my friend is majored in biology in the university and he alwasy compains about his high school life . according to korean education system he had to choose either scientific subject or literal subject and he chose to study scientific subject since he wanted to study biology in his university . however , he also had to choose either music or art a a compulsory subject . what a waste of time ! he should have to take music or art to study biology . what if he spent time studying science rather than music ? he could have used his time more effectively to improve his knowledge for his future . for the sake of worthwhile time , it is better to specialise in one specific subject . additionally , a the society progress , people are expected to have expertised knowledge in their working yard . if student are not prepared to satisfy this assumption , they will find it difficult to get a job or continue working in work place . as student study for one specific subject , they possibly will satisfy specialized demand in their working place . there is one student who want to be a hair designer . but she ha no time to concentrate on studying special hair cutting skill that would be required to learn for her job . because she ha to do many of compulsory `` academic subject '' if she is able to study on beuty subject other than academic subject at her high school , it may be easier for her to catch up other hair dresser in the real life . the world is changing . it is essential for people to realize and try to follow up a number of change . for student , it is far better to specialize one subject not only to adept these dramatic change in the world , but not to waste their valuable time for preparing their future .
