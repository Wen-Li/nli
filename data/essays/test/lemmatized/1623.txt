i agree with the statement which is that `` successful people try new thing and take risk rather than only doing what they already know how to do well '' . for example , people who usually showed on tv , actor , and company president . i will write some example of these in this essay . first , people who usually showed on tv especially comedian will be a politician . at first , they will use their face to be a politician and talk about problem that own country had . however at the last , they will never success in the government , and will never get back to tv . second , i will write about actor . many actor will be the director to make the film when they are succeed . usually it doe not get good result .
