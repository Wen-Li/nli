many people may agree with the statement that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide . however , i do n't think so . in my view , i believe that the best way to travel is with your friend or family member without a tour guide . to begin with , if one person travel with his friend without a tour guide , then he can choose where and when to visit according to what he really want . in fact , when travelling in a group with a tour guide , the routine of the trip is always decided by the tour guide so that the traveller will be limited and lost freedom and right to make decision in their travel . moreover , one will feel more relaxed and free when he travel just with his friend or family without any stranger in the group or a tour guide . for example , last year when i wa having a trip to japan in a group led by a tour guide , i did n't feel perfect and free because most people of the group is stranger . therefore , during this summer vacation , i travelled korean just with my friend without a tour guide . this trip is totally different and wonderful . experience tell me that travel with friend without a guide can make me relaxed and relieve my pressure from the busy study . last but not least , it is also more economic and cost le if travelling without a tour guide . facts infers u that the expense of travelling in a group always cost a lot due to hiring a tour guide . for instance , a friend of mine ha a trip to shanghai in a group with a tour guide spent much more money than i travelled by myself . to sum up , i think that the best way to travel is with friend and family rather than in a group led by a tour guide . in my obersvation , it is more free , cost le and let traveller make tour decision by themselves .
