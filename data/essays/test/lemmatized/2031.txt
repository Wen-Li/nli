many people think that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide . others think taht making and organizing a trip by there own is the best way . i think that this kind of trip ha both it 's own advantage and disadvantage . on one hand , guided trip are very good for tourist because they give them the possibility to know all the place they are visiting because the tour guide will know very well that place . in this kind of trip people learn a lot from the place such a the history and culture and they do not have to worry where to go or visit because they have all scheduled and organized . but the problem come when a person doe n't feel like doing what is scheduled and want to do something that they want to , this is not impossible but this person is going to loose for example the money they paid for an expedition . on the other hand , trip by your own have the benefit that you always do what you want and you spend your money in the thing that you want to , not in the thing scheduled by a tour guide of a group . but the drawback that this type of trip ha is that probably you are going to loose much information that a tour guide could have given to you a regard the history of the place or the culture . to sum up , i think that both type of trip ha it 's own advantage and disadvantage , but i do n't think that one is better than the other . i believe that the decision of choosing one type or the other depends on the person and the kind of trip he or she want to do .
