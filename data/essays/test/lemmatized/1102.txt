i agrees to the statement that `` successful people try new thing and take risk rather than doing what they already know how to do well '' . there are various example marked in history which establishes the above statement . trying new thing open new horizon , one ha to take risk to be successful and to minimise the error old way are always ameliorated or replaced by new thing . trying new thing open new horizon and with vast new horizon one ha a better possibility to grow and becoming successful . take an example of cellular phone . that wa a new invention and a new thing for every individulal . and now it an unavoidable part of one 's success . the fastest access to communication provided by cellular panones created a havoc in business world , health industry & etc . the organization which are entirely dependent on the old day phone system are deteorating simillarly people who have n't tried cell phone are lacking an important way of communication and hence are not successful . success is associated with the risk . even a s a child one ha to take a risk to learn new thing required to succeed in day to day life . if i have n't gathered the courage of holding a bicycle i could n't be able to ride it . the risk which i took at an early age helped me in learning car driving . the racing car driver are more popular and successful than me in racing world since , they took the risk of practising fast driving on race track . once success is directly proportional ti the amount of risk one is willing to take to acheive some thing . old way are always not the best way though , they are well tested and we followed them over a long time . but to minimize the error in a process new idea and thing are always tested . i will try new thing and take risk to succed in my life rather than not taking and trying new thing .
