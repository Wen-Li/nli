i agree with the satements that '' most advertisement make product seem much better than they really are . '' in general commercial are used to increase the selling number of a product . therefore it is the purpors of an advertisment to make a product look good , since nobody want to buy a bad product . for instance , an advertisement for a new kind of candy is used to introduce the product to the market . hence , the advertisement will show how nice and good the candy is . that the candy might contain sugar , which might make certain people fat , is not metioned in the advertisement because the candy company want to sell the candy . and in time of a free market there are so many product that an advertisement ha to point out the advantage of a product . therefore i agree with the statement because an obviously bad product ( the candy ) is shown in a better light than it is . the statement is usually considered to bad . however in a society where profites and selling number are the only focus it is a neccassity to show one product a the best on the market . hence , there is no other possibility other than to make a product look better than it is . for instance the contangan ( pain releaser , make , however , baby become handycaped ) ha been sold million time . thet fact that baby are born crippled ha never been mentioned in the advertisement . one might argue that is cruel and bad that advertisments make product seem much better than thez really are , i however , argue that it is a relsult and a neccassity of our modern society .
