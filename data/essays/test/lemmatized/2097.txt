i absolutely agree with the afct that advertisement rise the product ' appeal . as a first reason , the interest in this activity increased considerabily in the last year . moreover , i think that people in front of several product will chose the one they saw in an advertisement , thinking it is better than others not familiar , even if it not true . first , it is a fact that most of the organization focuse more and more every year on advertisement than on the quality of the prime material and working process . in the last year , both the ammount and percentage of money spent by organization in advertisement increased considerabily . for example , in the united stated the ammount of money dedicated to advertisement wa larger than the one dedicated to instruction . second , most of people i know . when have to decide what to buy in a supermarket , maily chose the product with the most advertised brand , sure that it will be the best product . once i have done a test with some friend . i bought several brand of can of tuna and than i made taste a little bit of each brand to each of my friend , while they had the eye closed . as a result , they where not able to associate the favourite brand with the best taste . in conclusion , i think advertisement make product appear better than what they are in real . firstly , beacuse organization show bigger interest in advertisement activity than in quality of their prime material and process . secondly , on teh basis of my experience .
