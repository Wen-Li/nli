the word advertisement can be considered a the key to the success and the enormous growth of many businessmen . advertisement is not only the best medium publication but also the life of any brand name to prevail in the market . there are many way of medium advertising like television , news paper , magazine , radio and few more . a human eye sometimes get cheated in identifying an object in reality which is at an optimum distance . in that case how can a product which is being compressed and altered by advanced technology using the latest equipment be clear and accurate to a person who would just have a glance in a news paper or on the television set . a product having multiple function and complication can not be properly explained to the viewer in one or two minute commercial advertisement . hence the major quality and advantage must be highlighted and telecasted or printed which will have only a half impact . for example let take a latest version of a brand new car . the car would be shown in all best possible color on the television screen . the shape and size will be telecasted in an elegant manner in a very pleasant atmosphere with attractive model around . the advertisement seems so real and outstanding , the viewer would not even give a second thought in judging the vehicle . when the shoot is being done the video camera used and the professional make it an eye catcher . but the reality will be different a we know the color shape and the performace might not be the same . at the same time one can not point out the advertising team `` s point of view . the idea behind spending lot of money and effort in creating an advertisement is just to attract the customer to flow into the show room and make money . if one desire to have the right product with him at the right price and not being betrayed with the demo 's on the screen , the best possible way of advertising is by having a demonstration in front of the customer . in the case of the car may be a test drive oppurtunity to the customer will be a much better option . here by we can conclude that a small time demo can not really show everything about a product . they look much more attractive and better on the advertisement . hence one must definetely touch and see the reality .
