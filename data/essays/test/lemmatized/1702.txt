the main topic is that it is more important for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact . i agree with this statement . the first reason i agree with this is that , if student understand the idea and concept it is much more easier for them to understand any task or any project they are handling . for example if they are doing any project , they should understand the concept of that project and come up with different idea . so that it will be well organised and willbe done according to the requirement . if you go according to the fact we may not be able to succeed in that project . because in reality the similar project failed due to several reason . another reason is that in any type of activity they perform , if they understand the concept of that activity and get some new idea and proceed , it is easy to suceed . if you really look for fact you may not suceed in many occasion . onother thing is that , students always have no real experiance with many thing and they look fact by reading book and other journels . some time which is not true and give wrong judgement also . it is also important for student that if they understand the concept of any activity it easy get some good idea based on their personnel experiene or some thing that what they read in book . always better idea give good result and it help student to perform another activity with more new concept . if they look into the fact they may not be able to gain any success but may get some information which they dont think in similar concept . some case it will help student to undersand the reason for failing or success . finally i understand that for student it is more important to understand the idea and conepts than learnfacts .
