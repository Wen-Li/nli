having a broad knowledge from many academic subject might not be a effictive a specializing in specific subject for many reason . first of all , specializations is to consintrat all of the specialist energy to make a development , step forward in their field , for example , studing medecie for five to six year resaulting in graduated student who are not effecient in work a someone who ha ph.d in medicine . on the other hand the varity knowledge mean learning alittle about many thing witch mean not making any improvement in life and learning the same material of information over and over again , for instance , high-school student ( who are being learned about several subject ) need to study in university to be specialist in some subject . frome that we can see , broad knowledge is just a step to the specialization . in conclusion , i believe that the humanity civilizaion is completely based on getting improved in each field of life which is the specialization it only road .
