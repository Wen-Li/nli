i agree with the statement that most advertisement make product seem much better than they really are . i have two reason to support this idea . first , both the maker and the seller of the product want to sell more , so they have good reason to show it attractively . for example , when i bought a skirt at an internet shopping mall , i checked the picture of the skirt in which a model have the skirt on , checked the size , length and texture , then bought . but later when the percel arrived at my house , i found that the skirt did n't fit for me completely , a i am not so good in style a the model in the picture . second , especially the maker have more information on the product than the consumer . because there are not so severe ban on the advertisement which brings the wrong information , the advertisement tends to express the merit , concealing the demerit . think of the advertisement on the wemen 's magagines , there are hundred of advertisement of drug for loosing weight , but most of them have practically no effect , even some are toxic , but no consumer know which are really effective and which are not . some say that the maker which creates good product can appeal the goodness to the consumer in order to make their life richer and happier , they just want consumer to know the merit . nonetheless , it is consumer who decide which product is good . in conclusion , i think because of the difference of the amount of information they have , the advertisement can easily be too attractive . i think the maker have to make big effort to convey the right and enough information to the customer , also the retailer have to stand for the consumer and sell good product to the customer .
