i strongly agree with the statememt that most advertisement make product seem much better than they really are . people can see advertisement everywhere in their daily life . when walking in street , wathing television , using internet , they see such huge poster around showing the product . firstly , the purpose of the advertisement are to make consumer buy product by making those product look good . they exaggerate how useful the product are and how they can help in daily life . therefore , production company try to attract people to buy their product and increase their income . for instance in commercial in a television , there is someone introducing product and explaining how they work . when advertising furniture or kitchen material , a person stand next to the product and explain about them . for instance , in japan , i have seen a television commercial which advertised a dining table . since most japanse house are quite small , some people put a round table in a small dining room , and eat by watching tv . the advertisement wa to show how this round table became larger and useful for the people . a man stood next to the round table to show the actual size of the table . my friend 's family bought this round table , and got surprised when the product wa sent to her house . it wa actually still in a small size and there wa no difference from the round table used before . people can see advertisement in magazine a well . in girl teen magazine , make ups and facial washing are shown in these magazine . when advertising facial washing soap , the model in the magazine are all smiling , happy with the effect of the soap . their face skin is shown very smooth that there is no pimple at all . therefore , the teenage girl are attracted to those facial washing soap and buy them . however , in reality , the picture of the model in the magazine are photoshoped and removed their pimple . actually , it depends on people 's skin because sometimes , the soap can harm their skin . when i had trouble with the pimple on my face , i saw the effect of the facial soap in a teen magazine and bought it . however , it worsened . thus , the product themselves are not shown better , but the effect from these product are shwon better . therefore , it can be said that the information of product shown in most advertisement is not true .
