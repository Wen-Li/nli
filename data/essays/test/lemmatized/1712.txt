i do not agree with this statement for the following reason : first of all , there are region and country in the world today , most of all china and india but also other third world country and region , that have started to develop a rapidly growing economy . these nation a a whole and also local company in these country start to establish themselves a major contributor to the worldwide economy . although the third world economy are dominated by the producing industry at the moment and thus the annual per head income is still very low , there ha been a remarkable increase in this area ( annual income per person ) in the last few year . as many study suggest that the economic uprising of these country is going to continue and that these society will turn into well developed community very similar to those in the usa and western europe , this trend of rising salary will most probably continue . there are going to be more and more service related business and the annual salary of most working people will increase . this will enable more people in these country to access good that have been unavailable to them until now . housing will be made more comfortable , technological product such a computer , mp3 player and the like will be accessible to a greater number of people and , of course , car will become more widely spread . many inhabitant of these third world country are just waiting for the day , when they will be able to purchase their own car . if you now combine this idea with the fact that more than two billion people live alone in china and india combined and many of those do not yet own a car , this may show to you the probable increase in car sale in these region . in fact , nearly all of the car producing company worldwide are already planning and/or establishing product perfectly suited for the market in china , india and the rest of the uprising third world country . given these fact , a drop in the number of sold and used car worldwide seems very unrealistic . in addition to that , i do not believe anymore in a decrease of used automobile in the western world , namely western europe and the usa . although there have been initiative to enhance the quality of the public transport system in the past , there are recent development that undermine these initiative . formerly state-owned railway company are being sold to private investor , and the first step these businessmen take is to decrease the number of offered line and connection . an efficient railway system that could compete with the street both on the sector of private car user a well a on the transport sector is just too expensive to be highly competitive . all that said , i definitely come to the conclusion that there will not be fewer car around in twenty year from now . there will be even more car .
