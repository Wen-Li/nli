advertisement is a big facter in a product sall , because when some one see 's a product that thay dont know nothing about it is not like when you already have a background about the product . when you see a product on t.v it stiks on your head so when you go to the market you have a background about what you whant to get , thats how the big compunys make back there money after thay spend alot of it just to advertise the product , the money that is spent on advertisement is alot but at the end they make that money with profit . so i strongly agree with that most advertisement make product seem much
