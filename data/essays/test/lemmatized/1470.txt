i definitely agree with the statement that advertisement usually make product seem better than they really are . advertisements are produced with the sole purpose of increasing the number of sale of a product and making the biggest profit out of that product . pretending that their product is the best out of it league is probably the best method of selling it . i frequently witness example of this issue in my daily life . for example , a couple of week ago i saw the advertisement of a hairdryer on tv . it had an attachment shaped like a fork at the end where the air blow out , and with the help of that attachment , the girl in the commercial were able to shape their hair into any style they wanted to - within second ! i wa so amazed by how multifunctional the product wa , it could straighthen , curl , or add wave to your hair via the same apparatus . i wa convinced that i had to buy it ; and within the week i saw the commercial of this `` perfect '' hair product , i bought one from their local store . although i did n't need a new hair dryer since i had other one at home , i bought this one simply because i wa attacted to it advertisement . when i got home , i quickly washed my hair and took out by new product from it box to give it a test drive . at that moment , i think i had the biggest dissapointment of my entire life . it wa nothing like what i had seen on the tv commercial . it wa much smaller and le ornate than what i had imagined , and one of the part of it attachment wa missing ! i turned it on and tried it on my hair anyways , but the machine kept on stopping in every ten second . deciding that this product wa obviously not worth my money or my time , i promptly returned it back to the shop , feeling deceived and mislead . i promised myself that no advertisement would ever be able to beguile and trick me into wasting my money for nothing .
