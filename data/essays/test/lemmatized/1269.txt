nowadays young people are very selfish . they do not want to do any thing for their family , and also their community . one of the most important reason for this can be technology . watching too much tv and using too much computer is not excellent for young . before the tv wa not invented , people conversed a lot . now young even do not want to look at their parent 's face . as a result , they do not listen their parent 's command , and leave them alone . it is very big problem in the world . the other reason for not giving time is that they do not respect their tradition . according to them , these are silly thing . for example , they do not listen an old woman . they think the old is very boring , if they give enough time for old people , they can help their problem . finally , they do not want to be volunteer . especially , university student think that all thing are for themselves . according to them , they do not have enough time . they have a lot of study to do . clearly , they are not generous . the behaviour of young people are getting worse from day to day . they prefer to spare their time , instead of helping poor , old people and their family .
