i agree that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their community because new generation are become more unresponsable . i can support my opinion with the following reason > first of all nowadays young people spend too much time to attend the school and they study a lot of subject . one example to support the first reason is that young people such a student have to study much more subject than before therefore they ca n't spend enough time to helping other people . another example is that there are some young people that have no time because they whether studying and working . the second reason to support my opinion implies the young people that think only about theirself . for example most young people think that buying a lot of thing is the best way to feel good . i do n't think so . i think that these are superficial peolpe . other people think only about enjoy theirself and anything else . they prefer spend all their spare time driving expensive car or getting in the disco . i believe that young peolpe nowadays dont give enough time to helping their community because they do n't care about the problem of other people . i think that if everyone give little of own time , it is possible improve the relationship among people .
