nowadays , there are so many people who are well-educated and intelligent that it is difficult to compete with those people and to be suceeded . it is quite true that a lot of successful people are well-known to the subject that they are using to earn money . a surgeon is good at doing surgeories , a carpentor is expert at making funiture . however , successful people are open to try new thing and take risk rather than to do only thing they know how to do because they are ready to do new thing , and they know that new thing can bring a lot of success . successful people are different from ordinary people because they are always ready to try new thing that they had never done . it doe not mean that they have no fear . but , even though they fear about what might happen , they have courage to attempt rather that to be afraid of it . for instance , when bill gates wa young , computer are totally new to people at that time . however , bill gates did not fear of them but tried to develop them more and make them familiar to all other people . his new idea of developing computer , brought him lot of success and that is how he became the world 's richest man . successful people are also ambitious . they know new thing will bring them lot of success . the word `` successful '' can mean be used in variety . a successful student can be good at studying . a successful business man can make a lot of money . but whoever the successful person is , the person will do new thing in order to get more successful . if it 's a student , he might do a research project on a hard and new topic that he ha never exprienced on . the project might go well and he might be chosen for a scholarship . if it 's a worker , and let 's say he is a chair maker , he might get suceeded if he tried making table . nobody know , what the result might be unless a person try and that 's how a person becomes successful . if a person want to be successful at someting , the only way is to try . if it worked , it 's good , if it did n't , he can try other new thing . a life is full of new thing and to try them out is the best way .
