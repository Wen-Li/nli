i strongly agree with this statement . i have been thinking about that during studying any subject . ideas and concept are what i consider most when i face on something first time . so i absolutely know how important they are . to demonstrate , i should be a good exampl . becuase i have a lot of experiece about that . i have been always confused in any idea and concept for a long time . actually , i wa not very good at studying or understanding something when i wa little . i thought i wa stupid . i did not know how to learn and understand . no one taught me how to do . even my parent did not . i ha been always taught just fact , not idea or concept . for instance , i did know about '' + '' and '' - '' . oneday , i got 20 point at my math test when i wa in the first grade . i did not know what they are . i wa so confused between those two . i did all of them wrongly . i did not know the concept or principle of that . in my opinion , fact are just fact . they do not show any idea or concept . they do not include any value . studying about fact is just knowing rather than knowlege . in order to get more completed knowlege , student must understand idea and concept better . that way can reduce the likelihood to misunderstand or to be confused . to sum up , understanding fact can be sometimes important . understanding idea and concept , however , must be a lot more significant than that . especially for student , that is very important .
