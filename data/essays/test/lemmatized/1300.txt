i agree with the statement that the best way to travel is in a group led by a guide . this is an effective way of enjoying all the moment in the right spirit and knowing the people around a well other than exploring the locale . i am one of those few blessed people who had the pleasure of travelling with family and and unknown people . it brings with it the chance of making some good friend if we are with unknown people in the group . or when we go out with our family the joy of spending time is different altogether . the best part is that one can never get bored throughout the trip . at the time of any difficulty you have people around you to help out so that make one of the problem solved automatically . it make sense economically . everybody pool in the money and so the total cost go down considerably.e.g : travel cost , stay cost , wining and dining cost . when these thing are taken altogether it doe make a bug impact on the budget allocated for the tour . not everyone can travel alone all the time . it cost and boring most of the time . having a guide with the group is extremely helpful a it make the task of locating the place easier . the biggest plus point of having a guide is that the guide give the whole history about the place that we travel to . we get to know about the language and culture in a more firm manner through the guide . that make the task of recognizing and identifying with the people easily . the guide also give suggestion about what to do and what not to do but it can be expected only from very few of them . not every guide take a keen interest . things can be planned out efficiently when in a group . that make the job of makng the decision easier . suggestions can be taken from people in the group and the guide also to if any problem relating to staying , eating or travelling occurs . though travelling alone give the option to be a free bird , the experience of travelling with people is a completely different experience . anytime it weighs over travelling alone .
