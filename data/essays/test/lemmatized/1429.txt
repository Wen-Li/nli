i agree the statement which it is more important for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact . the education polsy which i had passed in post graduated school of the university wa to teach how to think about problem . while i wa post guraduated student , i could n't get new knowledge because professor teach the solution for ploblems i want . instead of answer , professor suggested the way to find hint to me . then , proffssors asked some question for me to identify important thing or not . i have thought why they had not gave student for answer and fact . after i graduated , i found the reason . in societied ; there are verious problem that i do n't resort easily . if i can have ability how to find fact . i could be find th solution . thus , it is more important for student to understand idea and concept than get fact and answer . students must find solution by themselves in order to adopt to the future 's trouble .
