whether most advertisement make the product much better than they really are ? some people may hold the view that davertisement really do some exaggeration to the product , but other people may donot agree with . from my point of view , i really agree with the statement that most advertisement do make product much better than what they really are . the reason for this point are listed a below . to begin with , the first reason for my holding this argument ha do the fact that most of advertisement just give some introdution to the good respect of the product , but never mention the side-funtion of the product . for example , you can never find the defeat of the computur though the advertisement of the leveno 's computur and you will be told that some kind of nutrion will do some benefit to your health , but you will regret until you bought them . so , this kind of advertisments make the product seem much better than they really are . another reason for my considering the adertisements always make product seem better than they really are is that the advertisement always exaggerate the quallity of the product and give u some faulse expression on the product . an apt illustrion of this point involves the car industry . some of the advertisement make promise that their product will never have a question and the will always give nice service when there is some question . but what the fact is that many bright brand of car ha question and they are not be found until the accident happens . admittted that the advertisemnts refects the real aspect of the product to some extend , especially for some famouse componies but this can not change the nature of the advertisement . as we all know the nature of the advertisment is to encourage the consumer to buy the product , so if the advertisement can not change the expression of the people ' attitude to the product , this mean the product are not secceed . so , to achieve the ideal effection , most of the advertisement broaden the adverantages of the product and diminish the disadvantiges of the porducts just throuth the artifical method , which always make the product seems more better than they really are . to sum up , from what we have dissussed above , we can draw a conclution that most advertisement make product much better than they really are , not because they the nature of the davertisement , but for the reason that most of the advertisment just give some discribe of the good aspect of the product and to somewhat exaggerate them .
