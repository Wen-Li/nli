joanne smith , who is thirteen year old in winfield , kansas , is a star in her town because of her astounding intelligence . she received a countless number of award from many state competition like spelling bee , junior invetion festival , and so on . according to her mother , heather smith , her daughter went to school and learn based on understanding the idea and concocepts in science , math , and even language art . i agree with the idea that it is more essential for student to comprehend idea and concept of the field that they are learning because it help them correct misunderstanding problem and apply to other subject . first of all , understanding idea and concept help student prevent mistake . to be specific , if student understand simple idea and concept of mathematic , they will not repeatedly make mistake . one of the reason why they get incorrect answer is that they only try to solve the given problem rather than understanding them . to illustrate , when i took geometry in my 9th grade year , it wa hard for me to understand square root because i did not know the meaning of the symbol at all . i just guessed how it wa working by looking at what my friend ' doing . however , everytime i try to solve the problem that are related to square root myself , i alwasy got it wrong . after continuous direction from my teacher , i wa able to understand the concept of square root and never repeat the same mistake again . moreover , if student fully comprehend idea and concept of certain field , they are able to apply the idea to other subject . since all field are carefully related to each other , it is crucial to understand what people are learning . knowing one idea can be meant that they possibly know million of idea . for example , if you know the idea of graph , it can be used in many field such a business , biology , and even music . to elaborate , in business industry , graph is used to research consumer ' preference in current market . in biology , it is used to compare one experiment to another . also it is used to analyze the opinion of audience in musical field which help them pick song to bring in more people . just learning fact doe not improve , it maintains . therefore i believe that it is extremely important for student to understand concept and idea because it corrects mistake and applies to other field .
