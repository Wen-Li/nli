i totally agree that most advetisements make product seem much better than they really are . first of all the purpose of advertisement is to sell through a variety of very convincing argument . they try to answer question like why you should buy my product . how it is more important and ha better quality than any other product on the market . with competition being so high , the focus sometimes shift to a more convincing advertisement a a mean to increase sell and therefore the advertisement exceeds the quality of the product . let consider advil for example . a tv commercial for advil usually protrays someone experiencing an intense pain . the next clip of the commercial would show you that by taking one tablet of advil the pain would completely dissappear . everybody know very well that it doe not work that way but in other to draw people 's attention to the product advertisement have to represent the product in a surreal way . the advertisement in the motor vehecule industry are even more extravagant and surreal . my favorite one is the toyota thundra commercial . in this commercial a toyota thundra pick up truck is dropped over 100 foot from an higher elevation . to everybody 's amazement the truck wa still intact and without a scratch . other commercial would should car driving over water , the most ragged terrain without any problem at all . all those commercial are very misleading . the portrayal of those product exceed their quality . those car commercial far exceed the performance of those vehicule . even though peole are away of those fake computerized based commercial some would buy into them . they help increase not only the performance of the product but the sell . some people would still believe and buy those car with full awareness that the commercial or advertisement are misleading . some would go a far a to say : `` their is nothing important on tv anymore except the commercial . '' in some way they have an intertainment quality that drone people to them . with absolute certainty i would say yes that advertisement make product seem much better than they really are .
