today , people debat either important for student to understand idea and concept or to learn fact . some people claim that it is the most important thing for student to learn fact because learning fact is basement . however i suggest that it is more important for student to understand idea and concept . that is beacuse understanding idea and concept help them to remember more thing and to encourage thier thinking . first of all , last school usually tought student the common fact such a history and principal theory of science and test for student to remmeber learnig thing . but today school teach the reason why the fact happens because it make student not only to know the fact but also to understand idea and concept . for examaple , i remmeber what principal 's graviety is . my teacher explain it 's concept by using experiment . second , understanding idea and cocepts improve for student to have creative and considerable thinking . if you spends lot of time to solve problem and to consider why fact happens , you could feel that your capability of thinking becomes better creative and considerable . thoes are why i claim that it is more important for student to understand idea and concets than to learn fact . i believe that student learn the fact by understanding the fact 's concept . that help student to remmeber the fact longer and to understand other fact more easy
