i agree with the statement that successful people try new thing and take risk rather than only doing what they already know how to do well a the following reason . first , trying new thing and taking risk give u new oppotunities to success . for example , when i wa a senior student in waseda university , a private university in tokyo , japan , i went to yeonse university , a private university in seoul , south korea for study for a year . at that time , economy in tokyo wa not so bad and i had some chance to get job instead of flying to overseas . but i did not enter the company in japan and visited korea because i wanted to learn korean language and culture very much and expand my horizen . actually , that wa very risky for me , because i did not have any preparation after i graduated from korean university . however , i have never lose my job since i graduated from the university . additionally , i found my wife in korea too . if i would have not been to korea , i could not have gotten such a happy life . so i believe that trying new thing and taking risk is important for being successful people . second , trying new thing and taking risk can be a chance to find people 's own preference . for example , i have changed my job three time . this is not a commen in my county , japan , at my age 30 . but , finally i can say with confidency that i could find my best job that i would do this job until i would be able to work . so , i believe that if people want to success , they need to try new thing and take risk . in conclusion , i strongly believe that successful people try new thing and take risk rather than only doing what they already know how to do well . i will try to enter mba course next year . this would be a risk .
