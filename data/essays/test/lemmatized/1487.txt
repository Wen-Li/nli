referring to the statement that it is of more importance for student to understand the idea and reason behind a certain topic than it is for them to learn the fact i can agree in a way but not absolutely . there are two side of the coin and to me this statement is not very well developed and considered . we have different topic and subject with different requirement of knowledge for each single one of them . to me the mixure of both , understanding the idea/concepts and the fact , is what make your knowlegde about a topic absolutely reliable . if someone asks the student to explain a certain issue the student need to know all the background information and then try to show practical evidence to underline that it is totally right what wa said . in history class for example you need to explore the circumstance and reason why a certain event took place or why it wa time for a new era-i would consider those question a fact but also in a way a an idea how to solve a problem . then a student can learn about plan which help trying to realize certain thing . therefore you need to know about both to be well informed . in chemistry you first need to know about the appearance and ` character ' of an element before you can experiment with it . here it is absolutely neccessary to do those experiment to increase the understanding of the topic . in maths a student also need to know a definition of a problem and how to come to a solution before it will be solved . ideas and concept are in advantage when it come to learning because student are stimulated not only by learning it theoretically but by using different sens such a touching , hearing and speaking . they get the chance to experience something in a practical way . but if you see , hear thing or learn about something you should also know why you hear or see it-here we come to the point of learning fact . to come to a conclusion both aspect are important to study a topic in a serious way and then consequently you will get the ultimate result of reliable knowledge which you can pas on to others .
