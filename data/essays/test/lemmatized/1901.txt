yes , i strongly agree with this statement . most of the company which aim for huge profit rely on the advertisement of their product . advertisement is one of the mean of medium for promoting a product into the public . inorder to withstand the tough market competition many company try to display their product entirely different from the original . the ultimate goal of these company is to attract the common man by alluring them with these type of fancy and false advertisement . advertisements in the previous year used to be simple and were only through news paper and tv commercial . but due to the increase in market and competition among company , product are now advertised through large banner and hoard . they display the product in such a way that it draw the public attention . though the product is not so effective and reliable , they are presented in a such a way that every customer get tempted to buy them . i would like to cite one example that a close friend of mine experienced . he bought a new car by seeing an advertisement in the tv and also came to know about it by the large hoarding and picture posted through out the city junction . he wa satisfied by seeing the configuration and other specification mentioned and shown in the advertisement . only after buying the car he came to know that everything that wa shown wa false and misleading . the car wa found to be a little bit smaller and of le comfort than expected . though he complained to the company regarding this everything went into vain . the reason for giving this example is never mislead or get away with the commercial advertisement . there is an old saying whose essence is that `` never believe a thing by seeing it from outside , trust only when you knew it from inside '' . this indicates the disadvantage of having advertisement . this can be avoided by buying a product only after you talked about it with your friend or people from the industry . another mean is to avoid this false tactic by the advetising company . government should impose severe regulation and charge penalty from company for following these tactic . advertisements should be meant only for presenting the actual product but not the modifed one which misleads bthe public . every company should keep this in mind and serve for the society .
