it 's not reasonable to say there will be fewer car in use than there are today in twenty year . for one thing , many contries are still worried about their hibernating people . there could be full of car in developing contries in twenty year . more and more people in europe do not buy personal car for reason such a environmental problem . so , it is may be true that there will be fewer car in europe in twenty year . but the scientist are inventing car that use different fuel . and these new car will pollute much le than before . and otherthan the developed country , it is even a question whether there will be fewer car in us in twenty year . someone said , americans are cowboy who ride their iron horse . they owns the biggest number of car in the world . one american family at least owns 1.5 car in average . and because of america welcome the immigration . it is quite possible the number of car in america will not decreased in twenty year . furthermore , it is even possible that there will be more car in us in the future . cannada and some other developed country have similar situation . the critical flaw of this idea the people live in developing coutries . there are more people live in developing country than developed contries today . many of the country are developing very fast . for instance , normal people in china and india may capable to buy their car in twenty year . that 's numerous of car . the decreased number of car in the developed coutries can not compare with this number . and africa may have a chance to enlarge this number . in conclution , there will be more car in use than there are today .
