there is no doubt that i support the idea that peaple will succeed when they try new thing , rather than only taking advantage of their current knowledge . i point out two reason below . first of all , if peaple do not challenge new thing , they cannnot widen their knowledge . i would like to say that successful peaple try new thing by using their current knowledge and obtain new knowledge and experience . in my experience , i wa in charge of a new project , which nobody in our company did . honestly , i thought that the project is not my current business directly . but undertaking the new project , i obtained many knowledge and connection between the project member , who i had not talked with . even after i finished the project , the knowledge and the coneection i have gotten from the experience is very useful for my current role . second of oll , people not trying to challenge new thing may tend to narrow their perspective , the way of thinking . in my office , there is a professonal person who is in charge of same task for about ten year . he can do undertake only his task perfectlly . but it is the problem . he in confident to his skill of his task and tend to be obstacle . and then he doe not want to change his way , or improve it . it mean that progress would stop in that area , that would lead to declining . so i definitelly mention that people should try to do something new to make a progress of their skill . and that lead to big success .
