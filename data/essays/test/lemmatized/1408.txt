i agree with the statement that successful people try new thing and take risk rather than only doing what they already know how to do well . one of the reason why i believe this statement is true is the fact that although you might do well with one thing , trying out something new could get you result even greater than what you are doing right now . if you are e.g. good at baking cooky a an employee at a bakery , you can continue what you are doing and you will always do the same thing and probably earn the same salary . however , if you decide to let somebody else bake the cooky and you start your own bakery , do the admininstration , advertising , figure out the logistics , etc. you can realize that you 're even a good a with the baking part or even better and you can increase your profit and be more successful . and later on you could start a catering service which us your skill of coordinating a food business in order to diversify and get even more successful . another reason why i support this statement is that taking risk can provide you with more success than if you are doing the same thing you are good at all over again . if you take risk you have the possibility of a great outcome , which is especially true in the stock market . if you are willing to invest your money in high risk portfolio , the risk of losing your money is great , but so is your chance of getting a very profitable return . this way you have higher profit margin and are way more successful than conservative investor who always rely on `` safe '' alternative , with which they are doing well , but not a well a the first group of investor mentioned above . trying out a lot of new thing leaf people more flexible and get them more successful this way . this way they can figure out how to best use their ability . so if somebody is good at teaching , but after being burned out after several year of stressful teaching , she or he decides to become a child 's psychologist , this can be a very succesful switch in their career . so this person stay successful by trying out something new and taking the risk of the career switch . the same is true when trying out new thing people can be very successful a this allows them to adapt to market change . one decade internet start-ups are very lucrative , but by being flexible and taking risk people can switch their career to a different field after a couple of year and so escape the possible financial disaster right on time during the dotcom bubble . these are 4 valid reason why i believe that the above mentioned statement is true .
