nowadays , there is a big and important controversy centering on which is more important for student , to understand idea and concept or to learn fact . a large proportion of people contend that the emphasize shoule be put on the idea and concept . other people , on the other hand , argue that fact are more eccential . before renderring my opinion , i think it is more prudent and circumspect to take a look on the arguements on both side . people who advocate that idea and concept are more critical believe that without idea and concept nothing can go any further correctly and advancingly . as we may remember , our test book abounds with a great many idea and concept which help u greatly in our future study or even career , such a the defenitions in our physical book . in the construction , a bridge or building is built according to the defenition in the book . people who are in favor of the idea that fact are much more indispensable think that if a idea or concept go without a fact is totally nonsence , so people have to pay a great attention to learn fact . it is true , the usefulness of thing always come the first . so sometimes the fact is in the first place . facts are the important basic of any idea or concept . statistic report ha shown that sometimes a fact give birth to a idea or concept . if you can see that , you will have no problem to understand that fact have their own importance . consequently , taking into account of all the reason discussed above , we may safely draw the conclusion that both the idea or concept and the fact are both of great importance , without any of them , nothing could be achieved . so student should learn the conbination of both idea or concept and fact .
