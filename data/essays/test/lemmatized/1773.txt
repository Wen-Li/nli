as a tourist who ha traveled several country , travelling should be guided by tour guide . so that , i definitelly agree about this topic . especially , travel to abroad need guide for several reason . first , giude know which place whether it is safe or not . if i travel by myself without a guide , i might have lack of knowledge where i 'm traveling . for example , walk street alone which is known a much thief actively move or travel a mountain known a bear appears often . to prevent this happening , guid should follow u and lead u safety region . second , this is the strongest opinion why i suggest hire guide . my family usually go abroad in vacation . we used to accompany with a guide . one day , to save the cost of guidance , my mom decided to travel ourselves . my family tried to indicate important place for visitor . moreover , we tried asking tourist center to get information about the place . after the leisure period and get back to home , we noticed that our travel is n't that satisfactable . we watched toursit channel that intoduces where we 've travelled ourselves . the program showed u amazingly beautiful place that we 've never been or heard . since we did n't hire a guide who know the place a much a resident . third , new comer do n't know the cost in another country . they even do n't know they are buying meal and good with higher price . to avoid wasting of money by buying thing with more expensive , we have to follow with a guide . then i 'm sure we can enjoy shopping with proper price . someone might think travelling with guide is useless . however , i think going somewhere with a guide who know the place well is not wasteful . to make the travel enjoyable , memoriable and valuable then go with guide . they will lead you to unexpectable wonderful place and
