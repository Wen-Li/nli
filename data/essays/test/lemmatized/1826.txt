some people agree that the travel led by a tour guide is more effective than self-palnned tour . however , i firmly believe that if you study yourselves a lot of information about the touring site , you can enjoy a joyful trip , . besides , if you travel with a guide , it can be harmful for your joy and he/she can intervene in your trip . first of all , travelling is the optimal opporttunity to think myself and develop myself by learning a lot of thing such a indepence . that is , if you can prepare for the trip sufficiently , you do n't need a tour guide . for example , when i have traveled in europe last year , i had to prepare thoroughly and study a lage amount of the site where i would visit . it wa very impressive experience me because i can go through a lot of hardship such a a miss of road . if i had travel in a group led by guide , i could not learn a living knowledge and improve my indepence . in addition , if i can go om a trip with familiar friend without a guide , wh can enjoy whatever we want , it mean that tour guide can interrupt our liberty of the tour schedule . in my experience , when i wa traveling in a thiwan with my friend , i had to follow the guided schedule , it wa very exhausted and i could nor enjoy my trip a weel a concontrate on any beautiful scene since we have to move all over the site planned by schedule . therefore , my familiy came dome with a sickness after the trip . if it had not bene for the tour guide we can enjoy more leisurely and comfortably , consequently , i sincerely believe that a group led by a tour guide can not be a best way to travel . not only people can not have a opportunity to develop their indepence and their own time , but they can also interrupted their comfortable trip by a guide . therefore , the best way to travel is studying yourselves a lot of thing about your touring area and planning on your own . then , it can be a more fruitful and comfortable trip .
