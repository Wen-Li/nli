successfull people in my opion , successful people try new thing and take a risk rahter than only doing what they already know how to do well . because if they do n't do that they ca n't developed themselves . the reason of their success , she or he think new thing before no one think . or to ha a brave to try new thing . for example , in turkey we have a mega star , tarkan . he is more successful than other singer . why is he more different than the others for u ? when he started his career , he made an amazing kind of music . it did n't same the others . also he had a different hair and dress style . all of them made him fantastic for u . after him , every new singer wanted look like him . they seemed like copy . the used same music , same style . but tarkan made a new thing again that wa an untriedfull video . he used a naked person in his music video . he took a risk because it wa the first for turkey and it could be very dangerous to use naked person in turkey for him . but if he did n't try it , he would n't be a mega star . all of the thing can show u , taking risk and trying new thing make people successful . but also we must n't forget when we do something we have to make it very well if want to be success .
