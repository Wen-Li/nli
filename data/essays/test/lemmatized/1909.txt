in contemporary western society , largely dominated by individualistic value and good level of wealth , it is surely true that the people , and the young people in particular , feel le linked to the community in which they live . therefore , many people consider le important to actively participate to collective life and to directly manage surrounding problem than to attend their personal ambition and trouble . obviously , young people generally think that , having a future to build for themselves , they have a special right for this egoistic attitude , in particular during the last year , when the educational and professional training is quite long and hard and the job market is really tight . being a generation that had the luck to grow , on average , with many economic and material advantage , if compared with their parent and grandparent , nowadays young people could feel that the matter involving the community are not a dircet concerne for themselves . it is usual to hear people stating that the responsability to resolve collective problem , form the biggest ( such a crime , or natural disaster ) to the smallest ( minor trouble in local infrstructures , for example ) , is a burden of the official authority and the institution . thence , the personal contribution that a person can give to his community is dramatically underscored , and the possibility to learn through direct experience helping the others , that could be very important for the youngest , too . i belive that the only effective way to front this problem is to educate boy and girl to consider their life and personal project for the future a strongly linked with their community , in which they could become , when ther are adult , citizen and professional with big responsabilities .
