some people believe that learning fact is more important , however i have a different opinion . there are several reason to support that understanding idea and concept are more vital to the studends . first of all , based on the idea and concept , they could figure out how to process in any field in spite of any fact . also they could get more specific information such a fact thorugh group activity like team project but not alone because they hardly confer the idea and concept only by the fact . in addition , those idea and concept make them understood not only in one field where those can be apply to but also in another one with the process of understanding . even they coud know whether it is correct or not by proving the the idea and concept in some group activties like discussion and argument . finally , applying to other field with the idea and concept could give them some ability such a imagination and creativity to develop new idea . therefore i strongly agree the statement because it is necessary for them to learn more in any field . through understanding the idea and concept . they could develop new , better idea
