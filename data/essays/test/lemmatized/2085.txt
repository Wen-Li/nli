in daily life , society is divided on major issue involving konwing the fact or the concept . as what ha been come up with , when you have been brought into the problem focus that which is more important between the concept and the fact . what is your opinion and what is your standpoint ? with all aspect taken into account , i disagree the statement that understanding idea and concept is more essential than learning fact . my reason are a follow . to begin with , an old saying that acions speak louder than word , that mean fact in activity is much more important than thinking of concept on paper . giving a specfic example for this point , if student only learn the concept of ice , which is a special stage of water when the tempertare below the zero , however , they can not image what is the shape and color of the ice , in other word , in their brain do not a specific form of the ice . so , fact is an indispensable part of our study , particularly in the science study , this is the reason why we have the lab experience . for example , when we learn a new concept of work in physicse , we know there are two major condition of work : energy and movement for a distance . but , knowing this is not satsified , for we must get the fact of how work happen , and what can make energy , which is much more useful than having the concept of work . another reason cn be seen by everyone is that learning fact is more useful than having the idea in the daily life . as we know , in our life , we must maintain different skill for living , such a cooking , driving . i once expericed a real about my classmate in the high school . every day , she read a cooking book for a long time , because she wanted to cook delicuous food for u when the new year come . in the end , she could not cook a meal , because she even though did not know what wa sugar or salt . this is a good example in our life , for many time we can the idea about one thing but we connot do because we do not get the fact of it . actually , we often ignore the importance of the fact . every coin ha two side . some people claim the concept of an object is quite essential , because it ont onlycan provide a idea of one thing , but also can indicate u to perform action . however , a for me , when we get the right fact of one thing , then we can take action , otherwise it should be failed . from what i have discussed above we can attain that learning fact is more important than having concept , because it make much sense in our life a a right indicator , therefore i reinforce my standpoint a learing fact a my choice .
