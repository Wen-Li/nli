i agree that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide . there are three reason . first , traveler do n't know the detail of place where they visit . they ca n't visit all the famous place because they spend time to decide the place they go . but , in the tour they do n't need to choose the place where they go . theremore , the place where is decided by a tour guide are standard and famous place for sightseeing . we can ask a tour guide if we have place where we want to go . secondly , the travel in a group keep the cost cheaper then the travel individual . we can discount the cherge , for example , hotel , plane , entrance fee and so on . in general , it is cheaper to take a lot of tikets than to take a tiket . thirdly , in a group trip , people do n't concerned about everything . for example , in parsonal trip , people must search the way to place they want to go . until they arraive at goal , they worry the way is correct . in a group trip , a tour guide lead u to the goal . we only enjoy sightseeing , eating or playing at the goal . we do n't waste the time for concerning . therefore , the best way to travel is in group led by a tour guide .
