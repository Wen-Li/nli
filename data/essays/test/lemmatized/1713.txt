i agree that young people do not give enough time to helping their community . although i think that it ha not always been this way . due to the technological invention and to cultural change , the important aspect of life in the eye of young people have changed . whereas helping in a community and being active a a volonteer ha been quite common some year ago , young people nowadays prefere spending money , and having a much free time a they can have . in order to afford all good which they assume to be necessary , they start working very early . they are convinced that being wealthy and showing it fulfills them with joy and happiness . in the meantime they neglect that this emotional profit can also be achieved differntly . to young people `` profit '' often equal money . to my mind , profit ha it meaning in a whole other aspect . my understanding of profit is to enlarge the joy and happiness of the largest number of people possible . helping in community a a volonteer is one of the best way to achieve this goal and to enlarge the resented happiness around me . the contanct to other people and the offerred help for example contribute a lot to this goal . the fact that nowadays money ha become more and more important and the it could even be stated that `` money rule the world '' is a sad development . qualities such a loyalty and friendship have been exchanged by egoism and the desire to be rich in a materialistic way . being rich in non-materialistic way is nothing to aim at anymore . i am convinced that young people have to make up their mind and seriously overthink what they have been doing . the should reflect the real importance of being alive . possessing a lot of money can definately not be the reason for being living in a community . a communitiy is a group where many people should feel home and be happy . all member of it should contribute a much a they are capaple to make the living a beautiful a it can be .
