nowdays many people think young people do n't spend enough time to help their community . i do n't find my self compleatly agree with this statement . i am 26 year old and i have many friend of my same age that work in their free time in carities association and i did too in the past . anyway i can see that more and more people just take care of their self , specially young people . i worked a volonteed for caritas in my own town for a few year . i wa spending there 2 hour per week each week , but then when i started the university , i moved in bologna , i could n't save any time to work a volonteer and i stopped . at this point , me and my family decided to adopt a child in bangladesh , in this way i feel le guilty when i think to how many pooor people there are in world . some people can object that i choose the easiest way . i could find something more close to me , and i think this is quite true . there are may old people in my little country that need help : a for example keeping their company , going to the supermarket , or going to the porst office , but i ca n't handle it . i do n't have time enough for that . anyway adopt a child is better that nothing . i have a few friend that help old people in their own city , or their grandparent at home . i think young people are sensible to the problem of their comunities , just if their own family let them be sensible to them , because the society doe n't give you any input about that kind problem , the society nowdays is too caotic and led you this just to money , and power . i think young people would spend more time helping their comunities if they will be sensiblized to that kind of problem .
