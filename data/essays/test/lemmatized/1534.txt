most of the time , there are two way of teaching . the first way could be to expose the fact and discribe these fact . the second wy could be the explanation of idea and concept . some subject , a history imply the student to learn the fact . other subject , a philosophy , imply student to learn idea in one side but also to understand these idea and concept . in fact we can see those two way of teaching in the same subject . to my mind , i think that it is interesting to learn fact . facts , in the past , help u to understand the present time . in history for example leaning the fact could help u to understand the present time . moreover when we learn fact , we learn their process , their consequence on our time . it help student to understand the wolrd where they are living . for example learning the fact of the second worl war is really interesting for an european student because he can see , firts , the history of his country , second , what wa the childood of his grand parent who can explain cont to him this period . economics is an interesting subject when we learn the fact . we can understand what is the origin of our socity and of our economy . we can also analize how the economy ha progressed for the ninetenth century . learning the fact is a good way too to imagine what will happen in the future . but , i think that it is more important to understand idea and concept . i think that some people by their idea , their genus played an important place in the history . for example , aristote had a special view of the literature and yhe philosiphy which is still today a model for the writters . it is very important to learn the idea end the concept of p [ eople who were a genius because they discovered thing which have an impact today . moreover some concept seam to be eternal . for example artits are eternal by their work . according to me , it is more important to understand fact and concept because they the produce of a reflection . in general , they have no effect of destruction
