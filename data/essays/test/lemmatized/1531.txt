if we are talking about different way of learn , i agree with the idea of understand any topic , because the memory always forget anything the you do not learn well . but there are some case that you do not have another option that hold idea in your mind , even if you don not know what doe mean . we get information from the school , but we need to understand that information not only save it . this is a bad custum that we learn mostly the time on school and even in the house . to really learn something we have to take a period of time , according with the person to analyze the information given . after of this we can say that we learn something new . understand idea give you the power to get the point of this idea , no matter if it is change it ( the problem whre you suppose to use the idea ) . moreover it give you the possibily to disscuss these idea with other person and increase your power of understanding . even you can explain it at any time without loose it , becuase you did not memoryze it . about undertand concept , i think the is the goal of any subject , becasue how suppose that i will use a concept if i really do not how it mean . that 's why understanding is better . another hand learn fact , it is a easy way to get idea , but if you have to explain it in a different way that you receive it , maybe it can be difficult or impossible to do it or if you forgot it , you could not be able to resolve this problem . finally i give my summary about this statement , i think that both are way to study or learning and it depend of the subject is the way the you are going to choice what is better to your performance on the school . for experience i prefer understand idea and c
