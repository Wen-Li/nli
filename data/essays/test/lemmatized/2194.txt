people like to excel in different field in their life becuase they want have a decent life , earn a great income and occupy a respectable position in society . therefore , broading knowledge of many acadamic subject is better for many reason such a gaining more creativity and having higher expectation . a person who have a broad knowledge can be very creative because he can join between different subject to get to a new conclusion and it might be considered a a new invention . for example , if a person study a a doctor and a computer engineering at the same time , he will be able to use the technology provided be computer to create new tool that serf his need a a doctor and help him do his job more accurately . broading knowledge can make the person have higher expectation and make him think about a brighter future . moreover , he can dream about a world of his own where he might need something that doe n't exist in the real world so he invents it , and that 's where the creativity play it part . imagine a world without creativity or ambition , that will lead the world to a complete standstill . that 's why there are people who dream to get a higher eductaional level and earn different major because they want the world to stay vital and alive . finally , in my opinion , i think it is a good idea for the person to broaden his knowledge , not only acadamically , but also in the practical life because life is like a journey , you always learn from it . on the other hand , a person should be aware not to get lost into his dream and ambition and he should always think about the real world for every person in this world ha his own limit but knowledge is unlimited ; it is endless .
