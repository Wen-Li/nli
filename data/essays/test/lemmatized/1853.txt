success is , for a person , what he defines it to be . to succeed , a person might resort to use tried and tested way , which have little risk and a fair chance of success . another way is to risk it all and try new thing . i agree with the statement . successful people try new thing and take risk rather than doing what they already know how to do well . pioneers are people who are first in doing something . pioneers have done what is new and that which hasnt been done before . pioneers would n't be pioneer if they were not willing to risk it in doing something that wa n't done before . to support my stand , i would like to use the example of dhirubhai ambani , the founder of reliance group of industry . he wa a person who took whatever risk were requred and made it big . he knew that by doing what he wa doing , he could never become succesful , alhough he did it well . he decided to try his luck and he risked it all by trying new business . the result wa tremendous success . once someone attains success in a field , it doesnt take time for the others to catch up . in order to stand out from the crowd , to attain great success , a person mu7st be willing to come out of his `` comfort-zone '' , and try something new , keeping in mind the risk involved . the outcome might not always be success , but it is always worth giving a shot . doing what you know , all the time , for the rest of your life is not really an interesting prospect for me . life becomes too monotonous . change is always for the better and to succeed , a change is required at a certain point of time . in my opinion , it is alright to take a risk in doing something , but one ha to be sane enough to not underestimate the effect of the risk . to succeed , risk should be taken , but never to the extreme .
