i would not favorite a traveling in a group with a guide . once in my trip to austrailia , i had hard time touring . i could not look around the place i wanted to visit . the guide also made me to spend money . i would never go on such a travel again . i did not feel free during the visit in the austrailia . in the zoo , i wa not allowed to see animal except koala and kangeroos . we also spent only an hour and half in the zoo . it wa a little annoying that the guide tell u what to do or how to do . moving in group wa also uncomfortable . i could not talk personally in the bus . i needed to be quiet too . most of the adult were asleep while moving . the sight of the austrailia wa beautiful and all . however , i could not enjoy myself during the vacation due to the group led by a tour guide . the expense of the traveling also increased . according to a research done by korean journalist in josun ilbo , the amount of money spent increased when traveling with the guide . the reason is that the guide always temp the guest to by gift or decorative thing that are useless . about 82 percent of the people responded that they bought a gift that wa unneccesary . this is all because of the travel guide , who is trying to gain good by selling the gift to the guest . i had experienced once , and spent 50 dollar on a useless decoration . so i did not travel with a guide while the visit in new york city . and this time , i did not consumed anything unneccesary . traveling is to relax and enjoy themselves . the vacation should not be interrupted . traveling in group may feel really uneasy . i can not enjoy my private time . also , i do not need any travel guide that always require money , and temp me to spend some . i would like a vacation for myself , that is not bothered by anything or anybody .
