which way do you prefer to travel ? personally , i have expereinced both way of travelling . however , i would choose to travel in a group with a tour guide . there are abundant benefit i get from travelling this way . if i travel in a group led by a guide , i can visit most of the crucial and prominent monument and city . due to the fact that the guide is very familiar with the famous place , we can go to fabulous place without any help or difficulty . furthermore , when we travel individually or in group without a guide there are many disadvantage . primarily , even though we visit well known place , we wo n't be able to know the historical fact unless we search for them in the internet . in my opinion , we should know historical name and people that is related with the monument we look at . finally , by travelling in a group i can get to know the people i am travelling with . as we talk and experience conventional and ritual tradition during the trip , we can know about other people . perhaps , after the trip we can still be friend and call each other and talk about interestin stuff . for example , i wa in japan few month ago without any guide . my family could n't speak any japanese and were unfamiliar with japanese culture . there were a lot of difficulty in travelling . we were n't sure where to go and the transportation wa so complicated that we lost ourselves in the subway station . even though we went to several temple and monument , we did n't know any historical fact about it . looking without knowing what it is wa very unfamiliar to me and our family . to sum up the reason why i would prefer to travel in a group with a tour guide : foremost , i would n't have a lot of difficulty in travelling . also , we can be more receptive with information about prominent place . last , i can get to know people in the group i am travelling with .
