specializing in one academic subject ensures that you have excelled in a specific area in life . - something that distinguishes you and make you stand out in one area . in today 's world , everything ha become so interconnected and everythings is intertwined - we are inevitably exposed to new idea and we therefore do have an extensive understanding of the world to some extent i disagree with this statement a i believe that it is better to specialize in one specific subject . my reasoning for this argument , is that in today 's world , we are inevitably exposed to broader subject . for example , with the television and the internet , and we are therefore no longer restricted to consuming information on a specific subject and we come out with a more extensive understanding of the world , that may not necessarily be presented in an academic institution . secondly , i believe that a a person excells in a specific academic subject , he or she is ha excelled in a specific area in life . for example , whether it is science and learning about the characteristic of what make up the world we live in , or whether it is history and learning about our past , what distiguishes u a a human being , and how our world ha evolved throughout time , they are two subject that are complimentary in some manner . when specializing in a specific subject , a person is able to distinguish him or herself in comparison to another individual by having excelled in a specific subject . by excelling in a subject such a science , this individual ha an extensive understanding of how our world work and what characterizes it . they understand the distinct characteristic and fact , and therefore become proffessionals that are educated about a specific subject . same go to an individual studying a subject like history . he or she is able to become a proffessional in a subject where it is absolutely essential to know the detail and the characteristic of . furthermore , by having a broad knowledge of subject , a person loses his or her individuality and to some extent , are no longer distinguishable . more importantly , in today 's world , we are exposed to the broader knowlege of the world . we are living in a globalized world , and therefore , we are exposed to such thing such a the internet and television , and travelling , that we are inevitably educated about subject in a broader sense . we are no longer constrained to a certain subject and we are therefore inevitably exposed to new information . specializing in a specific subject is very important a it is a way of distinguishing an individual in comparison to another . furthermore , a we are living in an extensively globalized world today , there is no need for specialization .
