considering the existing petroleum resource will be eventually used up within decade , it is possible that in twenty year , there will be fewer car running on the street than today . also , if we take into account that people may be more conscious about the pollution and damage caused to the environment while we are driving , it also may result in the overall increase in the usage of the public transportation in the future . perhaps , people might even think about switching to bike instead , resulting in the overall number of car being used to decrease sharply . this is only one possibility of how the story may end . if we turn to see what is on the other side , there may lie an entirely different answer . knowing the consequence of driving , what it can do to the remaining natural resource and our environment , measure have been taken to avoid further damage a well a to seek our solution for our future . speaking from the environmental perspective of the matter , for example , i have seen on the news people are starting to purchase permit to emit carbon dioxide into the atmosphere or by taken action by growing more tree , hoping to do their share of saving the environment . although these are just small step , but i am optimistic that in the future , we will find many other method that we can involve more people into protecting the earth . therefore , simply because someone is concerned with what their driving to work is doing to the environment , instead of giving up driving entirely , they might just take on other action to lessen their guilt . having addressed the problem concerning pollution , the other problem with driving in the future is that we will eventually run out of petroleum . luckily , we seem to have found the solution to this problem . in recent year , researcher in many field have tried to find alternative method and resource to replace petroleum in the future . for instance , using solar energy could be a possible method . in the department of mechanical engineering of national taiwan university , a professor ha led his student to complete a project , building a car that run on solar panel , and that turned out to be a success , winning international award and recognition . who is to say what else can happen in the future , in this day of rapid technological revolution ? if that project can extend further , making the solar energy car available to everyone , it is very likely that people would not want or have to give up their luxury and comfort of driving . overall , a grim a some of the problem may seem at time , i believe the old saying `` there 's a will , there 's a way '' . human being have proven to have endless capacity , especially at time of need , so who know what the future may bring ? so let 's have our finger crossed , and i bet in twenty year , there would still be a much car running on the street , if not more .
