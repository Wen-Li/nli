students must keep on learning and thinking . some knowledge that they gain are through understanding idea , othres are from leraning fact . although both way of gaining knowkedge is important , i believe that it is more important for student to understand idea and concept than to learn fact . first , understanding make easier to memorize thing . there are many thing in the textbook that student must memorize . it is almost impossible to memorize the huge amount of information provided in the book without carefully organizing them . understanding idea and consepts are the way to organize the fact you learn . second , understanding concept enables you to apply your knowledge in a situaton which you have never been in . since idea and concept are not restricterd to a particular situation . ideas and concept you have will enable you to analyse the situation and to make logical explanation to the incident , and finally give you the answer how to behave . third , it is essential to understand idea and concept to create something new . many innovation in technology came from the minute study of concept and idea . for example , the invention of mri would not have been possible wothout the understanding the concept of quantom mechanism . understanding idea and concept are of great importance to student in helping them organize their knowledge , applying their knowledge , and to innovate new thought and material .
