now a day advertising field is the most profitable field a all of u know because any product will be released into the market with proper advertisement and promos . i agree with the statement that most of the advertisement make the product seem much better than they really are because of the reason mentioned below . first of all the reason for thinking that most of the advertisement are making their product seem much better than they really are is that the advertisement are showing the product in the television or through any other communicational medium for the sake of selling that product so they are using many advertisement strategy for making people think that their product is better over others . so they will make a time limit for that product and there will be a limited time for that particular advertisement to show case itself , so most of the commercial are advertising their produts facility in a very stylish manner r only by highlighting it most known feature . second the company that are advertising the product will hire a prominent brand ambassador for the advertising that particular product and when people see the advertisement thay will be impressed by the thing that were said in the advertisement by the person and will be impressed with the product . by watching these costly advertisement and promos about the product people will be ready to buy the product . but mainly we should remember that it is our job to find out about the product abut which the advertisement are being shown and by really finding out abou the product we can buy those product . in conclusion it true that most advertisement are making their product seem much better than they really are because of the reason like making the product to sale , and out run their rival product , and to capture the market share an for many more reason . but it will be on u to find out about the product befo
