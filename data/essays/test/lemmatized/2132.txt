i do agree with this statement . indeed , i think that the growing awareness of the harm brought about by car combined with the new mean of transport that are more and more used , there will be fewer car in use in about twenty year . nowadays , there are a lot of city-policies that tend to limit the use of car in the big city . for example , in paris , there are more and more bill that want to increase the use of the transport a bus or tramway and prevent car from parking - and thus from being in paris - by diminishing the number of parking place . in london there are also policy aiming at eliminating gradually the car from the city . these example can show the beginning of the political caution to bring better living condition in the city . but what 's really important is that politician and citizen are aware of the harm engendered by car over the environment by polluting it , and over human themselves , provoking lot of deadly accident . moreover , car can graudually be replaced by other transport mean , a bus , tramway , train , plane . indeed , what 's people want is to have comfortable and cheap travel . driving is not really comfortable , and very expansive . furthermore , there is a soar in the supply of cheap flight and people travel more and more by plane , that is more confortable and quite fast . and this supply corresponds to people 's demand . indeed , people now hesitate to take the car when it come to a hours-lasting travel . that 's why i think in twenty year , there would be more cheap and effective flight than now . but bus , tramway and train can also take more place in our live and replace car for two reason : the policy that tend to eliminate the car from the city because of the pollution , and the place they take , and also because they tend to be faster and faster , with way reserved to this mean of travelling , and the fund allocated by the state . because the car represent such disavantadges , i do think that people will gradually get rid of them and use other mean that are not only more comfortable but also cheaper and faster than car .
