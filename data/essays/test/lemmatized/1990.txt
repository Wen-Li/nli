having knowledge about many acedemic subject may seem appealing . however , trying to learn information about many subject will raise the risk of missing important detail about a subject . additionally , trying to learn many thing may become boring where a studying a subject that really catch your interest is fun . furthermore specializing in one specific subject will make a person more successful in that area and present advantage like making a career in that subject . as a result , in order to avoid the risk that are raised by trying to learn about many subject and to gain other advantage , i believe that having specialized knowledge in one specific subject is more preferable . to begin with , in order to have knowledge of many academic subject , one ha to omit the detail . however these detail may be very important to that subject . to illustrate , a student may try to know little about all of his/her subject . while trying to do this , s/he may miss important point of the subject and s/he may end up with not being successful at any of these subject . instead , if s/he try to gain more knowledge in one specific subject , s/he will be appreciated for his/her talent in that subject . secondly , there are many different academic subject and we may not be interested in all of these subject . if we continue trying to learn thing about the subject which we do n't like at all , we will be bored at the end . we may even give up studying the subject we like . on the other hand , studying a subject which is interesting for u can be really fun . obviously having fun while studying will result in a much more effective learning . finally , having detailed knowledge in one specific subject is very beneficial in the way it give the opportunity to further specialize in that subject . for example , in software engineering , there are many area on which you can focus your study . if you choose one of these subject to become specialized , you have the chance to further improve your ability in that subject . as a result , after graduation you will be an expert in your area and this will increase the job opportunity presented to you . in conclusion , trying to have broad knowledge about many subject ha disadvantage that can not be ignored . in contrast , having specialized knowledge in one specific subject ha the benefit of being appreciated for your success in that subject , making the learning process more fun , and presenting further career opportunity . for these reason , i do n't agree with the idea of having broad knowledge of many subject is better than specializing in one subject .
