advertising is the new industry ruling our economy . the technologic advance in the telecommunication and medium make the advertisement available to vast populatios , hence more effective . incredible amount of money spent each and every year to produce and publish advertisement on newspaper , television , bilboards and so on . this expansion in the advertisement industry is because it is understood by large firm that how easy it is to change the attitude or demand of the peolple by use of colorful , interesting slogan and picture . unfortunately , most of these colorful and entertaining advertisement are full of lie . first of all the effect of the product are exagrated most of the time . we see on the tv that a detergent can wash away all kind of dirt and remnant with only submerging the clothes in to the water . we get amazed by this news , run to a super market , buy a package of that detergent but eventually we are disappointed by the resulting stain on our clothes . we understand that it is no different than other similiar detergent . ofcourse , they are not . but the producer have to differantiate their product somehow and make the customer choose their product rather than million of similiar product on the shelf of the supermarket . this effort can be understandable . in my opinion the customer have the responsibility to be aware of such possibility and be more concious . on the other hand , the ingredient of the product are altered , too . this is a much more important issue and very dangerous for user . the effect can sometimes be exagrated but lying about the ingredient of a product can cause harm to user for example having alergies to certain food or product . finally , legal restriction and strict rule must be applied about advertising by the government to prevent the misleading information about the product in medium . the right of correct information of the customer must be granted . in conclusion , customer should be careful about what they expect and what they will receive while watching the advertisement . they should be aware that nothing in reality would be a attractive a on television or magazine .
