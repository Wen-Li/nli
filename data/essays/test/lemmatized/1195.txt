for a student is very important to learn fact of history , litterature , science , ecc . but at the same tine is fondamental that the student understands ideal and concept for make his own decision . this is a big problem that tuches many international scholls , where teacher do n't care very much about what a student can `` absorve '' from a lesson or from a specific argument that the teacher is going over . there is this problem because the professor are not payed enaught so they lose the `` hinspiration of teaching '' that consist on the dream to make a better future by teaching to the student the wright way to think and to make a choice . for learn fact u have to study the history , and with it u have to understand the concept and than you can be able to make a choice thinking . because is from the folts of the history that you can make a better future . but if you do not know the history you will make the same mistake that people made before you with no learning anything from tham . an example of understanding ideal , is be critical when you read the news in the news paper . so from there you are able to make a thought that will make you able to have a discussion with other people about the same topic . so is better if student learn this a soon a possible . in this way they will be successful .
