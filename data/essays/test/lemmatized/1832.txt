i firmly agree with the statatement that ` it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subject than to specialise in one specific subject ' real life encompasses diverse aspect and it is not possible t0 deal with them with the knowledge of just one . a person with kowledge in numerous field will always be better equipped to handle real life situation than a person specialising in only one field . specialisaton in a particular academic subject cripple the mind and confines the intellect to a bounded region . it prevents the mind to develop in more profound way . by specialising in one area , one is bound to gain , but only in one direction . minds remaining facultioes are wasted and left unexplored . also , academic subject are more or le theoretical . i personally believe that no student ha had enough exposure to decide with surity what he want to do later in life . i will like to illustrate this pont with an example . lets consider a student very intersested in the science . he doe a chemistry major and becomes a researcher . but after becoming a researcher he realises that he doesnot like the redundant and mundane laboratory procedure . he doesnot want to continue with his work . but with only the knowledge of chemistry , it is not possible for him to do anything else . he is now stuck in a profession that he doesnot like for life . but suppose he had also acquired the knowledge of marketing or informaton technology or any other field for that matter , he would definitely have been able to improve upon his situation . life is all about growing and experiencing . the more we learn in life , the more we grow - not only intellectually but also spiritually . the knowledge of myriad subject doesnot only make u a scholar but also make u more aware of everything that life ha to offer and we are able to appreciate it in a more complete way . a broad knowledge of multiflarious academic subject put u in a better position to take a decision of what we want to do further in life . it brings in greater adaptability a well a greater oppotunities . the specialision can be brought in at a professional level . ` i feel it is unfair to deprive a learning mind of knowledge just a it is unfair to deprive a thirsty person of water or a hungry person of food'
