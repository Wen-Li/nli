although i think that learning by fact is more important in the life of student , in my opinion is more important for them undestanding idea and concept than learning fact . there are two fundamental reason for which i think that the understanding is more important that learning . in the first place , a far a i am concerned without idea there are not fact to learn . the most important discovery in the all kind of science there are not possible if there are not based on an idea or a conpcet . we think to the theory of the relativity formulated by albert einstain in 1902 is an example that it can support my opinion . in my view in fact for a student is more important know and understand the process and the question that this theory had opened and developped than know the fact itself . another reason for which i think so is the importance of the immagination and of the creativity . understanding the idea and the concept of the whole world open our mind to new discovery . accordingly the development of the tecnology is possible because of it is based on the study of other people that probably have not had the possibility to continue their study or have not been able to see a particular thing . so , in conclusion , i think that the possibility to immagine or to conceive an idea is the basis of the progress of the world . facts are simple a fact .
