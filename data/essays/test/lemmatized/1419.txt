the assignment of the advertisement is to show the advantage of a product , because the people should buy it . but here is the problem . some advertisement show a product better than it really is . the people thing something of a poduct , buy it and then see the truth of it . in my opinion that is the problem of the strong competition in this century . firms want to survive in the market and so work with all opportunity . the customer should buy their product and not the product from another firm and for that reason they also work with unfair thing . a very good practical example for that problem are the work of the energy firm in germany . the advertisement of these firm show low price and the best available condition . but last week the newspaper wrote about some ( not puplic ) negotiation of the energy firm where they bargained a common price level of energy . the customer , the government etc. did not know anything about that negotiation process and after a while you heard in the tv that one energy firm increase their price . after some day the next firm increase their price and so on . the problem here is that the customer do not have the opportunity to change the energy supplier , because all have the same condition . and so the customer can not do anything against this . so you can see that this problem in the advertisement come from the strong competition . if the competition would be of a normal level then the customer would get what they see . the competition is very important for functioning of the market , but the firm should recognize the customer value . the customer confidence is the main driver for their firm success . but if the customer do not confident in the firm and their product than the firm can not survive anymore . my message to the firm are : recognize the customer value , because they buy your product . so make a true advertisement of your good .
