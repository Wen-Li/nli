learning a wide range of academic subject or specializing in only one ? i had to answer this question a few year ago , when i clarified my professional project . it depends on what one really want to achiev . if people are interesting in knowing very well a subject , they have to decide to study one specific subject . for example , researcher are specialized people . nobody is able to succeed in stem cell research if he doe n't specialized in this area and this special topic . on the other way , specialist are not able to summary all information . it is very useful for the society and human knowledge to have people with global competency and broad knowledge a leader and manager . for this kind of job , knowledge and know how in a broad range of many academic subject is mandatory . managers in our technological world need to study science a mathematics and physic but also economics , marketing , finance , corporate strategy , etc . but making two kind of people with specialized people on one side and generalist people on the other , is very simplist . there are a lot of relation between people , and specialized people discover and organise data for others . as a conclusion , i would like to give my point of view and explain my academic choice . i have chosen a few year ago to study science but also management and economics in order to understand our society . thanks to a wide range of academic study learned with my engineering degree , i am know able to understand and see relation between thing and fact . and this ability to discover rule underlying the world is for me the most interesting result of academic study .
