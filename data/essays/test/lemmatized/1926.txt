business is n't based on marketing ? i believe that nowadays it 's seem to be much important the way of we appear than the real behaviour of a person so i agree with the statement . i usaually watch television and everytime during film or talkshow or other television program i 'm fired by advertisement of any product , i believe that an adult should have a complex and structurated point of view about what he is seeing but a child need an help to better understand those type of image and message . and what about product they suggest ? advertisements are studied to increase the attention on that good but many time that good is n't a real thing that , can be increase my style of life . .. maybe not . but color music , the background where they built the advertisement make me feel better and i finally believe that it wa created only for me . the stronger example can i bring are mc donald 's advertisement or mobile phone advertisement last week i have watched for hour television and at least i 've eaten 20 hamburger and i 've changed about 5 telephone in 5 hour . i like watching television all around the word and i can affirm that everywhere advertisement are studied for the same purpose and are designed in the same way because everyone it 's made at the same way .
