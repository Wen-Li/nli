the car play a significant role in the development of what is called the `` american dream '' . having one 's own car symbolizes the freedom and liberty to choose what one want to choose and to go where one want to go - independently and easily . certainly , there are many developing country , that try to adopt the american way of life . ca n't we therefore easily conclude that the number of car worldwide will significantly increase in the next - let 's say - twenty year ? in this essay , i want to shed some light on this question in order to provide better argument on whether we will have more car on the future or whether we wo n't . my position will be , that we will definitively have more car by 2026 , but that there are also good reason to doubt a rapid , extreme growth . firstly , one of the most important issue of international politics call car-production into question : cars pollute our environment massively . therefore , there is and there will also be in the future a strong movement against the use of car and in favor of public transport . this argument in certainly true , but nevertheless i believe that technological progress will allow big corporation to create car , that pollute the environment le and le . although some people will avoid car and although their number might increase , i do n't believe , that this policy can significantly lower the number of car world-wide . furthermore , the econimoc growth of developing country mentioned above mate with a second factor : their rapid population rise . in the coming decade , there will be more and more people on our planet , who all want to participate in the western game of capitalism and democracy . and these will certainly also want to drive car . probably , car will even necessarily be a part of their western-oriented way of life . but thirdly , one could argue , that the growing population and the restriction of space on our planet will lead to very large town and city , city for example a big or even bigger than today 's `` megacity '' mexico city . cars , this argument go , would just hinder the traffic in such place and could be gradually replaced by better public transport . this is again an argument with a great plausibility . but still , i ca n't come to believe that the number of car will fall in total , because at least in the upcoming century there will always be place , where there is no such strict limitation of space . today 's city already provide enough room for car with all their road and highway . and this is very unlikely to be changed at all . finally , there is something in many western people , that can nearly be called an obsession for car . they belong to the western way of life , they are good of luxury and of status or sometimes even plaything for grown-up boy . this attitude towards car will certainly stay to be part of our culture for quite a long time . strikingly , such an attitude is even enforced by the industry , their advertisement and their production . these company need to create and maintain a market for their car and - a all corporation - they expand . how could we believe - or hope ? - that car will become le popular due to these circumstance ? to sum up , there is hardly any striking evidence for the idea , that we will have fever car after the next twenty year . rather , all the argument for such a position and all the problem about car i pointed out , can be accounted for in a larger picture of our planet 's and culture 's development . and in such a picture , car will definitely maintain their place during the next decade and possibly even century .
