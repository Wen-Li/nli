in the world , there are successful people and unsuccessful people . i think that unsuccessful people is doing nothing , so it is not happened , change anything . they to do a usual like already know thing . however , successful people is doing special thing like to try new thing but they take high dangerous risk . i totally agree with that good successful people try new thing and take risk . to try new thing make people excited because nobody know that what happened is next . for examople , when you try to eat new traditional food , are n't you excited ? or when you travel foreign country , are n't you excited ? however , they doe not know that the trasditional food is delicous or not , and what happened is at the foreign country . also , if a person is really excited , he effect to other people who will be excited too , and they will bet that they try to new thing too . to try new thing take risk . nobody know that the new thing is dangerous or safe becasue nobody ha never tried that . for example , a cake shop make new cake and start to sell , and owner is worried about the cake is good cake for buyer . in addition , the buyer do not know that the new cake is dalicious or not becasue it is a oroginal cake . if the buyer try to eat the cake , they have to use money . it is risk beacsue if the cake is not tasty , the money is wested . nobody think that they doe n't care about that risk although the cake is not tasty , however , pople who love cake , try to new cake . also , i love cake , and i always try to new cake becasue it is new . if i eat same cake a usual , it not excited and sound bored . if i failed , i will decide to get a delicious cake next time . if people want to become successful people , they should try new thing and take risk . and then , they should keep to try new thing although they failed or something . if they stop or to do same thing , it not happed and change anything . to try new thing make something new one however ; nobody know that what happened is next .
