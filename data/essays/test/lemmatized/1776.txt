i agree to the given statement , that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide . bacause , during the travel we will visit many place . they may be familiar to you or may not be . if i travel alone without a guide there are a lot of problem that i have to face . i may be misguided by my minor knowledge about the place and it becomes difficult to manage them . for example , i may enter a new place where i do n't know anything like where to go , how to get my work to be done . some time if i am out of the country there will be a problem with the language . since i do n't have any idea about the place , i have to enquire others to get the information , and there come the problem with the language . if i am travelling to a new place and if i missed the route to travel , then i will be strucked there without help and i ca n't reach the destination . if i travel in a group with a tour guide , he or she can assist the correct way to travel and also help in getting the thing to be done . the guide take care of u and guide in a correct direction in any matter . we can solve the problem like the language problem , since ther are more chance that atleast a single person in the group know the language , which help a lot for our travel . a group can give the best solution to a problem , rather than a single person . if we are travelling in a group and if there is any problem there are many chance of getting the best idea to getrid of the problem . if i am travelling alone i may not get the best idea of getting out of the problem . the guide also help u travel to our destination without any problem since he know everything about that place . so i prefer travelling in group led by a tour guide .
