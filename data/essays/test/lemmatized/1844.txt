nowadays , some people may hold the opinion that '' it is more important for student to learn fact '' , but others deem that `` it is more important for student to understand idea and fact '' . as far a i am concerned i agree that it more important for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact . there many subtle point that suppert my opinion . one reason for my inclination for this opinion is that the student can develobe his knowledg based on his own idea and concept . another reason for my peopensity for this opinion is that the student will be more flexable in the way he is thinking and this is very important for him to have an open mind and to be creative , so he can face deferent subject with one strategy third reason that i think i must give it a few word is that fact may be a result of understanding idea and concept . so , the student may reach fact based on his understandung the idea and concept . in a word , taking into account all these factor , we may reach to the conclusion that it is ipmortant for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact because of they can develop there own idea , forthermore , they can be flexable facing deferent type of supjects . also fact can be result of idea and concept .
