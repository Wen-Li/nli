i agree that it is more important for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact . why because understanding an idea give u a practical knowledge . it give u the exact meaning of the idea . we think that what information behind that idea . understanding a concept mean to know the whole information of the product or thing . becuse one idea can change our life . we all know that famous scientist newton , one day he wa at the apple tree sudenly one apple wa felt infront of him . he thoght that why it is not going back to same place . for this he invented an idea that there is a gravitational force on the earth . today all people around the world accepting this truth . this concept of earth gravitational force came from the idea of newton . so it is important for student to understand idea and concept . i disagree that it is not more important for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact . because an experience will make you leader in the society . great person mahatma gandhiji became the most popular person in india becuse of his experience . so many freedom fighter struggled hard for the society with revolution but failed to get freedom for the country . for this reason gandhiji struggled for the freedom with peace and got freedom to country . so by learning the thing every child or person will become the good citizen to thier country . so this is the best way of doing right thing . finally i would like to conclude that understanding idea and to learn fact both are important to the student . so student must choose the right thing and give the good name to their family and for their country . so we all hope that student will do the right thing .
