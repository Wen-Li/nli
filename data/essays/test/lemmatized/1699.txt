surely , most advertisement make product seem much better than they really are . but is not that the intension ? advertisements are there to attract people and get their attention to a new product . if they were not exagerating they would just summarize the feature of a product and everyone know what a washing powder , for example , is good for . it is important that the product advertized ha to appear to be something special compared to all the other product of the same type . how would you do that if they all look similar and have the same purpose ? you can choose a specific feature of the product and say that in this feature it is better than all the other similar product . for example , an advertisement for a washing powder of brand x could say that it make your clothes softer than any other brand 's powder in addition to it power to clean and remove dirt . but a product doe not only need to appear special regarding competition in the same type of product . what about newer version of an old product ? sometimes new product do not have a big improvement regarding the old product but in order to make people buy the new one instead of further using the old one , advertisement have to be exagerating . of course , that might not be the golden way to make people buy product but i must admit that it work with me and exagerated advertisement make me try something new and different and every now and then those convince me in their quality . people might complain that knowing that advertisement are overrating a product make it hard to see which product are really the best . but you can figure that out by yourself . after trying the product you always have the choice to either stick with it because you like it or return to using your old or traditional product .
