many people might think that traveling alone with out a guide will give them more time to examine the foreign country individually and thoroughly . however , i do not suggest to do so because after it is hard to communicate easily one might get lost and also the guiders no much more about the famous place in that country . before traveling we usually buy a trip book of the particular country for conversation that might sometimes be necessary . sometimes like when we are lost . truely , when i visited france i once wa out of the city where i did n't even know the name of and wa terrefied of my curcumstances . well , eventually , by asking and asking several foreigner by teling them to show me how , and where should i find this place by body language , i wa back to where i belong . this really wa a hard time for me . i always imagine wheather if i had a tourist at that time in the first place i would n't have gotten lost and would n't have to be panic at that time , so on , i could have had a good time during the trip , then having a bad memory . furthermore , if traveling with guiders you can visit place that are famous and spend your time without anxious where to go next , because the guider will lead you to the next destination . also , a we visit ancient tomb or kingdom , guider would explain about these monument which give you more comprehension to the country . on the contrast , if you dont have a guide , you sill have to ask every person to go to a particualr place and will lose the opportunity to have a closer look at how the country customes are about . in brief , to travel conveniently such a not having any complex situation or having trouble to find any good place to visit following a travel agent is benefitial in time and effort and at the end one will have a pleasing memory of the trip .
