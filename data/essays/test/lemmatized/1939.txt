i do agreee with the statement that successful people try new thing and take risk rather than only doing what they already known how to do well . successful people achieve their success througth their continued hardwork , concentration , commitment and facing risk . it is hard to believe that people can achieve success with out taking risk . doing only what we know will never help in the long run . it could make happy for a short period of time . but , in the later stage we need to strugle for not trying new thing . for example if we do n't abreast with latest technology and innovation we do need to depend lot on other people . we need to spend lot of money for every function that need new technology . similarly at the job we do n't get enough pay and promotion . we need to work for the same pay and in same position throughout . trying new thing may need to face certain risk . they are all for a limited time . when we started a new task we do need to face certain risk . the task need more attention and time in the beginning to learn . all this is just for a period of time . later , we are pretty much better at work compared to the others . get good position at the job . trying new thing help in growing mentally and economically . for example , if we see the people like microsoft , google , yahoo . everyone wa pretty good in their position . if they keep doing the same what they were doing they could not withstand in the market . there is a lot of competition that come . new challanges need to be faced . if microsoft just think the window is a user friendly software and there is no need to develop new version and face new problem , we could not see any advancement in today 's window operating system . the competetors would have taken over microsoft by this time . we know how the window software developed . first it started with just basic function . then at the time of each newer version there were several new function added and new problem were started . all those problem were only for a certain period of time . later they streamlined each version and made a the best software compare to the previous version and the competetors . trying new thing will always need to face certain risk but they are all for the good in the long run . therefore , i strongly agree with the statement that `` successful people try new thing and take risk rather than only doing what they already know how to do well '' .
