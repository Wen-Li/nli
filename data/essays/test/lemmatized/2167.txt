i 'm agree that statement . because many student do n't have concept of many problem . i think this phenomenon appear by teacher did't teach to student about concept and they did n't teach about fact . another cause of this phenomenon teacher are give up to teach . for example , student did n't focus on they adderess then , they give up to student to understand idea . this is big cause of that . so , i think it is very important . but not compulsion . it is not good for understand . on the contrary more increase defiance of student . therefore , when you teach student you will gentle . for instance several thing . first , you will respect student opinion . then student respect our opinion too . second , you will choice what a student focus on . that is important . it is easier understand idea than they do n't focus on . finally , you will be smile . smile give happy to every
