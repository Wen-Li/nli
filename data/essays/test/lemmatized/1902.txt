i agree with the statement `` successful people try new thing and take risk rather than only doing what they already know how to do well '' . i start by defining success a having a personal , emotional , monetary or creative gain in any aspect of life . i believe that risk taker have the chance to test new idea and accomplish their personal dream , whilst people who do not take risk pick the safer choice which is to keep doing what they are used to do . they do not pursue their fantasy and therefore will never get to know if their dream would have been successful . for example a person working in a bakery , who know how to do well a certain pastry and never try to open his own store . he doe not take the risk , thus he will never know if his dream would work , and will never be successful while he keep doing his job even though he is very good at it . people who do not take risk are afraid of failure , since doing what they do brings such stability to their life they do not feel the need to change . however taking risk even though they could end in failure , that failure would teach you new lesson in life , it would give you new experience . risk taker can develop idea , deepen concept and improve their technics , since taking that extra step will create a whole new set of possibility which will give them not only personal and emotional gain but also will widen their creativity . for example , pursueing a singing carreer instead of just being a singing teacher . if that person would try to record a cd , may be she would even end up meeting new singer , band memebers , people from the music industry who could help her singing , give her tip and even widen her scope and introduce her to new rhythm . that way by taking a risk , she ha a personal and a creative gain , and she could even improve her vocal capacity . if she had not taken that risk she would still be a teacher , teaching the same class for the rest of her life with no possibility of growth or success . in conclusion i think that risk taker are capable of gaining many positive experience , by following their dream . they will not be left with the doubt of whether that idea would have worked or not , and even though they are more exposed to failure , that failure come along with valuable lesson that will help them in future situation , that in itself determines success in an aspect of life . thus risk taker have more probability of having personal gain , and therefore be successful , than a person who pick the safer choice .
