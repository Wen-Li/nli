i agree with this statement for different reason . first of all , in order to be successful , we have to try new thing and take risk because life is always changing . what wa true yesterday is not necessarly true today . if someone want , for example , to be sucessful in business , he would better take risk and adapts himself to the law of change . indeed , during the industrial revolution in europe , the one who took the risk to develop their industry through machine were more successful than the one who kept manual and artisanal way of working . even in a relationship , people who do only what they already know how to do well , get bored . people need are evolving through the different stage of their life . one have to adapt himself to the other people evolving need . according to darwin , this statement is true even for the human specie . the one who adapt to his environment survive , the others die . when i wa a teenager , i refused to see that i had to take risk in order to be successful . i did never get involved emotionaly in a relationship because i feared that i would fail or get hurt . this way , i wa not failing , but also i wa not successful . today , i take more risk in this area , and i definitely got hurt many time , but i had some victory . the main one is that i am more opened to life . being successful in life mean also to be willing to take risk . a president of the united states once said : it is better to see thing in big rather than willing to achieve small goal and belong to the group of weak ' spirit people who do not know neither victory nor defeat . i also hear once that the way to success is paved by mistake and that nobody is failing , there are only people who stop trying .
