everyday we are reminded of the fact that we head towards a cleaner future , a better future . a future wherein there will be le pollution . this would be attributed to the assumption of le car in the future . however , in my opinion , not only will it take u a long time to reach our goal for a `` cleaner future '' , but there will be a marked increase in car over time . there are various reason for my support of this stance . population growth , a always continues to be a problem . on the one hand it mean an increase in poverty . on the other hand it also mean an increase in more middle income people , increased employment , etc . these type of people consider a car a necessity without which they can not survive . this will create a persistent , consistent increase in the number of car we see on the road . however , it is not only the middle class that will create an increase in this . every type of income earner would cause an increase in car , some , by just being born . as family become progressively bigger it is imperative to have more than one car . for example , in a family where both the husband and the wife are working there will be atleast two car . most government over the world are facing a population `` explosion '' of sort in their country . due to this , public transport system have to be established and grown progressively , while it is true that this doe solve the problem of le car on the road , it is also true that some , like high income earner will not avail of these type of transporting system . annual increase in some public transport system like public bus also contributes in a small way to increased vehicle on the road . this also lead me to my next point - car are , in today world considered , like many other product , to be a symbol for status . for example , a wealthy family would not be content with having just one car , or even two . it is not uncommon to see five or six car in come people 's garage , espescially the rich one . another possible increase in the amount of car on the road is the possibility of having `` enviromentally safe '' car in the future . if these car , like the honda privia , is made public , then many people would buy these car and , a such cause an increase in the number of automobile we see on the road . in conclusion , it is my opinion that there will not be fewer car in the future .
