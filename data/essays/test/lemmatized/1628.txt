i do think that advertisments make somtimes product seem much better than they really are . first i think this is logic since advertisments are usually commercial and this make the main porpuse for an advertisment is to show the advantage of the product even if that mean exaguration . advertising in general is a relatively large field , it study the response of consumer in order to be able to design the right advertisment for a certain product . in an open market full of competetors usually the most effective way to sell a product is to claim that this product is the best and to try to convince the consumer to buy it and this is the main aim . i can recall now the washing powder used for washing machine , when i watch these advertisments i get confused a a consumer , every advertisment for one kind of washing powder is claiming that it is the best in the market and it can do what others can not . like removing stain from clothes and giving a refreshing smels to clothes , and i have experienced that some of these claim are not quite right . some say why a good product need to be advertised in the first place , they say the product can talk for them self , in other word adverstisment is used for the le quality product in order to sell it . i do n't quite agree with this view since we see advertisments for the best car brand in the world ( bmw , merceeds . .. etc . ) . again do these very fine product seem much better than they are when shown on advertisments ! i think not , since all fine quality product producer know they will loose some of thier credit in the market if they resort to exagguration and that might shock thier position in the market , and such name can not afford to loose thier ranking position in a certain market for example car , washing powder , food . .. etc .
