i do agree with the statement because i am convinced that advertisments are created with the intention of not only promote specific charateristics of a product , but create expectation in the mind of the consumer . this expectation are what in the end , lead the decision of the consumer , and without this expectation , the consumer will not be convinced about why expend their money in one product or another . so the creation of a better image definetly is the main objective of the advertisments . i remember to have analysed this situation of why doe the advertisments make look to a product much better than what they realy are . when i studied business administration at universidad de la americas , a global and higly international mexican college , and i felt that the program apporaches social issue in a very broad and comprehensive manner . nevertheless , i felt form the start of the program that understanding of social issue would be useful to improve my general management in the human factor . thus , i enroll in some course delving into the complexity of the mind and how doe it affect every activity undertaken . this led me to study the work of dr. jose carroza , a famous spanish sociology that discussed the topic at lenght . he make seceral study related to the impact of advertisment in potential customer . he wa very interested in knowing wheter a customer will buy a product just by the objective characteristic . his research concluded that even if a product could performance better than others , it will not be buy by the customer . he demostrated that a good advertisment can sell more of a product that doe not perfom a good a another one . in my own experience , i have been also witness of the observation that good advertisment sell when it present large expectation for a product . working a a project director for grupo aitex , a major real state developer with public and private concern ha exposed me chanllenging situation not only related to technological , business , industry and economic situation , but related also to the people with whom i closely work . this exposure ha broadened my mind understanding on how doe different background and experience affect everyones decision and ha also helped me in seeing situation from different perspective before making a decision . i remember one time when i wa able to prove the efficieny of making an advertisment campaign for a new project of 500 flat . at that time my bos explained to me the importance of making high expectation for the target market , because a he said `` the success of the future sell depends on how much we could encourage the people to come to our new project . '' the impact of the campaign wa so sucessful that we stablished a new record on sale . i will never forget the impression of that experience produced just because of an advertisment . but the impact of a good advertisment is not just local , a i had the opportunity to discovered in many of my trip around the world . many of my most important memory are related with travelling , not only to major city , but to the richness and fabulous diversity of my beautiful country mexico . in my travel , i had taken time to chat with the local about different situation , and i remember one time when i wa in india taking dinner with a group of people from diferent country and we were discussing about the impact of publicity in our perception to some product . we were recalling one television spot from the gillete company that wa promoting the razor for me . with the group , we discussed about how that advertisment wa spread all over the world , and it wa amazing to discover about it impact . all the people that were gathered that day concluded that we had been affected by that advertisment in the same way , but in different country . that experience proven to me that the impact of the advertisments when they make a product seem much better than they really are , is global .
