success is a very subjective idea . people can feel successful when they are doing the thing they like and know , but they are not improving the way of thinking or doing thing . however , what society will consider success is when someone brings out a new development that benefit many people . this is the type of success i am going to talk about . we all have thing that we know how to do well . and a good way to obtain good result is to exploit our ability in the field that we already know . however , success is not only about that . success implies benefit for you and for the society a a whole . it is logical to think that new idea only come from takin risk . people can do anything they like in a traditional way . but this situation will never produce any improvement . by contrast , when someone take a risk , there are two possibilites , either he fails or he succeeds . yet , if he doe not take the risk there is no possibility at all to improve . even though most of u fear failure at some point , the only way of creating a new approach is by taking risk . the example are found in any time and place in history . would pablo picasso had been that famous if he had not dared to change the traditional way of painting ? would copernicus had developped the astronomical view of earth if he had not dared to oppose to the church ? would pasteur had discovered the rabbies vaccine if he had not taken the risk of trying new method ? take a a last example one of the most thriving company of our time : microsoft . if bill gates had not dared to follow a new approach in software engineering , microsoft will not be the huge enterprise we know nowadays . success is about daring to try new thing . of course mistake can always happen , but there is a big chance that in any of those try , the light of success enlightens our path .
