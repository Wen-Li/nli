i agree that most advertisement make product much better than they really are . i have a some reason and they are following . first of all , person who sell product they must be get many consumer a much a they can , because they want to get profit . most of all seller , they do not tell any lie , but they do not say bad aspect of the product . of couse , they do not need to say them . if i want to sell something at the school festival , i mean when i want to introduce our store or product to others , i deffinetly say only good thing . so , probablly , customer maight be seemed or discover bad aspect of our produsts . secondly , some advertisement are exassarate . i mean it is emphasized too much . it is also not lie but just too much . so , sometimes when i got a new stuff i will be dissapointed at it because i just follow that kind of advertisement . i think everyone ha that kind of feeling sometimes . i have a experience , a well . one day i watch the tv and they sold some food for diet . i wanted to loose my waight . and they said a lot of good word and also introduce someone who lost waight a lot because of that product . and i dont think that wa lie , but now i know that the someone wa just example . of course i do not now all peaple who use that food to loosing their waight . some could loose a lot , others could only 1 pound , i do not know . finally , i bought the product but i fail to loose my waight . so i think someone could loose waight a lot , they did exercise and ate that product . becuse i did not do exercise a lot . the seller just told the tures . so the advertisement is not bad . so what wa or is the problem ? i think the problem is myself , at least in my case . i get influence of advertisement , easily . now i know because of my imagination . when i see good word of advertisement , i never think about bat aspests of it and just thiknk about good one too much . that 's why i dissapointed sometimes . in conclution , i still agree that statement . however , i thiknk it is not advertisement but our imagination is problem , too .
