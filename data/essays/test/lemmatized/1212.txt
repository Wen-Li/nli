according to me it i agree with the following that successful people try new thing and take risk rather than only doing what they know what to do well . a they are mantioned a successful people already they will be succeeding in major part rather than failure . as the people are successful , they can try new thing . i am giving some example to support my view . i have a persona experience with these type of people . my father is the person i saw coming out every time with new idea , but still he is successful in the major time . actually my father wa a businessman . he ha started restaurant when he wa young . he succeeded in that by giving wide variety of food and good experience for the people who visited those restaurant . at some time he recognised lot of bachelor living in one of the area in our city . he understood that those people can not afford more money for the food in the restaurant and started take away centre for them , in which there will be no section to eat . so that it requires a small space and low budget . he gave some quality food there at low price and all the people started visiting them and buying food . this is one of the risk 's took by my father , a that area is so costly many people advised my father to leave that idea , but he did not give up and succeeded in his own way . another example we can consider this may be in film making . some director make film which are different from their previous one 's but succeed in doing them and getting the acceptance from the audience . one of the example 's i would like to give is that of a director named shankar in india . his movie will be different from one another . although if he follows a basic point which is important to the society . his approach in the making of the film is marvelous . he succeeded in all his eight film he directed . one basic example to tell his risk taking is that his budget to the movie . he directed a movie based on the public awareness of the bribe by keeping a sixty year old man a a lead role and budget of around hundred crore . but he succeede in making that film and also that film ha collected around 350 crore amazingly proving the talent of the director . so according to me successful people try new thing and also take risk to succeed further if also they already know how to do well . because every person is expecting something new rather than the old one .
