i would definietley agree with it that `` successful people try new thing and take risk rather than only doing what already know how to do well '' success is defined by each individual a a goal or an ambition to themselves . any successfull people who have reached the top , would have definitely faced so many failure and risk . after being successful in reaching their goal , there is no meaning in doing the same thing again and again , we would reach a state where we want to try out new thing either in different field or in same field eventhough we know it would involve risk . it is only when we try out new thing we do learn new thing and the mistake we committed . famous scientist like edison who discovered light didnt stop with that invention he further helped in the inventation of current . similarly tesla who discovered alternating current , in the begginning discovered direct current ( dc ) could have stopped with that but since he wanted to try out new thing and found out alternating current ( ac ) which we depend more on today for our daily need . success keep changing according to the person and the situation . when we consider the world a a whole picture , we human started our life from cave and stone but today live in a very comfortable world of sophisticated machine . the way people used to communicate with each other ha changed . we use email , telephones and other mode . we introduced internet , satellities . we dont stop with a particular success , we do look for a better advancement and try new thing . thus , success varies from person to person and we all have to remember that success is not a destination and it is a journey that never end .
