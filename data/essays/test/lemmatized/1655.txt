nowdays young people give enough of their time to help their community . todays world is totally dependent on the youngster if they stop helping their community , it would not be an easy task for government to do whole lot of it . it 's the youngster only which come out to help on a single call for it . once when in my colony the condition started becoming worse to live because of the smell of the garbage collected . due to strike of the local government , no official help wa availible . at that time it wa youngster who came out to help and clean all of it , making the place possible for living . they did a team work which also showed their co-operative power . many time young peaple are missunderstood because of the generation gap . elder people dont like their rash driving , their excessive smoking or drinking , but this ha nothing to do with social work which young people do , and should be appretiated by the elder . i remember the time when the kargil war wa going on between our country india and neighbour country pakistan . at that time it wa local area youngster only who helped the soldier in the war . they served them food , medical aid , and many more needfull thing . take them on strechers or even in their arm in emergency wa something which old people failed to do because of their physical weakness . on the other hand , young people have always given their best to help people building temple or mosque . they are the one who collect fund for it . they also take the full resposibility of building it . supply of water , cement , brick all is done by them only . i would like to conclude by saying that there wa a period when young people did n't use to give enough time to helping their community but nowadays it 's not so , they help their community , participate in solving relevant problem and give their hundered percent .
