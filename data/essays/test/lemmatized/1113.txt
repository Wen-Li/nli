whether it is more important that to understand idea and concept for student is important to learn fact ? difffernt people hold differnt opnion due to their differnt experice , in my point of view , i think that it is both improtant to abtain the idea and concept and to learn fact . there is no one more important than the other . in my following argument i will make some commend on the question . on the one hand , it 's basically for a sudent to learn the idea and concept . learning the idea and priciples can let u learn the world more comprehensively . all the later fumual and fact are relay on the basic concept . without the concept all the later experment and conclusion are unrealible . for example , if a student dont comprehansion the theory of ` gravity rull for everything ' . how can he culculate the speed of the thing drop from the air . and haw can he find the outer space of the universal . ideas and priciples are really the basic theory of the more progressive inversitgation , on the other hand , it is also important that the student need to learn the fact . to learn the fact really can deduce the time we need to explore the world . there are so many fact and conclusion that had been find and tested for a long time , that the treasure that our presecor leave to u . if we don'tn learn the fact , all the thing need to be find for the individua himself . it 's a such waster of time and energe . and no one can make progress not bassed on the fact , for example , at the medical field , there are so many anatomy fact had been dissected and we student ca n't learn anything more without learn the fact , after gather the all the fact we can keep our reserch on humankind . then we can contribute to the socialty in our limited life . so in conclusion . it is no doult that student need to learn the idea and priceples a well a the fact . they are so important to let u know the universal quikly and comprehensively . they are all the base that we can excavate the universal more really to the reality .
