today car are considered a a necessity apart from food , shelter and clothing . but in the year to come car might neither be a necessity nor a comfort . a gradual transition is bound to take place a far a the traveller 's preference are concerned . twenty year from now , there will be fewer car than there are today for several reason . there are a lot of other mode of transport that are gaining importance already because of the traffic congestion and pollution problem everywhere . for example , metro rail connecting different city and those running within the city are being preferred to car . a city like mumbai , located in india ha shown significant trend in this regard already . the local metro train are being prefered by the people who own car themselves because the city ha a lot of traffic jam everyday and rail are quicker and convenient . in twenty year from now , there might be more reduction in the use of car . moreover fuel price would rise in the next twenty year to come and so using car would be more costlier then . so people would prefer public transportation to car . and even if they use car , they would share it with friend . a person going in car alone to his office would prefer to drive along with two or three friend in year to come so that it is affordable . another reason is that the environmental concern about the air pollution due to automobile emission would limit the use of automobile including car , scooter etc in the future . the government world over are likely to make a lot of infrastructural improvement in the public transportation area to encourage the people to use them and limit the use of automobile and thus control the air pollution to some extent . with the reason mentioned above , i strongly agree that fewer car would be in use twenty year later than there are today .
