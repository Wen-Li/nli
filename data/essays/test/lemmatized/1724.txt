thinking about education process it is possible to affirm that it is more important for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact . the understanding allow the student not only to adquire knowledge , but also to use that knowledge in the solution of different real problem . a commun education problem is that the teacher usually ask the student to learn fact and not to understand the concept or idea that they are learning , so the learning process becomes an insolated thing that doe not result useful for the real life . if the student do not understand what they have learnt and they only worry about memorizing information , that information or knowledge will be completely unuseful for them . on the other hand , the learning process ha to be significative for the student , so he can be motivated with his own learning . in this way , if the teacher doe not help the student to understand the idea or conceps , the learning process will not be significative for the student and he will not be interested on continue learning what he would consider unuseful thing . the knowledge or the information becomes interesting for any person when he or she is able to understand that information , when you only memorize or learn fact it is difficult for you to get interested on that . what is more , if a person doe not understand one concept or idea it would be difficult to keep that idea in his/her mind , in other word , the information that is not understood is easily forgetable . in conclusion , in the teaching process is very important to worry about the learning process of the student for helping them not to learn fact or memorize information , but to understand the idea and concept that they have adquired , and also for him/her to be able to apply the knowledge in real context .
