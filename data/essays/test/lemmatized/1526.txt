ancient time saw the popularity of an item or a product by a kind of publicity which can be considered quite reliable since it wa a mouth to mouth publicity mainly due to the lack of mean of communication and medium a we have in the modern day . now , this medium that we have today make me think twice before i believe it completely . and one aspect of the medium today is ` advertisement ' . advertising everything it is paid for , never mind it effect on society . well , when this aspect come into picture then it definitely make me think twice before i buy any product advertised on television or by other mean like hoarding etc . lets look at the definition of advertising - it mean making people aware of a certain product and also inform them about it good effect , mind you only the positive point of the product though there might be negative association with it . well if a company had to advertise the shortcoming of it product then who would buy it ? so it highlight only the positive point in such a away that it is misleading at time , it actually exaggerates it positive feature . for eg.a bathing soap is actually just effective in fighting germ to an extent of fifty percent whereas the advertisement show it to be effective to an extent of ninety eight percent . in this way they make their product seem much better than it actually is . another example being that of soft drink - they have been promoted using the most popular sport person , actor , etc. associating these product with their success , but the ill-effects of it are disastrous like most of them containing pesticide leading to a cancerous effect in individual . people usually idolize these successful icon and follow their path and buy whatever they advertise unaware of the ill-effects . the fact is that the war of different company making the same product lead to this strategy of advertising each one 's product to outdo the other , hence leading to these exaggerated advertisement showcasing even a mediocre product a the best one in the market . and this completely justifies why i believe that most of the advertisement actually display a product in a much higher version tahn it deserves to be . it is only when a consumer us a product doe he know which is the best quality product .
