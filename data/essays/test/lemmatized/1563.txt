`` the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide '' . i disagree with the statement mentioned above . i am a person like to travel independently with my family . because they are the person known to me and being with unknown person is too problem to me . i am very interested to spend with my family because when we grow we can not stay with them and i will be busy in study . first reason , when we go alone we do n't have lot of time to stay at hotel . but when we are in group we have listen to the others and have to stay longer time with them . we can not have an oppurtunity to speak with the local and we have to stay along with them upto their work finished . second reason , even without a guide also we can handle the situation because now adays a tourism book is also available in bookstall and railway station . through this book we can visit many palces without a giude . moreover guide know only few palces . after going to the place we can have guide to explain the popular thing if we pay to him . moreover after the completion of tourism we can return home soon . when we will go with group of people it will take lot of time and we can not reach soon . even one person is missed we have to wait until the person is found . for job holder it is very difficult to spend more time because they can not get more holiday . at last even ticket booking is also available in railway station before some day and we can confirm ticket in this way . we are lot of way to travel . when person ha to return with in two to three day he can travel by airport which will take more time to reach the tourist place . it is probelm to take a guide with them .
