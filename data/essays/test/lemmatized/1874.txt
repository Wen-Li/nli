i completely agree with the fact that most advertisments are deceiving and give a completely distorted image of the product they are trying to sell . in fact the purpose of advertisment is not that of showing a product for what it is but rather to create the need for that particular item in a possible customer . in an advertisment , it 's not just the product that 's deceving but also the context in which it is placed and the sensation that it try to arouse . when i look at advertisement about car i ask myself : how come are they always pictured completely alone on a road set in an incontaminated landscape ? advertisments show you the bright side and do n't warn you that the increase of the number of car enhances problem about traffic and pollution . in an advertisment you never see all the feature of the product , the advertiment 's scope , in fact , is to enhance all the good quality the item might have disguising all the bad one . i once read an article about mcdonald 's which showed how the hamburger looked like on the advertisement and when you actually got them . it wa really hard to recognize they were supposed to be related in some way . the worst advertisments are the one for child . they picture toy so greatly that it seems that one could n't live whithout them ! and child , of course , do n't have the experience to understand that they are falling in a trap and that 's exactly the purpose of the advertisement . another technique used in advertising is that they make you beleive that if you have that particular item , a cell phone for example , than you will be the coolest person around . every body will be looking at you and envying you . advertisments make you believe that you can by happiness . that happiness come from what you have and what other people think of you rather than what you are . advertisments play with emotion , often you can hardly see the product they are trying to sell , you do n't get any infomation about them . .. but somehow they make you feel like you will not be satisfied untill you have what they are picturing .
