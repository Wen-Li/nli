'' i will disagree the opinion . ceatenly , i think the opinion have many adbantages . for example , it is very safety and it is not only and so on . but i love travel only mine because i can see the many thing and i can knowing various thing . firstly , i think in that case of travering only mine , i can see the many thing more then travering in a group . forexample the backgraund of the country and so on . secondly i think in that case of travering only mine , i can knowing various thing more than travering in a group . when i travering the unknown place i always have gidebook of this country , and lungedge book and i usualy tell the country people . i think tell the diffarent country people is so attractive . they teach me meny attractive thing . i think if travering with freiend or family i talk almost with freiend or family . i think it is not bad . however i prefer to talk with unknown people , i love travering very much . actually , i visited many place . for example , new yook city , tiwan , french , hawai , tailamd and so on . i had not all place visitet only mine . but i love travel only mine . i think travering mine give me many attractive thing .
