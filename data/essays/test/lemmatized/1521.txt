i agree the statement because i know the successful people in the history always tried something new . first example is john nash , the nobelist in the economy . before he established his own idea governing dynmics , `` in competition individual ambition serve the common good '' is widely spread . but after his idea wa penetrated to a variety of the region , for example in the trade system and negocition , the new system ha been creating more profit not only one side but also the other side . second example is nobunaga oda , one of the many leader in japan around 1550 . he introduced an old type of gun to the war , which were never seen in the history in japan . actually they were difficult to use a well a very expencive . however , he established gun troop . by using it , he beated a lot of enemy and almost controled all over the japan . third example is emigrating to the united state arould 1600 . as i describe above , great success always acompanied with the new idea , thing and/or person . so if you want to be successful to something , all you have to do is to find and try something new in the field .
