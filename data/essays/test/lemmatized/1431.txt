to be realistic , i truly do not think that the number of car will have any prospect of decreasing , ever . indeed , the need for short range transportation in everyday life make car a nessecity . many worldwide trend also indicate that continued increase in car usage really ha no currently foreseable return . the most intuitive cause is probably the ever-increasing prevalence of the privately owned automobile . as growing nation , china for example , eventually fully modernize , with the average person gaining more economic wealth , the consumption of car will just continue to grow with even more rapidly . maybe in some country , regulation on automobile use and ownership , possibly out of environmental concern , may curb car use slightly . however , newer technology : efficient diesel engine , oil-electric hybrid engine , etc. all alleviate this issue . it advance technology propogates , environmental concern on car use more even someday subside completely , becoming a historical issue . of course , too many car , thus too much traffic , is an issue in every major city in the world . this is why construction of modern public transportation system seems to be a must-do item for any metropolis of considerable size . the implementation of such public system will certainly lessen the need for private car , but it seems that most people still have private vehicle , either for use under emergency condition , or even recreational purpose ( e.g. the weekend countryside picnic , no metro system will probably get there ) . as for a solution for too much traffic , i believe that in the future , modern wireless network technology might be added to car , and with appropriate infrastructure , efficient metropolitan traffic control and management might be possible . for example , computer scheduling of car flow may avoid much traffic congestion . in summary , i simply think that the car is too much a nessecity of modern life , such that other issue , although important , really can not dwarf it . i think that mankind will find way to solve the many problem of car use , both comprehensive and pragmatic , that will make this aspect of everyday living sustain it function well into the future .
