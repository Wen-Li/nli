a lot of controversy exist over whether most advertisement make product better . my view on this issue is that advertisement have effect to have the product better . it is related with the profit a well a company 's image . first of all , these day , many company intrduce their product by using the advertisement . on this stage , they try to look better their product . because , it is associated with making profit . for example , in korea , one company selling the gum advertised it product using the exaggerated fact which is very effcient in prohibiting the cavaty . owing this information , a lot of people bought this gum and then the profit of this gum were skyrocketed . howerver , the fact that this gum did not have outstanding effect compared with other gum is revealed . however , regardless of the truth , thanks to the advertisemet they can get a lot of money . in addition , advertisement have a positive influence on the whole company 's image . that is , the more firm show good point of the product , the more they get a lot of consumer 's attention . it cause that the company could be more competetive than other company . to illustrate , one paper company introduced that it product wa more eco-friendly in the advertisement . at that time , the social trend wa being a eco-friendly . however , not only the quality of it paper wa the same a other paper , but also there wa no reason calling eco-friendly . it is through the advertisement that this company could get a lot of favor from the costumer . all thing considered , i firmly believe that advertisement have the fuction to make the product seem much better than they really are . because it is connected with the profit and company 's brand image .
