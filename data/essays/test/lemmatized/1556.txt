it is always good to travel in group under the guidance of a guide a group touring provides you with a great accompaniment and relief you from the planning tension . surely , it save a lot of time in identifying the worth visiting area . on the contrary , touring without a guide and good company or alone may be boring and often there will be a possibility for detouring becuase you do n't have a person who is familiar with the location . one may think that touring without a guide may be more adventurous and provides greater thrill to your venture of touring to unknown place . but what we think new may turn out to be very well known place to many other people . by the time that we reach a place that is picturesque our feeling of discovery may become a trivial trial on seeing the other people who reached there with a little effort under the direction of a professional guide . if we are not familiar with the touring place we obviously tend to waste a lot of time , money and energy that can be utilized to view more worthier place . when we do n't know the worth of a place we need to know the worth from either text book on that place or from the people who live there or otherwise from understanding the inscription on the rock . many a time it is impossible to u to decipher what wa writtent on it because of the linguistic a well a sementical constraint . so in order to avoid all these predictble disturbance and wastagew we can utillize our resource effectively by employing a tour guide who can give u a lot of information about the place that we tour and if it is required we can extend the thrill of our tour by extending it to someother unknown place , the information about which also can be obtained from the tour guide and so i certainly support the given statement .
