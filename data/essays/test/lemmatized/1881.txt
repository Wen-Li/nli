now day we are expose to a incredible ammaunt of adverting on tv , news paper , magazine and almost every where you look , all this add you see are there to promout a special product . i tottaly aggre with the statement that say that most of the advertisement make product seem much better tha they really are , because of several concept . firstable it is well know that in the advertising field , you learn to persuede people for doing , eating , buying even going where you want , that is why when you work a an advertiser you need to convince people that you ar right and that you have the best option of what they are looking for . for example if someone is trying to promote a new soda , that might be compiting with a very popular one , let say coca-cola , they should start convinsing people that it 's product is better than the one they all ready know , and how do they do that ? by letting you know the good thing about this product , for example the is a new flavor , with a very innovate packeging , and is sugar free , this are real property of the product , but compiting with coca-cola is not easy , so the advertiser star liyng , that is maybe because now day people is no easy to wow ! , so they star telling you that besides all this good propertis , the new soda is also going to help you to lose wigth witch is a lie . an other important thing is that with all the new technology , people can make u see what ever they want on tv and the worst of all is that we a a consumer believe almost avery thing they show u . is is very sad to see how day by day we have been falling for masive consuminsm , that dosent give u other way than to spend every time even more an more money on unusefull item that dosent by happines .
