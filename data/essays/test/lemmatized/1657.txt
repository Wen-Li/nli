i think tha the are more young people that do not give a enough time to helping their community . for instance i belive that depend of culture tnan your live . in my culture , for example , my parent learn me to help my friend , my family or the community . but i belive in this when i young , when i grow i help only my family and my friend , because the society chanche in few time and i do n't understaind everythingh . for this reason i think than other young people do n't helping their community . but if i tell this , i hope thah there are more peaple more interesting to socity and to understai their proplem and help their . a a conseguence that the people live together and every men can help yuorcommunities . if the people learn an your child an important good idea than peace and help , the new world will the best , but now more yuong people are n't interesting to the future of yuor world because they think only work , freetime , and take more mopney for holiday , for new dress , for a le interesting reason . the people during the day work and chave n't a more freetime to spend . they prefer spend it for shopping , for meet friend , go to cinema or restaurent , or to sleopp . every thingh the young people think instaed t helping their community . for lucky there are a young or not people to interesting to their community , they work for their . more people help to people need . ther are in every city a person to helping and person to help . i think that the person to helping have a beautiful temperature because she take yourselves to hand that other . they do a diversity work to help , yuo go to the specifity comunities , to go in street , to go in ither country for take a smile in person le lucky . finally i think that the people are varied and every person can help or no , but if yuo help yuo are more happy . belive me .
