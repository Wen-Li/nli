i totally agree that advertisments make product seem much better than they really are . infact making the product more attractive is the main goal of a spot . i am conscious about that because i 've spent few mounths in the marketing area of a firm and i know how it work . first of all there are lot of research beyond an advertisment ; they try to gain a many information a possible about consumer 's attitude in order to find an attractive way to present their product . after that , they try to highlight the best quality of the product , sometimes telling lie , and to hide the negative one . for example in a spot for an ice-cream you 'll never hear : `` the more you eat this ice-cream the more you put on weight '' ; it could be quite strange if it happens . second , sometimes big celebrieties are engaged a testimonial for a particular product . you could consider a product better than another only because george clooney is spotting it . let 's think about cosmetic ; how many time we have heard : '' do you want to be like . .. try our product !! '' . it is clear that there is no relation between who sponsorize the product and the quality of it . so it can be concluded that we should not base our opinion of a product on it 's advertisment while we have to consider it characteristic and if it is worthvalue . as we all know : it is not all what shine !
