some people argue that understanding idea and concept is more important for studentsthan than learning fact . in my opinion , both understanding idea and concept and learning fact are of great importance . in the following discussion , i will illustrate my point in detail . there is no escaping the fact that understanding idea and concept is very important for student . facts are fact , and they are not self-explainory . one of the purpose of learning is to teach idea and concept to student in order to make these fact more obvious to them . for example , why these thing happen ? how will they evolve ? how will they come to an end ? whether could make prediction about thing ? so , understanding these concept and ideasis very important . however , learning fact is also important because it can help student better understand the idea and concept that they have learned . i have such experience that if content of the class are all about idea and concept , student will have great trouble understanding them . first , idea and concept are quite boring . it is extremely hard for them to concentrate on the learning of idea and concept . second , idea and concept are usually too abstract to understand . they may not well understand what these thing are about . so , they need some some related fact to help them to understand . what is more , according to my experience , learning fact is quite interesting . facts and phenomenon can easily attract student ' attention . first , they are concrete and easy to understand . students will always be glad to learn something easy , perhaps the reason is their confidence may be destroyed by difficult thing easily . second , student will be happy to see that what they have learned are useful and can explain some fact . if what they have learned are not useful , it must be quite frustrating . in sum , i think both understanding idea and concept and learning fact are indispensable in the learning process , and combining them will benefit student a lot when they are learing .
