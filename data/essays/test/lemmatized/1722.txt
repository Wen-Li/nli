i do agree with the statement that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide . although we can get a lot of information , for instance , search on the internet , before we travel , there are many detail we can not handle completely . since the infomation we get is so limited , we need someone to help u during the travel . therefore , travel in a group led by a tour guide is the best solution . a guide is familiar with all the tiny aspect during the travel , and the guide can give u several suggestion to help u deal with something during the travel , so we can save lot of time and energy . the guide 's explanation can also help u fully understand the meaning of some specific thing , so we can get joy from the progress of the traveling . furthermore , travel in a group can add our pleasure and keep u more safer than travel alone , especially in the area with little population or dangerous animal . last summer , our family went to the tube in a group led by a tour guide . with the guide 's help , we made much clear about the famous place and had a good time there . for the patience of the guide , we learned some story that little people had knew and became good friend .
