i do not agree with idea that the best way to travel is in a group led bty a tour guide . there some reason to oppose it . first of all , travel is usually a great plesure for people . they might have worked hard and saved money to realize the dream that they make a travel to where they want to go . therefore , they must eager to visit any sight seeing place or nature thing such a revers or mountain and take enough time to enjoy attending the place . of course traveling in a group with a tour guide ha a lot of advantage . once , i actually experienced the tour in this situation and spent a really nice time . a tour guide can give u much information concerned to something they are going to see , so they can enjoy sight seeing thanks to the deeper knowledge . also , tour guide are usually very good at making people fun , attendant might have unexpected pleasant event . however , traveling in a group doen not have only good point . precisely , attendant are not free to act . they always have to keep the time given . for exemple , if a man want to buy survenia to his family at the moment because the product is limited one , he would not be able to buy it because of the departing time of the bus . when a man suddenly feel sick or feel like going to a bathroom , the bus will not stop in order to felp only one person because there are a lot of other customer . yes , the problem is it ; you are not the main person in the trip in spite of your feeling enjoying yourself . you are just one of many customer to the tourism company . compared to it , how wonderful the freedom of making a travel without a tour guide is ! travelers can go to everywhrer they want and take their time to do everything , they can conduct themselves a they like unless it make surrounding people uncomfortable . happy go lucky trip will surely bring people precious experience .
