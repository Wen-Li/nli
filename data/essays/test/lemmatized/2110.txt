one may think that beeing specialized in one specific subject may be better for our own personal and future profesional life . as far a i am concerned , i would say that one must keep a broad acadmic knowledge in order to succeed in his future . first of all we must remind that the true culture is not a lot on a very specific subject but a little about a must subject a possible . that is just because we wo n't have to stay enclosed within our ivory tower in the future . today 's world is made of communication , travel and foreign people . that is why today 's people will have to be prepared to face a world which is evolving faster than ever . as an exemple i would talk about the people working within the british or french mine . when they had to close for economic reason , that people very specialized could not find a job elsewhere . we must remind that a structure of an ecoonomy may change and that some sector could disapear and others rise . if someone is prepared from the begining to face a world and a professional life which could always evolve , he would have to be effective and moreover have a descent life . that is a way to get a purshasing power by being flexible in our work . an other point is that if someone want to get a better job within a car company , knowing everything about car and telling it to his superior wo n't be a way . profesional relationship are also made of humane quality , passion and culture . by knowing several knowledge about various subject , one can easily build good relationship at work and maybe , a 25 % of men , meet their future wife at the office . to put it in a nutshell , i would say that obviously , having many academic knowledge and humane quality is a main adventage in today 's world , when flexibility is a key .
