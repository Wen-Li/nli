as the rapid development of society , competition among company are becoming so pressing that the company are trying their best to make more profit to survive . so advertisement , which are useful to sell product , attract more attention . along with the advertisement , there is an increasing public concern about the real value of the product . some people argue that the advertisement make product seem better than they really are . as far a i am concerned , i agree with this assertion . companies usually adopt psychological mean to attract the customer and to make the customors feel the product are good for themselves . they carry out some research and study in the market and find out what the customors like , and then produce them . also , to make their advertisement more appealing , company usually hire some celebrity that are popular in the market and even respected by the customors to show in the advertisement . for example , company hire famous people with good skin to tell customors that by buying their face-protecting product , people will become more beautiful just like the model in the advertisement . as we all know , everyone would like to be beautiful , affected by this desire , people seek to find something that could protect their face and to make themselves more beautiful . so when people see some product shown in the advertisement which corresponds to their desire , they feel the product are what they want , which mean that the product are made more better , at least seemingly , than what they really are by catering to people 's need . however , we should not lose our sight of the fact that advertisement just make the good seem better , rather than actually better . the real value of the product is decided by the product themsevles , or more accurately , by how the company make them . so to attact more customors , the company should not focus all their attention on the advertisement , but on their product themselves and their service , which serve to the real quality of the product . to sum up , advertisement do have a positive effect on the product , but the product ' real value is not decided by the advertisement .
