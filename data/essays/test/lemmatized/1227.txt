i partially agree with the statement , but not completely . although different people might have different perspective for it . some people prefer to travel in group led by a tour guide , whereas some prefer to travel alone or in group without being led by a tour guide to explore thing on their own . a tour could have different purpose . it could be an educational tour or a tour in vacation with an intention to explore and feel the beauty of nature . there are many literature and book-guides available for well known place round the world . a book written by explorer could help you understand the place of visit thoroughly than a tour guide could explain it to you . it is worth spending after a book , though expensive but once , rather than spending out money for the tour guide . a tour guide is a human being and we human being are demanding bunch . a group might have to spend a fair amount after a tour guide , whereas a book ha to be bought only once and it could guide you throughout it lifecycle . interaction with a tour guide could be uncomfortable for few member in the group a the tour guide is an unkown person from the unfamiliar place . moreover , visiting a foreign place , to enjoy the company of a good tour guide , we might have to overcome the difficulty of cultural or linguistic difference . also , we could not judge what kind of person he is . so it is always better to travel without a tour guide and try to explore new thing and place on your own than to prefer to take risk . apart from the ambiguity that could be encountered in decision to take a tour guide , it could be beneficial to have a tour guide at few place of visit like forest , where there is an intrinsic chance of an attack by the wild predator . a tour guide can warn you before entering a particular zone . he can help you to understand what thing are to be taken care of or considered before entering such area . but a tour to a familiar place like the united states of america doe not require a tour guide . there are many book material available to understand and explore the natural beauty and cultural heritage of the united states . so , i concur , without any ambiguity that , to travel in a group by being or not led by a tour guide depends on the type of place you are visiting .
