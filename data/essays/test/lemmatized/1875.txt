i agree with the statement that people who are successful are tend to try new thing and take risk rather than not repeating same thing what they know how to do it . certainly , it is much easier to follow the way of doing thing what you know how to complete . you just need to repeat the same step a you did before . however , if you do the same thing everyday , it is safe and reasonable but the way of life doe not produce more than just a normal life . to give an example , a factory worker may put two mechanic part together a his bos told him to do so all day long , then he get a little money . it is very natural . easy safe activity make only that much result . on the other hand , i know how succesful people became so succesful . they are not in the higher position only by chance . a lot of those who spend a lot of time , got over many difficulty and sometimes might have been deceived by bad people , they came across the new idea , helpful people and so on to be successful . for example , they might have spent more than 20 year for experiment , bought expensive device to create new product and they even threw away their happy family life ! i am sure that successful people chose to be just successful by doing anything they need to be successful . by doing thing what they are so used to doe not make a huge benefit , only those who try new thing and have no fear to taking risk get a opportunity to be successful . in this point , i agree with the statement .
