i do n't agree with the statement , in my opionion , the traveling by myself is better than travel in group led by a tour guide . because i could be more freeable , i do n't need to pay more money and i may increase the ability of self-control . first of all , if i travle by myself , i could have a more better plan , i think that is the most important reason for people to choose this way to travel . in this way , firstly i could choose how to go to the place and where place to go to , i also could when to leave . others , i do not need to go shopping be the ledding . in many travel group , they often take the people to buy some unuseful thing , and then the guide will get the benefit from the shop . secondly , if i am not with the guide , i do n't need to pay for them . in fact , we can buy some book to understand the history of the famous place , we do not have to ask the guide . i believe the book will be more useful . in the other hand , we could use the money to buy some other thing . i think it is better than giving money to guide . thus , i prefer to travel by myself . the most important reason is i can improve the ability of self-control , it mean i need to kown a lot of the information about the place i will go , i need to understand the purpers of the travel , i need to plan all of the travel an i need to control the spend of money . i think these are very crucial for myself . this way also indicates i will be a manager to decision something . if i do it well , i must have more confidence to face the life in future . so , this way of travel carry more weight than another one . to conclude , i think the travelling by myself ha more adventages than those of led by guide.l could have own plan , i do not lose more money and i can get more ability , so i think that is my best choice to travel .
