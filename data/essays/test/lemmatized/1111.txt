yes , i agree that many company that are producing their product mostly like to reach the customer through the advertisments . so that the customer attracts to the product that are shown in the television . but when we get the product to the home we face many problem with the product , these problem are not even mentioned in the user manual . many other product that are used in the common life also creates many problem . for example when we consider the agriculture field we see many advertisments on the pesticide that are to be used in the agriculture inorder to protect the crop from the bacteria , but when we get the pesticide , after using it we face many problem that we never come into our notice previously . this may totally spoil the crop . when we take into account the advertisement of the any motor vehicle in that particular advertisement they show that the vehicle is more efficient an give good milleage and the engine working is good . ater getting it we face the problem in the milleage of the vehicle and the engine also does'nt work properly and get damage within a few month . usually every common man attracts to the advertisement that are shown on the health care medicine and the beauty cosmatics . when we watch the advertisement of the medicene that cure the common disease like fever , headache and the body pane . we never take the suggetions of the doctor , but we just take the medicine that wa shown in the advertisement , this may casue an serious illness . but these advertisisng company never give an serious caution not to take the medicine with the doctor suggestion . when we see the advertisement of the spectakles that wa telecasted on the television , they get to the showroom and purchase the glass , this cause the eye damage but we have to get tested by the eye specialist before using the glass so that he will suggest u to use the particular glass that are not affecting our eye 's but it protects . the advertisement on the fan also we face the same problem , the fan work for few day well and later it strukcs . these are the some example i observed particularly in my life .
