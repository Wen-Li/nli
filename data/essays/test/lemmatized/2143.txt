i think that the progress made by techonological developement and the need for more powerful mean of transport will lead our society to use le and le car to go from one place to another . governments of lot of country try to prompt the public transport ; for example in italy there are a lot of advantage if you take ticket for bus and underground that last for month or at least two week the company that manages the transport make you pay le than the ticket bought every day . but not only he convenience make you use the public transport : the fact that in large city ( and in the future there will be more and more larger city ) you can move from one side of the city to other staying only minute on the underground ; you can imagine how many people will be around in the future ( we are 6 billion today ) and you can imagine what if everyone would take the car to go somewhere : everyone would be stuck in traffic all the ay long ! so it is reasonable that more and more people will use public transport to move rapidly . another important problem connected with the use of car by everyone is that the pollution would became a menace for our health , what if billion of car would be around in a world that even today suffers from enviromental problem ; even today we experiece the consequence of air pollution : increasing of disease and lumb cancer . some intitution try to overcome this problem by stopping the traffic for one or two day but this is a remedy that is not sufficient . the problem must be solved from the inside with drastic remedy . the third reason is the thechnological development which in the last year ha made giant footstep : engineer will develop a fast , economic and respetful of the environment mean of transport to meet the need of the growing society and replace the use of car . so to summarize i think that future will be characterized by highy efficient mean od transport like high velocity train or something like that to move rapidly from one place to another respecting the enviroment .
