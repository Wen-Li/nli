success is an interesting but complicated issue at the same time . the common idea of a successful person is often associated with being ambitious and take new risk and initiative , expecially regarding one 's carreer . on the other side , other successful people are the one who can do very well one thing , usually their job . in my opinion , success can be found in a combination of these two attitude : it is a matter of ambitiousness and will to try new way and dedication and passion for one 's activity . it 's about improving what we believe it is our main quality , and at the same time , discovering new pattern to develop it . but it could be sometimes hard to challenge one 's limit , a well a extremely rewarding , both emotionally and socially . for example , there 's a huge company in my hometown producing clothes . at the beginning , 30 year ago , it wa only a small laboratory where two brother , both tailor , worked producing shirt , and focusing on a high quality service for few , known people . this small shop wa very well known in the city . this wa considered a success in term of fulfilling their dream to open a shop with their saving and reach a good reputation for their work in their hometown . but after a decade , they decided to go beyond production , and started to design their own shirt : it wa certainly a risk at the beginning , but it proved to be a smart choice after a while . the two brother ' company soon became very appreciated in the region and it 's now one of the country 's biggest fashion company , producing not only shirt but suite . they also export and have many shop around the world , being one of the most famous brand in this field . i believe this brief story show how success is about accomplishing your goal but also risk and try new thing at the same time , because you could find out new skill and habilities that you may not know to posse .
