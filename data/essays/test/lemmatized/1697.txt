youth is the time of life when a person is full of strength , when he/she stop being a child who need care and could start being a more active member of the community he 's living in . the more the community evolves and growth , the more personal involvement and participation are required by young people . at the same time , a much a the community ha to provide the young person with good living condition , it 's the duty and the responsibility of this person to contribute towards the well-being of the social group itself . what about nowadays relationship between the young and their community ? do the young contribute enough of their time and energy to helping the community they belong to ? since i wa sixteen , i started getting involves in all kind of activity carried out in my small social context , small a i live in quite a tiny town . at the beginning , it wa just i and a group of friend , fond of looking for something able to help u use wisely our spare time : i mean having fun , but pursueing at the same time good aim . with that idea in mind , we decided to set up a formal non-governmental organization , quite poor of financial resource to tell the truth , but full of ambitious purpose . since then , there 's no one single week we miss the meeting with old people or child with disability ; nor do we avoid organizing party all the citizen can take part in . we understood we just need to do all this : it 's a must , not to say the only way that give u a hand to feel better , to be motivated , happy and satisfied with our own life . after i started the university study , i got in touch with student coming from bigger city than mine , and i got the chance to talk to them on the social activity carried out in their community . i wa quite surprised while discovering also the biggest city ( a milan or pavia ) were made up of many part , which acted a if they were small town in the larger city . i wa interested to know each of these part had a sort of it own non-governmental organization that carried out task similar to mine . overall , i can say not only young people are involved in the life of the social group they were born in , but the number of people committed to towards the goodness of those group is definitely increasing , more and more , a well a spreading .
