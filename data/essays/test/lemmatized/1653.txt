advertising is a very expensive yet effective aspect of selling a product . many business now actualy run on advertising like internet based site with banner and free tv station . the advertising industry is a massive industry which involves allot of finance . for company to pay that much money and higher a team of employes just for advertising can only proof the essence and importance of promoting the product . the question is since now we see advertising for may be most product on the market if not all , doe that mean that every product is good ? doe it mean that every product is worth buying ? in my opinion the answer is no ! ive seen tv add for a soap that magicaly vanishes the stain , pills that make you loose so much weight in just a week and turn you in to a super model , toys that make you invinsable , advert which parrents call `` pointless crap '' . many countaries now banned or made law agains that `` pointles crap '' they call good advertisment . which falsfully promotes a product or brain wash kid on to making there objective of the month to make their parent buy that toy on tv for them . people are more aware of the techniques of advertising and they are aware that not all advertisement are true and that they can say anything i dont want u to think that i am implying that advertising in general is bad or that it should be stoped completely . no ! advertising is very good and it is indeed a very smart way to sell any product . personaly i just think that instead of falsfully advertising a useless project and convince people some thing that is completely not true . why not make add that are realy smart and catchy which are funny , which make want to buy the product without making you beleive something that is not true . i think if company did that it would be much more succesfull than tricking people to give them their money !
