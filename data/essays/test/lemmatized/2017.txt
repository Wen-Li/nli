many people claim that it is more important for student to understand idea and concept that it is for them to learn fact . i think it is not the case for many reason like reliability , validity , even from the theory . for general , most idea and concept we learned come from the book and newspaper , so most of the information is recorded a theory which could not provides u reliable infomation . and student would not cofirm the reliability until they saw the fact . for example , we heard about the theory about the market strategy from the textbook , but we could not be sure that the theory work in the real world , and we have to apply those theory in our job or volunteer career to see it reliability . secondly the idea and concept in the book could sometime be out of date , the student could hardly find a book talk about most fashionable design for now in the library and they have to go online and check the website , see the picture and had a clear idea with the valid information . and the real world now provide u for convenient way to learn fact , from the tv program , internet , even from other 's experience . furthermore , techniquely speaking , from many test in the lab we confim the fact that picture image and fact could bring more fresh memory rather than the understanding of idea and concept . that mean it would be more impressive for u when we saw the fact . in a word , we could gain our understading of idea and concept form the fact we learned , the procees of analysising those fact could impress our understanding . so i claim that it is more important for student to learn fact than to understand idea and concept .
