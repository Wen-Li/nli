to have broad knowledge about many academic subject is amazing and people will apretheate your information . to specialize on one subject in my opinion is better because you will go deep to the subject and if you work you will work in one satisfaying position a well a a satisfaying payment , but if you havce information about alot oif subject you will only kno the basic of all the subject , so when it come to work you will not be excelant in your job because you will only know the basic of it . specializationj in one subject will give you consentreation a well a fokising inm one way and one direction . my opinion is to specialize in one subject put a goal in ur life and work hard a well a doing what ever it take to acheave this goal of yours .
