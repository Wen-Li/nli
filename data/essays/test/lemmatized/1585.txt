my marketing professor at the university always told me that the main rule of the advertising is making promoted product more fashionable then they really are . i , therefore , belive that in the 90 % of case the advertisement make product useful and necessary even if they are n't , since the adversements always show cute people use the promoted product and , most of all , because the message they give is able to persuade people that if they use the adversided product they can became cooler people . first , one of the main advertising strategy is the use of famous actor to promote product . an advertising where a famous and gorgeous actor is involved make automaticaly the promoted product desiderable since people start to belive that if they use the advertised product they will be a cool a the famous actor is . for example in my coutry there are many u.s. actor that come in italy in order to promote italian product , a , for instance gorge clooney that ha been promoting the martin , an alchoolic drink , since 2001 . the conseguence is that many people belive that drinking martini is cool , since george cloney drink it . second , there are no rule or regulation that impose to the advertisement maker to be honest with the public , no morality exists in the advertisement war . therefore , doe n't matter if it is true , the message must be able to convince people to buy product . few month ago , in my country a new advertisement started to circulete on tv , it regard a new car , the safest one in the world ! . two week ago an article on the main newspaper of my country informed u that , after some experiment , the factory stopped the production of the new car a it wa unsafe . nothing happened in respect of the advertisement , the only conseguence of the news wa no more picture around the city of italy showing the `` safest car in the world ! '' finally i belive that the main purpose of the advetisments is to tell the true but is persuade people to spent their money , therefore always product seems much better then they really are .
