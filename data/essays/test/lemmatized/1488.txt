many people belive that studing a lot in a particular field is important . because they think that knowing one thing correctly is more useful than knowing several thing with light knowledge . however , i have different point of view . i maintain that having many field ' knowledge is better than scoping one field because people can not survive in the world with overflowing information . nowdays , people need broad knowledge in their house and office to be seen a smart . about several decade ago , having deep and amount of knowledge in one subject allowed people to get job what they wanted . it wa no matter whether they know how to play golf or know how to fix the mechines . however , in nowdays , a person should know how to play golf ; to become closer with one 's friend or boss , and should know how to fix electronic equipment ; in case when a computer break at the office or a tv , computer , and a radio breakes at home . knowing a lot of information and having lot of ability to do something are more appealing to people than focusing at one subject . because people think that some people who got broad knowledge are smart . with narrowed information , a person is easily neglected in a group and eventually a society ignores that person . as the society think that the person can not stand with the situation when one need broad knowledge to solve the problem . as the world is fullfilled with amount of data , we need to prepare for the situation that we might conflict to get over that situation with many information . we should prepare .
