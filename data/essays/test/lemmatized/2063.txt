i agree with it is important for student to understand idea and concept than to learn fact . although most of the people say that is is very important to know the fact the what ha happened , and how it ha happend . i think it is useless to sit and think about what ha happened . because it is just waste of time to relay on the past . as the student of the 21 st centure , where the technology ha been already developed . we ha to move with the fast moving world . .. everything ha been created for u . now it the time for u only toread about the main idea of the product , for what it ha been created . we have to understand the whole concept regarding the developement of the product . analyse the concept and should further modify it . for our future use . as the fact explain u about what ha already happened and how it ha happened . it only important for u only to know what had happened and we should leave about that . because they only give u idea , but nothing more than that . it also not so important for u to read it so deeply . we hav to leave the past a the past and should always move with the future technology to make our life beautiful . acccording to me a we the student of the technology we should always have the creative thought to invent some thing new and to give it to the society so , we should not simply sit and think what had happened , but think about what to do to improve the technology to make the life so simple . in order to conclude my opinion with learning thew new idea and understanding the concept . i suggest my friend only to learn some thing new than relay upon the past to know the past . because of we being the stundents of the new era ha so much work to do . that is to give some thig to our mother land . there is so much research work to do to invent some thing new . which may be helpful to thew humankind . so much work ha been done by our father and it is our responsibility to conclude their work with good result .
