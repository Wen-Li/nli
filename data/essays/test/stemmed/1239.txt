i complet agre with thi statement . understand idea and concept is in sever way much more import than just learn fact . my first reason ist that student should do more than just learn fact . nearli everybodi can choos what subject he or she want so studi . that show that the student are reali interest in the subject they studi . just lear fact would not be as satisfi as understand the idea and concept of all the differ theme . although peopl can more easi rememb thing when they understand them . learn fact is unfortun mostli for the short term memori . the second point is that understand idea and concept is much more usu in real life then learn fact . when you understand idea and concept you can use thi basic knowledg in mani differ situat in your everyday life . just becaus of the way you take on problem . a veri simpl exampl is when you want to find a bank for your money . onli if you understand how it realli work , you will find the right bank for you . the fact e.g. sparkass , a german bank , is the best one will help you noth . the last and most import fact is that you can onli use all the stuff , you have learn dure your studi , on the job when you understand the idea and concept . in everyday busi everi situat will be at least a littl bit differ from the situat you experienc befor . therfor it help you noth if you know about standart way to solv a problem . for exampl , you have to lead a team . just know about some fact about teamlead will not help you to lead the team to a good , or even better , great success . if you know the fact - treat everi person differnt - help you not much . just becaus it dont show you a to treat e.g. peter . in conclus i want to say , that there are a lot of point show understand concept and idea is much more import than learn fact . and i hope all professor around the world think the same way and tri to teach concept and idea not just learn fact by heart .
