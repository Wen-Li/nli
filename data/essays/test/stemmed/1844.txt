nowaday , some peopl may hold the opinion that '' it is more import for student to learn fact '' , but other deem that `` it is more import for student to understand idea and fact '' . as far as i am concern i agre that it more import for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact . there mani subtl point that suppert my opinion . one reason for my inclin for thi opinion is that the student can develob hi knowledg base on hi own idea and concept . anoth reason for my peopens for thi opinion is that the student will be more flexabl in the way he is think and thi is veri import for him to have an open mind and to be creativ , so he can face defer subject with one strategi third reason that i think i must give it a few word is that fact may be a result of understand idea and concept . so , the student may reach fact base on hi understandung the idea and concept . in a word , take into account all these factor , we may reach to the conclus that it is ipmort for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact becaus of they can develop there own idea , forthermor , they can be flexabl face defer type of supject . also fact can be result of idea and concept .
