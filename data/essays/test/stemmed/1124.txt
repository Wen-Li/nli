there are two type of reach success . the first is to do all the thing in the way that is desir by the commun as well as possibl and do them alway most effici . altern you can tri to act innov and handl risk with courag . that is the way i prefer . so i agre to the statement , that the way to ( better ) success is the way of innov and risk take . i identifi the reason for the implic `` better '' in two dimens : on one hand the tempor dimens is to be research . etern deal with well-known strategi might be effici for a certain time , but after some time boredom will certainli appear . as soon as a way of act lose it potenti to surpris it will be desir to be replac by someth new - especi in the fast renew commun we are live in in the 21st centuri . peopl are constantli ask for new , more , innov input . so keep act in one scheme for too long will send you automat into a state of be uninterest and all the success of the time of social loaf is decreas rapidli . anyway , the second dimens of qualiti in innov process is build upon the first one . kept strategi do not onli bore somewhen but also lose the abil of self-reflect . a product or strategi that had work for year might be caught by new , smaller , more simpl product who have still a view for the consum ' need and not alreadi lost in self-ador . let 's take microsoft and appl as exampl : for a long time microsoft wa the number one softwar distributor in the world . with their oper system `` window '' as their flagship they walk a well-known path of softwar develop . howev , one day appl sneak silent onto the market and from one day to the next their comput and softwar solut were as regard as never befor . their strategi wa the perman review of the consum ' need and the possibl own mistak . onli through thi abil to reflect the own product perman made them now the new number one . big might be power - but small is , on long distanc , more effect . without invest into innov and without some accept of risk success is no effect of durat . alway reflect your own mental model and you are go to be ( for long time ) abl to succeed in what you do .
