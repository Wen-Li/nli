advertis is a veri expens yet effect aspect of sell a product . mani busi now actuali run on advertis like internet base site with banner and free tv station . the advertis industri is a massiv industri which involv allot of financ . for compani to pay that much money and higher a team of employ just for advertis can onli proof the essenc and import of promot the product . the question is sinc now we see advertis for may be most product on the market if not all , doe that mean that everi product is good ? doe it mean that everi product is worth buy ? in my opinion the answer is no ! ive seen tv add for a soap that magicali vanish the stain , pill that make you loos so much weight in just a week and turn you in to a super model , toy that make you invins , advert which parrent call `` pointless crap '' . mani countari now ban or made law again that `` pointl crap '' they call good advertis . which fals promot a product or brain wash kid on to make there object of the month to make their parent buy that toy on tv for them . peopl are more awar of the techniqu of advertis and they are awar that not all advertis are true and that they can say anyth i dont want u to think that i am impli that advertis in gener is bad or that it should be stope complet . no ! advertis is veri good and it is inde a veri smart way to sell ani product . personali i just think that instead of fals advertis a useless project and convinc peopl some thing that is complet not true . whi not make add that are reali smart and catchi which are funni , which make want to buy the product without make you beleiv someth that is not true . i think if compani did that it would be much more succesful than trick peopl to give them their money !
