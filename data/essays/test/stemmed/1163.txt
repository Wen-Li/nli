im not agre i think that for student both idea , to understand the idea and concept and to learn fact are import . first is import to understand idea and concept to know all about someth , if one are interest , of cours . for exampl , when we are in the class and the professor are talk about some issu we must to take atent of hi word and then we can have an idea about the issu . despit of there are some issu that are not veri easi to learn it , but we can ask to the professor and tri to understand . sometim we have a differ idea of someth , of cours , is not necesari that all peopl have the same idea , but there are some topic that all know if it true or fals ( well , is difficult to speak about what is true or fals in the life , i think that all is rel , i m realli not sure about thi question , is difficult to respond ) and here is when the second part come , when we have the experi . for exampl , drug . there are mani young peopl who thing that the drug is not bad for ower health and life , and although their parent had tolk with them about the problem of drug but they didnt paid atent and they consum . after the experi or later they can see the drug problem . there are some peopl that they dont need to learn the fact , they onli understand idea and no more is necessari . so both are import for student . anoth exampl , usual , when i m studyng chines languag and learn about the structur , i tri to right some sentenc in my copybook , but onli when i go to the hous of some chines friend i can understand idea or concep of chines structur , becaus is better for me to learn fact than understand idea and concept in chines languag , but thi is a problem in my countri becaus hardli i can speak in chines with some chilean peopl , onli a few peopl can speak chines , and the anoth problem is that the chines peopl who live here in chile the most of them speak dialect or canton languagu . .
