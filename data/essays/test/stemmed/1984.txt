i disagre with the statement . i think it is as import for student to understand idea and concept as it is to learn the fact . these two can not be separ , becaus they complement each other . it is crucial to an effect learn process to combin both concept and fact . the understand of a concept is the base for understand fact . the concept/idea make the fact clearer to the student becaus then he/sh ha a background support a particular fact they might be face . let 's say a student is take an internship in clinic psycholog and ha to interview differ kind of patient . the student will not be abl to give an appropri and complet diagnosi base on onli the interview . he/sh will be abl to see in realiti mani of the thing he/sh ha learn in class . for exampl , the bodi languag of a patient . the student will not be abl to interpret all the signal the patient is send unless he/sh know what those signal or bodi messag mean . and thi is when the concept and idea play a big role . by combin the inform he/sh ha learn in theori with the inform provid in practic , the intern will be abl to make an accur interpret of the messag convey by the patient . mani univers here in chile base their curricula more on theoret cours rather than practic . i believ that a good curricula should alway have a good balanc between theoret and practic cours . it is true that the conceptu cours will train and shape the mind of the student to a more abstract kind of thought , but the factual world will shape other skill in the student as well . it is in the practic world where the student will end up work , and not in the world of idea and concept . therefor , it is crucial for them to face the fact of the concept they are learn in class .
