in my countri , korea , student are busi memor all the number and other specif inform . it is , howev , now chang and peopl give more credit on creativ becaus creativ is necessari to succeed in the global societi . for creativ they should have open-minded and for thi , student should know the idea rahter than fact . i agre that it is more import to get the idea of concept that to memor fact , becaus idea result to innov , and they can be rememb for a long time . nowaday , it is a global trend of educ to tri to make student more creativ . they stimul children 's imagin and make them becom more innov . in order to do thi they teach gener idea and background knowledg that would be fundament for further imagin . edison wa n't an well educ man , but still , he could invent more than 1,000 invent . he thought if he would be abl to transform sound into physic form , and thi made the phonograph . he did n't know specif detail but he had some basic knowledg for creativ . he had the concept of what he should do . moreov , he found out fact , and did n't learn them . fact such as number or year are easili forgotten unless it 's repeatedli memor . wherea idea stay in the memori much longer . for long term consequ , it would be better to know the gener concept not the specif fact . the fact can be found through research , instantli through the internet , as long as you know the what you should look for , which is the idea . onc , i had an import math test . i tri to memor all the equat which wa nearli imposs unless i 'm an i.q. elev person . instead of that , i tri to know the concept , not the fact for a few day befor the test . dure the test , i could find out the fact as solv the problem , understand how those equat came out more detail and also recal them longer that the other time when i tri to memor the specif detail , through my experi , to know the idea seem better . know the concept is the same as be abl to see an entir maze and know the fact is the same as just look at a wall . to come out , you should be abl to see the whole not a part . as far as i 'm concern , i believ that to have the knowledg of the idea would be more benefici .
