i person do not agre with the statement that `` the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guid '' . the primari reason i do not agre with the statement is becaus i believ that while travel a certain element of adventur is need to make the travel enjoy and memor . i think when you travel in a group led by a tour guid the element of adventur would be lost . the thrill in explor and travel new place on one 's own would be more reward compar to the comfort and pleasur provid by a guid tour . i might be will to travel in a group but without a tour guid . i would prefer to take along a travel book , if necessari , as a guid . it would be more fun to explor new place with friend and famili , but without a guid . it would bring out the adventur spirit in member of the group . though there would be a chanc that we might get lost dure the journey it would be worth the troubl onc we complet the trip . we can reflect back on the trip and share all those happi moment . i feel a guid tour would onli expos us to the most popular locat at a place . but when we make the tour on our own we would have have the freedom and time to explor the place on our own . also the experi would be uniqu and differ from what anyon els would experi if one opt for a guid tour . i speak partli from person experi . i troughli enjoy my trip along with friend to the `` burra cave '' near vizag in my home state . while a guid tour would have provid us with a visit to all the popular locat on the our , we decid to explor the place on our own . it gave us the chanc to see mani place which were not includ in the guid tour but nonetheless were more excit and memor . on the other hand i do not rememb much about the guid tour to the `` golconda fort '' in my home town of hyderabad .
