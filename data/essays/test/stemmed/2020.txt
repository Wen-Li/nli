today the number of car on our planet is realli high . some peopl think it will increas in the next year , other are convinc that thi number will be smaller than today . i feel strongli that the second posit is more realist , and one of the most import reason is that the cost of natur resourc as petroleum and ga , will increas in the futur . thees kind of resourc ar not everlast and they are the main resourc use in a car 's motor . a second point is that also the cost of life is increas . actual it 's realli expens to buy a car for a common famili and in the futur mani of thees famili will not have enough money for a cheap vehicl . anoth point is the lack of park place insid a big citi and traffic jam . thees are seriuo problem in a urban center and they will lead to a reduct of the vehicl . otherwis the life of citizen will becom an hell : they will spend all their spare time in search of a park or in the middl of road , crowd by other ' car . finnali i think that some problem could be solv . for istanc the structur of motor should be chang , permittng them to work also with a differ fuel : water will be the best candid . howev i think that a reduct of car could be consid postiv for our futur life .
