in the modern societi almost all compani reli on advertismet to promot thier product or servec . thi make adveris compani to whatev they can , to make product or servec apeal to the consum . becaus of that , there is a big debat wheater adevertis make product seem much better than the realli are . in my opinion , i gree with peopl . who say advertis make product seem much better than they realli are , for mani reason . the first reason is that , they show onli the possit side of the product . thu , these comopani deciev peopl and not show the other side . for instanc , a cloth soap compani might deciev peopl by onli say that thi product can clean all hard dirt in your cloth , and not show that it may spoil some kind of cloth . in addit , these compani deciev peopl by exagur on the posit side of the product . for exampl , i saw a commerci about an acn treatment . in thi commerci they say , thi treatment cure ani one who is suffer from acn . in fact , i bought thi product and i tri it , but it did not help me . anoth reason is that , mani compani prefer to target childern becaus they can be deciev easli . thu , these compani put a lot of advertis in cartoon on t.v . in fact , these advertis are not onli on t.v . they are everywher in the road billboard to target childern . there is a strong evedinc to support that if you look at the new gener of childern , you will recogn how they differ from the older one . these childern love the phrase `` i want '' . they ask thier parant for mani thing . all of that becaus of the deciept advertis , which target childern . overal , these compani love moni more than ani thing els , which make them deciept . they deciev peopl by exagur and not say the side effect of the product . in addit . they have creat a new gener of childern , which these childern ask parent for a lot of product to buy , by target them in thier decipt advertis .
