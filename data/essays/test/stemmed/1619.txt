do you believ that success peopl tri new thingd and take risk rather tan onli do what they alreadi know how to do well ? some peopl love to tri someth new and enjoy creation . some other love to do what they alreadi know becaus they do n't want to take risk of fail . from my viewpoint , i think that peopl can success becaus they tri new thing and take risk . i will argu thi issu with the fellow reason . first of all , i think that dream make peopl great . children have more possibl becaus they love dream . for exampl , a child dream that he want to be a basebal player . he may ha no idea how he should do will becom a good player , howev , he will tri to reach hi goal . if a child do n't have such a dream , he will never success . secondli , i find that these success peopl have one charact . they love to solv the problem . for instanc , my father is a professor . i alway find that he love think . he alway tri to solv the problem in hi resurch . not like me , i alway hope someon will help me to solv the question . so my father can becom a helper , and i alway depend other peopl help . thirdli , i think that creativ will make peopl success . sometim peopl have some new idea , some peopl will do it , some peopl do n't , then those peopl who love to tri their new idea will give them chanc to success . mayb they have a lot of bed experi dure the process , but they learn more lession . so thi knowledg and experi help them success . if peopl would n't tp tri , mayb we still think that peopl would never fli in the modern age . in the summari , i believ that peopl will success becaus they will learn more experi and knowledg , and they hope to solv the problem . and the most improt thing , they have dream to tri that they don , t konw about . so these peopl will success .
