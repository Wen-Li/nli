accord to me there are reason that support thi statement and reason that do n't . tri new thing is a good idea mainli becaus also if you can do veri well someth , you must know that there will alway be somebodi that can do the same thing better and faster than you . thi must push you not to be alway stabl on your idea , but to be open to chang , to be faster in adap to thi `` rapid chang '' world . for exampl , in electron busi technolog are in a veri fast evolut ( accord to new discoveri and research ) , and if you doe n't support chang , probabl your succ will come to an end . anoth reason for what chang is good is the concept of `` new idea '' . custom are interest in a product for a seri of characterist of the object and among them there is the import of new . new thing attract peopl as well as well-don thing . use the situat of electron busi , you can say that innov is one of the most impost aspect that make a custom choos a product instead of anoth or that push him to a certain way of live is free time , for instanc . on the other side , leav a rout to take anoth you do n't know where it goe is n't alway a good chois . in fact if you are strong in a busi , it would take a risk for you to begin a new `` business-path '' , becaus you can lose part of your money or even lose the carismat import you 've got in a certain field of the busi world . in a conserv view of busi , leav the old rout ( or give more import to new thing ) can be destruct : it cost you a lot of money ( new technolog , research . .. ) and , of cours , you ca n't know how your new busi area can evolv . but look at all these point , i think that in our societi , with so much chang in action , an econom polit of renew thing and smart `` gambl '' is absolut need . thi imag of the smart gambler is , accord to me , the best posit that success peopl must assum : someon who ha to take strong decis without forget that reason ha to be the background of hi behaviour . we need gambler . without them , our modern societi is go to fall down in a terribl hole of routin and inerthia ( dead calm ) .
