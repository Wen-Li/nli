mani peopl may agre with the statement that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guid . howev , i do n't think so . in my view , i believ that the best way to travel is with your friend or famili member without a tour guid . to begin with , if one person travel with hi friend without a tour guid , then he can choos where and when to visit accord to what he realli want . in fact , when travel in a group with a tour guid , the routin of the trip is alway decid by the tour guid so that the travel will be limit and lost freedom and right to make decis in their travel . moreov , one will feel more relax and free when he travel just with hi friend or famili without ani stranger in the group or a tour guid . for exampl , last year when i wa have a trip to japan in a group led by a tour guid , i did n't feel perfect and free becaus most peopl of the group is stranger . therefor , dure thi summer vacat , i travel korean just with my friend without a tour guid . thi trip is total differ and wonder . experi tell me that travel with friend without a guid can make me relax and reliev my pressur from the busi studi . last but not least , it is also more econom and cost less if travel without a tour guid . fact infer us that the expens of travel in a group alway cost a lot due to hire a tour guid . for instanc , a friend of mine ha a trip to shanghai in a group with a tour guid spent much more money than i travel by myself . to sum up , i think that the best way to travel is with friend and famili rather than in a group led by a tour guid . in my obersv , it is more free , cost less and let travel make tour decis by themselv .
