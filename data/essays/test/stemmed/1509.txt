i agre with the statement . advretis is some peopl job they are earn their money by advretis ant their job is make the product so good look and make the peopl who look at it think that is a perfect product . for exampl a make up product when women look at the advretis of the product they must think it is the best product for their makeup bag it look small in the advretis it look color it must look the same on their face , but it is not peopl should not beleav at everi product they see on the advretis are perfect as they think . it is the job of the peopl who make the advretis and thi is one of the legal way to earn money ( brain wash peopl ) . their job is to make u think it is a good product and make sure that you buy it . they do n't care care abaut you after you buy the product . that happend to me like it happend to everi kid in age 8 or araund 8 year old kid , i saw a new toy advert and i love the toy from the advert i beg to my parent to buy it and i sucsead but when i opend the the box of that toy i undearstond that it is noth compeard the one i saw in the advertis on t.v . so i undearstand that i should not beliv evert thing i see on the t.v.special the advertis . i am not say they are bad some of them can be hepl if you do n't know what is new on the shopingcent or market , mayb i did n't like the toy but some other kid love it , but i am still suppot with what i say in the begin most of hte advretis make the product seem much better than they are . almost all of the advretis for the kid are make the product look better than the kid see becaus they can imagin way more than a teenag or a adult can imagin .
