the communitiy is not an entiti without it peopl . peopl who live togeth , share the resourc like school , road , sanit , market and much more . to serv the commun ha rather gain a backstag nowday . the worst thing is that the young peopl who are the futur gener , are lake time and zeal to help their commun . there are variou reason behind thi problem . chang social valu , pressur to excel in career and indiffer attitud of the youth can be consid as the few of mani factor result in thi problem . firstli , i feel that in mani highli develop modern societi the social valu have chang . the peopl have becom more self centr and they hardli care about the other . they enjoy live artifici life . as a result these valu are pass to the younger peopl as well . after all , an individu behav in the manner what he or she see . thi attitud is less prevail in the lesser develop societi like in the develop world . there , poepl are depend on each other and still believ in serv their commun . secondli , the young peopl are hard press against time in their live . they have a tremend pressur on themselv to excel in academ , job , sport etc and as a result they spend most of their time in work hard to achiev their object . help their commun in activ like educ the street children , help the old peopl etc. come as a secondari prioriti for them . also not have ani monetori benfit in return to serv their commun discourag them to work for the same . final , one more point which i believ contribut to thi problem is the indiffer attitud of the youth . today youth ha easi access to everyth . in wealthi societi , the youth ha access to everi luxori without have to work hard . they believ that it is their birth right to have all the facil they are enjoy . they are so much involv in their fun relat activit that they forget that everi right come with a duti in return . so to conclud , i can say that it is import for the youth to understand their sens of responsibl toward their commun and societi as whole . the can not live isol from the problem of their surround . just a littl care attitud can do wonder for them and societi as a whole .
