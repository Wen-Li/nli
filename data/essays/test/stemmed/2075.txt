educ is a veri complex issu . mani professor , scientist think a lot about the subject of educ . how do the student learn ? what is the better way to learn and what are the most import thing to know ? the issu about the import of idea , concept and fact is essenti . some think that idea , concept are more import than fact . other think it is wrong . in my opinion , i agre with the given statement . understand idea , concept , is more import than to learn fact . fact are not suffici to understand the world , or school matter . in my opinion , theori ha to come befor practic . if student want to understand all the point of a problem , they will need idea and concept . first , fact are necessari in educ , they can help to better understand , but at the begin there is a real need of idea and theori . in chines cultur , student alway learn in thi way . theori then practic . i will illustr my point of view with a more specif exampl . in chemistri class , student first , learn the theori , how it work , whi product react like that . after , they will make some experi to verifi the idea and concept alreadi learnt . idea and concept are realli the begin . moreov , i think that there are a base . without such a base of idea , concept , research are imposs . for instanc , sustain develop . there is a theori but no real big scale applic . concept and idea allow to product fact and practic . howev , in primari school , fact are essenti . children learn better with fact . the teacher begin to show them a fact and children discov from thi fact , concept and idea . children will not forget what they have learnt if they discov by themselv idea and concept relat to the fact . so , to conclud , idea and concept come first in univers and high studi but are second for children .
