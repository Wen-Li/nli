the statment that onli those peopl who tri newer thing and take risk are sucees in comparison to those who keep do whatev they do best , is someth that i person beliv in veri strongli . infact i agre with it to the point that i intend to pursu my career orient endeavour in somewhat the same way . the reason that my belief for thi philosophi is so strong , is what i explain henceforth . first and foremost , it is onli becaus of such peopl who take risk and tri out new thing that we have achiev so much in the fireld of technolog so far . nowaday , tachnolog is the backbon of whatev we do . and , had it not been the risk take abil of the great scientist of the yester - year , we would not have had so mani discoveri and invent that have led to a better present and a promis futur for us . the one person that come to mind in thi case is the veri well-known but often not veri well rememb scientist tesla , who is respons for the alter current that we use to drive and run practic everyth around us - gadget , machin , etc . had it not been for hi vision and hi want to tri new thing , we would have been stil tri to find out way to transfer the direct current over long distanc and provid electr to far off distanc . infact , i believ thi desir to take the risk is someth that drive a person to face advers and come out fight through them stronger and more determin . secondli , such risk take and ` tri out new thing ' abil help an individu to somewhat defin hi own destini . he doesnot simpli sit back and enjoy doind what he know best , but rather through hsi personifi vigor , help a larger part of human in a known or unknown fashion . take the exampl of teh world 's richest man mr. bill gate . just imagin a world without microsoft and without window . frankli , it 's quit unimagin . bill gate took the risk of drop out of a comfort colleg degre that would have ensur a good job , pay him good money and he would have thu live `` happili ever after '' . he instead decid to tri out someth new and ventur into the littl known field of comput technolog . the result is for all to see and admir . not onli ha he made a fortun for himself , but hi organis employ million of propl across the globe and henc he in in an indirect way the wage earner for million of home all over the world . it wa hi convict and belief in hi abil that result in the ` tech-savi ' world we live in today . finallu , although there are mani exampl of such peopl who have drift from the norm and come out victori both for themselv and mani other peopl as a result , the one thing that common to all of them is that they believ in themselv and back their abil to achiev greater height . eventhough they knew what they were good in , they did not rest on their laurel . infact , they took risk and tri new thing that result in the better of human as a whole . on my part , i aspir to one day be recal as a member of thi leagu of wonder peopl of vision and ambit . they have made the world a better plave for us to love in and have shown the way . tri to succeed .
