i disagre with the statement mention . you should not compar help in the commun and help in the famili . in former time it wa tradit that the children live togeth with their parent and grandpar and they help each other . today it is not like thi anymor and therefor mani peopl think that thi gener doe n't care about social life . thi is not true , becaus there had been never so mani organ in the world which help depress countri or transfer money to disabel person or spend money for the reaserch of method against cancer . thi show that the peopl nowaday are interest in help other peopl . perhap it seem that young peopl are not so interest in the commun becaus they look more to the problem of the whole world and not onli on the problem in their citi . thi ca n't be seen as a neg point , instead it is a posit achiev due to the global of help . addit , i know mani peopl who work in organ or elderli home to help there for no money . peopl who have no time to help person becaus they have to much work to do by their own , mostli spend money to those organ i mention abov . anoth point that emphezi thi opinion is that nowaday the boy prefer to do a sozial year instead to go to the militari a year . today the boy can choos if they want to work in a sozial organ like elderli home or hospit or to go to the militari . i knew more boy who prefer to help other peopl , although thi type of work is harder and although thi is more work than to go to the militari . thu , it can be seen that there are mani peopl who give enough time to help not just their commun , they want to help out by problem which occur over the whole world .
