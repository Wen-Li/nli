in thi essay i will tell you whi busi make thier product look better than it is in real , and the advantag and disadvantag for both buyer and seller . could advertiz be harmful sometim ? i will answer my first question which is whi busi make thier product look good and perfect to peopl . these day peopl valu the product by the way it look , so compani is tri to attract peopl by make thier product look the best on the market , which could be good from the outsid but fake from the insid , and i disagre with that , becasu the buyer is trust the compani and buy the product , so he should be given the right to have a neat product . the compani will onli car about thier profit which is ofcours a smart tihng to do but they must also be awar of it product qualiti . for the seller , he will benefit from the money he will get from the custom , although , if it wa n't that effect , custom will never buy from it again and buz talk will spread out therefor the busi will declin . i will alway suggest that the busi should not fake it product , they should be honest with peopl and be awar of the fact of cheat .
