no one can deni the fact that in thi present context that everi person know that travel play an import role in our life , i think that the statement `` the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guid , sound veri true . the extent to which wecan enjoy in travel in a group can not be otherwis . the role of a tour guid is also veri import when travel in a group , a tour guid will be have all knowledg about the variou tourist site . we can miss out some import place to visit without a tourist guid . a tour guid also recommend us to not visit some prohibit site or site which are not so good and by do so a tour guid save our time and energi . moreov tour guid will take us to site by a shortest waywhich may be unknown to us befor . travel in a group is an adventur in itself . one can never get bore in a group . activ like play game in a group and sing etc. add a lot to fun and frolic ehil visit some sites. a person can never enjoy as much if he is alone. a guid take us to site where we can enjoy more and more spend time . more over we can miss some import and interest site . although some peopl like travel plone , on the other hand accord to me travel in a group is more benefici for the peopl . it is said that great think attract good result medicur think attract bad result . ultim i would you like to say that my view are rather diferr from other peopl . i have contempl the matter as far as the topic is concern .
