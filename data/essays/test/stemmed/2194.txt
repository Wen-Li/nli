peopl like to excel in differ field in their life becuas they want have a decent life , earn a great incom and occupi a respect posit in societi . therefor , broad knowledg of mani acadam subject is better for mani reason such as gain more creativ and have higher expect . a person who have a broad knowledg can be veri creativ becaus he can join between differ subject to get to a new conclus and it might be consid as a new invent . for exampl , if a person studi as a doctor and a comput engin at the same time , he will be abl to use the technolog provid be comput to creat new tool that serv hi need as a doctor and help him do hi job more accur . broad knowledg can make the person have higher expect and make him think about a brighter futur . moreov , he can dream about a world of hi own where he might need someth that doe n't exist in the real world so he invent it , and that 's where the creativ play it part . imagin a world without creativ or ambit , that will lead the world to a complet standstil . that 's whi there are peopl who dream to get a higher eductaion level and earn differ major becaus they want the world to stay vital and aliv . final , in my opinion , i think it is a good idea for the person to broaden hi knowledg , not onli acadam , but also in the practic life becaus life is like a journey , you alway learn from it . on the other hand , a person should be awar not to get lost into hi dream and ambit and he should alway think about the real world for everi person in thi world ha hi own limit but knowledg is unlimit ; it is endless .
