a lot of controversi exist over whether most advertis make product better . my view on thi issu is that advertis have effect to have the product better . it is relat with the profit as well as compani 's imag . first of all , these day , mani compani intrduc their product by use the advertis . on thi stage , they tri to look better their product . becaus , it is associ with make profit . for exampl , in korea , one compani sell the gum advertis it product use the exagger fact which is veri effcient in prohibit the cavati . owe thi inform , a lot of peopl bought thi gum and then the profit of thi gum were skyrocket . howerv , the fact that thi gum did not have outstand effect compar with other gum is reveal . howev , regardless of the truth , thank to the advertisemet they can get a lot of money . in addit , advertis have a posit influenc on the whole compani 's imag . that is , the more firm show good point of the product , the more they get a lot of consum 's attent . it caus that the compani could be more competet than other compani . to illustr , one paper compani introduc that it product wa more eco-friendli in the advertis . at that time , the social trend wa be a eco-friendli . howev , not onli the qualiti of it paper wa the same as other paper , but also there wa no reason call eco-friendli . it is through the advertis that thi compani could get a lot of favor from the costum . all thing consid , i firmli believ that advertis have the fuction to make the product seem much better than they realli are . becaus it is connect with the profit and compani 's brand imag .
