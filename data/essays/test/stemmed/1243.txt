i agre with the statement that most of the advertis repres the perticular product as the better one among all other . as advertis main motto is just to awar peopl about the new product and to advertis the best pat of it and lastli how it can help anyon . but now due to veri high competet in the market advertis are do differ job . my preferr is better as now a day advertis show mani thing with their product . which mani time look like evevn unimagin . for exampl i have seen an advertis for a deodrant . in which when one man spray that spray on hi bodi hundr of girl just start run toward him . in thi way it misguid mani youngest perticularli . as that advertis is target youngest . in the same way for the beauti cream . in the advertis they shown that just use thi cream for seven day and you will becom beauti . but accord to expereinc of peopl it onli work 20-30 % also depend on circumst . it also make advertis unreli . secondli , mani time for advertis compani use big star . perticularli those who have great fan follow . in that way also misinterpret occur by the fan of those star . like in an advertis arnold is do hi jim from a perticular product . so after see that advertis mani peopl interpret that by use that machin onli they can build muscl like arnold . in the last mani time peopl influenc with the advertis of perticular product buy that . but after use that product for some time , came to know that it is not fulfil the need or becaus of bad materi use in it , product damag . like you buy a motorbik of perticular copani without do proper research for it but just becaus of it rough tough advertis . after some time you came to know that it part are not work properli , it averag is also low . becaus in the advertis they shown the averag with small sign for ` condit appli ' . so in thi way i can say that my prefer is the better one as compair to the other as due to veri high competit in market , the advertis are made just to give maximum profit to the compani not to peopl that whi they repres product much better from what it is .
