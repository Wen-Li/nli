i do agre with thi statement . a gener trend seen amongst peopl is that they tend to do what they onli know how to do well . to be laud for thi is a good thing but due to thi peopl often get into a comfort zone . thi comfort zone is a state of mental satisfact where peopl feel they have achiev it all and see no reason to improv . it 's gener onli a person who see a reason to improv that tri someth new . clich as it might sound , ` need is the mother of invent ' . it 's common to see a great sportsman loos hi magic touch soon after he is sign for endors . he feel proud of hi achiev and henc loos the fire insid to improv . at the same time , it is not neccessari to tri someth new for the sake of do so . it is import to continu do what one doe well for sustain . at the same time it is requir not to get too comfort with the situat and see how the bar can be rais . it is a fine line divid a ration base and an adventur will to explor . a person who will stay ahead of the competit is one who will be abl to reinvent him or herself . it 's imper to realis that time chang and so should we . if we get left behind , then one 's action would be of no consider consequ anymor . thi is get pretti standard in busi practic across the world today . a compani that will innov and offer the custom the newest and best product they can have will be the one that stay ahead . similarli a person might start someth new today , but it might becom jade tomorrow so he will have to reinvent himself . henc , i do agre with the statement but i believ it is those peopl with a matur mindset and a fervour for adventur who will be abl to set and match ambiti target . becaus tri new thing doe not make a person success . if so then ani unsuccess person can gain success with simpli a chang in profess . but convers it is chase success that will make peopl tri new thing . stay out of your comfort zone , dream big , aim high and go for the kill . that 's the formula to success .
