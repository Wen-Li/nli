i do agre with the statement that `` most advertis make product seem much better than they realli are . '' some might argu that advertis mere educ the viewer about the avail of product but i appreci the fact that advertis also place the product and make them look better than what they are . in fact the purpos of advertis have graduat from educ the potenti buyer to make the product look better and creat a need for it . that is exactli whi there is a boom in the advertis industri as more compani hire profession advertis agenc to design their advertis . let me consid an exampl of an apparel brand to establish the abov mention fact . an apparel compani when advertis a shirt or an undergar , employ a good look model to wear and display the product . it is quit obviou that the outfit would look much better on that model than it would look on ani other common buyer . anoth exampl that i would like to use in strenghthen my point is of ` celebr endors ' . in the last few decad and increas number of compani have start to employ celebr to advertis for and endors their product . even in t.v commerci we often see sport or movi celebr use or talk about a product . thi , is my opinion is an attempt made by the comapni or the advertis agenc to make the prodect look better than it is , becaus it possibl that the celebr himself never actual think of the product as highli as he appear to in the advertis and never use it himself . he is mere use by the brand to suggest the viewer of the commerci that the product is as good as for a celebr of that statur to use it . conclus , i feel that advertis nowaday primarili make the product look better
