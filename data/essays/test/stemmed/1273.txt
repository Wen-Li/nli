i do agre with the point that success peopl tri new thing and take risk rather than do what they alreadi know how to do well . the former success foster new idea in the brain and also give the push to intiat them . there are quit a number of reason for that . first , the common notion say `` the success of the person increas hi risk take abil '' . suppos a person is well establish in a busi . he ha to hi credit the goodwil of mani custom who can buy hi new product or suggest hi product to the requir peopl . hi current busi qualilti assur the qualiti of hi futur product . thi prove that he ha a better chanc to succeed . higher the chanc higher the risk take abil . second , hi prior success give him the confid to move on furthur . the noraml tendenc of human behaviour is to take up a task onli if he is motiv to do it . success definet give that motiv to implement new idea . he know the basic of manag thing which ha to be appli to a slightli differ situat . third , diversif furthur help him in reduc the risk . a situat in which one busi fall down , he ha the other to depend on . so there would be mutual support between the two firm . so in a way by explor new avenu he is reduc hi risk . the exampl of mr.dhirubhai ambani prove the discuss . he ha start just with an oil refineri and then extend hi market to textil , commun and also domest product . thi could be a good exampl of how success allow a person to start new thing . so it could be conclud that the more you dig into divers field the greater would be the overal success of a person . thi form one of the basic of busi rule .
