gener think that young peopl nowaday do not give enough time to help thier commun . probabl , it is true . becaus they have to do their homework , assign and so on , and also they want to have a fun with their friend . i definit say that most of peopl like stay with thei friend better than help their commun . becaus we can meet our neiborhood anytim . i think that thi reason connect to thi issu that recent , young peopl do not give enough time to help thei commun . howev , i disagre with thi statement that young peopl do not particip in commun . first , they sure have their time . dure the time they sre frre , and also they can do anythig what they want to do . thu , i think that peopl should not regul their time , and they do not have ani rigt to forc to do someth . and it is one of selfith of adult in the commun . by the way , in the summer , my commun ha mani summer festiv with neiborhood . to achiev the festiv we need mani stuff , and also they want outgo person . each year , the peopl who arrang the festiv alway annoy about lack of stuff , howev mani youngstar in my commun particip in the festiv , and also they enjoy it realli much . they can know how to commun with oter peopl due to particip of a commun activ . i think it is the most import to live in a daili life s a human . i know that there is deffetr tendenc of the number of stuff each year . but i am one of a person who includ young peopl , i do not want someon to say such like a statement . in assit , i think that mani youngstyar know how import of commun with oter peopl like i mention abov . therefor i definit disagre that youngstar do not particip in their commun .
