`` the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guid '' . i disagre with the statement mention abov . i am a person like to travel independ with my famili . becaus they are the person known to me and be with unknown person is too problem to me . i am veri interest to spend with my famili becaus when we grow we can not stay with them and i will be busi in studi . first reason , when we go alon we do n't have lot of time to stay at hotel . but when we are in group we have listen to the other and have to stay longer time with them . we can not have an oppurtun to speak with the local and we have to stay along with them upto their work finish . second reason , even without a guid also we can handl the situat becaus now aday a tourism book is also avail in bookstal and railway station . through thi book we can visit mani palc without a giud . moreov guid know onli few palc . after go to the place we can have guid to explain the popular thing if we pay to him . moreov after the complet of tourism we can return home soon . when we will go with group of peopl it will take lot of time and we can not reach soon . even one person is miss we have to wait until the person is found . for job holder it is veri difficult to spend more time becaus they can not get more holiday . at last even ticket book is also avail in railway station befor some day and we can confirm ticket in thi way . we are lot of way to travel . when person ha to return with in two to three day he can travel by airport which will take more time to reach the tourist place . it is probelm to take a guid with them .
