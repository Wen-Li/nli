mani peopl travel in a group led by a tour guid in my countri . it wa more poppular than travel alon about ten year ago . howev more and more young peopl want to travel alon becaus they prefer to have free time and to decid by themselv when or where to go . even though i prefer to trvell alon , i agre with the statement `` the best way to travel is in agroup led by a tour guid '' especi for first time travel . there are mani advantag if we travel in group . first of all , we do not have to worri about the schedul , transport , place to go and stay . it is not easi to handl them . the tour giud and compani provid them in best way . they are professionalist of travel and have a lot of experinec , so in mani time they provid perfect schedul for situat . and then safeti is the most import factor that the beginn travler are concern about befor departur . they might be worri about the place where they are go becaus they do not knoe about them . howev , with a tour guid , it would be safe . he or she must have experinc and knowleg about it . in addit , the tour giud can give a lot of inform of the place to travel . it make the travel more valueabl and excit . if we travel alon , we should studi the place where we are travel . we should find out where to visit . some time the tour guid have variou experinc and usual have great knowleg about the place , so he or she can explain other stori . in conclus , i think it is a good idea to travel in a group , especi it you are a beginn travel . when we travel , we can face variou situat unexpectedli . it might be stress to slove them , so it is not possibl to enjoy the trip . it can be a wast of time and money . therefor , i strongli recommend trvell in a group to some peopl . after then , you can challeng to a travel alon . it would be wodner .
