i think that most advertis make product seem much better than they realli are . first of all , there are hundr of firm produc thousand of differ item . the firm 's financi success and profit total depend on it sale . thu , in order to increas sale in thi competit market , the firm can sometim claim that their product are much better than other . secondli , i believ that we live in a world of `` imperfect inform '' . that is , consum , do not have enough inform about the qualiti of good and servic offer to them . therefor , they are readi to use ani type of inform they can get and the onli way they can obtain some inform is through advertis . howev , most of the time , it is onli after they use the product , they realiz that the advertis is mislead . for exampl , one of my friend have been experienc hair loss and seen a doctor . the first thing the doctor ask wa the brand of shampoo she use . she told the doctor that she wa use one of the best shampoo , one which is advertis everyday and use by mani peopl . the doctor told her to chang her shampoo becaus it turn out that one of the ingredi in it may caus hair loss . she began to use anoth one , but that advertis is still on tv and mani peopl keep buy that product ! last but not least , i think that there are import problem in the legal environ . the firm ' activ includ their advertis are regul by competit law and commerci law . yet , they fail to identifi and penal the firm , which give mislead inform about the product . i think it is also necessari for consum to complain about the product they use whenev it is necessari . onli by thi way , the legal author may be awar of the problem and the law can be enforc . consequ , beacaus of imperfect inform and legal problem , most of the firm do not hesit to make product seem better than they are .
