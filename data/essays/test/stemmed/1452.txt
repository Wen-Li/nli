i do n't think that student should learn more about the idea and the concept than the fact . for exampl , littl children that are studi the import of a healthi way of live includ eat habit and exercis should know the fact that eat too much sugar and lack of exercic increas the risk of obes . the fact will support the idea and the concept and will gave them a complet view of the problem or the situat . secondli , they are mani idea about the way we suppos to eat , but if they are studi who state that eat less salt can help to control or lower the blood pressur peopl will be in favor to follow thi rule . fact help peopl to understand and to reli on someth , for exampl if they do n't exercis they know the fact that they can increas there chanc of have health problem as well as other problem like gain weight , lack of energi or cholesterol problem . i think that if student know the fact of good nutrit habit they are less like to make mistak and they will eat more right and make more exercic . howev , even if student understand the fact that doe n't mean that they will be more respons about their food comsupt or their exercic habit , so that whi i believ that student should learn everyth in gener that includ fact , idea and concept but not one more that they other . the import of thi is for the student to have a global understand of a problem or a histori event .
