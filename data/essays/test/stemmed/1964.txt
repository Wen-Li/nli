abund thing in our live are worth analyz and judg . when it come to whether ha a tour guid is the best way to travel in a group . some maintain that it is ration while other advoc that the revers is true . adittedli , there can be some notabl truth in both argument . yet my experi account my prefer that it will be better if have a tour guid in a group . now i will list some point to support my prefer . first of all , one strong argument is that it will be veri safe if have a tour guid . when we have a tour to go to a place , it mayb unfamiliar with thi place . have a tour guid can tell us where is danger to travel , howev it can make us de safeti and prevent danger thing to happen . besid , it can be reason to say that we can learn a lot of interest thing from a tour guid . be a tour guid , he must be well-known about thi place , so he can introduc mani histor or amaz thing about that place . so we can know some knowledg from the tour guid . what is more , there is a good evid that have a tour guid can make me friend with the tour guid . for exampl , i travel tokyo in the last summer vocat , my parent and friend did not accompani with me . i made friend with the tour guid , he told mani thing about tokyo , i wa veri happi dure the vocat . so that wa whi i think have a tour guid is a good way . take all the factor into consider , i think it is the best way in the group led by a tour guid . of cours , carl marx teach us to take a dialect view , it will have some good aspect tour alon , such as more cheaper . it can prove there are merit in both attitud . well , depend on my person idea and experi , i think it can be better to have a tour guid rather than travel alon .
