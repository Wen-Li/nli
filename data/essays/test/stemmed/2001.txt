thi is not an easi question becaus i think both point are not correct on their own . at first i think it is veri import to understand the main idea and concept of a topic . thi is true with no doubt . but in my opinion some main fact are essenti to get the main idea . it seem to me imposs to accept all main idea without the knowledg of some main point from the topic . for exampl my topic of research is quantum mechan . in thi field exist a few main idea and concept like the schroeding equat and it interpret . but with no fact about the topic where it is import to appli thi equat you may run in troubl . the fact is that mani of the interpret will not help you in special situat . in these situat you have to know how fact to handl the problem . now one may argu , that if someon know the main idea he can look in some book and will be abl to solv the problem in principl . but if you do not know further fact on the situatu it will be possibl that you have to look in hundr of book befor you will find the correct solut . an other import point i want to be mention is the task of someon to connect differ result . if you onli understand the main concept of the broad topic of quantum mechan you may not be abl to connect differ field of research of thi main topic . to do thi you have to know fact from both field . summar my argument i want to say that to understand main idea and concept is veri import but without the main fact , which one ha to learn , you may run in a lot of troubl while you are do special research .
