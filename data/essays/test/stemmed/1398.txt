i disagre that in twenti year there will be fewer car in use than there are today . as if we see the figur of the past about the yearli consumpt of car , we can say that the figur is increas continu . as the popul of the world is increas day by day , so there would be more need of car in come year in order to satisfi the transport need of peopl . also govern of countri is build new road which are comfort for drive car and other motor vehicl . better road increas the effici of the car . so transport by car would not be costli for peopl in come year . they would prefer travel by car rather then take the bu or hire motor vechil . the economi of the world is grow so as a affect , the wealth of individui person is go high . so , in come year more peopl would be rich as compar to present . so they will be more interest to buy car as the car are also mean of show off in the societi . by have the car , person tri to impress other in the context of thing which are meant for comfort . as person will be more econom stabl , he will prefer to buy thing of comfort which includ car as well . as the technolog of make car is improv day by day . so in come year , becaus of technolog advanc the cheaper way of produc might come in pictur and that will sure decreas the cost of car . as a result , in the futur car will in the buy rang of more peopl as they can not buy car now due to lack of budget . also becaus of technolog advcanc , new model of car will come in market . those model will be more comfort and would be more beauti in look . so new model might attract the more peopl as they will think that thi model will solv the problem of transport . as the life style of peopl is becom veri fast with time . now a day , person want to do more and more work in short period of time . so he need to reach at differ place in order to for exampl attend import busi meet or present . by take the public transport , he can reach at hi distin but that will take more time and problem is that he is not have time . so he would sure prefer to have hi own car . so there will be more car in use than there are today . also becaus of more consumpt of the car , the car industri would be boom , that will result in econom growth of the countri . so the govern will also enhanc the sale of car by allow compani to set up new manufactur unit in the countri and also by give them some tax benefit . final , i would stat that in twenti year there will be more car in use than there are today . thi statement is veri much support by fact which have been discuss abov . all in come year there would be more car on the road .
