i agre to the statement and disagre at the same time , becaus it depend on the place i 'm travel to , and if i have been there befor or not . the statement is correct in a way , but also wrong in other way , if i weigh the pro and con of travel in a group led by a tour guid , i would say that i would agre with the statement if i 'm visit a new place that i do n't know anyth about it . on the other hand , if i 'm travel to a place that i have been to befor , i would prefer to travel alon . travel in agroup led by a tour guid will give me the privilag of feel secur , thi is veri import when it come to place i do n't know . at the same time i can rest assur that i will see all interest place and sight of that place , without miss anyth . thi way i can truli live the experi and enjoy the trip without worri about money arrang , hotel book , airlin schedul and other thing that can realli ruin the pleasur of the trip . but if i 'm travel to a place i have been to befor , i will definitli prefer to travel alon , thi will set me free from be tie up to a group all the time . that becaus i know the place , i know where to have fun and i know what is interest to do or see , so there is no need for the commit to a schedul . furthermor i can enjoy a specif activ more time than anoth one if i would like , but thi is a pleasur of freedom that come with a price , as i will be respons for all the arrang of travel , but it is a price i 'm will to pay for that freedom and pleasur i 'm look for . to sum it up , i 'm will to put more money and effort to travel alon if i can handl the risk involv in that , but i would absolutli travel with a group led by a tour guid if the risk are vagu , becaus uncalcul risk can cost me a lot .
