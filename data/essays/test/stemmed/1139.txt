the statement say that in twenti year there will be fewer car circul on earth 's rout . even if thi would have posit consequ on the pollut condict , i realli do n't think it will be possibl and i do n't agre with thi statement . in fact , everybodi know that dure the last period the use of the car ha spread in the world , in particular in the rich countri of the planet . some year ago onli rich peopl had the financi possibl to brought a car , but then the cost of a car progress felt down . abov all , ford , the famou productor of german car , had a strong import in thi process . he reorgan hi factori in order to produc a lot of car quickli and with lower cost . thank to him , the car price collaps . the most famou model is the ^ t model ^ . it wa a small , black car and almost everyon had the financi possibl to buy it . now the car market is almost satur . that mean that everybodi ha at least a car and the sell are basic due to the need to chang it after some year of use . so mayb nowaday the number of car bought each year is not as hight as some year ago , when for the first time peopl began to use car to travel or move in citi . howev , i do n't think that the car market is in crysi . on the contrari , the use of car could spread in poor countri . thi obvious ha tragic consequ on air pollut . in addict to thi , the oil sourc of the earth are almost over . becaus of thi problem mayb in twenti year there will be differ kind of car that do n't use oil but differ sourc of energi . . the so call ^ clean eneri ^ . for exampl it 's possibl to use the sun energi to make a car move . there is also the possibiliy to buy an electr car that ha less influenc on pollut .
