where to travel in a group or travel by peopl themselv is a hot topic right now . some peopl think it will be veri help to travel in a group with a tour while some other prefer to travel by themselv . when face thi question , i would prefer travel by myself for the sake of the fun and flexibl schedul . i would like to give my reason and evid as follow . firstli , i have live in us for a coupl of year and my english is good , these allow me to travel to the english-speak countri as all the place that i want to travel to is somewher like perth , hawaii , london where peopl all speak english . i do n't have to worri that i ca n't read the sign or do n't know how to get around . i can alway take the local public transport to the destin , and mayb talk with the local on the weather in the bu or subway . secondli , travel by myself will be much more interest . i could just go wherev i want to at ani time onc i arriv that citi , without worri the schedul of the group , without car the peer pressur from other group member . or i can just rent a car in the destin , drive to the place i want to go , stop by a bar and sit down chat with local . if i travel with a group , then these will not most like happen . thirdli , travel without a guid will enabl me from been forc to somewher i do n't like to go . i am person who do n't like to go to somewher full of peopl . i have learnt from my lesson of my trip to niagara fall , i paid a lot to travel with a group howev i wa veri upset with the whole trip . the place wa pack with peopl and the servic of the hotel wa not good , too mani peopl wait in the restaur to get seat , and the food of the restaur that the tour guid brought us to wa not veri tasti . moreov , my boyfriend is veri good at plan trip and i would like to travel with him rather than with a bore tour guid , as i usual got a lot of fun and surpris when i travel with him . i went to disney land with him two year ago , he plan for the whole trip and it turn out fabul . we not onli enjoy the disney world went to a citi in disney call kissemm and watch the best show i have ever seen - the arabian night . there wa a love poni which play the show togeth with an actor , what suppris me is the poni can rememb how to play the show and even put the blanket when the man fell asleep on the stage . and also after dinner we even get the desert call `` princess wed cake '' , what a ador name ! of cours , travel with a guid will help you from get lost , and they will provid you a lot of infom of the place . but accord to my person experi , i am would not prefer to travel in a group with a tour guid .
